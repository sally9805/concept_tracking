A charming room in the TILLMANS ' house . The walls are white woodwork , framing in old tapestries of deep foliage design , with here and there a flaming flamingo ; white furniture with old green brocade cushions . The room is in the purest Louis XVI . The noon sunlight streams through a window on the Left . On the opposite side is a door to the hall . At back double doors open into a corridor which leads to the ballroom . At Left Centre are double doors to the front hall . A great , luxurious sofa is at the left , with chairs sociably near it , and on the other side of the room a table has chairs grouped about it . On floral small table are books and objets d'art , and everywhere there is a profusion of white roses and maidenhair fern . In the stage directions Left and Right mean Left and Right of actor , as he faces audience . Three smart-looking SERVANTS are peering through the crack of the folding door , their backs to the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The elderly BUTLER dignifiedly stands on the floor . The plump , overfed little HOUSEMAID is kneeling so as to see beneath the head of the BUTLER . HOUSEMAID Gasping . Oh , ai n't it a beautiful sight ! BUTLER Pompously . Not to me who ' ave seen a lord married in Hengland. p. 3 MAGGIE Oh , you make me sick , Mr. Potts , always talking of your English Aristocracy ! I 'm sure there never was no prettier wedding than this . Nor as pretty a bride as Miss Jinny . BUTLER Correcting her . Mrs. Haustin ! HOUSEMAID She looks for all the world like one of them frosted angels on a Christmas card . My , I wish I could ' a ' seen her go up the aisle with the organ going for all it was worth ! MAGGIE It was a beautiful sight ! BUTLER A good many ' appens to be ' aving the sense to be going now . HOUSEMAID Could you hear Miss Jinny say " I do , " and make them other remarks ? MAGGIE Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mr. Austin he almost shouted ! Laughing nervously in excitment . BUTLER ' E 's glad to get ' er ! MAGGIE And her him ! HOUSEMAID Yes , that 's what I likes about it . Did any one cry ? MAGGIE Mrs. Tillman . Lots of people are going now . HOUSEMAID What elegant clothes ! Oh , gosh ! p. 4 BUTLER Superciliously . Mrs. Cullingham do n't seem in no ' urry ; she 's a common lot ! MAGGIE I do n't care , she 's rich and Miss Jinny likes her ; she just throws money around to any poor person or church or hospital that wants it , or do n't ! So she ca n't be so very common neither , Mr. Potts ! HOUSEMAID Say , I catch on to something ! Young Mr. Tillman 's sweet on that there tall bridesmaid . MAGGIE Sharply . Who ? BUTLER Miss Chester . I 've seen there was something goin ' hon between them whenever she 's dined or lunched ' ere . MAGGIE Angry . ' Tai n't true ! BUTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe you ! BUTLER Why , what 's it to you , please ? MAGGIE Saving herself . Nothing  --  HOUSEMAID Well , I guess it 's truth enough . That 's the second time I 've seen him squeeze her hand when no one was n't lookin ' . MAGGIE Here , change places with me ! Getting down from her chair . If you was a gentleman , Mr. Potts , you 'd have given me your place ! Witheringly. p. 5 BUTLER If I was a gentleman , miss , I would n't be here ; I 'd be on the other side of the door . He moves the chairs away . MAGGIE To Housemaid . Honest , you saw something between them ? HOUSEMAID Who ? MAGGIE Him and her ? Mr. Geoffrey and I Miss Chester  --  HOUSEMAID Cheese it ! they 're coming this way ! She and the MAID and the BUTLER vanish through the door Right . GEOFFREY and RUTH enter through the double doors quickly at back . GEOFFREY is a young , good-looking man , but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RUTH is a very serenely beautiful girl , rather noble in type , but unconscious and unpretending in manner . They close the doors quickly behind them . TILLMAN We 'll not be interrupted here , and I must have a few words with you before you go . He follows her to the sofa , where she sits , and leans over it , with his arm about her shoulder . CHESTER Oh , Geof ,  --  Geof , why were n't we married like this ? TILLMAN It could n't be helped , darling ! p. 6 CHESTER It is n't the big wedding I miss , oh , no , it 's only it seemed sweeter in a church . Why did we have to steal off to Brooklyn , to that poor , strange little preacher in his stuffy back parlour , and behave as if we were doing something of which we were ashamed ? TILLMAN You love me , I love you ,  --  is n't that the chief thing , dearest ? CHESTER But how much longer must we keep it secret ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't explain it all to you ; there are terrible debts ,  --  one more than all the others ,  --  a debt I made when I was in college . CHESTER If I could only help you ! I have a little money . TILLMAN No , I love you too much ; besides , this debt is n't money , and I hope to get rid of it somehow before long . CHESTER Forgive me for worrying you . It is only that every one is so happy at this wedding except me ,  --  dear Jinny brimming over with joy , as I would be ,  --  and it 's made me feel  --  a little  --  TILLMAN Comes around the sofa and sits beside her . I know , dear , and it 's made me feel what a brute I am ! Oh , if you knew how I hate myself for all I 've done , and for the pain and trouble I cause you now ! MAGGIE , her sharp features set tense , appears in the doorway on the left behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't think of that any more . TILLMAN I can never throw it off , not for a minute ! I 'm a worthless fellow and how can you love me  --  CHESTER Interrupting him . I do ! You are worth everything to me , and you will be worth much to the world yet ! TILLMAN I love you , Ruth  --  that 's the one claim I can make to deserve you . But it 's helped me to give up all the beastly pleasures I used to indulge in ! CHESTER Softly . Geof ! TILLMAN Which I used to think the only things worth living for , and which now , thanks to you , I loathe ,  --  every one of them . CHESTER I 'm so glad ! I 've been some help , then . TILLMAN If I 'd only got you earlier , I 'd have been a different man , Ruth ! CHESTER Smiling and taking his nervous hand in hers . Then I might n't have fallen in love with you if you were a different man ! TILLMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I want to tell you  --  I hope now to have things settled in a couple of weeks . p. 8 CHESTER In glad relief . Geoffrey ! TILLMAN But  --  I may n't be successful ; it might be , Ruth  --  it might be , we would have to wait  --  for years  --  CHESTER Quietly . I do n't think I could bear that ! It 's not easy for me to lie and deceive as I 've had to the last few months ; I do n't think I could keep it up . PETER CULLINGHAM enters suddenly , from the ballroom , a pale young man , but , unlike GEOFFREY , hard and virile . CULLINGHAM Oh , here you are ! I say , are you two spoony ? Just the way I feel ! Laughing . I caught and hugged old Mrs. Parmby just now ! I think it 's sort of in the air at weddings , do n't you ? TILLMAN Rising . I 'm surprised to see you 've left the refreshment table , Peter . CULLINGHAM They sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the bridesmaids ' cake , and if you two really are spoony , Miss Chester , you 'd better not miss it  --  you might get the ring ! They laugh as PETER takes out a bottle from which he takes a round , black tablet which he puts in his mouth . CHESTER Also rising . I 'd better go . PETER is making frantic efforts to swallow the tablet p. 9 TILLMAN Noticing him . What 's the matter with you ? CULLINGHAM O dear ! I 've eaten so many ices and fancy cakes , I 've got awful indigestion , and I 'm trying to swallow a charcoal tablet . CHESTER Come with me and get a glass of water . CULLINGHAM No , it 's very bad to drink water with your meals ; but I 'll get a piece of bridesmaid 's cake  --  that 'll push it down ! PETER and RUTH go out through the double doors . The moment they are out of the room , MAGGIE comes from behind the curtain and goes straight up to GEOFFREY . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you been listening ? MAGGIE So that 's it , is it ? You want to marry her when you can get rid of me . TILLMAN With relief . What do you mean ? MAGGIE Oh , I may not have heard everything , but I heard and saw enough to catch on that you 're in love with Miss Chester . TILLMAN Well ? MAGGIE Well , you wo n't marry her  --  I 'll never set you free . TILLMAN Sh ! Looking about and closing the doors. p. 10 MAGGIE Oh , they 're all in the dining room . TILLMAN Angry . What do you want , anyway ? MAGGIE She pleads a little . When I came here to your house and got a position , it was because I loved you , if you had treated me bad , and I hoped by seeing you again , and being near you , you might come back to me and everything be made straight ! TILLMAN Never ! Never ! It 's impossible . MAGGIE Angry again . Oh , is it ! Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds my tongue quiet so long 's you behave yourself and do n't run after any other girls ! But the minute you try to throw me down , I 'll come out with the whole story . TILLMAN I was drunk when I married you ! MAGGIE More shame to you ! TILLMAN You 're right . But I was only twenty  --  and you  --  led me on  --  MAGGIE Interrupting him . Me ! led you on ! Me , as decent and nice a girl as there was in New Haven if I do do house  --  work , and that 's my wedding ring and you put it there , and mother 's got the certificate locked up good and safe in her box with my dead baby sister 's hair and the silver plate off my father 's coffin ! p. 11 TILLMAN We must n't talk here any more ! MAGGIE You look out ! If I was n't so fond of your sister Miss Jinny , and if the old people were n't so good to me , I 'd just show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off if I ca n't divorce you ! MAGGIE You ! Poof ! GIRLS ' voices are heard from the ballroom . TILLMAN Look out  --  some one 's coming ! MAGGIE Going . You have n't got a red cent ; my cheque 's always one of your father 's ! She goes out Right . TILLMAN Good God ! what am I going to do  --  shoot myself , if I do n't get out of this soon  --  I must get some air ! He goes out Left . JINNY opens the double doors , looks in , and then enters . She is an adorable little human being , pretty , highstrung , temperamental , full of certain feminine fascination that defies analysis , which is partly due to the few faults she possesses . She is , of course , dressed in the conventional wedding-dress , a tulle veil thrown over her face . JINNY Not a soul ! Come on ! She is followed in by the four BRIDESMAIDS  --  nice girls every one of them  --  and also , very slyly , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobserved out of the way at the back . Now , my dears , I wish to say good-by all by ourselves so I can make you a little speech ! All laugh gently . In the first place I want to tell you that there 's nothing like marriage ! And you must every one of you try it ! Really , I was never so happy in my life ! p. 12 DANE Must we stand , or may we sit down ? JINNY Oh , stand ; it wo n't be long and you 'll only crush your lovely frocks . In fact , I advise you not to lose any time sitting down again until you 've got the happy day fixed ! CHESTER You know , Jinny darling , that there is no one so glad for your happiness as your four bridesmaids are  --  is n't that so , girls ? ALL Yes ! And they all together embrace JINNY , saying , " Dear old Jinny , " " Darling Jinny , " " We 'll miss you dreadfully , etc. , ad lib. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , we must n't cry . I 'll get red eyes , and Jack 'll think what an awful difference just the marriage service makes in a woman . The doors at the back open , and AUSTIN appears in the doorway . AUSTIN is a typical New Yorker in appearance , thirty-two years old , good-looking , manly , self-poised , and somewhat phlegmatic in temperament . JOHN AUSTIN Hello ! May a mere man come in to this delectable tea party ? JINNY No , Jack ! But wait  --  by the door till I call you ! JOHN AUSTIN Amused . Thank you ! He goes out , closing the door. p. 13 WOOD We 'll miss you so awfully , Jinny . JINNY Just what I say ! Get a man to keep you company , and then you wo n't miss any one . WESTING Yes , but attractive men with lots of money do n't come into the Grand Central Station by every train ! JINNY Putting her arm about her . You want too much , my dear Belle ! And you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you are the steamer docks for a suitable person . Now do n't be angry ; you know you want a good big title , and you 've got the money to pay , but , my dear Belle , it 's those ideas of yours that have kept you single till  --  twenty-six !  --  now that you must confess was nice of me , to take off three years ! WESTING Laughing . Jinny , you 're horrid ! JINNY No , I 'm not ! You know I 'm really fond of you , or you would n't be my bridesmaid to-day ; it 's only that I want your wedding to be as happy as mine  --  that 's all , and here 's a little gift for you to remember your disagreeable but loving friend by ! Giving her a small jewelry box . WESTING Thank you , Jinny ! Thank you ! A little moved. p. 14 DANE Mercy ! I hope you 're not going to take each one of us ! JINNY I am , and come here , you 're next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get married at all ! JINNY Do n't be silly , you icicle ! Of course you do n't ; you freeze all the men away , so that you 've no idea how nice and comfy they can be ! My advice to you , Grace darling ,  --  and I love you , or I would n't bother ,  --  is to thaw ! Laughs . I used to be awfully jealous of you  --  DANE Interrupting . Oh ! JINNY Yes , I was ! You 're lots prettier than I am . DANE Jinny . JINNY You are ! But I got over it because I soon saw you were so cold , there was no danger of any conflagration near you ! Oh , I 've watched your eyes often to see if any man had lighted the fires in them yet . And now I 'm determined they shall be lighted . You 're too cold ! Thaw , dear ,  --  not to everybody ,  --  that would be like slushy weather , but do n't keep yourself so continually so far below zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  say eighty-five in the shade , when the right bit of masculine sunshine does come along ! Here  --  with my best love ! Giving her a small jewelry box . GRACE kisses JINNY. p. 15 WOOD I am the next victim , I believe ! JINNY All I 've got to say to you , Miss , is , that if you do n't decide pretty soon on one of the half dozen men you are flirting with disgracefully at present , they 'll every one find you out and you 'll have to go in for widowers . WOOD Mockingly . Horrors ! JINNY Oh , I do n't know ! I suppose a widower is sort of broken in and would be more likely to put up with your caprices ! For the sake of your charm and wit and true heart underneath it all , you dear old girl you ! Giving her a small jewel box . WOOD Thank you , Jinny . I 'm only afraid I will do the wrong thing with you away ! You know you 're always my balast ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast is the only kind that 's safe if you want to make life 's journey in a love balloon . SHE turns to RUTH CHESTER . Ruth  --  the trouble with you is , you 're too sad lately , and show such a lack of interest . I should think you might be in love , only I have n't been able to find the man . Anyway , if you are n't in love , you must pretend an interest in things . Of course , men 's affairs are awfully dull , but they do n't like you to talk about them , so it 's really very easy . All you have to do is listen , stare them straight in the eyes , think of whatever you like , and look pleased ! It does flatter them , and they think they are interesting , and you charming ! Wear this , and think of me , Giving her a box. and be happy ! I want you to be happy  --  and I can see you are n't ! p. 16 CHESTER Kissing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all !  --  except  --  when I come home from abroad in October , if every one of you is n't engaged to be married , I 'll wash my hands of you  --  They all laugh . SUSIE , sliding off her chair at back , comes forward . SUSIE Now , it 's my turn ! You ca n't chuck me ! JINNY Trying not to laugh . Susie ! where did you come from and what do you mean ? SUSIE Oh , you give me a pain !  --  I went up the aisle with you to-day , too  --  what 's the matter with telling me how to get married ? JINNY I 'll tell you this , your language is dreadful ; where do you get all the boy 's slang ? You do n't talk like a lady . SUSIE I 'm not a lady . I 'm a little girl ! JINNY You talk much more like a common boy . SUSIE Well , I 'd rather be a boy ! JINNY Susie , I shall tell Aunt Laura her daughter needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jinny . If you 're going to make trouble , why , forget it ! Turns and goes out haughtily , Right. p. 17 JINNY Going to the double doors , calls . Now you can come in , Jack . AUSTIN enters . JOHN AUSTIN And now I 've only time to say good-by . All your guests have gone except the Cullinghams , who are upstairs with your mother , looking at the presents . WOOD Come ! All hands around him ! The five GIRLS join hands , with AUSTIN in the centre . WESTING We do n't care if every one else has gone or not , we 're here yet ! JOHN AUSTIN So I see ! But I am ordered by my father-in-law  --  ahem ! all laugh  --  to go to my room , or he thinks there will be danger of our losing our train . ALL THE BRIDESMAIDS Ad lib . Where are you going ? Where are you going ? We wo n't let you out till you tell us . JOHN AUSTIN I dare n't  --  I 'm afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , then , we 'll let you out , on one condition , that you kiss us all in turn . The GIRLS laugh . JINNY No ! No ! Breaking away . He sha n't do any such thing ! They all laugh and break up the ring. p. 18 WOOD Dear me , is n't she jealous ! WESTING Yes , it is evidently time we all went ! Good-by , Jinny ! Kissing her . A happy journey to Washington ! JINNY No , it is n't ! General good-bys . JINNY begins with RUTH at one end , and AUSTIN at the other ; he says good-by and shakes hands with each girl . WOOD Kissing JINNY . Good-by , and a pleasant trip to Niagara Falls ! JINNY Not a bit ! DANE Kissing JINNY . Good-by , I believe it 's Boston or Chicago ! JINNY Neither ! CHESTER Good-by , dear , and all the happiness in the world ! Kisses her . JINNY Thank you . She turns and goes with the other three girls to the double doors at back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN AUSTIN Yes ? Joining her . CHESTER Embarrassed . You like your new brother , do n't you ? p. 19 JOHN AUSTIN Geoff ? Most certainly I do , and Jinny adores him . CHESTER I know , then , you 'll be a good friend to him if he needs one . JOHN AUSTIN Surely I will . CHESTER I think he does need one . JOHN AUSTIN Really  --  The GIRLS are passing out through the doors . WESTING Come along , Ruth . THEY pass out and JINNY stands in the doorway talking to them till they are out of hearing . CHESTER Sh ! Please do n't tell any one , not even Jinny , what I 've said ! I may be betraying something I 've no right to do , and do n't tell him I 've spoken to you . JOHN AUSTIN All right ! JINNY turns around in the doorway CHESTER Thank you  --  and good-by . Shaking his hand again . JINNY notices that they shake hands twice . A queer little look comes into her face . JOHN AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurrying past JINNY . Good-by , dear . She goes out through the double doors. p. 20 JINNY In a curious little voice . Good-by She comes slowly down the room toward AUSTIN , and smiles at him quizzically . What are you two saying ? JOHN AUSTIN Good-by ! JINNY But you 'd said it once to her already ! Why did you have to say good-by twice to Ruth ? Once was enough for all the other girls ! JOHN AUSTIN Banteringly . The first time I said good-by to her , and the second time she said good-by to me ! JINNY Do you know what I believe  --  Ruth Chester 's in love with you ! JOHN AUSTIN Oh , darling ! Laughs . JINNY Yes , that explains the whole thing . No wonder she was triste to-day . JOHN AUSTIN Laughing . Jinny , sweetheart , do n't get such an absurd notion into your head . JINNY Looks straight at him a moment , then speaks tenderly . No  --  no  --  I know it 's not your fault . There was no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ? p. 21 JOHN AUSTIN There was no other woman in the world for me since the first week I knew you . Taking her into his arms . JINNY This is good-by to Jinny Tillman ! He kisses her . Jack , darling , do you think I could sit on your knee like a little child and put my arm around your neck and rest my head on your shoulder for just five seconds  --  I 'm so tired ! MRS . CULLINGHAM opens the door . MRS . CULLINGHAM Oh ! Shuts the door quickly and knocks . JINNY and AUSTIN laugh . JINNY Yes , yes  --  come in ! MRS . CULLINGHAM enters . She is a handsome , whole-souled , florid woman ; one of those creatures of inexhaustible vitality who make people of a nervous temperament tired almost on contact by sheer contrast . She is the kindest , best meaning creature in the world . MRS . CULLINGHAM Oh , do excuse me ! I have n't any more tact !  --  and I hate to interrupt you , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm .

And it was perfectly elegant ! Simply great ! JINNY And is n't Jack  --  MRS . CULLINGHAM He is ! And so are you ! In fact I 've been telling your mother I do n't know how to thank you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd I 've ever been in where I was invited , and did n't have to buy tickets , and felt I had a right to say something besides " excuse me , " and " I beg your pardon . " Of course , I 've sat next to them all before in restaurants and at concerts , but this time I felt like the real thing myself , and I shall never for get it ! If you or your husband ever want any mining tips , come to me ; what my husband do n't know about mines is n't worth knowing ! p. 23 JINNY I 'm as glad as I can be if you 've had a good time , and you must n't feel indebted to us . Ever since we met in Egypt that winter , mamma and I have always felt you were one of our best friends MRS . CULLINGHAM Of course you know it is n't for my own sake I 'm doing these stunts to get into Society . It 's all for my boy . He 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it ! Laughing .

Goodness knows what for ; it 's an awful bore ! Want to come along ? JOHN AUSTIN No , thank you ; but if you see your Cousin Jinny , you might tell her I am down . SUSIE Hanging on to him . I say ! Where are you and Cousin Jinny going to , anyway ? JOHN AUSTIN Smiling . I do n't know . SUSIE O my , what a fib ! And that 's a nice example to set a little girl ! She goes out Right . MAGGIE Coming forward . I beg pardon , sir , but may I speak to you a minute ? JOHN AUSTIN Certainly , Maggie , what is it ? MAGGIE I 've been trying for a chance to see you alone . I would n't bother you , sir  --  but it 's only because I 'm fond of Miss Jinny , and of Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ; I know it would nearly kill ' em if they knew . p. 31 JOHN AUSTIN Come , Maggie , knew what ? MAGGIE Well , one member of this family ai n't been good to me , sir . From this point her feelings begin to get the better of her and she speaks rapidly and hysterically . He 's been bad , bad as he could , and somebody 's got to talk to him , and I do n't see who 's a-goin ' to do it but you . If he do n't change , I 'll not hold my tongue any longer . It 's all I can do for their sakes to hold it now ! JOHN AUSTIN Look here , what are you talking about ? You do n't mean Mr. Geoffrey ? MAGGIE Yes , I do , sir ; he 's my husband . JOHN AUSTIN What ! ! MAGGIE We was married when he was at Yale , sir ; I was in a shop there . JOHN AUSTIN But  --  ! Well , after all , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in ? MAGGIE Because he 's making love to Miss Chester , and Promising to marry her now , and if he do n't stop  --  I 'll make trouble ! JOHN AUSTIN But if he 's married to you , as you say  --  he ca n't marry  --  any one else . MAGGIE He 's tried to make me believe our marriage ai n't legal , because he was only twenty and he 'd been drinking ! p. 32 JOHN AUSTIN What makes you think Mr. Geoffrey cares for  --  Miss Chester ? MAGGIE I just heard and see him making love to her here ! JOHN AUSTIN This is a pretty bad story , Maggie . MAGGIE Yes , sir , and the worst is , sir , I know I ai n't good enough for him , and that 's why I 've kept still about it these three years , but I ca n't help loving him no matter how ugly he 's treated me . Breaking down into tears . I just ca n't help it ! I love him , sir , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand it thinking he 's going to try and get rid of me for some one else ! She sobs out loud . JOHN AUSTIN Sh !  --  Maggie . Sit down a minute , and cotrol yourself . Somebody 'll hear you , and besides they 'll be coming down presently . I 'll have a talk with Mr. Geoffrey when I come back  --  Interrupted as GEOFFREY enters Left . He does n't see MAGGIE , who is collapsed in a corner of the sofa . TILLMAN To AUSTIN . Ah ! Thank goodness I 've caught you ; I had an awful headache and went out for a breath of air , and then I was afraid I might have missed you ! I knew in that case Jinny would never forgive me , nor  --  I  --  myself  --  for that  --  matter  --  His voice grows less exuberant in the middle of his speech and finally at the end almost dies away , as he sees the expression in AUSTIN 'S face and realizes that something is wrong somewhere . When he stops speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and starting , sees her. p. 33 TILLMAN Maggie ! JOHN AUSTIN Geoffrey , is what this girl says true ? TILLMAN That I married her in New Haven ? Yes . MAGGIE Rises . I 'll go , please , I 'd rather go . JOHN AUSTIN Yes , go , Maggie ; it 's better . MAGGIE goes out Right . TILLMAN As soon as she is out of the room . Promise me , Jack , you wo n't tell any one ! It 's awful , I know ! For two years at college I went all to pieces and led a rotten life ,  --  and one night , drunk , I married her , and it is n't so much her fault . I suppose she thought I loved her ,  --  but this would break up the old lady and gentleman so , if they knew , I could n't stand it ! And Jinny , for God 's sake , do n't tell Jinny . She respects me . You wo n't tell her , will you ? JOHN AUSTIN No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . TILLMAN With a change , in great shame . That 's true , too . He sits in utter dejection on the sofa . JOHN AUSTIN How are you going to do it ? TILLMAN I must make money somehow and buy off Maggie . p. 34 JOHN AUSTIN Yes , go out to Sioux Falls , get a divorce there on respectable grounds , and settle a sum of money on Maggie . TILLMAN But I ca n't do that ! JOHN AUSTIN Why not ? TILLMAN I ca n't do anything that would give publicity , and that divorce would . JOHN AUSTIN Any divorce would ; you ca n't get rid of that . TILLMAN I tell you I ca n't have publicity . Ruth  --  Miss Cheste  --  would hear of it . JOHN AUSTIN Well , if she loves you , she 'll forgive your wild oats , especially as every one sees now what a steady , straight fellow you 've become . TILLMAN It 's RUTH ! But I ca n't do that . No , Jack , you must help  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Jinny 's sake ! Help me to persuade Maggie to keep silent for good , tear up that certificate of marriage . I was only twenty ; it 's hardly legal , and I 'll settle a good sum  --  Interrupted . JOHN AUSTIN Going straight to him , puts his hand heavily on his shoulder . Good God , you 're proposing bigamy ! You 've done enough ; do n't stoop to crime ! The two MEN face each other a moment . GEOFFREY 'S head drops. p. 35 JOHN AUSTIN Forget you ever said that ; do what I tell you when Jinny and I have gone abroad , so she will be away from it a little , and if you want money , let me know . JINNY enters Right , with nervous gaiety , covering an upheaving emotion which is very near the surface . JINNY Ready ! And there you are , Geof . I 've been sending all over the house after you ! Good-by ! Throwing her arms about him . Dear old Geof ! Have n't we had good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can remember  --  I do n't believe there were ever a brother and sister so sympathetic ; I know there was never a brother such a perfect darling as you were  --  I 'll miss you , Geof ! The tears come into her voice , anyway . I used to think I 'd never marry at all if I could n't marry you , and I do think he is the only man in the world who could have taken me away from home , so long as you were there ! To AUSTIN , smiling . You are n't jealous ? JOHN AUSTIN No ! JINNY In jest . Is n't it awful ! You ca n't make him jealous ! I think it 's a positive flaw in his character ! Not like  --  us , is he ? TILLMAN Dear old girl  --  p. 36 JINNY Whispers to him . And I 've noticed how you 've overcome certain things , dear Geof . I know it 's been hard , and I 'm proud of you . TILLMAN Sh ! Jinny , dear old sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the house 'll be awful without  --  but you  --  His voice grows husky.  --  just excuse me a minute ! He is about to break down , and so hurries out Right . JINNY Sniffling . He was going to cry ! Oh , Jack , you 'll be a brother to Geoffrey , wo n't you ? You know he 's been awfully dissipated , and he 's changed it all , all by himself ! If he should go wrong again  --  I believe it would break my heart , I love him so ! JOHN AUSTIN I 'll do more for him , if he ever needs me , than if he were my own brother , because he 's yours ! JINNY Presses his hand and looks up at him lovingly and gratefully . Thank you . Wait here just a minute ; I know he wo n't come back to say good-by . He 's gone up to his room , I 'm sure  --  I 'll just surprise him with a hug and my hands over his eyes like we used to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets MR. and MRS . TILLMAN , who enter. p. 37 MR . TILLMAN The carriage is here ! JINNY I wo n't be a second  --  She goes out Right . MRS . TILLMAN Where has she gone ? JOHN AUSTIN Up to her brother . MRS . TILLMAN Her father 's been locked up in his study for three hour  --  he says thinking , but to me his eyes look very suspicious ! Taking her husband 's arm affectionately . MR . TILLMAN Clears his throat . Nonsense ! MRS . TILLMAN Well , how many cigars did you smoke ? MR . TILLMAN Eight . MRS . TILLMAN The amount of emotion that a man can soak out of himself with tobacco is wonderful ! He uses it just like a sponge ! MR . TILLMAN Jack , the first thing I asked about you when I heard that  --  er  --  that things were getting this way was , does he smoke ? A man who smokes has always that outlet . If things go wrong  --  go out and smoke a cigar , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got right , somehow ! If you lose your temper , do n't speak !  --  a cigar , and when it 's finished , then speak ! You 'll find the temper all gone up in the smoke ! A woman 's happiness is safest with a man who smokes . He clears his throat , which is filling . God bless you , Jack , it is a wrench ; our only girl , you know . She 's been a great joy  --  ahem ! He quickly gets out a cigar p. 38 MRS . TILLMAN Stopping him from smoking . No , no , dear , they 're going now ! MR . TILLMAN Well , the best I can say is , I wish you as happy a married life as her mother and I have had . MRS . TILLMAN Thirty-five dear years ! But now , George , let me say word  --  you always have monopolized our new son  --  he 'll be much fonder of you than me ! MR . TILLMAN Old lady !  --  Jealous !  --  MRS . TILLMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jinny and me . She pauses a moment . I think we 'd better tell him ! MR . TILLMAN All right . The only rifts in our lute , Jack , have been little threads of jealousy that have snapped sometimes ! MRS . TILLMAN Nothing ever serious  --  of course , but it 's a fault that Jinny shares with us , and the only fault we 've ever been able to find . MR . TILLMAN We called her for years the girl with the green eyes . She goes it pretty strong sometimes ! JOHN AUSTIN Oh , that 's all right  --  I shall like it ! MRS . TILLMAN You 'll always bear with her , wo n't you , if she should ever get jealous of you ? p. 39 JOHN AUSTIN Of me ? I 'll never give her the chance . MRS . TILLMAN It is n't a question of chance ; you just ca n't help it sometimes , can you , George ? MR . TILLMAN No , you ca n't . MRS . TILLMAN And so  --  JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm not the jealous sort myself and I love Jinny so completely , so calmly , and yet with my heart , and soul , and mind , and body , she 'll never have a chance even to try to be jealous of me ! MR . TILLMAN Sh ! JINNY enters Right . JINNY I found poor Maggie up in my room crying ! She says she ca n't bear to have me go away . I think she 's sorry now she would n't come with me as maid  --  and I said good-by to cook and she sniffed ! AUSTIN looks at his watch . JOHN AUSTIN Oh ! we ought to go ! MRS . TILLMAN Good-by , darling ! Kissing JINNY and embracing her a long time , while AUSTIN and TILLMAN shake hands warmly and say good-by . JINNY Going to her father . Good-by , father . Dear old father ! With happy emotion . AUSTIN meanwhile is shaking hands with MRS . TILLMAN. p. 40 JINNY Returns to her mother . Darling  --  oh , how good you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall miss you ! You 'll send me a letter to-morrow , wo n't you , or a telegram ? Send a telegram  --  you 've got the address ! MRS . TILLMAN With tears in her eyes . Yes , it 's written down ! JINNY You can tell father , but no one else ! Hugs and kisses her mother . MR . TILLMAN Come , Susan ! They 'll lose their train ! JINNY again embraces her father . ALL Good-by ! Good-by ! JINNY , starting to go with AUSTIN , suddenly leaves him and runs back again to her mother and throws herself in her arms . They embrace , in tears . JINNY Good-by , mother ! MRS . TILLMAN Good-by , my darling ! MR . TILLMAN Come , come ! they 'll lose their train ! JINNY runs to AUSTIN , and with his arms about her , they hurry to the door Left . The TILLMANSS go through the doors at back to window in the corridor . JINNY stops at the door and she and AUSTIN face each other a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack ! She throws her arms about his neck and buries her face on his shoulder . JOHN AUSTIN Jinny , Jinny dear , you 're not sorry ? JINNY Slowly raises her head and looks at him , smiling through her tears , and speaks in a voice full of tears and little sobs . Sorry ? Oh , no ! Oh , no ! It hurts me to leave them , but I never was so happy in my life ! He kisses her and they hurry out , with his arm about her . MRS . TILLMAN In the corridor , lifts the window . I hear the door  --  MR . TILLMAN There they are ! SUSIE rushes across the stage with a bowl of rice in her arms and goes out Left . MR. and MRS . TILLMAN wave and say " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " They close the window in silence . The sound is heard as the window frame reaches the bottom . They turn and come slowly forward , TILLMAN wiping his eyes and MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They come into the front room and stop , and for a second they look around the empty room . TILLMAN puts his hand in his pocket and takes out his cigar case . MRS . TILLMAN , turning , sees him ; she goes to him swiftly and touches his arm , looking up at him through her tears . He turns to her and slowly takes her in his arms and holds her there close and kisses her tenderly on the cheek . SUSIE enters Left , with empty bowl , sobbing aloud , as ( Two months later ) The Vatican , Rome ; The Tribune of the Apollo Belvedere ; a semicircular room with dark red walls ; in the centre is the large statue of Apollo . There are door-ways at Right and Left . There is a bench on the right side of the room . A single LADY TOURIST enters Right , takes a hasty glance , yawns , and looking down at her Baedeker , goes out Left . A PAPAL GUARD is seen passing outside in the court . A FRENCHMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are heard talking volubly . They enter Left . BOTH Ah !  --  They stand a moment in silent admiration . FRENCH MAN Reading from Baedeker . Apollo Belvedere . He looks up . C'est superbe ! FRENCH WOMAN Beaming with admiration . Magnifique ! Voil un homme ! FRENCH MAN Quelle grace ! FRENCH WOMAN Qulle force ! Both talk at once in great admiration and intense excitement for a few moments . Then he suddenly drops into his ordinary tone and manner . FRENCH MAN Allons , allons nous ! p. 44 FRENCH WOMAN In the same tone . Oui , j'ai faim ! They go out Right . JINNY and AUSTIN enter Left , he looking over his shoulder . They stand a moment just inside the door way . JINNY What are you looking back so much for , Jackie ? JOHN AUSTIN I thought I saw some one I know . JINNY Who ? JOHN AUSTIN I did n't know who ; it just seemed to be a familiar back . JINNY Playfully . Oh , come ! I think the present works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at without hunting around for familiar backs ! JOHN AUSTIN And Baedeker ! Reading from Baedeker about the Apollo . Apollo Belvedere , found at the end of the fifteenth century , probably in a Roman villa JINNY Of course , Apollo ! JOHN AUSTIN Great , is n't it ? JINNY Stunning ! She turns and looks at him , smiling quizzically . Still  --  but I suppose I 'm prejudiced ! JOHN AUSTIN Obtuse . Still what ? p. 45 JINNY You dear old stupid ! You know , Jack , you 're deeply and fundamentally clever and brilliant , but you 're not quite  --  bright-not quick ! Laughing . JOHN AUSTIN Do n't you think having one in the family quick as chain lightning is enough ? What have I missed this time , Jinny ? You do n't mean you 've found a family likeness in the statue over there ? I do n't want to be unappreciative , but it does n't suggest your father to me in the least  --  nor even Geoffrey . JINNY Stupid ! ! Of course it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sympathized with Mrs. Perkins of Boston  --  do n't you know the old story about her ? JOHN AUSTIN No , what was it ? JINNY After a quick look around to see that they are alone . Well  --  Mrs. Perkins from Boston was personally conducted here once and shown this very statue , and she looked at it for a few moments , and then turned around and said , " Yes , it 's all right , but give me Perkins ! " JOHN AUSTIN Jinny ! Laughing . JINNY Are you shocked ? Come , I 'm tired ; let 's sit down here and read my letters  --  there 's one from Geof . They sit on the bench at Right , and JINNY takes out a letter from GEOFFREY. p. 46 JOHN AUSTIN I 'll read ahead in Baedeker and you tell me if there 's any news . He opens the Baedeker and reads , and she opens and reads the letter . Where is Geof 's letter from ? JINNY New York , of course ; where else would it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JINNY Geof ! Where ? JOHN AUSTIN West , a good way somewhere . JINNY But why would he go West ? JOHN AUSTIN Oh , he had some business , I believe ; I remember thinking it was a good idea when he told me . It was the day we were married  --  I was waiting for you to come downstairs . JINNY I think it 's very funny Geof never said anything about it to me . JOHN AUSTIN My dear , what time had you ! You were getting married ! ! JINNY I was ! Thank heaven ! I 'm so happy , Jack ! Snuggling up to him on the bench . JOHN AUSTIN Steals a little , quick hug with his arm about her waist . Bless you , darling , I do n't think there was ever a man as happy as I am ! They start apart quickly as a GERMAN COUPLE enter Right , with a YOUNG DAUGHTER , who is munching a cake , and hanging , a tired and unwilling victim , to her mother 's hand. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GERMAN MAN Grsses , nicht ? GERMAN WOMAN Yah ! They stand admiring . JOHN AUSTIN By the way , when you answer your brother 's letter , I wish you 'd say I seemed surprised he was still in New York . JINNY Reading . Um  --  um  --  GERMAN MAN Wiping his warm brow . Wunderbau ! GERMAN WOMAN Yah ! ! They go out Left , talking . JINNY Looking up from her letter . Oh ! what do you think ? JOHN AUSTIN That you 're the sweetest woman in the world . JINNY No , darling , I mean who do you think Geoffrey says is over here and in Italy ? JOHN AUSTIN I have n't the most remote idea ! So far as I 've been able to observe there has been absolutely no one in Italy but you and me . JINNY If you keep on talking like that , I shall kiss you ! p. 48 JOHN AUSTIN What ! before the tall , white gentleman ? Motioning to Apollo . I am dumb . JINNY Very lovingly . Silly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have brought Ruth Chester ! JOHN AUSTIN Speaking without thinking . Then it was her back . JINNY With the smallest sharpening of the look in her eye . When ? JOHN AUSTIN That I saw just now . JINNY With the tiniest suggestion of a strain in her voice . You said you did n't know whom it reminded you of . JOHN AUSTIN Yes , I know , I did n't quite . JINNY But if you thought it was Ruth Chester , why not have said so ? JOHN AUSTIN No reason , dear , I simply did n't think . JINNY Well  --  Sententiously.  --  next time  --  think ! JOHN AUSTIN What else does Geoffrey say ? JINNY Oh , nothing . The heat for two days was frightful  --  already they miss me more than he can say  --  Interrupted. p. 49 JOHN AUSTIN I 'll bet . JINNY Father smoked nineteen cigars a day the first week I was gone . JOHN AUSTIN I have n't had to smoke any ! JINNY Mercy ! do n't boast !  --  and he thinks they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN AUSTIN Does n't he say a word nor a hint at his going West ? JINNY No , he says he may go to Newport for August , and that 's all . Putting away letter , and getting out others . JOHN AUSTIN Going to read all those ? JINNY If you do n't mind , while I rest . Do you mind ? JOHN AUSTIN Of course not , but I think while you 're reading I 'll just take a little turn and see if I ca n't come across the Cullinghams . Rising . JINNY After the merest second 's pause , and looking seriously at him . Why do n't you ? JOHN AUSTIN I 'll bring them here if I find them  --  He goes out Right . JINNY looks up where he went off and gazes , motionless , for a few moments . Then she throws off the mood and opens a letter . Two tired Americans enter Right , a girl and her mother , MRS . Lopp and CARRIE. p. 50 MRS . LOPP What 's this , Carrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ; I 've sort of lost my place , somehow ! MRS . LOPP Well , we must be in Room No. 3 or 4  --  ai n't we ? CARRIE Reads out . The big statue at the end of Room No. 3 is Diana the Huntress . MRS . LOPP This must be it , then  --  Diana ! Strong-looking woman , ai n't she ? CARRIE Yes , very nice . You know she was the goddess who would n't let the men see her bathe . MRS . LOPP Mercy , Carrie ! and did all the other goddesses ? I do n't think much of their habits . I suppose this is the same person those Italians sell on the streets at home , and call the Bather . JINNY is secretly very much amused , finally she speaks . JINNY Excuse me , but you are in one of the cabinets  --  and this is the Apollo Belvedere . MRS . LOPP Oh , thank you very much . I guess we 've got mixed up with the rooms ,  --  seems as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was a man all the time ! p. 51 MRS . LOPP Well , what with so many of the statues only being piecemeal , as it were , and so many of the men having kinder women 's hair , I declare it seems as if I do n't know the ladies from the gentlemen half the time . CARRIE Did the rest of us go through here ? JINNY I beg your pardon ? CARRIE Thirty-four people with a gassy guide ? We got so tired hearing him talk that we jes ' sneaked off by ourselves , and now we 're a little scared about getting home ; we belong to the Cook 's Gentlemen and Ladies . JINNY Oh , no , the others have n't passed through here ; probably they have gone to see the pictures ; you 'd better go back and keep asking the attendants the way to the pictures till you get there . MRS . LOPP With rather subdued voice . Thank you ! We 've come to do Europe and the Holy Land in five weeks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm getting awful tired  --  after jes ' seven days . CARRIE Affectionately . Now , mommer , do n't give up ; it 's because you have n't got over being seasick yet ; that 's all ! JINNY Helplessly . Oh , yes , you 'll find it much less tiring in a few days , I 'm sure . p. 52 MRS . LOPP Still Rome does seem a powerful way from home ! How 'll we ask for the pictures ? CARRIE Why , mommer ! " Tableaux ! " " Tableaux ! " I should think you 'd ' a ' learned that from our church entertainments ! Good-by ; thank you ever so much . MRS . LOPP You have n't lost your party , too , have you ? JINNY Smiling . I hope not ! He promised to come back ! ! MRS . LOPP Oh ! pleased to have met you  --  Good-by ! They start off Left . JINNY No , not that way  --  back the way you came . MRS . LOPP Oh , thank you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop crackers , an account book , a thimble , a thread and-needle case , a bottle of pepsin tablets , etc . They all stoop to pick the collection up . JINNY helping . JINNY Handing . I 'm sure you 'll want these ! MRS . LOPP Yes , indeed ; do n't you find them coupon meals very dissatisfactory ? CARRIE Thank you ever so much again . Come on , mommer ! MRS . LOPP and CARRIE go out Left . JINNY looks at her watch and goes back to her letter . MRS . CULLINGHAM enters Left. p. 53 MRS . CULLINGHAM Sceams . Jinny ! JINNY Jumps up . MRS . Cullingham ! They embrace . Did Jack find you ? MRS . CULLINGHAM No , we have n't seen him ! Ruth and Peter are dawdling along , each on their own ; I like to shoot through a gallery . There 's no use spending so much time ; when it 's over you 've mixed everything all up just the same ! JINNY Laughing . Well , I 've this minute read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Jack , who thought he got a glimpse of you a little while ago , went straight off to try and find you . MRS . CULLINGHAM What fun it is to see you  --  and how happy you look ! JINNY I could n't look as happy as I feel ! MRS . CULLINGHAM Glancing at the statue . Who 's your friend ? Nice gent , is n't he ? Laughing . JINNY Mr. Apollo ! Would you like to meet him ? MRS . CULLINGHAM Hesitates . Er  --  no I do n't think ! You must draw the line somewhere ! He would n't do a thing to Corbett , would he ? p. 54 JINNY Who was Corbett ? MRS . CULLINGHAM He was a prize fighter , and is  --  but that 's another story  --  Do you mean to say you 've never heard of him ? JINNY Oh , the name sounds familiar . But this , you know , is Apollo . MRS . CULLINGHAM No , I do n't know ; was he a champion ? JINNY No , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he ? Well , I would n't have cared about being in the tailoring business in those days , would you ? Let 's sit down . They sit on bench Right . Of course you know we would n't accept a thing like that in Peoria , where I come from , as a gift ! No , indeed ! If the King of Italy sent it over to our Mayor , he 'd return it C.O.D . JINNY Sounds like Boston and the Macmonnies Bacchante ! MRS . CULLINGHAM Oh , my dear , worse than that ! It reminds me of a man at home who kept an underclothing store in our principal street and had a plaster cast of this gent 's brother , I should think , in his window to show a suit of Jaegers on ,  --  you know , a " combination " ! And our Town Committee of Thirteen for the moral improvement of Peoria made the man take it out of his window and hang the suit up empty ! p. 55 JINNY Poor man ! MRS . CULLINGHAM You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a perfectly beautiful park ,  --  and all the men statues wear Prince Alberts , and stand like this  --  She poses with lifted arm at right angle to body.  --  as if they were saying , " This way out " or " To the monkey cage and zoo . " JINNY Laughing . But the women statues ? MRS . CULLINGHAM My dear ! They only have heads and hands ; all the rest 's just clumps of drapery  --  we only have " Americans " and " Libertys " anyway . They apply the Chinese emigration law to all Venuses and sich ladies ! They both laugh . JINNY Where did you say Peter and Ruth were ? MRS . CULLINGHAM Well , I left Peter-who is n't at all well ; I hoped this trip would help his indigestion , but it seems to have made it worse !  --  I left him  --  er  --  in a room with a lot of broken-up Venuses  --  I thought it was all right ; he was eating candy , and there was n't a whole woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How did you happen to bring over Ruth Chester ? MRS . CULLINGHAM Well , you know I always liked her . She never snubbed me in her life  --  I do n't think any one you 've introduced me to has been quite so nice to Peter and me as Mrs. Chester and her daughter . p. 56 JINNY O they are real people ! MRS . CULLINGHAM Ruth is terribly depressed over something . She 's thin as a rail and the family are worried . She says there 's nothing worrying her , and the doctors ca n't find anything the matter with her ,  --  so Mrs. Chester asked me if I would n't take her abroad . They thought the voyage and change might do her good , and I seem to have a more cheery influence over her than most people . So here we are ! As PETER enters Left , eating . Here 's Peter ! How do you think the darling looks ? CULLINGHAM How do you do , Mrs. Austin ? JINNY How do you do , Peter ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seedy , but you eat too many sweet things . CULLINGHAM I 'm not eating candy ; it 's soda mints ! Showing a small bottle . I am bad to-day , mother . MRS . CULLINGHAM If you do n't get better , we 'll go to Carlsbad . JINNY How do you like Rome , Peter ? CULLINGHAM Oh , I do n't know  --  too much Boston and not enough Chicago to make it a real lively town . JINNY Laughing . I think I 'll go look for Jack and tell him you 've turned up . p. 57 MRS . CULLINGHAM Perhaps he 's found Ruth . JINNY With a change in her voice . Yes , perhaps . She goes out Right . CULLINGHAM Going to the doorway Right , calls after her . Ruth 's in a room on your left , with rows of men 's heads on shelves , Emperors and things ,  --  but gee , such a job lot ! Comes back and looks up at the statue . MRS . CULLINGHAM Is n't it beautiful , Peter ? CULLINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still this one is n't broken ! CULLINGHAM That 's a comfort ! Yes , it has been mended , too ! Examining . Oh , yes , it 's only another of these second-hand statues . Say , you missed one whole one , the best I 've seen yet ! A Venus off in a fine little room , all mosaics and painted walls ,  --  that 's where I 've been . MRS . CULLINGHAM Why , Peter Cullingham ! Alone ? What kind of a Venus ? CULLINGHAM Oh , beautiful ! I forgot to take my medicine ! MRS . CULLINGHAM Was she  --  er  --  dressed , darling ? p. 58 CULLINGHAM We  --  you know  --  she had been , but she 'd sort of pushed it a good way off ! MRS . CULLINGHAM With a sigh . You know we ought to admire these things , Peter darling ; that 's partly what we 've come to Europe for ! CULLINGHAM Oh pshaw ! here comes a gang of tourists . Come on , let 's skip ! MRS . CULLINGHAM But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait , and we can all meet at our hotel . A crowd of TOURISTS , let by a GUIDE , presses and crowds in the doorway . They drag their tired feet in a listless shuffle across the room and stand in a somewhat sheepish and stupid bunch at the statue . One or two of the younger women nudge each other and giggle . The GUIDE stands a little in advance of them . The GUIDE describes the statue , and while he is doing so PETER and MRS . CULLINGHAM go out Right . Most of the TOURISTS turn and watch them go instead of looking at the statue . GUIDE This is the Apollo Belvedere , discovered at the end of the fifteenth century , some say in a Roman villa or farmhouse near the Grotter Terratter . Very fine specimen both as marble and man . This statyer is calculated to make Sandow et cetery look like thirty cents . Height seven feet , weight  --  p. 59 MAN TOURIST How much ? GIRL TOURIST Was he married ? Titters from the group . GUIDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god once held a bow in his left hand and probably a laurel wreath in his right . ANOTHER WOMAN TOURIST A what ? GUIDE A laurel wreath . You want to take a good look at this , as it is a very fine piece . Now come along , please  --  make haste ; we must finish up this place before feeding ! He leads the way out Right , and the TOURISTS follow , shuffling along , without speaking , MRS . LOPP and CARRIE lagging in the rear . AUSTIN enters Left , followed by RUTH . JOHN AUSTIN . This is where I left her with Apollo ! Calls . Jinny ! She seems to have gone ! He looks behind the statue and out door , Right . CHESTER Probably the Cullinghams , who were headed in this direction , found her , and they 've all gone back for us ; you see I walked all around the court first without going into the rooms , so I missed them , but found you . JOHN AUSTIN What shall we do ? Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall I go in search ? p. 60 CHESTER . Oh , no , you might miss them , and then we 'd all be lost ! If you left Jinny here , she 's sure to come back to meet you . She sits on the bench and AUSTIN stands behind her . JOHN AUSTIN I 'm sorry to learn you 've been ill . CHESTER . Oh ! it 's nothing . JOHN AUSTIN . Ah , I 'm afraid it 's a good deal . Will you forgive me if I say I think I know what it is ! She looks up startled . After a moment . You have n't forgotten the day of Jinny 's and my wedding , when you told me Geoffrey Tillman needed a friend ? CHESTER I hoped you 'd forgotten ; I ought n't to have told you ; I ought n't to have ! JOHN AUSTIN Why not ? I had a talk with Geoffrey , then , and he told me everything . CHESTER He did ! You are sure ? JOHN AUSTIN . Sure . He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN AUSTIN Love each other . CHESTER . Oh , but that is n't all . JOHN AUSTIN I know the rest ! CHESTER . He told you  --  about  --  about  --  p. 61 JOHN AUSTIN The marriage ?  --  Yes . CHESTER Oh , I 'm so glad , so glad ! Now I can speak of it to some one , and some one who can advise me , and will help us . JOHN AUSTIN I have already advised him , but he does n't seem to be taking my advice ; it has worried me . CHESTER When I left he was awfully depressed . He said he saw no prospect of being able to publish our marriage for years , maybe ! JOHN AUSTIN What marriage ? In astonishment . CHESTER . Our marriage , in Brooklyn ! She notices his expression and is alarmed . You said he had told you ! JOHN AUSTIN Recovering himself , and speaking at first with hesitation . Yes , but not the details , not  --  wait , I 'm a little confused . Rising and walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , that 's the only way I can help you  --  both ; I ought , of course , to have gone through it all with him , but there really was n't time . CHESTER I ca n't go on like this much longer . It 's killing me to deceive mother ; I must tell her soon ! JOHN AUSTIN Quickly , stops walking . No . You must n't , not yet , if I 'm going to help you ; you 'll obey me , wo n't you ? p. 62 CHESTER Yes , if you only will help us ! JOHN AUSTIN . You said you and Geoffrey Tillman were married where ? CHESTER In Brooklyn . JOHN AUSTIN When ? CHESTER A month before your wedding . JOHN AUSTIN To himself . It 's impossible ! Walking up and down . CHESTER Smiling sadly . Oh , no ! I remember the date only too well . JOHN AUSTIN I did n't mean that . CHESTER I lied to my mother that day for the first time  --  at any rate , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ever since . JOHN AUSTIN Probing her . But  --  but why were you married so secretly ? CHESTER We could n't afford to marry and set up for ourselves . He expected then to be sent off at once to the Philippines , and  --  well , he did n't want to leave me behind , free ; I 'm afraid he 's rather jealous  --  you must have found out by now that Jinny is . They all are ! And I did n't want him to go so far off without my belonging to him either ; I 'm that jealous , too ! Smiling . So  --  that 's why ! p. 63 JOHN AUSTIN And this long period of secrecy since then  --  do you understand that ? CHESTER Has n't he explained to you his debts ? You know before he loved me he was very fast , but since  --  JOHN AUSTIN Yes , I know how he gave up every one of his old habits with a great deal of courage . CHESTER Nobody knows what it cost him ! How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay off his debts ? Or ca n't you make him feel even if we do have to go on living at our different homes for a while , it is better to publish the fact that we are married ? - JOHN AUSTIN I shall go back at once to America if I can persuade Jinny ! CHESTER . And I , too ? JOHN AUSTIN No . You must stay abroad till I send word for you to come home . If I am going to help you , you will help me by doing exactly as I say , wo n't you ? CHESTER . Yes . JOHN AUSTIN It 's very important that you should absolutely obey me ! CHESTER . I Will . A pause . JINNY , unnoticed by either of them , appears in the doorway at Right . AUSTIN . is walking up and down.RUTH is leaning her elbow on the back of the bench and burying her face in her hands. p. 64 JOHN AUSTIN It 's awful ! My God , it 's awful ! JINNY In a strained , asswmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN AUSTIN I did n't hear you , Jinny ! JINNY No , you both seemed so absorbed . CHESTER Going to JINNY . I 'm so glad to see you . Kisses her , but JINNY only gives her her cheek and that rather unwillingly ; she is looking all the time at her husband . JINNY Thank you , I , ve just left the Cullinghams . They sent word to you they were going and would wait for you outside . CHESTER Oh , then , I must n't keep them waiting . We 'll all meet at dinner to night , wo n't we ? Good-by  --  good-by . With a grateful look at AUSTIN , she goes out Right . JINNY Watches her go ; then turns to AUSTIN . That was n't true , what I told her  --  I have n't seen the Cullinghams , and I do n't know where they are , and what 's more , I do n't care ! JOHN AUSTIN What do you mean ? p. 65 JINNY Beginning by degrees to lose control of herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN AUSTIN Jinny ! JINNY Oh , do n't try to deny it ; that 'll only make me suspect you ! JOHN AUSTIN My dear girl , you do n't know what you 're saying ! JINNY She 's ill , they say at home ! Yes , and they do n't know what 's the matter with her , do they ? No ! But I can tell them ! She 's in love with another woman 's husband ! JOHN AUSTIN Taking her hand . Hush ! I wo n't allow you to say such things ! JINNY With a disagreeable little laugh . Oh , wo n't you ? You 'd better be careful , - my eyes are opened ! JOHN AUSTIN Yes , and much too wide . JINNY A half-blind person would have known there was something between you two . When I came into this room just now , it was in the air  --  it was in both your faces ! She sits on the bench . JOHN AUSTIN You 've worked yourself up to such a pitch you 're not responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible ! What was it you were saying was so " awful " when I came in here ? " My God , so awful ! " He does n't answer . Almost hysterical , she rises . She had told you she loved you ! She 'd confessed she 'd followed you over here ! JOHN AUSTIN Absolutely false , both your suppositions ! JINNY Oh , of course you 'd protect her ; you 're a gentleman ! But if I thought you knew she was coming over- JOHN AUSTIN Jinny ! Jinny ! How can you have such a thought ? JINNY Well , why did n't you tell me when you thought you saw her a little while ago ? JOHN AUSTIN Oh  --  JINNY Oh , it 's very easy to say " Oh ! " Imitating him. but why did n't you ? JOHN AUSTIN I told you I did n't think who it was ; I only thought something familiar flashed across my eyes . Jinny darling , this is sheer madness on your part , letting yourself go like this . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own heart , and your own mind , if in speaking to me as you have , you have n't done me at least an injustice and my love for you a little wrong . p. 67 JINNY Well , I 'm sure she 's in love with you , anyway . JOHN AUSTIN No , she is n't ! And it 's disgraceful of you to say so ! I know she is n't  --  JINNY How do you know she is n't ? JOHN AUSTIN There 's no question of it . I 'm sure of it ! You must n't think , dear , that because you love me , everybody does  --  you idealize me ! Smiling apologetically . JINNY Oh , you 're so modest you do n't see ! But I do  --  on the steamer , in the hotels , everywhere we go , always , all the women admire you awfully ! I see it ! JOHN AUSTIN Laughing . What utter nonsense ! Taking her into his arms . You 've got something in your eyes ! JINNY Only tears ! JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughs through her tears . Somebody 's told you my old nickname ! JOHN AUSTIN What ? JINNY Laughs and is a little embarrassed . The girl with the green eyes . JOHN AUSTIN Ahem !  --  p. 68 JINNY Well , I do n't care if it is appropriate , I ca n't help it . Slipping from his arms . JOHN AUSTIN You must  --  or it will threaten our happiness if you let yourself be carried away by jealousy for no earthly reason outside of your dear , little imagination , as you have this time  --  Interrupted . JINNY You honestly do n't think she cares for you ? JOHN AUSTIN Not a bit ! JINNY But what was it you were so serious about  --  what is between you ? JOHN AUSTIN She is in a little trouble , and I happen to know about it . JINNY How ? JOHN AUSTIN After a second 's hesitation . That you must n't ask me ; it was not from her I knew of it . JINNY Truly ? JOHN AUSTIN Truly . JINNY I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! I should think she 'd have gone to a woman instead of a man for sympathy . She 's got Mrs. Cullingham ! JOHN AUSTIN She ca n't go to her , poor girl . Mrs. Cullingham knows nothing about it . p. 69 JINNY Now do n't you get too sympathetic  --  that 's very dangerous ! JOHN AUSTIN Look out , your imagination is peeping through the keyhole . A moment 's pause . JINNY In a sympathetic tone , the jealousy gone . What is her trouble , Jack ? JOHN AUSTIN That , dear , I ca n't tell you now ; some day , perhaps , if you want me to , but not now . Only I give you my word of honor , it has nothing to do with you and me  --  does not touch our life ! And I want you to tell me you believe me , and trust me , and wo n't let yourself be jealous again ! JINNY I do believe you , and I do trust you , and I will try not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that book of De Maupassant 's They move away together . I was reading in the train the other day ,  --  about the young girl who killed herself with charcoal fumes when her lover deserted her ? JOHN AUSTIN Half laughing . This is apropos of what , please ? I have absolutely no sympathy with such people . JINNY In America that girl would have simply turned on the gas . p. 70 JOHN AUSTIN You 're getting morbid , Jinny ! JINNY No , I 'm not ! but if ever  --  JOHN AUSTIN Interrupting  --  laughing it off . I shall install electric light as soon as we get home ! They both laugh . JINNY I 'm sorry I was so disagreeable to Ruth , but I 'll try to make up for it in every way I can . She sits on the bench and he leans over the back toward her . JOHN AUSTIN There 's one other thing , Jinny , I 'd like to speak of now . Would you mind giving up the Lakes and going home this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --  Wall Street is very uncertain . I 'm worried ,  --  I do n't mind telling you ,  --  and I want to see Geoffrey about his business . JINNY Half in earnest . Jack ! You 're not running away from her , are you ? JOHN AUSTIN Jinny ! After all we 've said ! JINNY No ! I was n't in earnest ! I 'm ready to go . I 've seen the Lakes , and whether you are in Italy or in New York , so long as we are together , it 's our honeymoon just the same . p. 71 JOHN AUSTIN And may it last all our lives ! JINNY Still , I do n't mind owning up that leaving Ruth Chester behind here is rather pleasanter ! She rises quickly with a sudden thought . She is not going back , too ? JOHN AUSTIN Oh , no , not for a long time . They are over here indefinitely . JINNY I 've been too horrid and nasty for words this morning , Jack  --  I 'm so sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do forgive me ? JOHN AUSTIN Of course , dear ; only I want to say this one thing to you : to suspect unjustly a true love is to insult that love ! JINNY I did n't really suspect you . JOHN AUSTIN Of course I know you did n't ! This is only by way of a grandfatherly warning ! It is possible to insult a true love too often  --  and love can die  --  JINNY Sh ! do n't , please , say any more . You have forgiven me , have n't you ? JOHN AUSTIN Yes ! JINNY Then kiss me ! JOHN AUSTIN Smilling . Here ! My dear , some one will see us ! p. 72 JINNY No , only Apollo ; see , there 's no one else about  --  it 's luncheon hour ! JOHN AUSTIN But  --  Taking her hand . JINNY Pulling him . Come along , then , behind the statue . No one will see us there ! They are behind the statue a moment and then come around the other side . JINNY There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , are you ? JOHN AUSTIN " So happy ! " JINNY takes his arm and they go to the Left entrance . She stops and looks up at him . JINNY Are my eyes green now ? JOHN AUSTIN Now they 're blue ! JINNY Hurrah ! and I 'm going , from now on , to be so good , you wo n't know me . And hugging his arm tight they go out as  --  @x ( Three weeks later ) The Austins ' library ; a warm , attractive room , with dark woodwork , and the walls hung in crimson brocade ; Dutch marqueterie furniture ; blue and white china on the mantel and tops of the book shelves ; carbon photographs of pictures by Reynolds , Romney , and Gainsborough on the wall . There is a double window at the back . A door at Right leads to the hall , and another on the Left side of the room leads to JINNY 'S own room . MRS . TILLMAN sits at a pianola Right , playing " Tell me , Pretty Maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is unaccustomed to the instrument . JINNY enters from Left , singing as her mother plays . JINNY Darling mother ! She puts her arms about her and kisses her . They come away from the pianola together , to a big armchair . MRS . TILLMAN I really must get one of those sewing-machine pianos for your father . I believe even he could play it , and it would be lots of amusement for us . JINNY Jack adores it ; I gave it to him for an anniversary present . MRS . TILLMAN What anniversary ? Sitting in the chair . JINNY Day before yesterday . The eleventh Tuesday since our marriage . Have you been in town all day ? I am glad to see you ! She sits on the arm of the chair with her arm about her mother. p. 74 MRS . TILLMAN Yes , and I told your father to meet me here and we 'd take the six-thirty train from Long Island City . JINNY Jack and I are going to the theatre to-night . MRS . TILLMAN I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are several musical comedies on ,  --  Jack 's favorite form of amusement ,  --  and I 've bought the tickets myself for a sort of birthday party . MRS . TILLMAN Is it his birthday ? JINNY No , that 's only my execuse ! MRS . TILLMAN Laughing . Had we dreamed you and Jack were coming home in June , your father and I would n't have gone into the country so early . JINNY We 've been home two weeks and it has n't been hot yet . MRS . TILLMAN And you 're still ideally happy are n't you , darling ? JINNY Yes  --  She rises and goes to a table near the centre of the room and looks at the titles of several books without realizing what they are . MRS . TILLMAN Why , Jinny ,  --  what does that mean ? JINNY Oh , it 's all my horrid disposition ! p. 75 MRS . TILLMAN Been seeing green ? JINNY Um ! Um ! Once in Rome , and on the steamer , and again since we 've been back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turns and faces her mother . No  --  but the last time Jack was harder to bring around than before , and he looked at me for fully five minutes without a particle of love in his eyes , and they were almost  --  dead eyes ! MRS . TILLMAN What was it all about ? JINNY Ruth Chester , principally . MRS . TILLMAN Why Ruth ? JINNY Well , the first real scene I made was in Rome in the Vatican . I was jealous of her ; I ca n't explain it all to you  --  as a matter of fact , it has n't been all explained to me ! Something was troubling Ruth that Jack knew , and he said he 'd help her . MRS . TILLMAN What ? JINNY That 's just it ; Jack wo n't tell me . And the day we sailed from Naples a telegram came , and of course I opened it , and it said , " Trust me , I will do everything you say . Ruth . " MRS . TILLMAN Why have n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 76 JINNY Going back to her mother . I was ashamed to ! Somehow , in the end I always knew I was wrong and had hurt him  --  hurt him terribly , mother , the man I love better than everything else in the world ! Yes , even better than you and father and Geoffrey  --  all together ! In her mother 's arms , crying a little . MRS . TILLMAN Oh , this curse of jealousy ! I was in hopes he was so strong he would help you to overcome it . JINNY He does try hard , I can see sometimes ; but he has n't a spark of it in him , and he ca n't understand it , and I know I 'm unreasonable , and before I know it I am saying things I do n't know what , and some day he wo n't forgive them ! I 'm sure some day he wo n't !  --  Breaking down again . She rises and turns away . MRS . TILLMAN Rising and putting her arms about her . Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that wo n't do you any good ; you 've got to fight this battle out , I 'm afraid , by yourself , trusting in the deep love of your husband to teach him forbearance . Your father 's and my troubles were never very big because we shared the curse , so we knew how to sympathize with each other ! JINNY What an awful thing it is ! p. 77 MRS . TILLMAN Yes , my dear child . Jeal-ousy has no saving grace , and it only de-stroys what is always most precious to you . Jinny , do n't let it destroy your best happiness ! JINNY Mother , if it should , I 'd kill my-self ! MRS . TILLMAN Shocked , but quite disbe-lieving her . My dear ! MAGGIE enters Right . MAGGIE Mr. Tillman is downstairs , madam . MRS . TILLMAN Tell him to come up . MAGGIE Yes , madam . She goes out Right . JINNY Do n't tell father anything before me . MRS . TILLMAN I do n't know that I shall tell him at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . MRS . TILLMAN sits on the sofa at Left . MR . TILLMAN Are you here ? JINNY Going to meet him . We are , father dear , and your presence almost completes us . Kisses him . I say almost , because Jack has n't come up town yet , and Geoffrey 's heartless enough to stay on fishing at Cape Cod ! p. 78 MR . TILLMAN No , he is n't ; he 's back to-day . He sits in the armchair at Right . JINNY Oh , I do want to see him ! Sitting near her father . MR . TILLMAN He ought to have been in by now  --  I met him this morning . He was to lunch with Jack , and he 's going to put up for a few days at the University . JINNY He must dine with us every night . MR . TILLMAN Jinny !  --  Looking at her.  --  You look as if you 've been crying ! The two WOMEN are embarrassed , and JINNY does n't reply . MR . TILLMAN Hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , it 's all right ! I do n't begrudge your mother her first place in your affections ! JINNY Not at all , father ; with you and mother there 's no first place . She will tell you all about it on the way home ! Please , mother . MRS . TILLMAN Very well , dear . MR . TILLMAN A little " scrap " between you and jack ? JINNY Yes , but it 's all over ! p. 79 MR . TILLMAN Um !  --  Thinks a second then taking out his cigar case , he empties it of cigars and hands them to JINNY . Give your husband these , please , when he comes in ! JINNY and her MOTHER exchange a smile . JINNY But , father , Jack 's got boxes full  --  MR . TILLMAN Never mind ; give him from me , with my compliments ! JINNY Laughing . Very well ! MR .

JINNY I do n't know , he just did n't want her ; and then last week he talked with her in the library for three-quarters of an hour by my watch . MRS . TILLMAN Why ? JINNY Oh , it seems she has troubles , too ! All single young women with troubles , of no matter what class , seem to make a bee line for my husband , even if they have to cross the ocean ! p. 80 MR . TILLMAN What do you mean ? JINNY Half laughing . Oh , nothing , but it was about that talk with Maggie that we had our last quarrel . MAGGIE enters Right . MAGGIE Mrs. Culingham . A second 's dead silence , the announcement falling like a bombshell . JINNY Astounded . Who ? She rises . TILLMAN AND MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam . JINNY They 're in Europe . MRS .

MAGGIE Yes 'm . She goes out Right . MR . TILLMAN Why , they only just sailed the other day , did n't they ? MRS . TILLMAN Yes , and they were supposed to be gone all summer at least , for Ruth Chester 's health ! What in the world can they have come back for ? p. 81 JINNY With curious determination . That is what I intend to find out . MR . TILLMAN Rising . We must be going , Susan ; we 've lost our train as it is . MRS . TILLMAN Rising . We can take the seven-two . MAGGIE shows in MRS .

Sites on the sofa . JINNY To PETER . Will you have some water ? p. 82 CULLINGHAM No , thank you , I 've learned now to take them au naturel , and without much , if any , inconvenience ! Takes his tablet with still a certain amount of difficulty , and sites Right . MRS . TILLMAN To MRS . CULLINGHAM . Did you have a bad voyage ? MRS . CULLINGHAM No , perfectly beautiful !

But it 's the Custom House that 's worn me out ; I was there from twelve till four . MRS . TILLMAN But you would n't have had time to buy anything ! MRS . CULLINGHAM Of course not ! But I took plenty of new dresses for the entire summer ; most of them had n't been worn , and they were determined to make me pay duty . JINNY We had to pay awfully for things ! I wanted to try and smuggle , but Jack would n't let me ! MR . TILLMAN I 'm afraid we must go ! All rise . MRS . CULLINGHAM What do you think the Inspector had the impudence to ask me finally ,  --  if I wanted to bring the dresses in as theatrical properties ! They laugh. p. 83 MRS .

CULLINGHAM Nothing , except that you must know we were coming home . JINNY Why  --  that I must ? MRS . CULLINGHAM You must n't put me into a corner like that ! JINNY How do you mean " corner " ? How did you happen to come home like this ? MRS . CULLINGHAM Ruth suddenly got a cable  --  she did n't tell me from whom  --  but she said she must go home at once . JINNY But her mother 's never been better ! MRS . CULLINGHAM Carelessly . The cable was n't from her mother . p. 85 JINNY Oh , then , you know who it was from ? No answer .

You know what I mean ; it was dreadful of me , but I could n't help it . JINNY In a strained voice . Jack and Ruth are very good friends and he looks after some of her affairs . You know having no man in the family complicates things . CULLINGHAM Oh ! I say ! Standing up , suddenly . MRS . CULLINGHAM What is it , dear ? CULLINGHAM I believe I have n't got my before dinner tabs . MRS . CULLINGHAM Oh , look carefully ! CULLINGHAM He looks in his right-hand pocket , takes out a bottle . Soda mints !

I 'm awfully ashamed of myself , and I hope I have n't made any trouble or fuss with my meddling . Do n't let me ! JINNY No , of course not . With a strained smile . MRS .

Going to the desk at Right , and finding the telegram . Of course it 's from her , saying that she 's arrived . That 's the trouble with telegrams ; the address does n't give the handwriting away . She must have sent it from the dock ! Could n't even wait till she was home ! She walks to the window and stands there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearly seven already , and no sign of him , and we must dress and dine  --  huh ! I think I might as well tear up my theatre tickets ! She paces up and down the room , stopping now and then with each new thought that comes to her . I wonder if he went down there to meet her  --  he must have known the boat ; if he cabled her to come back , she must have cabled an answer and what boat she 'd take ! But no other telegram has come for Jack here to my knowledge  --  oh ! of course , what am I thinking of , she sent that one to his office to-day ; she was afraid he might have left before this one could get there , so she risked it here . Good Heavens ! why am I maudling on like this to myself out loud ? It 's really nothing  --  Jack will explain once more that he ca n't explain , but that Ruth has " troubles , " and I 'll believe him again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay over there ! Looks at her watch again . He 's there , with her ! Nothing ever kept him half as late down town as this ! What a little fool I am ! GEOFFREY enters suddenly Right. p. 88 JINNY Cries out , joyfully . Geoffrey ! And rushing to him , embraces him . You brute , you , not to come straight back to New York when you heard I was home ! You dear old darling , you ! TILLMAN I could n't , old girl ; there were reasons  --  I do n't have to tell you I wanted to . JINNY I do n't know ! Was there a pretty girl up there , Geof ? I 'm sure I should n't think her pretty if you were in with her . I believe I shall be awfully jealous of your wife when you get one ! TILLMAN Rubbish ! Has n't Jack come back yet ? JINNY " Come back " from where ? TILLMAN Brooklyn . JINNY Brooklyn ! Why , he told me  --  what did he go there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don't --  JINNY You do ! ! TILLMAN No  --  really  --  I  --  JINNY Oh , it 's something to be concealed , then ? TILLMAN Hang it , Jinny ! drop the subject . I thought he said he was going to Brooklyn ; probably I was mistaken . p. 89 JINNY Satirically . One is so apt to think just casually that every one 's going to Brooklyn ! Looks at her watch . Of course it 's Brooklyn . Goes and looks at the telegram ; turns . So you 're going back on me , too , are you ? You 're going to protect Jack at my expense ! AUSTIN enters Right . JOHN AUSTIN Absorbed . Good evening , Jinny dear . JINNY It 's after seven ! JOHN AUSTIN Pleasantly . Is it ? Have you been waiting long , Geoffrey ? TILLMAN No , I 've only just now come in . JINNY It 's I who have done the waiting ! JOHN AUSTIN I 'm sorry , but it could n't be helped . JINNY You did n't tell me you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp look at Geoffrey , who shakes his head once emphatically . It must have escaped my mind . JINNY That 's very likely ! Going to Brooklyn 's the sort of thing one talks about and dreads for days . p. 90 JOHN AUSTIN Well , Jinny , that will bear postponement , and my conversation with Geoffrey wo n't ; will you please leave us together here for a while ? JINNY And what about the theatre ? JOHN AUSTIN What theatre ? JINNY Oh , you 've forgotten entirely my little birthday party ! Thanks ! JOHN AUSTIN Oh , Jinny ! I did ! Forgive me ! I 'm awfully sorry ! I 've got a lot on my mind to-day . Tries to put his arms about her and kiss her . She pushes herself away from him , refusing to let him kiss her . JINNY Yes  --  I know you have  --  At door Left.  --  I 'll leave you two to your confidences . You can trust Geof ; he just now refused to betray you . AUSTIN only looks at her fixedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she deliberately crosses the room , gets the cable , and recrosses with it and goes out Left . JOHN AUSTIN Poor Jinny ! Turning to GEOFFREY . And that , too , lies largely on your already overcrowded shoulders . TILLMAN Breaking down . I know ! I know ! JOHN AUSTIN Sitting in the corner of the sofa . Here , do n't cry ! You 've got to be strong now , and you 've no use nor time for crying . I 've had another long interview with the Brooklyn minister . p. 91 TILLMAN Yes ?  --  JOHN AUSTIN Drawing a chair near to him and sitting . Well , of course we both know that he 's doing wrong to keep silent , but he will . He wishes I had n't told him , because he thinks he 'd never have noticed your divorce from Maggie when it was granted  --  nor remembered your name if he had seen it in the papers . TILLMAN That 's what I told you ! JOHN AUSTIN You only argued that for fear I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom of your heart you know it was a risk we could n't afford to run . I 've explained everything to him  --  how such a fine , sweet girl would suffer if he did expose you , and I gave him my word you would be re-married to Ruth at once after the divorce . Of course we both know it 's wrong , but we both hope the end justifies the means that removes difficulty number two . TILLMAN You 're sure about Maggie ? JOHN AUSTIN She 's signed a paper ; she realizes you 'll never live with her , and  --  it 's pathetic  --  she loves you  --  that girl , too  --  so much as to give you your freedom  --  Good Lord ! what is it about you weak men that wins women so ? What is it in you that has made two women love you to such a self-sacrificing extent ? p. 92 TILLMAN Half tragic , half comic laugh . I give it up ! JOHN AUSTIN Bitterly . So do I. Well , Maggie is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get it ? JOHN AUSTIN We 'll talk about that when the time comes . He rises . Now the most important , the most painful , task of all must be done and you must do it . Not I this time  --  you ! TILLMAN Looking up , frightened . What ? JOHN AUSTIN Ruth Chester landed this morning . TILLMAN Starting up . Impossible ! Rising . JOHN AUSTIN The moment Maggie signed my paper I cabled Miss Chester to return You ca n't go out West and institute proceedings for divorce without her knowing the whole truth from , you first ! You do n't want her to find it out from the newspapers , do you ? TILLMAN And you want me to tell her ! JOHN AUSTIN To-day . And to-morrow you start west ! TILLMAN Facing AUSTIN . I wo n't start tell her . p. 93 JOHN AUSTIN Calmly . You 've got to ! TILLMAN I 'd rather shoot myself ; do you understand me  --  I 'd rather shoot myself ! JOHN AUSTIN That 's nothing ! That would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cowardly . TILLMAN She 'll hate me ! She 'll loathe me ! How could she help it at first ! But just after a little , if I were n't there , the love she has for me might move her somehow or other  --  and by degrees perhaps  --  to forgive  --  JOHN AUSTIN I do n't deny that you will have to go through a terrible degradation with her  --  but that is nothing compared with what you deserve . If you tell her , at least the humiliation is secret , locked there between you two , and no one else in the world can ever know what happens ; but if you send some one else , and no matter who ,  --  any one else but you is an outsider ,  --  you ask her to make a spectacle of her humiliation , to let a third in as witness to the relations and emotions between you two ! It 's insulting her again ! Do n't you see ? A pause . TILLMAN Yes , I see ! My God ! I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't waver , make up your mind and do it  --  Come ! Urging him up. p. 94 TILLMAN Hesitates a moment . And Jinny ? JOHN AUSTIN Oh , she 'll come round all right ; she always does . TILLMAN And she does n't suspect ? JOHN AUSTIN Not the slightest . A pause TILLMAN Need she ? JOHN AUSTIN The worst ? No , never ! TILLMAN He rises , with new encouragement . You 'll give me your word ? JOHN AUSTIN Yes . Shakes his hand . I know how much she loves you ; I would n't have her know anything . It 's made us some ugly scenes , but they soon pass , and when you are once out of your trouble for good , we 'll have no excuse , I 'm sure , for any more ! TILLMAN Then I shall go to bed to-night with the respect still of at least two women who are dear to me , my mother and Jinny , even if I lose the respect and love of the one woman who is dearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up there  --  never mind about myself  --  and make her suffer tortures ! Good-by . God give me courage to do the heart-breaking thing I must do . JOHN AUSTIN I am sure the one hope you have of forgiveness is in your manliness of going to her as you are doing and telling her yourself all the truth ! p. 95 TILLMAN And that , like everything else , I owe to you . JOHN AUSTIN No , to Jinny ! Good luck ! He shakes GEOFFREY 'S hand and GEOFFREY goes out Right . JOHN AUSTIN Goes to the door Left , opens it , and calls to JINNY , in the next room . Jinny , Geoffrey 's gone  --  what are you doing ? JINNY Answers in a very little staccato voice . Waiting till you should have the leisure to receive me ! JOHN AUSTIN Come along ! Leaves the doorway . JINNY enters Left and stands in the doorway . JINNY With affected nonchalance . I did n't care to go downstairs for dinner , so I have had a tray up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; would you like it now ? JOHN AUSTIN Ignoring purposely her mood and manner . I should n't mind ! I do feel a little hungry . He sits in the armchair . JINNY Speaks off through the doorway Left . Bring in the tray for Mr. Austin , Maggie . p. 96 MAGGIE Off stage . Yes 'm . JINNY pulls forward a little tea table beside his chair . Her whole manner must be one of slow , dragging carelessness , like the calm before a storm . Her expression must be hard . She carries the telegram still unopened , and on top of it the theatre tickets torn into pieces . MAGGIE brings in the tray , puts it on the table , and goes out Right . On the tray are chops , peas , some whiskey , a syphon , a roll , etc . JOHN AUSTIN Sits down quickly and with a show of eagerness . Ah ! Begins to eat as if he were hungry and enjoyed it . JINNY sits on the sofa at his Left , and looks at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood , but pretends not to notice it . JOHN AUSTIN After a silence during which he eats . I say I am hungry ! And these chops are very good , are n't they ? No answer . I 'll tell you what it is , Jinny ! Of course travelling is great sport and all the rest of it , but after all one does get tired of hotels , and to quote a somewhat familiar refrain , " There 's no place like home . " No answer . Have you a headache , Jinny ? p. 97 JINNY Very short . No . JOHN AUSTIN That 's a good thing , and I hope you are not as disappointed as I am about the theatre . JINNY Half laughs . Humph ! JOHN AUSTIN I 'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow and take you . JINNY Quickly . Why did you go to to Brooklyn ? JOHN AUSTIN On the private business of some one else . JINNY With all her nerves tied tight . That 's the best answer you will give me ? JOHN AUSTIN My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you . JINNY When you are through I have something for you ! JOHN AUSTIN What ? JINNY I 'll give it to you when you have finished . JOHN AUSTIN I 'm ready . He rises . JINNY rises too , and gives him the telegram with the torn tickets on top , and then rings the bee , at Right . What are these torn papers ? JINNY Our theatre tickets ! He looks at her. p. 98 JOHN AUSTIN And when did this telegram come ? JINNY This afternoon . JOHN AUSTIN Why did n't I get it when I came in ? JINNY Bitingly . I kept it to have the pleasure of giving it to you myself ; it 's from Ruth Chester . JOHN AUSTIN How do you know ? JINNY Oh , I have n't opened it ! But I I know . When I held it in my hand it burnt my fingers ! MAGGIE enters Right . Take away the tray , please , Maggie . MAGGIE Yes 'm . She leaves the room with the tray . JINNY replaces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reads the telegram ; there is a second 's pause . JINNY May I read it ? JOHN AUSTIN After a moment 's hesitation . Yes , if you wish . Not handing it to her . JINNY I do ! JOHN AUSTIN Reaches over and hands her the telegram ; he speaks quietly . When you behave like this it 's impossible for me to feel the same toward you . p. 99 JINNY And how do you think I feel when I read this ? Reads it , satirically , bitterly . " Arrived safely ; please let me see you before the day goes . Ruth . " " Ruth " if you please ! JOHN AUSTIN Standing over JINNY . I want you to be careful to-night . I want you to control yourself . I 've been through a great deal to-day , and if you make me angry God knows what I might n't say and do ! JINNY And I 've been through a great deal for many a day now , and I want the truth about this at last ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not telling me what this mysterious trouble is about which you 've been hoodwinking me ever since we were married , but now you 've got to choose between sparing her and sparing me ! She sits determinedly . JOHN AUSTIN Is this your answer to me when I beg you to be very careful to-night to control yourself ? JINNY It 's your turn to be careful ! What did you marry me for if you were in love with Ruth ? JOHN AUSTIN Jinny ! JINNY A little frightened , to excuse herself . You gave me your word of honor she would stay abroad indefinitely . p. 100 JOHN AUSTIN Nonsense ! I said I understood she was going to stay some time  --  indefinitely . JINNY It 's the same thing , and here she is back practically the moment we are ! JOHN AUSTIN I ca n't control Miss Chester 's movements  --  I could n't foresee when she would come back . In Rome she told me she would stay on . JINNY Rising and facing him . Ah ! that 's what I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JOHN AUSTIN What do you mean ? JINNY Beside herself . Liar ! He only looks at her , with his face hard and set ; she is insane with jealousy for the moment . You sent for Ruth to come back . JOHN AUSTIN And if I did ? JINNY You tried to deceive me about it . And if you 'll tell me a lie about one thing , you 'll tell me a lie about another , and I do n't believe one word of all your explanations about the intrigue between you and Ruth Chester ! JOHN AUSTIN Taking her two hands . Sit down ! She sits in the armchair , half forced by him. p. 101 JINNY Why did you send for Ruth Chester to come back ? JOHN AUSTIN I have told you before , I am trying to help Miss Chester . JINNY " Ruth ! " JOHN AUSTIN I am trying to help her in a great and serious trouble . JINNY Why did you send for her to come back ? What 's the trouble ? JOHN AUSTIN I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You dare n't tell me , and you have n't even the face to tell another lie about it ! JOHN AUSTIN If you say another word , I shall hate you ! If you wo n't control yourself , I must make you , as well as keep my own sane balance . You have insulted my love for you to-night as you 've never done before ; you 've struck at my own ideal of you ; you 've almost done , in a word , what I warned you you might do  --  kill the love I have for you ! JINNY Frightened . Jack ! JOHN AUSTIN I mean what I say ! JINNY In tears . That  --  that you  --  you do n't love me ? JOHN AUSTIN That is not what I said , but I tell you now that since I first began to care for you , never have I loved you so little as I do to-night . p. 102 JINNY With an effort at angry justification . And suppose I tell you it is your own fault , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a child , instead of a woman ! JINNY No , because you 've kept part of yourself from me , and that part you 've given  --  JOHN AUSTIN For God 's sake , stop ! A pause  --  JINNY is now thoroughly frightened ; slowly she comes to her senses . Do you want a rupture for good between us ? No answer . Ca n't you see what I tell you is true ? That I ca n't bear any more to-night ? That if you keep on you will rob me of every bit of love I have for you , just as you 've already robbed me of the woman I thought you were ? JINNY " Already ! " No , no , Jack , do n't say that . Oh , what have I done ! She cries . JOHN AUSTIN You 've done something very serious , and before you do more  --  Speaking hardly.  --  I think we 'd better not stay in this evening ; it would be wiser for both of us if we went out somewhere . JINNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've hurt you , hurt you terribly ! Oh , why do I do it ? Why ca n't I help myself ? p. 103 JOHN AUSTIN I think one more scene to-night would finish things for us . I warn you of that , Jinny  --  He goes to the desk and sits at it , looking blankly before him . She comes slowly , almost timidly , behind his chair . JINNY No , do n't say it ! do n't say it ! Try to forgive me  --  oh , Jack , I hate myself , and I 'm so ashamed of myself ! I know I 've disappointed you awfully , awfully ! You did idealize me ; I knew it when you married me , but I told you then I was n't worth your loving me , did n't I ? I never pretended to be worthy of you . I always knew I was n't . JOHN AUSTIN Hush ! JINNY It 's true ! it 's only too awfully true . But do you remember how you answered me then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JOHN AUSTIN Coldly and without looking at her . No . JINNY You took me in your arms and held me so I could n't have got away if I 'd wanted to  --  which I did n't  --  and stopped the words on my lips with your kisses . Her throat fills . He makes no reply . She goes on very pathetically . How I wish you 'd answer me that way now ! JOHN AUSTIN Whose fault is it ? p. 104 JINNY Oh , mine ! mine ! I know it . You do n't know it one-half so well as I ! I love you better than anything in the world , love everything of you  --  the turn of your head , the blessed touch of your hand , the smallest word that comes from your dear lips  --  the thoughts that your forehead hides , but which my heart guesses when I 'm sane ! And yet , try as hard as I can , these mad fits take hold of me , and although I 'd willingly die to save you pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you past all bearing ! It does n't make any difference that I suffer too ! I ought to ! I deserve to  --  you do n't ! Oh , no ! I know I 'm a disappointment and a failure ! Her eyes fill up with tears and her voice breaks . JOHN AUSTIN He turns to her . No , Jinny , not so bad as that , only I thought you were big  --  and you 're so little , oh , so small ! JINNY Yes , it 's true ; I 'm small  --  I 'm small ! Oh , I 'd like to be big , too ! I want to be noble and strong , but I 'm not  --  I 'm as weak as water  --  only it 's boiling water ! I want to be Brunhilde , and I 'm only Frou Frou ! Yes , I 'm little ; but I love you  --  I love you ! She sinks on to a stool beside him . A moment 's pause . With a trembling voice . You do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very quietly , he places his arm about her neck , his hand on her shoulder . She quickly steals up her hand to take his , and leaning her head over it , kisses his hand . He draws it away and kisses her hair . JINNY Timidly , very softly . You forgive me ? JOHN AUSTIN With a long sigh . Yes . JINNY Bursting into tears and burging her face upon his knees . Thank you  --  thank you  --  I know I do n't deserve it  --  I do n't deserve it  --  I do n't deserve it ! JOHN AUSTIN Softly . Sh !  --  JINNY. half turns and looks up at him . JINNY Very , very quietly . You forgive me  --  but still  --  yes , I see it in your face , you do n't love me the same . You look so tired , dear . JOHN AUSTIN Also very quietly . I am , Jinny . JINNY I wish I could make you so  --  make you love me the old way . You used to smile a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any more . But I mean to make you to-night , if I can , and to make you love me as much as ever you did . p. 106 JOHN AUSTIN Good luck , dear . JINNY Brightening . What time is it ? JOHN AUSTIN Looking at his watch . Nearly nine . JINNY I suppose it is too late for me to dress and for us to go to the theatre ? JOHN AUSTIN Oh , yes ,  --  and I 'm too tired . JINNY Triumphantly . Well , then , you shall have your theatre at home ! If Ma- homet wo n't go to the mountain , the mountain must go to your lordship ! JOHN AUSTIN I do n't understand ! JINNY Well , just wait  --  She blows her nose.  --  till I bathe my face and eyes a little ; I feel rather bleary ! Starting to go , she stops and turns . Good-by ? Questioningly . JOHN AUSTIN Quietly . Good-by . JINNY Who wanted him to call her to him and kiss her . Oh , very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of your own accord to-night  --  you 'll see ! She goes out Left . She is heard singing in her room . AUSTIN goes to the desk and after a long sigh he begins to write. p. 107 JOHN AUSTIN Writing . Dear Ruth . The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night . My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening , but please God you will bear it bravely . The man who loves you is not bad , but he has been weak . Hoever , I feel once he can shake off the burden of his present marriage , you will never have cause to complain of him again . And if your future happiness lies truly in his hands , it will be safe there . JINNY Calls from her room . Are you ready ? JOHN AUSTIN Yes . He stops writing . JINNY In your orchestra chair ? JOHN AUSTIN Yes . JINNY What will you have , tragedy or comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JINNY All right . JOHN AUSTIN Continues to write . So far I have been able to keep Jinny in absolute ignorance , but I fear the blow must fall upon her soon , and I dread to think of what she , too , will suffer . Help me to keep it from her as long as we can , wo n't you ? JINNY comes back ; she has changed her dress to a loose neglige gown , with a red turban on her head ; she brings two sheets . with her p. 108 JINNY Excuse me one minute while I set the stage ! moving toward each other the big armchair and the sofa , she covers them with the sheets . AUSTIN turns from his letter on the desk , to watch . Uncle Tom 's Cabin , Act Four ! She goes out only for a moment , and renters , wearing a man 's overcoat , with a pillow tied in the middle with a silk scarf , eyes , nose , and mouth made on it with a burnt match . Eliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow . Mammy 'll save you from de wicked white man ! Jumping up on the sofa , and moving with the springs . You ought to do the bloodhounds for me , Jack ! Excuse me , but you look the part ! AUSTIN watches her , not unamused , but without smiling . Hold tight to Lize , honey , and do n't be afeerd o ' dat big black man over dah  --  dat 's Uncle Tom . Crossing to the arm chair . Do n't be afeerd , honey ; it 's Lize dat 's cuttin ' de ice this time . She throws the pillow away and drags off the two sheets . Oh , I can see this is too serious for you ! She starts singing a cakewalk and dances across the room until she reaches him , where she finishes . JOHN AUSTIN Very good , Jinny ! I 'm sure we could n't have seen better at the theatre . p. 109 JINNY Ah ! You 're getting yourself again !  --  Darling ! Come !  --  Come !  --  come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in there ready ; I heard mother struggling with it . You do n't suppose she has designs upon the Casino , do you ? Now  --  ready ? He goes to the pianola and starts to play the sextette from " Florodora . " She runs to the opposite side of the room and begins to sing and dance , crossing to AUSTIN as he plays . JOHN AUSTIN After a few moments . But I ca n't see you and play at the same time ; I do n't like it ! JINNY Delighted . You want to see me , do you ? JOHN AUSTIN Of course I do ! JINNY Jack ! Delighted . Well , then , turn round ! JINNY , hurrying the time of the song , turns it into a regular skirt dance . She dances delightfully and AUSTIN can not resist her charm . His face lightens , he smiles , and love comes into his eyes . JINNY sees and dances and sings all the better till she reaches him . JOHN AUSTIN Rising , he takes her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack ! You 're smiling again and  --  you love me ! Clasping her arms about his neck. p. 110 JOHN AUSTIN Yes ! Is the theatre finished ? JINNY No , only the first act . He sits in the big armchair , JINNY on his knee . I 'm tired ! He kisses her . There is a pause . There is a knock on the door at Right . Oh , hang it ! Knock repeated . Do n't answer it ! We have n't half made up yet ! JOHN AUSTIN But we must answer it , dear . JINNY As she rises unwillingly . I do n't see why  --  I should have let her knock till she went away . JOHN AUSTIN Come in ! MAGGIE enters with a letter . JINNY What is it , Maggie ? MAGGIE A note from Miss Chester , ma 'm , and she 's downstairs herself waiting for an answer . JINNY For me ? Taking the letter . MAGGIE No , ma 'm ; I think she said it was for Mr. Austin . JINNY Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAGGIE Yes , ma 'm . She goes out. p. 111 JINNY Slowly goes to AUSTIN and gives him the letter , lightly . I see now why you were so anxious to let Maggie in . Perhaps you were expecting this . JOHN AUSTIN Jinny ! Holding her by the hand and trying to pull her over to him . Come , I 'll give you a kiss for the letter . JINNY No , thank you , I do n't want kisses that are given by you for letters from Ruth Chester . Yes ! do kiss me ! He kisses her . I wo n't be jealous ! I wo n't be ! Clinching her teeth . See , I 'm not jealous a bit ! Read your old letter ! AUSTIN opens the note and reads it . As he does so JINNY has passed on ot the desk and sees AUSTIN 'S unfinised letter to RUTH , which after a little hesitation she picks up and reads . AUSTIN , having read RUTH 's note , looks up thoughtfully a second , and then re-reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she finishes she gives a little cry from the very depths of her heart . JINNY Oh , Jack ! JOHN AUSTIN What is it ? JINNY Nothing ! She sinks by the desk , crushing the letter in her hand . She looks over at him , and then down at the letter , and then back at him. p. 112 JOHN AUSTIN Maggie ! JINNY Rising suddenly . She speaks with a voice trembling with only halfcontained emotion and passion . I told her to wait in the hall ; may I read it ? Holding out her hand for the letter . JOHN AUSTIN Now look here , Jinny ,  --  I always let you read everything , do n't I ? JINNY Hiding his letter behind her back . Yes . Holding out her other hand . Give it to me ! JOHN AUSTIN Now begin to show that you really are going to turn over a new leaf , and that your love is going to have perfect confidence , and do n't ask to see this letter . JINNY But I do ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse you ! JINNY What ! is it even more compromising than your letter to her ? JOHN AUSTIN What letter ? Looking first on the desk , he looks across at her and sees it in her hand . He is angry , but also frightened for fear it has told her her brother 's secret . And you 've read it ? JINNY It lay open on the desk there , and anyway the end justifies me ! p. 113 JOHN AUSTIN In an agony . What does it tell you ? I forget what I wrote ! JINNY It tells me that my jealousy all along has been right , that I 've been a fool to let you blind me ! JOHN AUSTIN With a great sigh of relief . Is that all ? JINNY Beside herself . " Is that all ! " Is n't that enough ? Dear God , is n't that enough ? That there 's an understanding between you and Ruth to get rid of me ! JOHN AUSTIN If it tells you that , the letter lies ! Give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Reads with bitter emphasis . " The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night ! " So  --  you and she went to Brooklyn , did you , and that 's why you came back too late to go to the theatre with me ? You cheat ! She screams in her madness . A pause . Why do n't you answer  --  why do n't you say something ? JOHN AUSTIN Because if I speak as I feel , I 'm afraid of saying something I 'll regret all my life ! JINNY You do n't deny , then ? p. 114 JOHN AUSTIN Yes ! that is due to Ruth . Whatever you may feel about me , you have no right to insult her ! JINNY Oh , there 's more to the letter ! JOHN AUSTIN Jinny , do n't you see what you 're doing ? JINNY Yes , I 'm getting at the truth at last ! Reads . " My heart aches for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves you  --  " JOHN AUSTIN You sha n't read any more ; you 're mad now ! Tearing the letter away from her . JINNY I do n't need the letter , the words are burning in here ! Pressing her hands to her forehead . " The man who loves you is n't bad , only weak . However , I feel once we can shake off the burden of this present marriage "  --  oh ! you  --  you brute to say that !  --  " you will never have cause to camplain of him again ! So far I have been able to keep Jinny in perfect ignorance , but I feel the blow must fall upon her now  --  " Interrupted . JOHN AUSTIN Shall I tell you the truth ? JINNY You do n't have to ; I 've found it out for myself ! JOHN AUSTIN In weariness , in disgust , in utter hopelessness . No ! what 's the use . You 've done it now  --  let it go ! Let it all go  --  the whole thing ! What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on the door at Right . Come in ! MAGGIE enters and closes the door behind her. p. 115 MAGGIE Please , sir , Miss Chester came upstairs and made me knock again to see if there was an answer and if you will see her now or not . JINNY Suddenly  --  aflame with her idea . Yes ! Maggie , show her in ! JOHN AUSTIN No , no ! What do you want to do ! I 'll see Miss Chester to-morrow , Maggie . JINNY has crossed to the door , Right . JINNY Ruth ! Ruth ! CHESTER Off stage . Yes ? May I come ? JINNY Do come in ! She recrosses room ; she and AUSTIN face each other for a second . JOHN AUSTIN In a lowered voice . For God 's sake , be careful ! RUTH enters Right . CHESTER Jinny ! Going to her quickly to embrace her . JINNY , without speaking , draws away and stares at her with a look of hatred . RUTH , seeing it , stops short , and looks from JINNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him her hand , which he takes , presses , and drops ; JINNY 'S shoulders contract at this moment ; RUTH immediately turns again to JINNY. p. 116 CHESTER What is it , Jinny ? To AUSTIN . Surely she does n't blame me in any way . JINNY Blame you ! JOHN AUSTIN She does n't know . JINNY That 's a lie ! I know everything , Ruth ! I know why you followed my husband to Rome , and why he sent for you to come back here . I know that you and he were in Brooklyn this afternoon , and that you only plan to get rid of me by some divorce , and by hook or crook to marry each other ! CHESTER No !  --  No !  --  JINNY Oh , you can lie , too , can you ? I wo n't keep you waiting long ! You 've stolen my husband from em  --  take him , I wo n't share him with any woman ! He 's yours now , and I 'll soon be out of your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be told the turth . AUSTIN bows his head . JINNY Now you 'll make up your story , will you ? I tell you it 's useless . If he would n't let me see your compromising letter , I 've seen a letter from him to you to-night that gives the whole thing away . CHESTER Very quietly . Your husband went to Brooklyn without me , as your brother will tell you , to see the clergyman who married me , or thought he married me to Geoffrey Tillman three months ago ! JINNY looks up with a start . That marriage was illegal because your brother was already married , and Mr. Austin tried and did get the promise of silence this afternoon about the Brooklyn service , to prevent a charge of bigamy against your brother . The first marriage , which still holds good , was with  --  Maggie , your present servant  --  JINNY stands immovable . There is a silence. p. 117 JOHN AUSTIN Geoffrey is not at your house ? CHESTER No , he left when I came on here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was too stunned by what he told me to answer then , and I wanted a word of advice with you . She turns to JINNY . I knew what I thought was my marriage to your brother must be kept secret , but I could not learn why . This was my trouble , which , after your marriage , I selfishly laid on your husband 's shoulders thinking he might help me ! No answer from JINNY , who stands as if struck dumb and into stone . Mr. Austin only learned the whole truth when we met that day in Rome . I did not learn till to-day that I was not honestly your brother 's wife . I had to be told , because divorce proceedings are to be started at once to break  --  the other  --  marriage . No answer from JINNY . To spare me , and above all to spare you the knowledge of your brother 's sin , your husband has kept Geoffrey 's secret from you . You have well repaid him ! She turns again to AUSTIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He 's tumbled so far off his pedestal he has fallen out of my heart . But still  --  we 'll see ; I 've told him to come to-morrow . Thank you from the bottom of my heart  --  it 's full of gratitude , even if it is broken ! She goes out Right . JINNY slowly turns , almost afraid to look at AUSTIN . He stands stern , with set face. p. 118 JINNY In a low voice , ashamed to go near him . Can you forgive me ? Can you  --  JOHN AUSTIN Ugh ! Crossing room for his coat . JINNY I 'm mad ! You know I do n't know what I do . But I love you  --  I love you ! Forgive me ! JOHN AUSTIN Never ! Taking up his coat . JINNY Where are you going ? JOHN AUSTIN Out of this house . JINNY If you leave me , I 'll not bear it ! I 'll kill myself ! I warn you ! JOHN AUSTIN Bah !  --  Good-by ! Going to the door Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN Out of this house for good ! At the door he turns and looks at her . JINNY Echoes . For good ? JOHN AUSTIN For good ! He goes out , slamming the door behind him . JINNY stands a moment motionless . She then cries faintly  --  " Jack ! " She goes to the door and pushes it open , crying out again in loud , strong despair , " Jack ! " There is a moment 's pause . She cries out again weakly , heartbrokenly , " Jack ! "  --  comes back into the room , and throwing herself down on the floor , her head resting on her arms in the armchair , she sobs hysterically , wildly , " What have I done ! Dear God , what have I done ! " as Dawn of the next day . At the rise of the curtain JINNY is by the open window , whose curtains she has thrown aside . The sky is blood-red and streaked with gold the moment before sunrise . JINNY is worn and haggard , with hair dishevelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last ! What a night  --  what a night  --  but now it 's morning and he has n't come back ! He means it ! And it 's my own fault  --  it 's my own fault ! She shivers . She closes the window and comes away . After a moment 's pause she goes deliberately and looks at the several gas fixtures in the room . She then closes all the doors and locks them . She carefully draws down the shade and closes in the curtains of the window . She hesitates , then pulls aside the curtains and the shade , and takes a long , last look at the dawn . She closes it all in again . She gets AUSTIN 'S picture from the desk and places it on the table near the centre of the room . She then goes to the gas bracket at the Right and turns on the gas . She lights it to see if the gas is all right ; then blows it out . She then crosses to the other bracket and turns that on ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting a chair , turns on its three jets . She then sits down by the table with AUSTIN 'S picture before her , and looking into its eyes , her elbows on the table , her head in her hands , she waits . Oh , Jack , my beloved ! I could n't help it  --  I never for one minute stopped loving you better than everything else in my life , but no more than I could stop loving you could I stop or help being jealous ! Once the cruel idea has got hold of me it seems to have to work its way out ! Everything gets red before me and I do n't seem to know what I say or do ! It 's no excuse , I know . I 've got no excuse , only I love you ! You 'll forgive me when I 'm gone , wo n't you , Jack ? You 'll know I loved you !  --  loved you so I could n't live without you !  --  loved you !  --  loved you ! She kisses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loved  --  you  --  loved you !  --  loved  --  Her head drops forward as p. 121 THE CURTAIN FALLS p. 122 Act 4 , Scene 2 SCENE II The same morning , three hours later . The curtain rises on the same scene in a doll , cold , early morning light . The lamp has burnt itself out . A tiny ray of sunlight steals through a slip between the curtains . JINNY sits by the table , her arms spread over it and her head on her arms  --  she is perfectly still . AUSTIN 'S picture is before her . There is a moment 's silence . Voices are heard outside , approaching door , at Right . Gradually what they say is distinguished . MAGGIE No , sir . She has n't been to bed ; I 've been to her bedroom  --  that door 's not unlocked . MR . TILLMAN She 's been here all night ? MAGGIE Yes , sir . But twice in the night , sir , I came to the door and spoke to her and she would n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and sometimes talking to herself . MR . TILLMAN Calls softly . Jinny ! Knocks softly . It 's father ! No answer . It looks as if she were asleep now . JOHN AUSTIN At a little distance . Father ! MR . TILLMAN I 'm outside the library door . p. 123 JOHN AUSTIN Nearer . I ca n't wait  --  have you seen her ? Will she see me ? MR . TILLMAN She 's locked herself in here . She 's not been to her own room . JOHN AUSTIN Not been to bed at all ! Poor Jinny  --  God forgive me . MR . TILLMAN Maggie says she 's walked the floor all night . He knocks on the door Right . JOHN AUSTIN Outside the door , Right , rather softly . Jinny ! I 'm so sorry ! I ca n't say how sorry ! I 've thought it out through the night , and I think I understand things better . He waits a moment for an answer . Jinny , answer me ! you shall be as jealous as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those doubts of yours , and I 'll have no more secrets from you , dear . Not one ! Jinny ! As he calls there is a slight movement of one of JINNY 'S arms . With a note of alarm . Father ! I ca n't hear a sound of breathing ! A moment 's pause as they listen . She threatened  --  she threatened it several times ! With great determination . We must get into this room  --  do you hear me  --  we must get in if we have to break the door down ! They shake the door . He calls a little louder . Jinny , Jinny darling  --  do you hear me ? JINNY makes a sort of feeble effort to lift her head , but fails . Jinny , for God 's sake , answer me ! I love you Jinny  --  Jinny ! Very slowly JINNY lifts her head and , with difficulty , she hears as if in a dream ; she is dazed , barely alive . She does n't answer ! p. 124 MR . TILLMAN See if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MR . TILLMAN Get the other keys , Maggie . JOHN AUSTIN Father ! Gas ! Do n't you smell it ? MR . TILLMAN What ! JOHN AUSTIN Gas , I tell you ! O God ! she 's killed herself ! Jinny ! Jinny ! Beating the door . JINNY staggers up , she tries to call " Jack "  --  but the word only comes out in a half-articulate whisper ! She tries again , but fails . MAGGIE Here 's a key , sir . JINNY tries to go to the door ; She staggers a few steps and then falls . They try one key  --  it does not unlock the door ; they try another . JINNY half raises herself and makes an effort to crawl , but is unable and sinks back upon the floor . JOHN AUSTIN Break the door in , father ! We dare n't waste any more time ! MR . TILLMAN No , this has done it ! They open the door and rush in . They stop aghast at JINNY and the oppressiveness of the gas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN AUSTIN Quick  --  the window ! TILLMAN tears aside the curtains and throws open the window . The sunshine of full morning pours in . He then rushes to the opposite gas burners and turns them off . JOHN AUSTIN Kneeling quickly beside her . Jinny ! My wife ! My beloved ! He takes her up in his arms and hurries to the window . MR . TILLMAN Are we too late ? JOHN AUSTIN I do n't know . No ! she 's breathing  --  and see  --  see !  --  she knows me !  --  she knows me ! JINNY smiles at him pathetically . Send Maggie for the doctor ! TILLMAN goes out Right . JOHN AUSTIN Jinny , forgive me ! Forgive me ! Forgive me ! She slips her two arms up and joins them about his neck . AUSTIN kisses her . Father ! We 've saved her ! Oh , thank God , we 've saved her ! Bringing her to big chair and putting her in it , he kneels at her feet . JINNY Whispers faintly . Dear Jack ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN There 's one thing stronger even than jealousy , my Jinny . And that 's LOVE ! That 's LOVE ! He kisses her hands , and
