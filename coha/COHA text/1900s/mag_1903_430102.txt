 |p510  Mr. Van Vorst in her book : , The Woman Who Toils , pronounces the girl who works from choice , when she might be supported by her parents , a snob , drawing the sweeping conclusion that she is prompted to effort " in her unmeasured vanity " by a desire to dress better , and to possess more luxuries than otherwise would be possible . Strangely enough President Roosevelt is sufficiently impressed by the lady 's argument to warmly indorse it , and to argue further that a nation has cause for alarm when its women do not recognize that life 's highest mission is " to be good wives and mothers " ; the girl who , works from choice being , by inference , a factor of weakness in our nation : What could be more astonishing than the statements and conclusions of these two thinkers and molders of public opinion ? Intelligent people have ceased to regard the horizon as the end of the world ; but the sense of measurement in man seems quite as rudimentary now as at any age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd for a chemist to judge of the final transparency of a fluid by its appearance during the process of agita tion and - combinings necessary to its production ! A turbid stage may be but a step of the process , without which final clearness would not be possible . Now here are President Roosevelt , strenuous above all men , and Airs Van Vorst , who needs must find an outlet for mental energy through her pen writing to condemn the girl who , caught in the same resistless current of the age 's overwhelming activity , but obeys the push within , as do they . Why is President Roosevelt strenuous ? I lc ca n't help it ! Why is Mrs Van Vorst thinking , inferring and expressing ? Because she must . It is preposterous to tall : of decadence in an age when every other man is an inventor , or the projector of startlingly evolutionarv ideas , commercial , professional , ethical , mechanical , or social ; when the citizen dominant in wealth , is not in idler or voluptuary but a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may chance to elect ; when the laborer is not a clod but a radiating center of independent , aggressive thought ; when one out of every ten or twenty citizens ( of both sexes ) " throws off " a book , sketch , play , song , essay or sermon , as the contribution of their leisure or recreation hours . NVIien President Roosevelt writes of " case-loving laziness " in this age , where does lie find it ? Even the pronounced pleasure seeker is a stratiger to ease and laziness , applying the sante dynamic energy to his ends as his neighbor devotes to serious pursuits . Apropos of luxuries that have spelled " decay , " effeminacy of the great , and oppression of this under strata , in nations ' histories , we might turn a flashlight upon our own age 's virility by trying to picture Mr Morgan or Air Rockefeller being carried in splendid litters to sumptuous baths for morning converse with intimates upon art , literature , the newest dish , or petty scandal , the populace gaping ( as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentlemen be jaundiced by impatience at the ease , luxury and deliberation of his progress ? And how the populace would guy him ( however common the spectacle ) and dispute his right of way  |p511  at every crossing ! His bearers would be union men with " rights " which would qualify his freedom in apportioning ; , his , time , , the baths would be moderately " slow , " and the themes indicated unspeakably dull for morning , hours . one is forced to admit that this is not an art age , that literature lacks great and shining lights , that the " higher repose " has fled but decadent wc are NOT . Our virility , on the contrary , is so all compassing that the very health of the individual and the nation is being brought to a higher standard , under straim which would have decimated the world a few hundred years ago . And the girl of to-day ! How can she sit idly at home employing herself with homely duties ( which she underrates , not understanding their significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from within to explore and test the range of her possible activities , and also to attain that inalien able birthright of every human soulindependence ' : And to her clementary development " independence " means the ability to buy her clothes and food . In reality it means but Poise-that poise which makes a mail or woman recognize inherent independence , which may find its expression ill the masterful discharge of any responsibility , whether it be the management of a home or the earning of some money . The girl of to-day is heir to ages of repression , and , awakened in this hour of general awakening , she rushes from her sheltered quiet life to-Become . She may perhaps think it is the desire for pretty clothes and other luxuries which draws her , but it is not . It is the age . It is the hour for her evolution . She is in swift process of " becoming . " Her efforts may be ill directed , her motives she may ; herself misinterpret-all these are side questions-but as well try to set the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor girl to the knitting of her stockings and ill ( , routine of household duties , when the big outside world is drawing both to explore and test it , each after her own manner . Today 's girl , in short , is enmeshed in Mr Roosevelt 's " strenuosity " ; but of the various steps to her " becoming , " there may not , perhaps , be even P , trace in the final outcome . And that outcome . Why , of course , it is fitness for the highest responsibilities laid upon human intelligence ; the rearing- of children , and , in the highest sense , the making of the home , . It is only too true that to-day 's woman can not be said to be inclined to domestic life , and the rearing of " large families . " Charged with the universal unrest , she feels she has not " the time , " that she would be engulfed by such sacrifice of her forces . But ignorance of the glory of her stupendous responsibilities will pass ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the " large family " of some future not the haphazard group of playthings for blind accident or destiny , but orderly beings , born in love , , reared in strength , developed in intelligence , to mastery of self and circumstance . In very truth , Mr Roosevelt , woman must go out to-day and battle in the world in order to find that it is not her place . I am glad I can not take so dark a view of the process of woman 's " becoming " as the authorities mentioned . The least observant must often remark how even the most frivolous of to-dav 's girls develop ( to the surprise of all who know them ) into excellent homemakers and the most devoted of wives and mothers , under the inspiration of love and responsibility . I doubt if a large proportion of the girls who , from choice , are partly selfsupporting entertain as a motive for their efforts the " desire for fine clothes . " Some , of course , frankly declare pleasant luxuries to be their object , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flimsy or serious the  |p512  pretext , the testing of powers , capacities and activities must be entered upon , and pursued to rightful conclusion , and it is the hight of unwisdom in the onlooker to mistake the process for either its prompting cause or its outcome . It were better to observe the process with calm philosophy , to condemn none of its phases , and to grasp the big conclusion -- this , after all , being God 's world , and none other's-that the final result must be according to the law of laws , Progress . THE intelligence of the whole country for weeks past has ; in effect , been knocking at the laboratory door of Dr H. W. Wiley , chief of the bureau of chemistry , United States department of agriculture , to inquire as to the results of the all important experiments in progress touching food preservatives . The messenger intrusted with such inquiries has , of course , been the newspaper man , who , following the first principle of his profession , " to satisfy , divert and convince , " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diverting ) , explicit , convincingly plausible . Such interest arresting heading , , ; as " Poison Squad 's Work , " " Effects of Dr Wiley 's Adulterants Noticeable , " " Physicians Called to Observe Poison Squad 's Changing Condition , to Insure Against Possible Catastrophe , " * etc , have formed part of the - menu of " important news " daily submitted to the public . It is my privilege at this writing to definitely ' state that each and all of the highly seasoned dishes in question were of " home manufacture , " Dr Wiley 's laboratory doors not having been once opened , not even wide enough for the merest peep . In answer to a request that something " absolutely authoritative be given to the readers of Good Housekeeping , " Dr Wiley writes : " You are quite right in supposing that the statements tnade in newspaper reports are wholly unauthorized . . . . The statement in the interview that the results are not to be given to the public yet , is correct . Dr - is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if our plans are carried out . It is our design to report on each substance as soon as the investigations are completed therewith . Thus the materials on which we are now experimenting will be reported to the secretary of agriculture as soon as we arc satisfied that the work has been pushed far enough to leave no doubt its to the results obtained , whether they be positive or negative . The fact that the people of the country have been so generally interested in this work is very encouraging to us , and shows that the results are quite certain to be of benefit to the people . " I will add that Dr Gudeman ( an eminent chemist and one of Dr Wiley 's personal friends ) , to whom the letter was shown , ventured the opinion that it would probably require two years for Dr Wiley to adequately cover the ground of thc experiments undertaken . Dr Gudeman expressed much pleasure in Dr Wiley 's intention to report on each - subslance " as soon as the investigations are completed therewith. - These reports will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture , which file overworked newspaper man will doubtless be prompt to give , in substance , to the public . It is probably unnecessary to explain that Dr Willey 's experiments , authorized by the department of agriculture , were undertaken to establish to our government and people an international point at issue , namely , whether the food preservatives now largely in use are hurtful or otherwise . The English government ordered in 1899 the most exhaustive experiments , of which the report , made public 111 Igol , is favorable to the use of at least one preservative , boracic acid . The experiments , less extensive , ordered by the German government , and reported in 1902 , were unqualifiedly adverse to boracic acid ; and the German food bill , which went into effect last October , provides that " no preservatives  |p513  of any kind be used in any food product . " That bill bars out American meats ; and though we can not hope that Dr Wiley 's findings will affect our exports , Germany 's food bill doubtless is in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which undoubtedly will at least have the good effect of untangling and unifying our conflicting state food laws . Dr Wiley 's investigations will cover more ground than those made by other governments , as not only preservatives will be . studied , but also all coloring matters used in the manufacture of food products . The subject of preservatives includes borax , boracic acid , salicylic acid and its compounds , formaldehyde , sulphurous acid and its salts , and saccharine . The " coloring " subject is too extensive for listing here . When one comprehends the import of such lists to the health of every citizen of the - United States , the investigations in progress become a matter for individual thankfulness . Incidentally , one feels like proposing life pension , ; for each " subject " lending himself to such scientific inquiry . " HERE COMES THE BRIDE !

" If you would escape the rude shocks common to the process of unveiling these several and a thousand other counts , discount the whole at the outset .

" As to the vows you are about to make : ' Love " Yes , you stand ready to fulfill that . ' Cherish ' ? That 's more  |p514  difficult , sir , since itreallv means to hold fast to your ideals , so that they remain ideals through all that expediency exacts .
