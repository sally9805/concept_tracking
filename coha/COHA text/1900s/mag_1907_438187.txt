UPoN the wall of the Atlantic office , among the portraits of former editors , there may be seen a fine open face , with striking eyes and a beard worn longer than is now the fashion . It is a fair likeness of Francis II . Underwood . the projector of the magazine . At least four years before the Atlantic came into being , he originated the plan , engaged the contributors , and but for the failure of a publisher would have enjoyed the full credit of the enterprise . When the magazine was finally launched , in 1857 , Underwood was still the initiating spirit . It was he who pleaded with the reluctant head of the firm of Phillips , Sampson and Co . As " our literary loan , " in Mr. Phillips 's comfortable proprietary phrase , he sat at the foot of the table among the guests at that well-known dinner where the project of the magazine was first made public . lie visited England to secure the services of the first British contributors . Recognizing that Lowell 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new venture , Underwood loyally accepted the position of " office editor , " as assistant to his more gifted friend . When the breaking up of the firm of Phillips , Sampson ; Ind Co. , in 1850 , threw the ownership of the magazine into the hands of Ticknor and Fields , Underwood went out of office , as did Lowell in due time . lie had thereafter a varied and honorable , although a somewhat disappointed career , which has already been sketched in this magazine by the sympathetic pen of , J. ' 1 ' . Trowbridge . A graceful writer , and a warm-hearted , enthusiastic associate of men more brilliant than himself , Underwood 's name is already shadowed by that forgetfulness which awaits the second-rate men of a " The Author of ( 214 ? 6bin , " January , 1895. 658generation rich in creative energy . For it must be admitted that his ability was not of the first order ; as the slang of the athlete has it , he never quite " made the team . " But he played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ; he became , in short , a model of the " scrub " player . The scrubs , as every one knows , get a good dinner at the end of the season , listen to the thanks of the coaches , and then are straightway forgotten . Underwood , however , gave alms to oblivion by several useful volumes , and by keeping an extraordinary scrap-book . ' In two huge leather-backed volumes are pasted hundreds upon hundreds of letters received during his forty years of correspondence with many of the foremost American and English writing men . There are a dozen or more from Lowell , many from Emerson , nearly forty front Holmes , and about fifty from Whittier . The letters are arranged alphabetically and run from Alcoa and Allibone to Robert C. Winthrop and Elizur Wright ; and in point of time they range from Richard Ii . Dana the elder , who helped found The North . American Review in 1815 , down to authors who are still struggling . Many of these letters throw light upon the unwritten history of the At-/antic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country during Underwood 's life . One of the earliest letters , for example , is from N. P. Willis , then a name of first rank in the literary profession . Underwood , who was born in Enfield , Massachusetts , ill 1825 , had left Amherst College without graduating , had gone to Kentucky , taught school , studied law , and married . Kindly loaned to me by its present owner , George P. Babbitt of Boston , But he yearned for a literary career , and sent specimens of his poetry to Mr. Willis , who was then in Washington . The veteran 's reply is interesting , and his bland phrase , " Your poetry is as good as Byron 's was at the same stage of progress , " betrays both a kind heart and a long editorial experience . WASHINGTON , April 29 , about 1848 AlY DEAR Sin , ? Your letter forwarded to inc here is just received , and I hasten to comply with your request , tho ' young poets ask advice very much as lovers do after they arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should always advise against adopting the literary profession , for at the best , it is like making waggon-traces of your hair ? wholly insufficient for wants which increase as the power gives way . Your poetry is as good as Byron 's was at the same stage of progress ? correct , : Ind evidently inspired , and capable of expansion into stuff for fame . But there sic many men of the same calibre who would go on , and starve up to the empty honor of being remembered ( first ) when dead , were it not that they could turn their more common powers to account , alai live by meaner industry . Poetry is an angel in your breast , and you had better not turn her out to be your maidof-all-work . As to writing for magazines , Thal. is very nearly done with as a matter of profit . The competition for notoriety alone gives the editors more than they , an use . You could not sell a piece of poetry now in America . The literary //venues are all overcrowded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drudge to a newspaper .

WILLIS . 11 , nderwood 's sojourn in Kentucky increased his native hatred of slavery , and upon his return to Massachusetts in 1860 he enlisted in the Free-Soil movement . In 1862 he was appointed Clerk of the State Senate , Henry Wilson being its President . his acquaintance with public men grew rapidly , and by 1863 , when he was but twenty-eight , he conceived the notion of a new magazine . Some such project had long been in the air , as is evident from the letters of Emerson , Alcott , and Lowell , but Underwood was the first to crystallize it . It was to be anti-slavery in politics , but was to draw for general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in interesting J. P.

In selecting some of the letters received in reply , the anti-slavery men shall be heard first . Wendell Phillips was dubious : ? LYNN , Aug. ' till . 1823 DEAR FRIEND , I have given your idea the best consideration in my power , and am obliged to come to a different conclusion from Messrs . May and Garrison . I believe the plan has been tried thrice within my time ( I mean my antislavery life ) and has each time failed .

The plait was to issue the first number early in January , 1854 , and the contributors , as Thoreau 's first letter indicates , were asked to send copy by December 5 . Thomas Wentworth Higginson , then a young minister in Worcester , has printed in his Old Cambridge the letters which he received from Underwood . The first one ran : BOSTON , November CI , 1883 . DEAR ? Messrs . J. P. Jewett and Co. of this city propose to establish a Literary and Anti-Slavery magazine ? commencing probably in January . The publishers have energy and capital , and will spare no pains to make the enterprise completely successful . They will endeavor to obtain contributions from the best writers , and will pay liberally for all they make use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , prominent as giving character to the Magazine , will occupy but a small portion of its pages .

I am desired to request you to become a contributor . If you are disposed to favor the project , and have anything written at this time , please forward the MS. with your reply . If not , please state whether we may expect to receive an article soon ? if before December 5th it will materially oblige us . If permitted , we shall announce you as a contributor , in the prospectus . The articles will all be anonymous , as in Patna nt 's Monthly . Your early attention is respectfully solicited . With high regard , Truly yours , FRANCIS II . UNDERWOOD . The scrap-book preserves Higginson 's reply ,  - -  -  a letter characterized by the prompt helpfulness which the successive editors of the Mantic have happily experienced for more than half a century . WoncEsTElt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear with great interest of the proposed magazine , though I have grown distrustful of such enterprises , especially when of Boston origin . The publishers you name are in a position to do it , if any are . I gladly contribute my name to the list of writers and may counsel I can ever give , when needed . As to the positive amount of literary aid to be expected from me , I must speak very cautiously . I am very much absorbed by necessary writing , speaking and studies , and it is hard to do collateral work ; I have been engaged sonic four months to write an article for the Christian . Examiner on Collier 's Shakespeare ; have all the books collected and yet have done about nothing and finally given up that undertaking . Besides , I have access to Putnam for anything of a literary character in prose and verse , a better paymaster , I suspect , than the new magazine can lie expected to be . To be sure , Putnam is not . reformatory ' , and I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect Mr. Jewett would be much more keen on the scent of any theological heresy , however latent , than the Editors of Putnam . But I know I shall have something , in time to offer , tho ' I have nothing now at hand  - -  -  nor can I before Dec. 5 . I by . hi mind especially an essay wh. will actually give a new aspect of the slavery subject ! ? called " The Romance of Slavery or American Feudalism , " grouping the points of analogy between Mediaeval slavery and southern . Of Hebrew and Roman slavery there has been an excess of discussion : of Mcdimval serfdom hardly anything is known and yet the analogy is more picturesque and more thorough . I read a lecture on this subject at Salem this winter , but it will not be in condition to print , for a mouth or two . It will be , in that time , unless I decide to keep it for a lecture . I lowever it is a new matter to me ( your magazine ) and these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express my good will and give my name , and partly to suggest some other names , as follows : Rev. D. A. Wasson of Groveland , minister of an Independent Church  --  a man of rare and growing intellect  --  author of several verses and a remarkable article on Lord Bacon in the New Englander . Miss Anne Whitney of Watertown , Mass. , author of two remarkable poems in Illy Thalalta ; I know of no American woman with so much poetical genius , now that Mrs. 11 . Lowell is gone . Miss Eliza Sprout of Philadelphia , author of the original and admirable " Stories for Children and Poets " in the National Era . But especially and above all , William Henry Hurlbut of Cambridge , Mass. , author of those brilliant letters fr . Cuba in National Era and of some fine articles ( a few years ago ) in N. A. ReVieW and Chr . Examiner . Be is a young man of the most versatile talent , great industry and ( except Theo . Parker ) the most universal scholar I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but understands // slavery thoroughly and is ( between ourselves ) the man to edit the magazine . I say this with the utmost delicacy of opinion ? not knowing whether you yourself are to be Financier or Agent or Editor of the concern . I suggest the names of these contributors , not for their sakes , but for that of the magazine to which they would all wove valuable auxiliaries . But perhaps vou think I have been quite too officious already . Cordially yours , T. W. Ihnoms03 . To this Underwood replied with the second of the letters printed in Old Cambridge : ? llosToN , November 25 , 1853 . MY DEAR SIR , ? Our Magazine is not vet definitely determined upon . Probably , however , it will he commenced . The letters I wrote for the enlistment of contributors have been mostly answered favorably . We have already a very respectable list engaged . We are waiting to hear definitely from Airs . Stowe , who we hope will be induced to commence in the Feb. no. a new story . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . I shall write to Mr. Hurlbut at once , and to the others in a day or two . Those who have already promised to write are Mr. Carter ( formerly of the Commonwealth ) who will furnish a political article for each number , Mr. Hildreth ( very much interested in the undertaking ) , Thos . W. Parsons , author of an excellent translation of Dante , Parke Godwin of the New York Evening Post , Mr. Ripley of the Tribune , Dr. Elder of Phila. , It D. Thoreau of Concord , Theodore Parker ( my most valued friend ) , Edmund Quincy , James R. Lowell ( from whom I have a most exquisite gem ) . Many to whom I have written have not replied as yet . I shall have the general supervision of the Magazine , ? intending to get the best aid from professed litterateurs in the several departments . We do expect to pay as much as Putnam ? that is at the rate of three dollars for such pages as Putnam 's , though it is probable that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary . Poetry , of course , we pay for according to value . There are not above six men in America ( known to me ) to whom I would pay anything for poetry . There is no medium ; it is good or it is good-for-nothing . Lowell I esteem most ; after him Whittier ( the last I confidently expect to secure ) . The first no. will probably lie late ? as late as Jan. 5 , or even nth . It is unavoidable . But in Feb. we shall get be fore the wind . Mr. Jewett will be liberal as to heresy . Indeed he is almost a heretic himself . For myself I am a member of Mr. Parker 's society ; but as we must get support moral and pecuniary from the whole community we shall strive to offend neither side . In haste , Most gratefully yours , FRANCIS II . UNDERWOOD . Whittier , who was on cordial terms with his publisher Jewett , writes with enthusiasm : Ausauav , 25 , 11 Mo .. 1853 . DEAR FRIEND ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will go : the time has conic for it and Jewett is the man for the hour . I will try and send something on or before the .5th . At any rate I shall be glad to write for it , if my health permits . Wilt thou say to Jewett that I thank him for his capital getting up of my " Sabbath Scene . " The illustrations are admirable ? the best of the kind I ever saw . They do great credit to the artist . Thine truly , J. G. WHITTIER . In view of his later relations with the magazine , I , owell 's letter  --  written on the same sheet as the manuscript poem which accompanied it ? is of peculiar interest . The allusion in the first para- graph is to the death of Mrs. Lowell , which had taken place a month earlier . The poem , which then bore the title " The Oriole 's Nest , " with its sad December " Palinode , " remained unpublished until Lowell himself , as editor of the Atlantic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , 1858 . It was not included in any volume of his verse until the publication of Heartsease and Rue in 1888 . MY DEAR Sm , ? I have made an effort for you , for I did not wish merely to say that I wished you well . This is an old poem , and perhaps it seems better to me than it deserves ? for an intense meaning has been added to it . I might promise you something for February if Mr. Jewett would like an expensive contributor so soon again . I have once had an essay upon Valentines in my head , and I could recreate it . It would suit that month . I should be very happy to see you sonic evening to talk over your undertaking . Meanwhile , thanking you heartily for the kind note which you wrote sonic time ago and wishing you every success , I remain heartily yours , J. It . L. B. lt . UNDEnwoon , Esq . 23rd Nov. , I85 : ; . I take it for granted that articles will be anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of biller disappointment . J. P. Jewett and Co. failed , and the magazine plans were abandoned . On the very clay when the copy for the January number was to be ready , Lowell is writing to Underwood : Elm w000 , 5th Der , 1853 . MY DEAlt Situ , ? I can not help writing a word to say how truly sorry I was to hear of the blowing-up of your magazine . But it is not so irreparable as if it had been a powder magazine , though perhaps all the harder to be borne because it was only in posse and not in case . The explosion of one of these castles in Spain sometimes sprinkles dust on all the rest of our lives , but I hope you are of better heart and will rather look upon the affair as a burning of your ships which only makes victory the more imperative . Although I could prove by a syllogism in barbara that you are no worse off than you were before , I know very well that you are , for if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse to lose hope , which is the mint in which most gold is manufactured . But , after all , is it a hopeless ease ? Consider yourself to be in the position of all the world before the Mansion of our Uncle Thomas ( as I suppose we must call it now ? it has grown so respectable ) was published , and never to have heard of this Mr. Jew-wit . I think he ought to be ? that something ought to be done to hint , but , for that matter , nearly all booksellers stand in the same condemnation . There are as good fish in that buccaneering sea of Bibliopoly as ever were caught , and if one of them have broken away from your harpoon , I hope the next may prove a downright Kraalten on whom , if needful , you can pitch your tent and live .

Whittier 's note , written the next day , wasted no words : ? AMESIWItY , WI 12 Ma , ISM . DvAn Stu , ? I regret the failure of the magazine project . I was quite sure of its success .

He was one of the leaders of that loosely organized group of ( liners who after 1857 used to meet under the name of the " Allanlin " or the " Magazine " Club , ? a gathering often confused with the Saturday Club , although Longfellow 's Journal and many other contemporary writings clearly make the distinction . The following letter from Professor Felton gives an agreeable picture of the cordiality which characterized the group of men who were so soon to become fellow contributors to the long-deferred magazine .

So , with thanks , and best wishes , Yours , IL W. Eu EICSON . ) Ir . Underwood now thought that the time Was ripe for bringing the magazine project to the front once more . Alr . Phillips was slow to take an interest in it , but finally agreed to consult M is . Harriet Beecher Stowe . Ile had published her Bred in 1858 , although he had previously rejected Uncle Tones Cabin through fear of alienating his Southern trade . Mrs. Stowe was instantly enthusiastic over the proposed magazine , and promised her support . It was this fact , as Underwood often said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher . Then came the famous dinner given by Mr. Phillips on May 5 , 1857 , to the men whose co8peration was thought to lie essential . Although Mr. Arthur Gilman 's article , printed in the present number of the Atlantic , describes this dinner , it may be interesting to quote Air . Phillips 's own letter about it , as given in Dr. Male 's . horses Russell Lowell and His Friends ( p. 1.57 ) . I May In , I8 ) 7. 1 " I must tell you about a little dinner-party I gave about two weeks ago . It would be proper , perhaps , to state that the origin of it was a desire to confer with my literary friends on a somewhat extensive literary project , the particulars of which I shall reserve until you come . But to the party : My invitations included only R. W. Emerson , Ii . W. Longfellow , J. R. Lowell , Mr. Motley ( the ' Dutch Republic ' man ) , 0 . W.

We sat clown at three r , NI. , and rose at eight . The time occupied was longer by about four hours and thirty minutes than I am in the habit of consuming in that kind of occupation , but it was the richest time intellectually by all odds that I have ever had . Leaving myself and ' literary man ' out of the group , I think you will agree with me that it would be difficult to duplicate that number of such conceded scholarship in the whole country besides . " Mr. Emerson took the first post of honor at nv right , and Mr. Longfellow the second at Illy left . The exact arrangement of the table was as follows : MR . UNDERWOOD Gunn ' IOTLEY HOLMES LONG I , EbLOW EMERSON Pruners " ' They seemed so well pleased that they adjourned , and invited me to meet them again to-morrow , when I shall meet the same persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that brilliant constellation of philosophical , poetical and historical talent . Each one is known alike on both sides of the Atlantic , and is read beyond the limits of the English language . Though all this is known to you , you will pardon me for intruding it upon you . But still I have the vanity to believe that you will think them the most natural thoughts in the world to me . Though I say it that should not , it was the proudest day of my life . " " In this letter , " continues Dr. Hale , " he does not tell of his own little speech , made at the launch . But at the time we all knew of it . Ile announced the plan of the magazine by saying , Mr. Cabot is much wiser than I am . Dr. Holmes can write funnier verses than I can . Mr. Motley can write history better than I. Mr. Emerson is a philosopher , and I am not . Mr. Lowell knows more of the old poets than I. ' But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows // the American people as well as I do . ' " Exactly what Underwood thought , as he listened to this self-satisfied speech of his employer , is not recorded in his scrapbook . Nor do the letters of the next few weeks throw any light upon the now familiar story of Lowell 's accepting the editorship of the new magazine upon the condition that Holmes should become a contributor , and of Hohnes 's suggestion that it should be christened " The Atlantic Monthly . " Who chose John Winthrop 's head as a design for the brown cover does not appear . Underwood , meanwhile , had sailed for England in June to secure contributors . He enjoyed his mission , and his scrapbook contains ' nifty hospitable notes from Charles Evade , Wilkie Collins , John Forster , A. II . Clough , and other English writers .

" Encouraged by promises of contributions , Underwood sailed for home , leaving the manuscripts to follow . Some of them , as Mr. Norton relates elsewhere in this number , disappeared forever with Mr. Norton 's unlucky trunk . A pleasant note from Shirley Brooks , of the staff of Punch , refers to the loss of his manuscript :  - -  The Garrick Club , LONDON , Oct. 28 , ' 57 . MY DEAR Slrt , ?

In the meantime pray consider that there is no pecuniary matter between us ? accept the intention to serve the new magazine ? and let us start fresh . Only , if you notice in any of the New York or other papers an article called " My Ghost , " do you lay hands on the pirate  --  the N. Y.

I ought perhaps to say that the romance is considered by one of my critical friends the best thing I have ever written . I can not judge of these things my-self , We have been long in reaching the actual first number of the Atlantic . The financial stress of 1857 harassed Messrs . Phillips , Sampson and Co. , and publication was nearly suspended , after all . But in October the first issue appeared , under date of November .

It is well known , also , that Lowell suggested to Whittier the peculiar form of the refrain which adds so greatly to the effectiveness of " Skipper Ireson 's Ride . " In Lowell 's Letters we read : ? CAN:moms , Novembor 1 , 1857 . My DEA n ? I thank you heartily for the ballad , which will go into the next number . I like it all the better for its provincialism ? in all fine pears , you know , we can taste the old pucker . I knew the story well . I am familiar with Marblehead and its dialect , and as the burthen is intentionally provincial , I have taken the liberty to print it in such a way as shall give the peculiar accent ? thus " Crip'n Ireson for his horril horrt Was toned and feathered and mulled in a eorrt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it "  --  only it began " Old Flud Ireson .

It will be in a great measure a labor of love to write for a magazine of so high a tone as the Atlantic . I have long felt the want of a channel in which to dace articles on which I might bestow labor and thought . Ilere in New York we are far too apt to neglect the higher aims . Will you permit me to express the great pleasure I have experienced in reading " Skipper Ireson 's Ride " in your last number . It abounds in lyrical fire , pathos and strength .

I sin sorry that the Atlantic did not put in its claim to being the father of the short story . Of course there were excellent short stories before the Atlantic was burn -- T'oe 's and Hawthorne 's ? but the magazine gave the short story a place which it had never before readied . It began with " The Diamond Lens " of Fitz-James O'Brien , and ended with ? well , it has not ended yet . " The praise elicited by the early numbers is fairly represented by this note from Henry Ward Beecher : Banos , v1i , Oct. 31 , ' 57 , MY DEAR The Atlantic has a good look robust and bold .

Although the authorship of the articles WIN supposed to be kept secret , a privately printed list of the authors in each number was soon sent out to newspaper reviewers Mill other friends of the magazine . It was not until the tenth volume , however , in 1862 , that an index of authors was printed at the completion of each volume . The first signed articles to appear were Harriet . Hosmer 's " Process of Sculpture " and Gold win Smith 's " England and America , " in December , 1864 . Occasional signed articles followed , such as William M. Rossetti 's in 1866 and George Eliot 's in May , 1870 , but it was not until July , 1870 , that signatures were regularly used . Inasmuch as the names of the more promilient contributors engaged were printed in the initial advertising pages , it was not difficult to guess the authorship of most of the articles . But even without this , discerning readers were at once aware of the singularly high quality of the new periodical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place , Marylebono Road , LONDON , December 2011o , 1557 .

I will never under any circumstances submit a MS. of mine to the chance of any other writer comprehending it and seeing its merit . If therefore that is an absolute condition , you will never see a line of mine in the Atlantic Monthly while I live . The stories you do publish in the Monthly could never have been selected by any judge competent to sit in judgment on me . We had better wait a little . You will find that every word of fiction I produce will succeed more or less ; this in a world crammed with feeble scribblers is a sufficient basis for treaty . As to the exact manner of success no man can pronounce on it before-hand . " White Lies " which you seem to think hiss failed has on the contrary been a greater success than " It is Never Too Late to Mend .

Whereas what passes for criticism here is too often a mere mixture of Cuck-oo and hce-haw . A set of conventional phrases turned not in English but in Norman French and the jargon of the schools . After five and twenty years of these rotten old cabbage stalks without a spark of thought , novelty or life among them , I turn my nose to such papers as your " Autocrat of the Breakfast Table " etc. with a sense of relief and freshness . . . .

Even the self-contained Emerson writes about the " luck which goes to a dinner " in anything but a transcendental vein : ? CONCOHD , SI Nov. 11857.1 DicAn Snt , ?

The editor 's portion of the article was indeed separated from the contributor 's by a blank line , and the article was of course unsigned . But Godwin was very angry , as his letter to poor Underwood , who had apparently attempted an ' explanation , will show : /slaw Yoaa , March 26 , ' 58 . MY DEAlt Mit . UNDERWOOD , ?

As this is the first expression of opinion that I have had from anybody , connected with the magazine , I ant glad to be enlightened . The deficiency imputed to them , or any other deficiency , would have been a good reason for suppressing them , altogether : but it is not a good reason for mutilating them ; nor does it justify any man in appending to them , without my knowledge or consent , several pages of his own remarks . These articles were written after careful survey of the whole field of discussion , ? from a pretty good knowledge of the state of public opinion ; and in view of the yet nascent tendencies of parties . They were addressed to the reason and good sense of the American people rather than to the feelings and prejudices of factions .

It seems that I have made a mistake : and that my considerate sentences are unsuited to the " fervid " atmosphere of Boston . Now , this is a mistake that I can not , because I will not correct . I have never yet written for mere factions or localities . I have studied the polities of this country many years , with an average degree of intelligence , I hope : with the sincerity of a patriot , I know : and also in the large and thoughtful spirit of philosophy .

I learn from your note that Mr. Lowell was the person who took upon himself to curtail my article , and then to substitute his own matter . For Mr. Lowell 's general poetic and literary abilities I have a high respect : but I have never heard of bins as a peculiarly competent political thinker or writer : and , however that may be , I must say frankly that I should prefer to put my writings beforethe public without his " improvements . " Under these circumstances I do not see how you can expect from me the promised article on the " Decadence of Democracy , " a part of what I reserved to say in that Mr. Lowell has anticipated , and the rest , I imagine , would be exposed to the same liabilities the former articles have been .

I should have liked it better if you had been more direct and frank in your method of communicating the fact ; but I certainly acquit you personally of an unkindness or unfriendliness in the premises .

In a sketch of Thomas Bailey Ald ? icli which the present writer prepared for the May ( 1907 ) Atlantic , there was printed a dignified letter from the young Aldrich to Underwood , // May 25 , 1858 , refusing to make some suggested changes in the rhymes of his poem " Blue Bells " and consequently withdrawing the verses . Further search in the scrap-book reveals the fact that it was Lowell himself who had desired the alteration , and who was now wondering what had become of the poem . But the Atlantic never saw it again ; although Aldrich ultimately adopted the editorial suggestion . 11858.1 MY DEAR UNDERWOOD ,  --  You will remember that I asked you to send the " Blue Bells " to Mr. Aldrich for an alteration in one of the stanzas .

One passage from a letter of Parkman attempts to explain why Underwood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Harvard man nor it hum-bug " ! 50 Chestnut St. , April 15 , 1875 . MY DEAR Mn . UNDERWOOD , ? . . . I wish that your connection with the Atlantic could have been continued long enough to give your literary powers and accomplishments a fair chance of just recognition . It is for the interest of us all that men like you should be rated for what they are worth . I farvard College and its social allies answer a very good purpose in defending us ? to some extent ? against the intellectual clap-trap and charlatanry which prosper so well throughout the country ; but those who are neither Harvard men nor humbugs may be said to be the victims of their own merit , having neither the prestige of the one nor the arts of the other . . . . With cordial regards , Very truly yours , F. PARKMAN . Occasionally a former contributor would write into a cordial note . One of these letters , from Bose Terry , inclosed a charming girlish photograph , ? the only photograph preserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18110 , My DEAR Mn . Usimaiwoop , ? Your letter of October 24th only reached me yesterday , and I ain afraid you have thought me very uncivil . I am very glad to have the opportunity of doing even so little a thing for you , to whom I owe so much kindness and consideration during our mutual engagements with the old Atlantic , which after all seems to me far better than the new I congratulate you on having " drifted " out of literature , it is " weariness to the flesh " turd small satisfaction to the spirit . The photograph I send you is one from a picture ( an ambrotype ) taken about the time when I first wrote for the Atlantic ; I send it because it is the prettiest one I ever had a feminine rea-son , but then I never was strong-minded . A picture now would be anything but pleasant , illness and anxiety for years are not beautifiers ! I hope at least the face may express to you all the good wishes I have for you and yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend even when its original has " gone over to the majority .

Of the letters of congratulation received upon Underwood 's appointment as United States Consul at Glasgow , in 1885 , Whittier 's is worth printing , as showing that he , like Motley , was under the impression that Underwood had been the Atlantic 's first editor ; ? HoLDERNEss , N. II. , 7th Mo . 27 , 1887 . My Dr , Au UNDERWOOD , - I have been away for some time trying to gain some strength from the hills , and have just seen a paragraph in the papers by which I am glad to learn of thy appointment as U. S. Consul at Glasgow . I am heartily rejoiced at it , and hasten to congratulate thee . President Cleveland has done a handsome thing in thus recognizing one of the " literary fellows " who had the honor of the first editorship of the Atlantic Monthly . I have been in Boston only once for the last year , and then only for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before thy departure for Glasgow , but that is not possible in my state of health . I must not leave here during this hot weather . I am glad our country and its literature is to be so well represented in the and of Burns and Scott . God bless thee and prosper thee ! Thy old friend , JOHN G. Wiirurtim . These later notes from Whittier refer to the biography upon which Underwood was engaged . They are vigorous , and very characteristic . AmEsuir8Y , ?

A mere mention of the fact that I have written in my first attempts a great deal of prose and rhyme which I would not now insult the reader by reproducing , is enough . And do not forget that I have lived a hard life outside of my verse making . I am a man and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIHMER . AlggSBURY , 1 Mo . 14. 1883 . ) DEAR F. IL UNDERWOOD , - ... see one of the chapters headed " Beginnings of Fame . " t I do n't think at the time mentioned the word Fame is applicable . It is safe to say that there are now in the United States ten thousand boys and girls who can write better verses than mine at their age . The single fact is that my first scribblings are very poor and commonplace . Thine truly , JoHN G. WHEITIE12 . AsQuAm , II01.1wits888 , N. II. , 7 Mo . 21 , 1883 . DEAR FRIEND , - I am grateful for thy generous estimate of my writings in " Characteristics , " but I fear the critics will not agree with thee . Why not anticipate them , and own up to faults and limitations which everybody sees , and none more clearly than myself . Touch upon my false rhymes and Yankeeisms : confess that I sometimes " crack the voice of melody and break the legs of time .

Endorse Low-ell 's " Fable for Critics " that I mistake occasionally simple excitement for in- spiratMn . In this way we can take the wind out of the sails of ill-natured cavillers . I am not one of the master singers and do n't pose as one . By the grace of God I ant only what I am , and do n't wish to pass for more . I return the sheets , with this note . Think of my suggestions and act upon them if it seems best to thee . Always thy friend , Join/ G. Witrernot . A MI.75117111 ' , I Ai. 20 , 18S-1 .

I see no use in setting all the literary ghouls to digging for something I have written in my first attempts at rhyme . I detest the whole of it . .. . Ever and truly thy friend , JOHN G. WHITIThlt . Underwood 's experiences in Great Britain , both at Glasgow and later at Edinburgh , ? where he was Consul during Cleveland 's second adtnitlistration , ? have already been touched upon by Mr. Trowbridge , Between the two consulships he wrote a novel , Quabbin , in which he described from that benign distance his native town . He received many social honors during his residence abroad , and the degree of LL.D . was conferred mum him by the University of Glasgow . Ile made friends , as always and everywhere , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some letters inquiring into the value of certain American securities . To name these securities now might invoke the Comic Spirit . Underwood never came home to that world which had more or less grown away from him . He died at Edinburgh in 1894 . Versatile in gifts and genial in spirit , he was associated , as we have seen , with some of the best men ' of his day , but lie himself never quite " arrived . " There were Celts of old time who " always went forth to the fight , but they always fell . " One likes them none the worse for that . During the Civil War , Underwood 's fertile brain devised a curious project , which had no other result , apparently , than the creation of one more remarkable autograph for his scrap-book . He wished to start a saw-mill in Florida . Every magazine editor , its is well known , has his moments of keen desire to be running a sawmill somewhere . But Underwood picked out an actual spot , then under occupation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , setting forth the benefits to the nation which would accrue from the said saw-mill through the promotion of emigration to Florida . Here is the very document , thrown carelessly into the scrap-book , endorsed by leading citizens of Boston , with Ex-Governor Boutwell at the head , by Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson , Senators from Massachusetts , by Major General Gillmorc , then at Hilton Head , and by the President of the United States : ? I fully approve , subject Rol the discretion and control of the Commanding General . Mcrch 50 , ISGI . A. LINCOLN . A saw-mill in Florida ! What a castle in Spain , for this editor who was never the Editor !
