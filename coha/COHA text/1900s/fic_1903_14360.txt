SCENE .  --  Sitting  --  room of the home of the NEEDEYS , showing dull colors , sad pictures , dry  --  looking books about . MISS FELICIA NEEDEY is seated , weeping . She is thin , spectacled , severely dressed . She holds a large book marked " Milton . " MISS ROSALIE NEEDEY is reclining , asleep in an easy chair . She has a plump figure , clad in a lounging wrapper , her hair is in curl-papers , and in her lap are some fashion papers . ( ROSALIE wakes . ) ROSALIE What 's the matter , Felicia ? FELICIA This . ( - holds up book ) ROSALIE Only a book ! I think it is ridiculous the way you go on about books . What is affecting you now ? FELICIA I 'm reading " II Penseroso . " It 's so sad . ( boo  --  hoos violently ) ROSALIE ( yawning ) Did Sally say'what was going to be for lunch ? FELICIA ( still crying ) I think she said " fried oysters , " but just listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hail divinest Melancholy ! " Ah ! Milton knew exactly how I feel . p. 3 ROSALIE ( looking over fashion papers ) Excuse me , Felicia ; since Sally is going to have the dressmaker today , I might as well consult her about my new gown . I 've got to have something to wear to the performance of " The Rivals " by the Amateur Dramatio Society . They wanted me to take a part . ( laughs and yawns ) Too much like work . Sally is to be Mrs. Malaprop . Did you know that , Felicia ? FELICIA ( scornfully ) Mrs. Malaprop ! Oh , yes , I know . I wish I could interest Sally in higher literature . ROSALIE Well , it 's lucky that Sally is n't always buried in doleful books , like you , or who would look after the house , now that mother is away ? I have n't the energy . But if grandfather is better , mother will be coming home soon now . FELICIA Mother 's letter said he was better , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROSALIE Oh , I ca n't find any pattern that pleases me . I 'll get Sally to design something . ( settles down for another nap ) FELICIA Where did you say Sally went ? ROSALIE To engage a dressmaker to make her , costumes for Mrs. Malaprop. p. 4 FELICIA Such frivolity ! ( Postman 's whistle , knock at the door , maid brings in letter to FELICIA . ) FELICIA From Tarrytown ! Rosalie , wake up . Here 's a letter from mother . ROSALIE ( sits up ) Is she coming home ? FELICIA ( reads ) " Dear Girls :  --  Here is a piece of news for you . You are about to receive a visit from your rich Aunt Merry  --  Mrs. Muntoburn . Probably none of you remember her , as she has lived in California since you were little girls . I regret very much that your grandfather is not well enough for me to come home yet , and you will have to receive her without me . Of course , I am anxious that all my daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , I know ; especially when I tell you that your aunt intends to invite one of you to accompany her on a trip to Europe . She will decide which one when she has made your acquaintance.Your aunt 's chief characteristic is the love of a joke . Nothing delights her more than life and high spirits and hearty laughter , but she hates a long face . See to it now , Felicia , that you do not bore her with humdrum conversation ; Rosalie , that you shake off your indolence ; and Sally , that you are not too busy with your theatrical performance to bestow every attention on , your aunt from California Yours lovingly , Mother . " p. 5 FELICIA A trip to Europe ! Oh , think of visiting the grave of Browning , the tomb of Shakespeare , and the church-yard that Gray wrote his elegy in . ROSALIE A trip to Europe ! With my rich Aunt Muntoburn ! toburn ! Luxurious steamers ! Best hotels ! Elegant menus ! Paris fashions ! And escape from all kinds of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . FELICIA Oh , that she would take me ! ROSALIE What was it mother said about her tastes ? ( Both seize letter and mutter " fond of fun , " " hates long face , " etc . ) FELICIA Oh , here 's a postscript ,  --  " Your aunt will arrive on Friday , the 16th , about 11 A.M. Good gracious ! This morning ! ROSALIE It 's ten o'clock now . ( They walk apart in thought . ) FELICIA ( to herself ) I believe it is wise for me to stoop my intelligence to the study of pleasing my aunt . What method shall I pursue ? ROSALIE ( to herself ) If there is anything worth exerting myself for , it is a trip to Europe . How to set about it ! FELICIA A thought occurs ! The furnishing of this room , dictated by my cultured taste , would not , I fear , appeal to a jovial person ( exit ) p. 6 ROSALIE Felicia wo n't stand a chance . Those books of hers will betray her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just leave a few open at the title page . By the way , that gives me an idea . ( exit with hat ) ( Enter FELICIA , arms full of gay sofa pillows , comic statuette , bright posters , etc . ) FELICIA I procured these from Sally 's room . I can just mention to aunt that I put them here . ( Enter ROSALIE , with roll of papers . ) ROSALIE Ho ! Those wo n't do you any good . Sally will say they 're hers . Now , I just slipped to the corner newsstand and bought these . ( unrolls comic weeklies ) I 'll write may name on each , and they 'll make a contrast to yours on the center table . FELICIA Oh , no . Mine are going to be temporarily out of sight . ( hides her books under the table , replaces them with some of SALLY 'S ) ROSALIE Felicia , would you say I had a hearty laugh ? FELICIA I do n't know . Let me hear you laugh . ROSALIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful ! Let 's hear you Felicia. p. 7 FELICIA I ca n't laugh at absolutely nothing . ROSALIE Well , I 'll read you a joke , then . Here 's a short one . ( reads from comic paper ) A Scotchman met an Irishman and accosted him with " Hoot , mon ! " to which Pat replied , " Go on wid yes . D'yes take me for an owl ? ( Both laugh weakly , the sound dies away , and they groan together , as SALLY enters with bundle . ) SALLY Girls , I 've got a fine rig for Mrs. Malaprop  --  ( stares in amazement ) What in the world ! FELICIA AND ROSALIE ( alternately ) Oh , Sally ! Who do you think is coming this very morning ? Our aunt from California ! Mrs. Merry Muntoburn ! We fixed up these things to try and please her ? Mamma writes that she 's a humorist . Hates a long face . Dotes on jokes and high spirits . SALLY ( stares at them ) Ha ! ha ! ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't be able to laugh like that when you hear all that depends on it . FELICIA No , she is going to take one of us to Europe . She wishes to make our acquaintance , so as to decide which pleases her best . SALLY A trip to Europe ! Oh , I 've been dying to go ever since I visited the midway at the Pan-American . Oh , fun alive ! But , of course , she wo n't take me . Plain Sally will stand no chance beside the cultured Felicia or the fashionable Rosalie. ( courtesies to FELICIA and gives ROSALIE a hug ) But , let me see the letter ( reads ) " ' m  --  ' m  --  ' m  --  And Sally , see that you are not too busy over your theatrical performance to bestow every attention on your aunt . " Oh , goodness ! And I have so much to do to-day . The dressmaker is coming . p. 8 ROSALIE Why did n't you get something ready-made at the costumers and save yourself trouble ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's lovely , too . But it does n't quite fit , and the dressmaker is coming to alter it . I 'll show you . ( starts to undo bundle ) FELICIA Sally , I beg of you , do n't undo that now . What dressmaker did you yet , Mrs. Flim ? SALLY No , Mrs. Flim could n't come herself , but she said she would send one of her assistants around as soon as possible . FELICIA Go back at once and countermand that order . It wo n't do to have a dressmaker cluttering up the place when we are entertaining our aunt from California . SALLY Well , I 'll do that , sister . But , say ! I want to ask you , Felicia , if you will lend me your lorgnette , and you , Rosalie , if you will lend me your brooch and your jeweled fan to complete my costume as Mrs. Malaprop . I wo n't hurt them a mite . Please say yes . FELICIA Impossible , Sally , I ca n't spare it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fan ! No , indeed . They are both too valuable . SALLY Oh , dear ! I wanted them so . But , mercy ! I must take some time to-day to rehearse the part of Mrs. Malaprop . Felicia , it wants a half-hour yet to eleven . Wo n't you please hear me rehearse my lines ? p. 9 FELICIA I really ca n't , Sally . I 'm too busy . ( exit , studying comic paper ) SALLY Rosalie , wo n't you ? ROSALIE With only a half-hour to get dressed ? You 'll have to excuse me. ( exit ) SALLY ( ruefully ) I suppose I can be rehearsing to myself on the way to the dressmakers. ( takes up hat ) ( Knock on door . Maid presents telegram . ) What 's this ? A telegram ! To the Misses Needey . Hope nothing 's happened to mother ! ( reads ) Here 's a joke . " Visit postponed . Do not expect me . Mrs. Merry Muntoburn . " And the girls have taken all this trouble for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have to put off the dressmaking then . Let 's see what needs doing . ( undoes bundle and holds up things ) This goes here , and this here . Wonder how I 'll look . I do n't believe anyone will know me . Say ! How would it be to make up now and try and pass off on the girls as Aunt Merry ? I wonder if I could ! They have refused every time to look at my costume or hear me rehearse . I 'll try it . It will be a huge joke on my sisters if they do n't know me. ( puts on disguise ) It will be good practice for me , too , in preparation for Mrs. Malaprop . Now , I 'm ready . ( Enter FELICIA , carrying lorgnette. ) p. 10 FELICIA Sally , if you do n't hurry off to that dressmaker 's  --  Oh , I beg your pardon . SALLY I presume I have the pleasure of addressing one of the Misses Needey ? Behold in me Mrs. Muntoburn . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I was coming ? FELICIA Oh , is this Aunt Merry ? Yes , certainly she did . How do you do ? The maid did not announce you . You are very welcome , I 'm sure . SALLY Just turn about so as to face the light , my dear , and see if I can recognize you from your photograph . No , I think not . You are Rosalie ? FELICIA No , I 'm Felicia . ( Enter ROSALIE , dressed up with brooch conspicuous on breast . Not seeing SALLY . ) ROSALIE Oh , how I dread the visit of this awful aunt ! FELICIA ( horrified ) Rosalie ! Here is Aunt Merry . ROSALIE ( stammering ) Oh  --  how do you do , Aunt Merry ? SALLY You 'll have to speak louder , my dear . I have n't heard a word you said . I do not always hear with the perspicuity of younger ears . Observe , young ladies , I do not say I am deaf , but merely that an occasional sentence , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROSALIE ( aside ) Lucky escape ! I thought my chance of seeing Europe was " extinct . " ( aloud ) You do n't know how we 've been looking forward to your coming , Aunt Merry . FELICIA We 've heardthat you are such a joker . Humor is what I particularly admire . ROSALIE And so do I. SALLY I am by no means a humorist myself . But in youth I always commend plenty of hilarity and vivisection . But do not misreprehend me . There is a decorum in these matters I would on no account have a young woman continually divulging herself in piebald laughter and loud halloo-cinations . But that she should have a natural , copious fund of merriment is imminently fitting Where is the other young woman , Sally ? FELICIA She was obliged to transact some business with the dressmaker this morning . But she 'll be right back . SALLY I am told that she looks like me . Does she ? ROSALIE Yes , I think she does , a good deal . SALLY Ahem ! Is she good-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , not very good-looking compared to you , Aunt Merry . SALLY Well , I must say I am not flattered  --  by her absence this morning on a trumpery dressmaking errand when she had every reason to prognosticate my coming ( tosses her head and unsettles her wig , tries in vain to adjust it securely ) After my journey , my coiffure seems to be a little deranged. p. 12 FELICIA Would n't you like to step up-stairs and have the conveniences of my toilet table ? ROSALIE Oh , use mine , Aunt Merry . ( exit all ) ( Maid ushers in Mrs. MERRY MUNTOBURN . ) MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Just say a lady to see the Misses Needey. ( exit maid ) No one in readiness to receive me . I have taken them by surprise after all , as sure as my name is Merry Muntoburn . I was provoked this morning to receive a letter from their mother , saying that in spite of my express injunction to the contrary , she had written to apprise them of my visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted me to see them wearing their best company manners . I wanted to take them unawares . And evidently , thanks to my foxy little telegram , I am to have my way . I think I will try for a while to prevent their knowing who I am . It will give me a better opportunity to judge of their real characters before selecting a companion for my European trip . And I do so enjoy a little intrigue . ( Enter SALLY , in haste , going toward the sewing basket . ) SALLY I had hard work to slip away from them . If I do n't get this fixed  --  ( sees MRS . M. ) Oh , you are the dressmaker sent by Mrs. Flim , are n't you ? p. 13 MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN I just came . SALLY Well , here , just take a stitch or two in my dress . It is ripping on account of being too small . See ? MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) Who in the world can this be ? I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Are any of the Misses Needey at home ? SALLY Oh , yes , they 're all home . I mean , no . That is two of them are . I know it was Miss Sally Needey who engaged you . But she 's out . She 'll be right back . You just do this for me quickly . It 'll be all right . I 'm her aunt , her rich aunt from California , Mrs. Merry Muntoburn . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN W-ha-a-at ? SALLY Yes , I 'm on here to size ' em up . I 'm going to take my pick of them for a trip to Europe . ( laughs ) MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN You are ! ( drops scissors in amazement ) SALLY ( aside ) Wonder if she knows me . I have never set eyes on her before . ( aloud ) You seem disturbed . Is anything the matter , I 'd like to know ? MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( starting to repair dress ) Oh , no . Nothing at all . ( aside ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fathom this . ( Enter FELICIA and ROSALIE. ) p. 14 ROSALIE Oh , here you are , Aunt Merry ? FELICIA We did n't know where you were . ( MRS . M. starts forward to respond , but perceives that that they address SALLY . ) SALLY My gown ripped , and I came for the sewing basket , but your dressmaker kindly repaired the rent . FELICIA Dressmaker ?  --  Oh  --   --  ( sees MRS . M. ) Why , Miss Sally has just gone to see you to make other arrangements . I do n't know how you missed her . But you 'll probably miss her again if you return now . She will surely hurry back to meet Aunt Merry . Perhaps you had better just sit down and wait until Miss Sally comes . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Thank you , I will . ( aside ) And keep an eye on that outrageous impostor . SALLY I see there is a proficiency of books about here . ( picks up gaily-bound volumes and reads from backs ) " Mark Twain " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Slang . " FELICIA I 'm responsible for the presence of those delightful works , Aunt Merry . SALLY Very proper . All the Muntoburns are devoted to that kind of reading . ( MRS . M. opens her eyes ) But do n't I see some other books partially congealed by the table cover ? ( takes big book from under table ) p. 15 FELICIA ( aside ) Oh , my most precious volume ! SALLY ( reads from fly-leaf ) " Felicia K. Needey . " What book is this , Felicia ? FELICIA It is a book of daily readings entitled , " Selected Extracts from Browning , Macaulay , Blackstone , and Herbert Spencer . " SALLY What ! Shocking ! Such reading does not become a young woman . I fear you are over-educated . I 'm not . I do n't believe in it . None of the Muntoburns ever went to school after they were ten . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN On the contrary  --  hem  --  hem  --  hem ! SALLY Who prescribes for these comic papers ? ROSALIE Those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Merry . SALLY Eh ? What 's that ? You do n't care for work ? Then just step up-stairs and get me a lozenge if you please . And kindly move with more celebrity or I may cough before you return back . ( Exit ROSALIE . ) Dr. Muntoburn often says , " Merry , be careful not to cough , as you are very pliable to jar your diagram . " ( turns suddenly and catches FELICIA fondling " Selected Extracts . " ) Felicia , will you kindly put that book out of sight . I have a perfect anticipation against it . They say it was just such a book as that that was thrown at an ancestor of the Muntoburns by an angry schoolmaster . It hit him right on the frontal globe of the antibellum , and that is why ever since the Muntoburns have all been born cross-eyed. p. 16 MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) Well , of all things ! FELICIA I have heard that the Muntoburn ancestry can boast many brave and gallant soldiers . SALLY Far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man once called your uncle " Colonel " Muntoburn . Your uncle sued him for definition of character . Please do not again connect the name of Muntoburn with vulgar clanking soldiers . None of the family ever went to war except one , and he was grafted . ( SALLY 'S yarns about the MUNTOBURN family produce a lively effect on MRS . M. ) FELICIA ( aside ) I am unfortunate in every attempt to please her . ( Enter ROSALIE , breathless . Gives SALLY lozenge : About to take easy chair , is forestalled by SALLY . ) SALLY ( with slight motion to rise ) You were n't going to take this chair , were you ? ROSALIE Oh , no . SALLY ( smiling on ROSALIE ) I like to see a young woman so sprightly and active . Activity is a prominent trait in the Muntoburn family . My mother-in-law , Mrs. Lot Muntoburn , though over ninety , never descends the stairs except by sliding down the banisters. p. 17 MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) I can hardly control my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must know many amusing stories . Can you commemorate one to tell me now ? FELICIA Oh , I know a very amusing anecdote , aunt . SALLY Let 's have it . Nothing would please me better . The Muntoburns are collaborated for their sense of humor . FELICIA It was an incident in which a Scotchman encountered an Irishman , and the Scotchman uttered the national phrase , " Hoot , mon , " and the Irishman responded by asking if he ( the Scotchman ) was expecting him ( the Irishman ) to give an imitation of the familiar cry of an owl . ( pause ) SALLY ( with polite interest ) And then what did the Scotchman say ? FELICIA Oh  --  that 's all  --  or  --  you see  --  the Irishman understood him to have reference to an owl . SALLY It 's not at all surprising that he did . No one expects an Irishman to reprehend the localisms of Scottish determinology . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) And that 's the Muntoburn 's sense of humor ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? ( takes up comic paper ) I think there must be more to it .  --  Oh , I can hardly read this print . I left my reading glasses in the train . Just give me that lorgnette of yours , Felicia , lorgnettes do not become a young woman . FELICIA You 're welcome to it , Aunt Merry . SALLY ( using lorgnette ) Ah , this is better , ( aside , mimicking FELICIA ) " Impossible , Sally , I ca n't spare it . " Oh , this is rich ! I 'll get the brooch and fan , too . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) That lorgnette is an article of value ! SALLY ( reads ) Hum  --  Yes , it is as you told it .  --  My neck-gear here will not stay in place . Just give me that brooch , Rosalie . You do n't need it there . This wearing of brooches at one side where they serve no unitarian purpose does not become a young woman . Thank you , I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth fifty dollars ! That woman is a thief ! I see it all . Having heard in some way that I was coming , she effected entrance here by impersonating me . Oh , what shall I do ? p. 19 SALLY Let me see this music here . Oh ,  --  coon songs . How does this one go ? ROSALIE I do n't know , Aunt Merry . ( maliciously ) Felicia put them there . SALLY ( with approving smile at FELICIA ) That shows a healthy , youthful taste . The Muntoburns often rise at five o'clock in the morning to sing coon songs . FELICIA Yes , I dote upon them . They are so enlivening . SALLY Well , sing one for me . FELICIA Oh , please excuse  --  SALLY Tut  --  tut ! Do n't infect modesty . A Muntoburn abhors stimulated intimidation . ROSALIE ( aside to FELICIA ) Think of Europe , Felicia . Better try it . ( aside ) I know Felicia ca n't do it . FELICIA ( aside ) I have heard Sally sing it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begin at once . As a member of the Muntoburn family , instant compliance is what I 'm accomplished to . FELICIA Very well , I 'll try . ( sings ) p. 20 SALLY ( aside , covertly laughing ) Oh , think of getting Felicia to sing a coon song ! ( interrupts ) Louder ! Louder ! ( FELICIA sings louder ) Rosalie , come girl , get up and dance to that chorus . ROSALIE Dance ! Oh , I do n't know how . SALLY I 'll teach you . Stand by me. ( dances a few grotesque steps ) Do that . ( ROSALIE tries ) Jump more . Jump higher , Rosalie . ROSALIE ( stopping , exhausted ) I ca n't dance any more . I 'm not used to dancing that way . SALLY Why not , I 'd like to know . That is the proper way . The Muntoburns are leaders in California society . They all dance that way . The higher you jump , the more fashionable you are considered . Many a time I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanticleer . And though I do n't wish to boast , it is a common saying in San Francisco 's upper circles that Mrs. Merry Muntoburn dances like a kangaroo . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Indeed ! ( girls look at her in surprise ) SALLY Oh , I 'm warm , Rosalie , did n't you have a jewelled fan up-stairs ? Run and get it . ( ROSALIE exit , and returns with fan , which she puts on the table . Knock at the door . FELICIA opens . Enter MISS WILCOXNGIBS. ) p. 21 MISS WILCOXNGIBS Is Miss Sally Needey here ? She engaged a dressmaker from Mrs. Film 's establishment to sew for her this morning . FELICIA We know that she did . The dressmaker is here . ( indicating MRS . M. ) MISS WILCOXNGIBS I 'm the dressmaker . Mrs. Flim just sent me around . She could n't spare me any earlier . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) , What shall I do ? If I say who I am now , I fear they wo n't believe me. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and would engage two of us . SALLY Oh , no ! I never  --  can believe a niece of mine would be so extravagant . ( aside ) I do n't understand this . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside to MISS W. , giving her money ) Back me up . It 's all right . Only a joke . MISS WILCOXNGIBS Oh , yes , I remember now . Miss Sally was at the office twice . The first time she engaged this lady , and then she came back and engaged me also in addition . ROSALIE Why , that ca n't be ! She went back a second time to countermand her first order , and arrange to have her work done at Mrs. Film's. p. 22 SALLY ( aside ) That second girl is lying . The first has acted suspiciously from the beginning . What if they are sneak thieves ! They are evidently in league . I 'll keep my eye upon them till they leave . FELICIA We expect Miss Sally back every minute . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know Sally never engaged two dressmakers just to alter that costume . We had better send them back . Otherwise they will perhaps expect Sally to pay for their wasted time . FELICIA ( to MRS . M. and MISS W. ) Ladies , there is some mistake , I know . You had better not wait . I take all responsibility in the matter . MISS WILCOXNGIBS Very well . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( aside ) What shall I do ? I ca n't leave those unsuspecting girls at the mercy of that bold swindler. ( aloud ) I think I ought to wait . Miss Sally 's last words to me were , " If I should not be at home , do n't fail to wait till I come . " SALLY ( aside ) Oh , I said nothing of the sort ! She 's a burglar ! I know she 's a burglar ! p. 23 FELICIA ( to MRS . M. ) That may be , but I am Miss Needey , and I request you not to wait . MRS . MERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  aside ) I 'll fly for a policeman . My only fear is she may escape while I 'm gone , with that brooch on . ( sees jewelled fan on the table ) She sha n't take this anyhow . ( slips fan into her muff ) SALLY ( pouncing on her ) Thieves , thieves ! Put that back ! I knew they were thieves ! I just saw this one take your fan , Rosalie . She has it in her muff . ( forces MRS . M. to disclose fan ) MISS WILCOXNGIBS Oh , I 'm no thief ! I had nothing to do with it . She gave me this five dollars when I came in , to back her up in pretending she was from Mrs. Flim 's , too . I thought it was some joke . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Girls , listen to me ! She 's the thief . ( pointing to SALLY ) I 'm not a thief  --  SALLY Oh , no , of course not , with that fan in her muff . FELICIA I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Listen a moment ! She 's not your aunt at all  --  ( Enter MRS . NEEDEY. ) p. 24 ROSALIE AND FELICIA Mother ! FELICIA Oh , mother , we 've caught a thief here ! MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Sister ! This woman is a burglar ! SALLY This woman just tried to rob us . MRS . NEEDEY Why , Sister Merry ! What does this mean ? Who is this ? ( MRS . M. , struggling to free herself , knocks off SALLY 'S wing . ) SALLY ! ! ! What are you doing to your Aunt Merry ? MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN Sally ! SALLY Aunt Merry ! ROSALIE AND FELICIA Sally ! Aunt Merry ! MRS . NEEDEY Your grandfather recovered so fast that I was able to come home in time , thank goodness , to prevent your haling your aunt to the police station . Sally , are you at the bottom of this ? SALLY I thought Aunt Merry was n't coming , so I dressed up just for a trick on the girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressmaker ! SALLY And I took her for a thief . MRS . NEEDEY Well , you had better ask her pardon . p. 25 ROSALIE We beg you to forgive us , Aunt Merry . FELICIA We would n't for the world have treated you with discourtesy . MRS . MERRY MUNTOBURN ( starting to laugh ) Well , I certainly appreciate the pains you were at to gratify my tastes . ( sternly ) But , as for Miss Sally ! ( looks at crestfallen SALLY and gives way to laughter )
