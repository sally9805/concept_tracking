txt Mr. Justice BREWER of the United States Supreme Court is distinctly the " brightest " member of the . tribunal which his membership adorns . He never talks without saying something , and he exudes ideas , in a highly " ( ) biter " way , which attract attention even when they most urgently invite refutation . Of course to say that he is the bright , est man on.that bench is by no means to say that he is the strongest Judge . Perhaps even the contrary . Amusing or interesting paradox is a prime factor in an eligible companion , but no factor at all in the composition of an authoritative layer-down of the law . A Judge with so many notions may well seem to be a creature much too bright and good for human nature 's daily food . However , the latest extra judicial appearance of this extra judicial jurist is. in the address he has just been delivering at the commencement of Vassar , in the course of which he advanced the startling proposition that nobody could be sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was addressing had.turned gray " a woman like Queen VICTORIA should not sit in the White House to glorify this Nation as VICTORIA glorified England . " The learned Judge makes it clear by the context that the woman in question ? is not to sit in the White House as the wife of the President , but as herself the President . This sentiment , at a female college , deserves the applause with which it appears that it was received . deleted 3 lines Nobody can really look forward to the election of a female Chief ' Magistrate of the United States by 1935 . Queen VICTORIA ' herself would have stood no chance at any time of being elected to direct the affairs of the ' British Empire . There were in her time . a dozen or more persons so elected , from the Earl of MELBOURNE to the Marquis of SALISBURY . It may be true , as Judge BREWER suggests , that female suffrage implies fe male office holding . But the demand for female suffrage , among women who could exercise it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation ago . It is true that some counterpoise may be needed , as Judge BREWER further suggests , to the flood of immigration which is coming In , no longer alone from the countries of Western Europe , whose natives we have found politically assimilable to ourselves , but , as another observer ha/ put it , " from Armenia and Cappadocia and those places that are mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. ? But the counterpoise that is most likely to be brought Into ' play is not the enfranchisement of native women , on terms which the female Armenians and Cappadocians would be able to meet as readily as the males , but the disfranchisement , or the more deliberate and cautious enfranchisement , of the male Armenians and Cappadocians , even though this should entail a delay in the naturalization of much more valuable material for American citizenship . Upon the whole , the most amiable view to take of Judge BREWER 'S address at Vassar is that its author did not attach to it a very serious importance .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
