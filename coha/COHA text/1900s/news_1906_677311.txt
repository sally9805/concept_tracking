txt WASHINGTON . June 14 . ? President Roosevelt to-day attended the eighty-ninth annual commencement of Georgetown College , conferred the degrees and prizes awarded , and delivered a brief address to the students who were graduated . Secretary of the Navy Charles J. Bonaparte was also present . The President , in his address , said : " It is a real pleasure to be here in this ancient , historic Institution of learning to-day . Georgetown is just one year older than the Constitution of the United States . It was founded here by Archbishop Carroll , himself bearing one of the great historic names of the Revolution , and from President Washington down , every President , with the exception of two , has come here to greet you . Ws.stington was presented with an address of welcome by one of the students , whose children , grandchildren , and now a great-grandchild , have since come here . That boy of Washington 's time is now represented here by his descendant in the fourth generation " I have only one or two things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this institution I know that while you lay the full stress you ought to lay upon learning , upon the training of the intellect , yet you appreciate that even more important than intellect is character ; that while your intelligence is going to be a great factor  --  you boys who graduate to-day ? In your success , yet that it IS your character which will be an even greater factor in the success of each of you , and which will be the all important ' factor in deciding whether that suceees shall be a service to your countrymen or not .  --  You might gain the kind of personal triumph winch some people would consider a success and yet - which would merely make you a curse to your countrymen . We must depend upon the development of your individual characters to see that such is not the case , and that when you triumph for yourselves you triumph also in ways that redound to the advantage of the country at large . " I never believe in preaching an Impossibly high ideal , because I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ideal is merely a thing to be spoken about , writen about , talked about In conventional fashion ; that it is some= thing entirely different and apart from conduct . Your ideals do you no good unless you measurably realize the min your conduct . No institution of learning should fail to make its pupils understand that their conduct under the strain and stress of life is the measure of their success , in applying of the ideals that have been held up to them . " Of course it is unnecessary to say that you who graduate from an institution such as this bear a peculiarly heavy burden of moral obligation . To you much has been ' given . You enter life with privileges denied to most of your fellows ; and therefore we have a right to expect from you a peculiar measure of service to society , to the State , in return . " Of course the first duty of each of you is to earn his own livelihood . You will not find it too easy , either . Your first business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have helped put you through , or who have entirely put you through this institution of learning . That is your first duty . I do not want you to go out so intent upon reforming the world that you are quite unable to keep your own heads above water . Remember that your power of doing good to others is conditioned upon your not being a burden to others . " First be able to hold your own in the world . But if you make that be the all and end-all of your existence , better never come to a university like this at all . Treat it merely as laying the foundation of your life , and upon that foundation of self-help , of self-service , raise the lofty structure of service for your fellows , of service to the State , of service to the community as a whole . " Remember , each of you younger men here , ( what I think the older men do not need to be told , ) that the chance for heroic endeavor of a rather spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really counts in this life is not the man who thinks how well he could do some bit of heroism if the chance arose , but the man who actually does the humdrum . workaday , everyday duties as those duties arise . The very first thing to no is to do your duty in the family , in the home . It is a happy coincidence that your commencement comes on Flag Day , when we pay especial honor to the symbol Of our National existence . Georgetown . I which has sent its proportion of soldiers to the country whenever the country called for it , must remember that duty just as high can ho done in time of peace as in time of war . We have plenty of evil to combat in this Republic , and the success of the fight that we wage against it is going in large part to depend upon the attitude taken by the graduates of our universities . whose training should peculiarly help them to leadership in such a fight . " Nova just one word in connection with that fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not attack the poor man who is dishonest or the rich man who is dishonest as a member of a class : attack him simply because he is dishonest . Wage war relentlessly on every man of wealth who does what is wrong . Attack in every way the iniquity of the corporation which commits iniquity . But remember , you men of education . you men of college training . YOU to whom we have a right to look for leadership in the generation now taking up its burdens , that you do the greatest possible wrong if you train people to an obliqueness of vision which shall make them condemn wealth instead of condemning crooked wealth , which shall make them fail to see the real test is honesty as against dishonesty . " Condemn the rich man who corrupts a Legislature : condemn equally the demagogue who seeks to incite one set of our citizens against another because that other is in the material things of this ' world more fortunately off . The wealthy corruptionist and the sour demagogue who 1 denounces all wealth represent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under different conditions . The arrogance of the man of wealth who disreboltshis obligations to the country , who looks down upon and disregards his poorer brother . is not a different feeling from , it is the same feeling as . the envy , hatred , malice . felt by a man of mean and jealous temper who lacks means for the MO , ? e ? fortunate man who has means . " The selfish arrogance and the envious hatred are not different qualities ; they are simply the two sides of the same foul shield . You can rest assured that the poor man who thus envies and hates the rich man , the arrogant rich man who looks down upon and disregards his duty toward the poor man . would each commit the faults of the other if fortune placed him in the position of the other . " I was much pleased to-day not only to be able to give degrees , but to give prizes , in at least one case . to students who had evidently been able to develop a thoroughly sound mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I believe in them chiefly because of the moral qualities that they display . I am glad to see the man able to keep his nerve in a close baseball game , able to keep his courage under the punishment of a foot . ball game , or in a four-mile boat race , because if the boy really amounts to anything and has got the right stuff in him , this means that he is going to keep his nerve and courage in more important things in after life . " if your prowess is due simply to the possession of big muscles it does not amount to much . What counts is the . ability to back up the muscles with the right spirit . If you have the pluck , the grit in you to count in sports , just as if you have the pluck and grit in you to count in your studies . so in both cases it will help you to count in after life . " You will not need to show in after life the identical traits of intellect or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you will need to show the character , the qualities of heart and soul , which enabled you in college to make valuable your intellect or your bodily prowess . " When you come out into after life t can say no more than to wish you to copy the motto which should be the motto of every boy who plays on a college eleven ; ' Do n't flinch , do n't foul , and hit the line hard . ' "
