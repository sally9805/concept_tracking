 | THE history of the growth of the drama is one of the most fascinating chapters in the record of the spiritual life of the race . So closely is it bound up with that life that the unfolding of this art appears , wherever one looks deeply into it , as a vital rather than a purely artistic process . That art has ever been conceived as the product of anything less rich and deep than an unfolding of life shows how far we have been separated by historic conditions from any first-hand contact with it , any Beepgoing and adequate conception of what it is , and what it means in the life of the race . It requires a great effort of the imagination to put ourselves into the attitude of those early men who had the passions and were doing the work of men , but who had the fresh and responsive imagination of childhood ; who were so closely in touch with nature that the whole world was alive to them in every sight and sound . Personification was not only natural but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its knowledge . Such a race would first create and then devoutly believe the story of Dionysus : the wandering god , master of all the resources of vitality ; buoyant , enthralling , mysterious , intoxicating ; in whom the rising passion , the deep instinct for freedom which the spring let loose in every imagination found visible embodiment ; the personification of the ebbing and rising tide of life in Nature , and , therefore , the symbol of the spontaneous and inspirational element in life ; the personification of the mysterious force of reproduction , and therefore the symbol of passion and license . The god was entirely real ; everybody knew that a group of Tyrrhenian sailors had seized him as he sat on a rock on the seashore , bound him with withes , and carried him to the deck of their tiny piratical craft ; and everybody knew also that the withes had fallen from him , that streams of wine ran over the ship , vines climbed the mast and hung from the yards , garlands were twined about the oars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then suddenly a lion stood among the sailors , who sprang overboard and were changed into dolphins ; while the god , taking on his natural form , ran the ship into port . Such a being , appealing alike to the imagination and the passions , personifying the most beautiful mysteries and giving form to the wildest longings of the body and the mind , could not be worshiped save by rites and ceremonies which were essentially dramatic . The seed-time and harvest festivals furnished natural occasions for such a  | worship ; the worshipers often wore goatskins to counterfeit the Satyrs , and so gave tragedy its name . Grouped about rude altars , in a rude chorus , they told the story of the god 's wanderings and adventures , not with words only , but with gesture , dance , and music . The expression of thought and feeling was free from selfconsciousness , and was like a mirror of the emotions of the worshiper . This ballad-dance , which Mr. Moulton describes as a kind of literary protoplasm because several literary forms were implicit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free , spontaneous , natural act of worship ; it was also a genuine drama , which unfolded by easy gradations into a noble literary form . The frequent repetition of the story threw its dramatic element into more striking relief : the narrative gradually detached itself from the choral parts and fell to individual singers ; these singers separated themselves from the chorus and gave their parts increasing dramatic quality and distinctness ; until , by a process of rude and almost unconscious evolution , the story was acted instead of narrated , and the dramatic poet , when he arrived , found all the materials for a complete drama ready to his hand . It is sober history , therefore , and not mere figurative speech , that the drama was born at the foot of the altar . And more than eighteen hundred years later the drama was born again at the foot of the altar . Whatever invisible streams of tradition may have flowed from the days of a declining theater at Rome through the confused and largely recordless life of the early Middle Ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the ancient drama had begun , in the development of worship along dramatic lines . In the history of fairy tales and folk-lore , the explanation of striking similarities between the old and the new is to be sought , probably , in the laws of the mind rather than in the direct transmission of forms or materials . When spiritual and intellectual conditions are repeated , the action or expression of the mind affected by them is likely to be repeated . In every age men of a certain temperament dramatize their own experience whenever they essay to describe it , and dramatize whatever material comes to their hand for the purpose of entertaining others . The instinct which prompts men of this temper to make a story of every happening by selecting the most striking incidents , rearranging them . and heightening the effect by skillful grouping , has made some kind of drama inevitable in every age . When the influence of Menander , modified and adapted to Roman taste by Terence , Plautus , and their successors , was exhausted , farces , with music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the general need with the coarse fun which suited a time of declining taste and decaying culture . The indecency and vulgarity of these purely popular shows became more pronounced as the Roman populace sank in intelligence and virtue ; the vigor which redeemed in part their early license gave place to the grossest personalities and the cheapest tricks and feats of skill . The mimes , or players , carried this degenerate drama into the provinces , where taste was even less exacting than in Rome , and the half-heathen world was entertained by cheap imitations of the worst amusements of the Capital . At a still later date , in market-places , on village greens , in castle yards , and even at Courts , strolling players recited , postured , sang , danced , played musical instruments , and broke up the monotony of life at a time when means of communication were few , . slow , and expensive . It is difficult for modern men to realize in imagination the isolation of small communities and of great castles in the Middle Ages . The strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because he brought the air of the remote world with him . The vulgarity and indecency of shows of such an origin , everywhere adapting themselves to popular taste at a time when popular taste was coarse to the last degree , was not surprising . Then . as now , society had the kind of entertainment for which it asked ; then , as now , the players were bent on pleasing the people . The Church , having other ends in view , tried to purify the general taste by purifying the amusements of the people , and in the fifth century the players of various kinds ? mimes , histriones , joculatores ? were under formal ecclesiastical condemnation . The Church not only condemned the players ; she excluded them from her sacraments.  | players continued to perform in the face of ecclesiastical disapproval , and they found audiences ; for the dramatic instinct lies deep in men , and the only way to shut out vulgar and indecent plays is to replace them by plays of a better quality . The play persists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a once noble art came into England after the Norman Conquest , and the players became , not only the entertainers of the people , but the story-tellers and reporters of the period . They made the monotony of life more bearable . How much indirect influence this humble and turbid stream of dramatic activity may have had on the development of the English drama can not be determined ; the chief influence in the making of that drama came from the Church . The Church condemned the manifestation of the dramatic instinct , but it did not fall into the later error of condemning the instinct itself ; on the contrary , it was quick to recognize and utilize that instinct . It had long appealed to the dramatic instinct in its worshipers ; for the Mass is a dramatization of certain fundamental ideas generally held throughout Christendom for many centuries . From the sixth century the Mass was the supreme act of worship throughout western Europe . " In the wide demensions which in course of time the Mass assumed , " says Hagenbach , " there lies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , idea . A dramatic progression is perceptible in all the symbolic processes , from the appearance of the celebrant priest at the altar and the confession of sins , to the Kyrie Eleison , and from this to the grand doxology , after which the priest turns with the Dominus vobiscum to the congregation , calling upon it to pray . Next , we listen to the reading of the Epistle and the Gospel . Between the two actions or acts , intervenes the Graduale ( a chant ) , during which the deacon ascends the lectorium . With the Halleltiia concludes the first act ; and then ensues the Mass in a more special sense , which begins with the recitation of the Creed . Then again a Dominus vobiscum and a prayer , followed by the offertory and , accompanied by the further ceremonies , the Consecration . The change of substance ? the mystery of mysteries ? takes place amid the adoration of the congregation and the prayer for the quick and the dead ; then , after the touching chant of the Agnus Dei , ensues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanksgiving , the salutation of peace , and the benediction . " In the impressive and beautiful liturgy of the Mass the dramatization of the central mystery of the Christian faith was effected by action , by pantomime , and by music . There was no purpose to be  | dramatic ; there was the natural evolution of the instinct to set forth a truth too great and mysterious to be contained in words by symbols , which are not only more inclusive than words but which satisfy the imagination , and by action . The Church did not stop with a dramatic presentation of the sublimest of dramatic episodes , the vicarious death of Christ ; it went further and set forth the fact and the truth of certain striking and significant scenes in the New Testament . As early as the fifth century these scenes were reproduced in the churches in living pictures , with music . In this manner the people not only heard the story of the Adoration of the Magi and of the Marriage of Cana. but saw the story in tableaux . In course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it was but a logical step to the representation dramatically , by the priests before the alter , of the striking or significant events in the life of Christ . Worshipers were approached through everyavenue of expression : the churches in which they sat were nobly symbolical in structure ; the windows were ablaze with Scriptural story ; altar-pieces , statues , carvings , and pictures continually spoke to them in a language of searching beauty . In some churches the priests read from rolls upon which , as they were unfolded toward the congregation , picture after picture came to view . Christmas , Good Friday and Easter services inevitably took on dramatic forms , and became beautiful in their reproduction of the touching and tender scenes in the life of Christ , and gruesome in their literal picturing of his suffering and death . The dramatic instinct had been long at work in the development of worship ; a play on the Passion , ascribed to Gregory of Nazianzen , dated back to the fourth century . This early drama is a succession of monologues , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth centuries . There was nothing forced or artificial in the growth of this later and more complete drama ; a description of a Durham Good Friday service makes us see the easy progression toward well-defined drama : " Within the church of Durham , upon Good Friday , there was a marvellous solemn service , in which service time , after the Passion was sung , two of the eldest monks took a goodly large crucifix all of gold , of the semblance of our Saviour Christ , nailed upon the Cross . . . . The service being ended , the said two monks carried the Cross to the Sepulchre with great reverence ( which Sepulchre was set up that morning on the north side of the choir , nigh unto the High Altar , before the service time ) , and then did lay it within the said Sepulchre with great devotion . " It is easy to follow the dramatic development of such a theme , and to understand how beautiful and impressive worship became when the divine tragedy was not only sung and described , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the drama was born a second time at the foot of the altar . But the time came when the drama parted company with the liturgy , and , as in its development in Greece , took on a life of its own . The vernacular was substituted for Latin ; laymen took parts of increasing importance ; the place of representation was changed from the church to the space outside the church ; the liturgical yielded to the dramatic ; humor , and even broad farce , were introduced ; the several streams of dramatic tradition which had come down from an earlier time were merged in the fully developed Mystery or Miracle play . The trade guilds had become centers of organized enterprise in the towns , and the presentation of plays , in which popular religious and social interest was now concentrated , fell into their hands . Cities like York , Chester , and Coventry fostered the growing art with enthusiasm and generosity . By the beginning of the fifteenth century the presentation of the dramas was thoroughly systematized . In some places the Mayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places special messengers or heralds made the round of the city and gave public notice . The different guilds undertook the presentation of different acts or scenes . Two-story wagons took the place of the stage in front of the church or in the square ; on these wagons , or pageants , as they were called , the rude dressing-rooms were on the lower and the stage on the upper story . These movable theaters , starting from the church , passed through all the principal streets , and , at important points , the actors went through their parts  | in the presence of throngs of eager spectators in the windows , galleries , doorways , squares , and upon temporary scaffolds . The plays were in series and required several days for presentation , and the town made the occasion one of general and hilarious holiday . On the pageants , handsomely decorated , the spectators saw acted scenes with which they had been made familiar by every kind of teaching . The drama in the Garden of Eden was presented with uncompromising realism , Adam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great and effective part , furnishing endless amusement by his buffoonery , but always going in the end to his own place . Pilate and Herod divided popular attention by their semi-humorous or melodramatic roles , and Noah 's wife afforded an opportunity for the play of monotonous and very obvious masculine wit on the faults and frailty of woman , The construction of these semi-sacred dramas , dealing with high or picturesque events and incidents in Biblical story , was rude ; the mixture of the sacred and the comic so complete that the two are constantly merged ; the frankness of speech and the obscenity almost incredible to modern taste . It would be a great mistake , however , to interpret either the intermingling of the tragic and the comic or the grossness of speech as indicating general corruption ; they indicate an undeveloped rather than a corrupt society . The English people were morally sound , but they were coarse in habit and speech , after the manner of the time . There was as much honest and sober living as to-day ; the grossness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men and women saw , without any consciousness of irreverence or incongruity , the figure of Deity enthroned on a movable stage , with Cherubim gathered about Him , creating the world with the aid of images of birds and beasts , with branches plucked from trees , and with lanterns such as were carried about the streets at night . Religion was not a department or partial expression of life ; it was inclusive of the whole range of feeling and action . It embraced humor as readily as it embraced the most serious conviction and the most elevated emotion . It was , therefore , entirely congruous with the deepest piety of the time that grotesque figures , Monstrous gargoyles , broadly humorous carvings on miserere stalls , should be part of the structure of those vast cathedrals which are the most sublime expressions in art of the religious life of the race . To read into the grossness and indecency of expression of the fifteenth century the moral significance which such an expression would have in the nineteenth century is not only to do a grave injustice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound historic sense . The great dramatists who followed these early unknown playwrights understood that the humorous can not be separated from the tragic without violating the facts of life ; and religion , in its later expressions , would have been saved from many absurdities and much destructive narrowness if the men who spoke for it had not so strangely misunderstood and rejected one of the greatest qualities of the human spirit ? that quality of humor which , above all others , keeps human nature sane and sound . To the Mysteries and Miracle plays succeeded the Moralities . Whether these later and less dramatic plays were developed out of the earlier dramatic forms is uncertain ; that they were largely modeled along lines already well defined is apparently well established . No line of sharp division as regards time , theme , or manner can be drawn between the two ; although certain broad differences are evident at a glance . The mediaeval mind dealt largely with types , and only secondarily with individuals ; and the break in the slow and unconscious progression from the type to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of the modern mind but of modern art , is not inexplicable . The characters in the Mysteries and Miracle plays were received directly or indirectly from Biblical sources ; in the Moralities there was , apparently , an attempt to create new figures . These figures were more abstract and far less human than their immediate predecessors in the pageants , but they may have had the value of a halting and uncertain attempt to create instead of reproduce . The first result was , apparently , a retrogression from the dramatic idea : the earlier plays had shown some skill in the development of character ; in the Moralities the stage was surrendered to the per- sonifications of abstract virtues . In place of a very real Devil , reveling in grotesque humor , and an equally real Herod , who gave free play to the melodramatic element so dear to the uncultivated in every age , appeared these very tenuous and shadowy abstractions the World , the Flesh , the Devil , not as actors in the world 's tragedy , but as personifications of the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Perseverance , and the Seven Deadly Sins . These prolix and monotonous plays cover a wide range of subjects , from the widely popular " Everyman , " which deals , not without dignity , with the supreme experience of death , to " Wyt and Science , " which doubtless , on many a school stage , set forth the charms of knowledge , and presented one of the earliest pleas for athletics . The Moralities beguiled the darkest period in the literary history of England ; the tide of the first dramatic energy had gone out , the tide of the second and greater dramatic movement had not set in . There  | were freedom , spontaneity , fresh feeling , poetic imagery , in the ballads ; but the Moralities were mechanical , rigid , labored , and uninspired . The Moralities marked , however , one important step in the development of the English drama ; they created opportunities for professional actors , and made acting as a profession possible . The earlier plays had been in the hands of amateurs ; men who had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were members of guilds , with other and different occupations . Side by side with the Mystery and Miracle plays there had percolated through the long period when the English drama was in the making many kinds of shows , more or less coarse and full of buffoonery , in the hands of roving pantomimists , singers , comedians ? a class without habitation , standing , or character . Now these wandering performers , many of them doubtless men of genuine gifts cast upon an unpropitious time , found place in companies supported by noblemen and attached to great houses , or in companies which presented plays in various parts of the country in the courts of inns and , on great occasions , in large towns and cities . For all classes dearly loved the bravery , excitement , and diver sion of the pageant , the masque , and the play of every kind . The parts were entirely in the hands of men ; no woman appeared on the stage until after the time of Shakespeare ; the female characters were taken by boys . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual , and was not marked by logical gradations . The tendency to allegory gave place slowly to the tendency to character-drawing , to the unfolding of a story , and to the humor and liveliness of the comedy . One of the earliest forms which comedy took was the Interlude ? a transitional dramatic form with which the name of John Heywood is identified . A London boy , believed to have sung for a time in the choir of the Chapel Royal , Heywood studied at Oxford , was befriended by that great Englishman , Sir Thomas More , and early became attached to the Court of Henry the Eighth as a player . Players were still under social and religious interdict , but Heywood 's sincerity as a Catholic withstood the test of the withdrawal of the royal favor at a time when a king 's smile was fortune in a most tangible form . There was a manly integrity in the nature of  | John Heywood , as in that of many of his fellow-actors . The Interlude in his hands was less ambitious in construction than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the time . It was often rude , but it was oftener racy , direct , and effective in expression ; using the familiar colloquial speech of the day with great effectiveness . The interest turned on a humorous situation , and the dialogue was enlivened by the play of shrewd native wit . In Four P 's " the characters were so well known that the audience hardly needed the stimulus of wit to awaken its interest . The Palmer , the Poticary , the Pedlar , and the Pardoner brought the playwright and his auditors into easy and immediate contact , and furnished ample opportunity to satirize or ridicule the vices , hypocrisies , and follies of the time . The structure of the Interlude was simple , and its wit too fine for the coarse taste of the time ; but it was a true growth of the English soil , free from foreign influence ; the virility , the gayety , and the license of the early English spirit were in it . " Ralph Roister Doister , " earliest comedy , was produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Four P 's . " Heywood had shown how to set character in distinct outlines on the stage ; Nicholas Udall , an Oxford student , a scholar , holding the head-mastership first of Eton College and later of Westminster School , brought the comedy to completeness by adding to the interest of characters essentially humorous the more absorbing interest of a welldefined plot . Udall was a schoolmaster , but there was no pedantry in him ; he felt the deep classical influence which had swept Europe like a tide , but he took his materials from the life about him , and he used good native speech . He had learned from the Latin comedy how to construct both a plot and a play , and his training gave him easy mastery of sound expression ; but he composed his comedies in terms of English life . " Roister Doister was a type of man instantly recognized by an English audience of every social quality ; a coward who was also a boaster. whose wooing of a widow , like that of Falstaff , affords ample opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece lay in its freshness , its freedom , and its ease qualities which were prophetic of the birth of a true drama . " Gammer Gurton 's Needle , " a broad , coarse , but effective picture of rustic manners , generally believed to have been  | written by John Still , a Lincolnshire man by birth , a Cambridge man by education , and a Bishop by vocation , marks the first appearance of the fully developed farce in English , and is notable for vigorous characterization in a mass of vulgar buffoonery . That such a piece should come from the hand of the stern divine , with Puritan aspect , who lies at rest in Wells Cathedral , and that it was performed before a college audience in Cambridge , shows that the social and intellectual conditions which permitted so close a juxtaposition of the sacred and the vulgar in the Mystery and Miracle plays still prevailed . The saving grace of this early dramatic writing was its vitality ; in this and its native flavor and its resistance to foreign influence lay its promise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not difficult to account for . Tragedy exacts something from an audience ; a certain degree of seriousness or of culture must be possessed by those who are to enjoy or profit by it . Comedy , on the other hand , appeals to the untrained no less than the trained man ; it collects its audience at the village blacksmith 's or the country store as readily as in the most amply appointed theater . Moreover , it kept close to popular life and taste at a time when the influence of the classical literatures was putting its impress on men of taste and culture Italy , by virtue of its immense service in the recovery of classical thought and art and in the production of great works of its own in literature , painting , sculpture , and architecture , was the teacher of western Europe ; and such was the splendor of her achievements that what ought to have been a liberating and inspiring influence became a danger to native originality and development . Italian literature came into England like a flood , and , through a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequality of a difference of more than two centuries in culture was equalized with astonishing rapidity . In that age of immense aptitude for knowledge , the art and scholarship of a more mature people was assimilated with almost magical ease . The traditions of the classical stage for a time threatened the  | integrity of English art , but in the end the vigor of the English mind asserted itself ; if the classical influence had won the day , Ben Johnson would have secured a higher place , but Shakespeare might have been fatally handicapped . " Ferrex and Porrex , " or , as the play is more generally known , " Gorbodoc , " was the earliest English tragedy , and is chiefly interesting as showing how the influence of Seneca and the sturdy vigor of the English genius worked together in a kind of rude harmony . The manner shows the Latin influence , but the story and the spirit in which it is treated are genuinely English . Sir Philip Sidney , whose culture was of the best in point of quality , found " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climbing to the height of Seneca his style , " but notes the failure to comply with the traditional unity of time . Sackville , one of the authors of this vigorous play , stood in relations of intimacy with the Court of Elizabeth , became Chancellor of the University of Oxford , and Lord High Treasurer of England . His work in " The Mirror of Magistrate " brings out still more clearly the deep seriousness of his spirit . Norton , who collaborated with him in the writing of " Gorbodoc , " was a man of severe temper , a translator of Calvin 's Institutes , and a born reformer . Such men might be affected by the classical influence ; they couId hardly be subdued by it . In the excess of action , the rush of incident , the swift accumulation of horrors , in this sanguinary play , Seneca would have found few suggestions of his own methods and temper . The blank verse in which it is written , however , came ultimately from Italy through the skillful adaptation of Surrey . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now rapidly increasing in numbers , turned to English history and produced the long series of Chronicle Plays , to which Shakespeare owed so much , and which furnished an inaccurate but liberalizing education for the whole body of the English people . In these plays , probably covering the entire field of English history , the doings and the experiences of the English race were set forth in the most vital fashion ; English history dramatically presented became a connected and living story . It developed the race consciousness , deepened the race feeling , made love of country the passion which found glorious expression in " Henry V. , " and prepared the way for the popular appreciation of the noblest dramatic works . This dramatic use of national history made the drama the natural and inevitable expression of the English spirit in Elizabeth 's time , and insured an art which was not only intensely English but intensely alive . The imagination trained by the Chronicle Plays was ready to understand " Hamlet " and " Lear . " Bale 's " King Johan , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Famous Victories of Henry V. , " " The Contention of the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster , " " Edward III. , " and kindred plays , not only furnished material for Shakespeare 's hand , but prepared Shakespeare 's audiences to understand his work . These plays practically cover a period of four centuries , and bring the story of English history down to the Armada . In close historical connection with the Chronicle Plays must be placed the long list of plays which , like " Cardinal Wolsey , " " Duchess of Norfolk , " " Duke Humphrey , " and " Hotspur , " drew upon the treasury of English biography and dramatized individual vicissitude and fate ; and the plays which , like the " Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington , " developed the dramatic uses of legendary history . It would not be easy to devise a more stimulating method of educating the imagination and preparing the way for a period of free and buoyant creativeness than this visualization of history on the rude but intensely vitalized stage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English spirit was taken by Shakespeare 's immediate predecessors and by some of his older contemporaries . Such a play as " Arden of Feversham , " which has been credited to Shakespeare by a number of critics , brought the dramatic form to a stage where it needed but the hand of a poet of genius to perfect it . There was still a long distance between the plays of this period , however , and the balance , harmony , and restraint of Shakespeare . " Arden of Feversham , " and a host of dramas of the same period , are charged with power ; but he who reads them sups on horrors . " Lyly 's comedies were acted , with one or two exceptions , before Queen Elizabeth , and were mainly , as Mr. Symonds suggests , elaborately decorated censers in which incense was lavishly burned to a Queen incredibly avid of adulation and flattery . As a writer of comedies for the Court , the author of " Euphues " influenced the language of the later dramatists far more deeply than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty dialogue , and repartee became in his hands a brilliant fence of words ; it remained for Shakespeare to carry both to perfection in " Much Ado About Nothing . " When Shakespeare reached London in 1585 , he found the art of play-writing in the hands of a group of men of immense force of imagination and of singularly varied gifts of expression . During the decacade in which he was serving his apprenticeship to his art England lost Peele , Kyd , Greene , and Marlowe ; Nash , having become a physician , died in 1625 . Every member of this group , with the exception of Marlowe , was born to good conditions ; they were gentlemen in position , and scholars by virtue of university training . They were careless and , in some cases , violent and criminal livers ; men born out of due time , so far as adjustment between genius and sound conditions was concerned , or committed by temperament to unbalanced , disorderly , and tragical careers . Greene , after a life of dissipation , died in extreme misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of misfortune , and became the victim of his vices ; Nash lived long enough to lament the waste and confusion of his career ; the splendid genius of Marlowe was quenched in a tavern brawl before he had reached his thirtieth year . He who would pass a sweeping and unqualified condemnation on this fatally endowed group of ardent young writers would do well to study the times in which they lived , the attitude of society towards the playwright , the absence of normal conditions for the expression of genius such as they possessed , and the perilous combination of temperament and imagination which seems to have been made in each . It is futile and immoral to conceal or minimize the faults and vices of men of genius ; but it is equally futile and immoral to attempt to determine the exact degree of moral responsibility and to reach a final judgment . Greene was a born story-teller , without having any marked gift for the construction of strong and well-elaborated plots ; his study of character was neither vigorous nor convincing . Nash was , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse but very effective method , and a humor often grotesque but always virile . Peele was pre-eminently a poet of taste , with a gift for graceful and even elegant expression , a touch of tenderness , and a sensitiveness of imagination which showed itself in his use of the imagery of mythology . Lodge wrote dull plays and lightened  | them by the introduction of charming songs . Marlowe was the creative spirit of this group of accomplished playwrights . The son of a Canterbury shoemaker , he took his Bachelor 's degree at Cambridge , and arrived in London , " a boy in years , a man in genius , a god in ambition . " His ardent nature , impatient of all restraint and full of Titanic impulses , found congenial society on the stage and congenial work in play-writing . His life was as passionate and lawless as his art ; his plays were written in six turbulent years , and his career was one of brief but concentrated energy . The two parts of " Tamburlaine , " " The Massacre at Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II. , " and " Dr. Faustus , " the glowing fragment of " Hero and Leander. " and a few short compositions , among . them the exquisite " Come live with me and be my love , " evidence the depth and splendor of Marlowe 's genius and the lack of balance and restraint in his art . He gave English tragedy sublimity , intensity , breadth , and order ; he freed blank verse from rigidity and mechanical correctness , and gave it the freedom , harmony , variety of cadence , and compelling music which imposed it upon all later English tragedy . Neither in his life nor in his art did Marlowe accept the inevitable limitations of human power in action and in creation ; he flung himself passionately against the immovable barriers , and grasped at the impossible . But his failures were redeemed by superb successes . He breathed the breath of almost superhuman life into the English drama both as regards its content and its form ; for he was even greater as a poet than as a dramatist . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; For that fine madness still he did retain Which rightly should possess a poet 's brain . He left but a single step to be taken in the full unfolding of the drama , and that step Shakespeare took : the step from the Titan to the Olympian.
