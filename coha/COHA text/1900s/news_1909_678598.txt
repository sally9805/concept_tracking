txt Danger in Overloaded Boats . The pictures of overloaded boats in y-esterday 's paper were timely . I IN as a passenger on a boat leaving the Battery one day last week , and my experience was terrifying . The boat was overcrowded with people even before reaching the R-tttery , yet at that place many hundreds more were packed aboard . There were not seats enough for all . Had a fire occurred , or had the boat sunk quickly as the result of a collision , the Slocum Slaughter would have become merely an Inconspicuous incident by comparison . The season Is now at its height . Nearly every excursion boat is crowded beyond the limits of safety or comfort . Where are the officials whose duty It is to regulate this excursion business and compel steamboat men to obey the law ? If the boat to which I refer above was not carrying passengers in excess of the number permitted by her license , then the license is useless as a safeguard . PRUDENCE .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
