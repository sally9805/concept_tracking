No doubt the happiest field of criticism lies outside of contemporary literature , but an important field lies inside ; and in this the reviewer works . His conception of the truth about contemporary writing will lack certain safeguards which time and detachment afford the critic of the past . The elements of personal prejudice or convenience , of pressure from within or from without , endanger his ance . The difficulties of his position are many and serious enough to have led so keen an observer as M. Jules  | Lemaitre to announce that " the criticism of our contemporaries is not really criticism , but simply conversation . " This seems to be altogether too sweeping a dictum . It fairly asperses the value of any sort of individual judgment . We can not wait for the opinion of posterity upon the character of our nextdoor neighbors ; nor will it necessarily be true that our expressed opinion of them is nothing more than gossip , though the chance may lie that way . It is the business of the reviewer to express his opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other critic , is to see as clearly as he can , and to tell precisely what he sees . He had better not be thinking much about his liability to error ; it is enough to do as well as he can . I do not mean that his judgments ought to be based upon mere whim or prejudice ; if they are , he is not a critic in any serious sense . For criticism , as Arnold said long ago , " is the art of seeing the object as in itself it really is ' ; and the critic is of value in proportion as his vision approximates perfection . The great critic is born and made . His naturally keen vision is refined , before it reaches its highest power , by every contact : by contact with life ; with literature ; finally , with the classics of criticism . At the end of all this , it remains for him only to tell what , as the result of his being and knowing , he does actually see . The honest expression of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critic has before him ; his rank depends upon the plane of reason in which his judgments are formed . Shiftlessness of opinion and insincerity of expression are the only crimes which can be charged against a reviewer ; his other errors will be due to limitations which he can not remove . Moreover , personality , as well as intellect , contributes to the effectiveness of the critic . True criticism , we have begun to see of late , is as much a means of self-expression as any of the forms which are commonly called creative . The fact has been most strikingly suggested by M. Anatole France in his definition of criticism as " the adventures of a soul among masterpieces . " This suggests the chief point of disadvantage for the critic of the contemporary , or reviewer . His adventures must often be upon a lower , at least a more dubious level . His function can not be agreeably limited to the walled gardens of literature ; and he will not find masterpieces bursting from every hedgerow . He is definitely committed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few . He must travel in all places and in all companies . He can not , as Ruskin advised , keep out of the salt swamps of literature , and live on a little rocky island , or , as Schopenhauer urged , devote his time for reading " exclusively to those great minds of all times and all countries who overtop the rest of humanity , those whom the voice of fame points to as such . " He is , in fact , a drudge of fame . His reward is , now and then , to hit upon merit , to hit upon truth , to feel himself not only the drudge of fame , but the herald of excellence . At such moments he has 11 nothing to ask of fate ; the world is his , and the fulness thereof . But why all this stress upon honesty ? Is there any reason for a reviewer 's being anything but honest ? There are many reasons ? more perhaps in America than elsewhere . England still preserves a taste for robust criticism . It rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saturday Review " its fun . One can perceive a theory behind this method , to the effect that if a reviewer ( who is free to write or not ) can not find a book good enough to write about , the next best thing is to find one bad enough . Either will give him opportunity to enunciate , or to illustrate , some important critical principle . This is not the American theory . We are given to understand that a reviewer should ignore what he can not praise . It is his duty to speak only of books about which he can find something amiable to say . He is to be a guide , but not a guardian , of the public . Unfortunately , the ordinary reviewer has obvious reasons for speaking of books in which no cultivated taste can find occasion for praise ; and he is too likely to succumb to the general demand for amenity . But let us consider the extraordinary reviewer , the writer who is free to treat only such books as commend themselves to his taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience against meretricious work upon which the perfunctory reviewer is pronouncing silly encomiums ? It is quite true that the best service of criticism is affirmative . We are in no danger of underrating the value of Professor Dowden 's assertion that " The most valuable critic is the critic who communicates sympathy by an exquisite record of his own de -- lights . " The purest pleasure , the highest profit , lies in constructive work ; nobody covets the office of literary headsman . Yet it is a necessary office , and there is no reason why the reviewer should feel himself culpable in occasionally undertaking it . He is not so fatuous as to imagine that his comment upon a book will have a mysterious power of adding to or subtracting from its value . The immediate circulation of a book may conceivably be affected by somebody 's opinion of it ; its quality , and consequently its permanent standing , can be in no way affected . Works of merit do not always speak for themselves at once ; works of no merit very commonly speak beyond themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the value of one as well as of the other . The especial temptation of the American reviewer is to concern himself more with persons and with volumes of printed matter than with qualities and principles . He thinks of the author , he thinks of the publisher , he thinks of the public ? they all like to hear pleasant things said . He says them . This is not a method of criticism ; that is , it is not a respectful method of approaching an author or his work . An ingenious argument is sometimes advanced in favor of it , based upon the theory that the duty of the reviewer is not only to judge literature , but to  | encourage authors . We are assured that there must be no more instances like that of the poor young Keats . I can only say that this theory of the reviewer 's function seems to me altogether false . It is his sole business to express his opinion of the abstract value of a book as literature . It is a publisher 's business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it falls to anybody in his official capacity to encourage , to deprecate , to distinguish between promise and achievement , it falls to the editor . Every good editor will succeed in bringing out much valuable new material by this sort of manipulation . But the critic is under obligation only to the truth as he sees it . The moment he begins to falter , to qualify , to mitigate the substance of his criticisny he makes it worthless . To its form he may well give the highest possible degree of amenity . These principles can not be too strictly kept in mind by the reviewer whose critical integrity finds itself wavering under , it may be , the fourfold pressure of author , editor , publisher , and public . He is a judge , or he is a mere fabricator of book-notices . It is not his business to help the sale of books , or to coddle sensitive authors , or to make everybody feel comfortable about everything . Discrimination is always offensive in one quarter or another ; and the reviewer discriminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
