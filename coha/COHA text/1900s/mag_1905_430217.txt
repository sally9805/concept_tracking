 |p1225  I SHALL never forget the unalloyed pleasures of my first balloon ascension . Tho scarcely more than a youth , I had long dreamed of the adventure , because in those days , before the founding of the Aero Club , it was an adventure , even in Paris . Everything was still in the hands of the professional aeronauts ; and its was with one of the kindest and best of these , the late M. Machuron , that I was to make my initiation . Today even ladies of Paris society , like the young Duchesse d'Uzes , think nothing of starting off from the Parc de SaintCloud for an afternoon floating over the map of France . It was a beautiful morning in late spring . The basket rocked coquettishly beneath the immense sphere . I stood in my corner and heard the last word given : " Let go all ! " The wind ceased . All seemed instantly motionless around us . We were off , without feeling it , at the speed of the air current in which we must live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sensation of its existence ! Infinitely gentle is the unfelt movement upward and onward ; the illusion is complete ; it seems to be not we who move , but the earth itself that is sinking down and away from us ! In the emptiness that had already opened 1,500 yards below us , almost before I could realize it , the earth looked no longer the same . No , it did not look like an orange flattened at the Poles ? we were not far enough away for that ; but , by a phenomenon o f refraction it showed concave like a bowl , the effect being to lift up constantly to the aeronaut 's eye the circle of the horizon . Villages and woods , chateaux and gardens slip and glide far , far below . Faint piercing sounds ,  |p1226  like locomotive whistles and the yelping of stray dogs , are the only ones which penetrate to us . The human voice can not mount up to these solitudes . Human beings look like ants along white lines that are highways . While my gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It cooled the gas of our balloon , which obviously wrinkled and began descending , gently at first and then with accelerated speed , against which we struggled by throwing out ballast . Yes , I was frightened . I did not feel myself falling , but I could see the earth coming swiftly up to us ; and I knew what that meant ! It was an idle emotion . A few pounds of ballast overboard not only stopped the mad career of the earth in our direction , but sent it down , down , down again away from us , and we found our equilibrium , this time above a plateau of clouds at about 3,000 yards . It was a wonderful sight . On the dazzling white cloud screen below us the sun cast shadows of the balloon and ourselves , magnified to giant size ; and this in the exact center of a magnificent rainbow . As we could no longer see the earth by reason of this cloud screen , all sight sensation , even of movement , ceased . Were we standing still ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . To learn the direction we were taking we had to drop below the clouds . At the moment we began to see the earth again a gay peal of bells mounted up to us . It was the noon Angelus from some village belfry . I had brought up a little panier of hard boiled eggs , cold meats , cheese , ice cream , fruits , cakes , champagne , coffee and liquors , and I now experienced how delightful it is to lunch above the clouds in the nacelle of a spherical balloon . No earthly dining room could possibly have such a decoration . The sun 's heat sets the clouds in ebullition , making them throw up rainbow jets of frozen vapor like fireworks all around the table . Lacelike spangles of the most delicate ice formation scatter themselves here and there , appearing out of nothing , and filmlike flakes pop into existence under our very eyes , in our very drinking glasses . Then , suddenly , all changed like the trick in the pantomime ; and a somber drop scene fell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The barometer rose rapidly 5 millimeters , showing a sudden rupture of equilibrium and a swift descent . Doubtless the balloon had become overweighed with some pounds of snow , and it was certainly falling into a cloud . We passed into the dim darkness of the fog . We still saw our basket , instruments and the parts of the rigging nearest us ; but the balloon had completely disappeared . So we had the strange and delightful sensation of hanging in the void without support , either above or below ; of having lost our weight ; of being nowhere ! Really , it was strange beyond description . We slackened the fall , as usual , by throwing out ballast , and came to equilibrium far , far below the clouds at scarcely more than 300 yards altitude . A village fled beneath us . We were scudding fast . We compared our route map with the immense natural map unfolding below us , and soon we could identify roads , railways , villages and forests ? all hurrying toward us from the horizon with the swiftness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us down marked a change in the weather . Little gusts pushed the balloon from one side to the other and up and down . Again , and again the guide rope , dangling roo yards below our basket , touched earth ; and soon even the basket began to graze the tops of trees . What is called " guide roping " thus began for me . M. Machuron and I each held a sack of ballast , and when some special obstacle rose in our path ? a tree or house ? one of us would throw out a few handfuls of sand , to make the balloon leap up and pass over it . More than half the guide rope dragged behind us , and so we scudded comparatively close to earth at a wonderfully even altitude . But shortly , as we passed over a little group of trees , a shock threw us backward into the basket . The balloon had stopped short and was swaying in the gusts at the end of its guide rope , which had curled itself around the head of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted 119  |p1228  ing world ? a soul freed from the trammels of matter ! Now and again there come the lights of earth to cheer you . You see a point far below ahead . It slowly expands , until where there came to be a blaze there are countless bright spots . They run in lines , with here and there a cluster . It is a city . Then it is out again over the lone land . When the moon rises you see , perhaps , a faint curling line of gray . It is a river , with moonlight or starlight falling on its waters . There comes a flash and a faint roar ; it is a railway train , the locomotive 's fires illuminating for a moment its smoke as it rises . Then you throw out ballast and rise through the dank black clouds to a soul-lifting burst of starlight . And there , alone with the constellations , you await the dawn . When the dawn comes , red and gold and purple , one is almost loath to seek the cheery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in who knows what part of Europe affords still another unique pleasure . For many the greatest charm of spherical ballooning lies here . The spherical balloonist becomes an explorer . Are you young ? Would you roam and tempt adventures ? And are you tied down ? You may still penetrate the unknown and deal with the unexof altitude and air currents is yours , but when the moment comes to land you have the true explorer 's zest of coming on unknown peoples , who are not expecting you ? a god from a machine ! " What country is this ? " Will the answer come in French , German , Italian , Norwegian , or even Russian ? Paris Aero Club members have actually been shot at crossing European frontiers . Yes , the air is still for most people an unknown element ; and I who know it remain astonished at the world of different sensations one experiences in it as one goes as a spherical or dirigible balloonist . The realization of this wonderful difference flashed on me , at a moment I recall well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Mediterranean coast in my No. 6 during the memorable winter of 1902 . I was by this time an experienced dirigible balloon captain ? it was the winter following my winning of the Deutsch Prize in Paris ; I had no task to perform , nothing to prove , and I could give myself up to the pleasures of aerial navigation in by far the swiftest airship I had yet constructed . As I steered my course I remember saying to myself : " How different are these from the sensations of the spherical balloonist ! It is true that he has the earth flying backward beneath him at a great speed . but he knows that he is powerless . The sphere of gas above him is the plaything of the air current in which it finds itself : and he can not change its direction . " In my dirigible balloon I could see myself flying over the sea , and I had my hand on a helm that made me master of my direction in the splendid course I was making . Once or twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved the helm around , while going at full speed . Delightfully obedient , the airship 's helm swung to the other side . and I was speeding in a new diagonal course that would have brought me to shore in a few minutes had I continued it . But these maneuvers only occupied a few instants each , and each time I swung myself back on a straight line to the entrance of the Bay of Monaco , from which I had come and to which I must return to the balloon house built for me by the Prince of that bay and the land around it , for I was flying homeward like an eagle . To those watching my return , from the terraces of Monte Carlo and Monaco town ( as they told me afterward ) , the airship increased in size at each moment , like a veritable eagle bearing down on them . As the wind was coming toward them they could hear the low crackling buzz of my motor a long distance away . Faintly now their own shouts of encouragement came to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " tacking " is meaningless . Imagine the air current to be a river running to miles per hour . If you go against the current , making 20 miles per hour , your net progress will be but to miles per hour . If your propeller makes you 20 miles per hour with the current , your net speed becomes 30 miles per hour . Well , it is just so in an airship . In a calm it makes its own speed , unaffected by wind current . The navigator of the air , however , has one great pleasure unknown to the navigator of a river . He can seek to change one air current for another . The air is full of varying currents . Mounting , I have often sought and found either a calm or an advantageous breeze , even in a spherical balloon ; and this is one of the ever-changing delights of the aerial realm . Before going on my first airship experiment I really wondered if I should be seasick . I imagined that the sensation of mounting and descending obliquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I looked forward to a deal of pitching ? not rolling ? another novelty in ballooning . For , remember always , the spherical balloon gives no sensation of movement at all . In my first airship , however , the suspension was so long that it approximated that of a spherical balloon . For this reason there was very little pitching . And speaking generally , since that time , tho I have been told that on this or that trip I pitched considerably , I have never been seasick in the air . You see in the airship there is no smell . All is pure and clean , and the pitching itself has none of those shocks and hesitations of the boat at sea . The movement is suave and flowing , owing to the immensely lesser resistance of the air . The pitches are less rapid than at sea ; the dip is not brusquely arrested ? so the mind can anticipate the curve to its very end and be prepared . There is no shock to give that " empty " feeling as the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore part , then its aft , with its propeller churning the air so viciously , to sink the next moment and churn the water . All this brings me to the most remarkable of all the sensations of aerial navigation . This is the wonderful diagonal flight . On my first trip it actually shocked me . Man has never known anything like free vertical existence . Held to the plane of the earth , his movement " down " has scarcely been more than a return after a short excursion " up , " our minds always remaining on the plane surface , even while our bodies may be  |p1231  page deleted  |p1232  round the Arc de Triomphe and down the Avenue des Champs Elysees at as low an altitude as the housetops on either side , fearing no ill and finding no difficulty . Knowing that the feat must be accomplished at an hour when the pleasure promenade of all Paris would be the least encumbered , I had instructed my men to sleep through the early part of the night at the Neuilly station . Arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , waked the men , brought out the airship and crossed the Seine as I rose diagonally a little after dawn . Turning to the left I made my way over the Bois , picking out the open spaces . When I came to trees I jumped over them . So , navigating through the cool air of dawn I reached the Porte Dauphine and the beginning of the Avenue of the Bois , which leads to the Arc de Triomphe . The carriage promenade of Tout Paris was empty , and I might actually have threaded the Arc de Triomphe had I deemed myself worthy . Instead , . I rounded the national monument to the right , as the law directs . Like the Avenue of the Bois , the Avenue of the Champs Elysees , was deserted . Far down its length I saw a solitary cab . As I guide roped along to my house at the corner of the rue Washington , I thought of the time , sure to come , when the navigators of handy little airships will not be obliged to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by their domestics on their own roof-gardens . So I reached my street corner , to which I pointed downward my stem and descended very gently . Two servants caught , steadied and held the airship while I mounted to my apartment for a cup of coffee . That is another kind of dirigible ballooning !
