 | I WILL call first upon Margaret , the artist , for her I story of light housekeeping , " said the hostess . ' ' here was a moment of silence while a girl leaned her face on her hand and turned her eves on the glowing fire . " lt seems like delving into a former life if I speak of the days before I dropped into light housekeeping . There had been no preparation for it . From a com fortable farmhouse , then a college dormitory , I came straight to the city and rented a studio . I had little enough to meet expenses until fortune began to come my way . For three months my work and pupils barely earned enough to pay rent . And light housekeepingsurel , y-lighter was never known . My bed was a hammock swung across the room . With its blanket and pillow it could be rolled into the smallest compass , and during the dav leaned in a wardrobe . There were supperless , hopeless nights when it swung me gently to sleep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11Iy  | cooking outfit was one utensil , an oldfashioned tin alcohol lamp , like a pint cup fixed to a saucer . Anything I wanted to boil I put in the cup , shut the lid , poured a. tablespoon of alcohol in the saucer and set it ablaze . Ten minutes later it was steaming ' . - 1T v dish cupboard , one corner of a shelf where I stored paints and brushes and canvases , held a cup and saucer , a tumbler and plate , a knife , fork and spoon . " " What did you cook in your alcohol lamp ' .1 " queried the hostess . " At first I tried on milk and dry cereals , or bread and butter with coffee , tea , or cocoa brewed in the lamp , then strained into a cup . One teaspoon of alcohol cooked an co- in three minutes . Boiling water and beef essence made : t good bouillon , or I heated a canned soup occasionally , when I could atford one . 1 got a cook book and began to experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it was oyster soup , scrambled eggs , creamed codfish , frizzled beef , Scotch collops , made from hamburg steak , or a kidney stew . On Sunday , when there were no interruptions , I used . to boil potatoes . Then there were canned vegetables , such as peas , beans , corn or tomatoes , which could be heated in three minutes . You ought to have seen my individual desserts . " " Desserts ! " cried the chorus of incredulous voices . " Yes ! One-egg custards , cups of jelly , apple sauce , stewed b e r r i e s , blancmange , chocolate cream , prune whip , orange custard , tipsy pudding , Spanish cream , charlotte russe , or junket . " " All made in the pint cup ? " queried the schoolma'am incredulouslv . " All of them ! Every success inspired me to try something new , and almost before I realized it , I had become a first-rate c o o li . Graduallv I began to plan more hygienic meals . I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables . Frequently my lunch was little  | but a salad , with rile bread , a morsel of cheese and a glass of water . All the year round I could find cheap salad materials - lettuce , radishes , watercress , cucumbers , tomatoes , celery or chicory . As I grew to depend on more wholesome food than baker 's cake and doughnuts I felt better and could work better . After I had got marketing down to a science my food seldom cost more than a dollar a week . For a year I kept expenditures within in v small income . " , " And then ? " asked one girl eagerly . " And t hen , - the artist laughed , " thing , began to come my way . In athalie , a next d o o r neighbor , I found a new friend . Let her tell of light housekeeping as she knows it . " " Hear , bear ! " cried the chorus , and all eves were turned yon the cheerful athalie . " I fled to light h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape inquisi- tive landladies , a dismal vista of neglected back yards , a cabbage and onion atmosphere , and boarders with whom I could not possibly fraternize . At last I found the sort of place I wanted and hung out mi7 shingle , ' Expert Stenographer and Typist . ' " DZy ! the rent took my breath away but I wanted that particular room . I could gaze down into the heart of areat elms in the city square , elms where birds nested and squirrels scam- " Glued Vattelina 's patent leathers to the floor " pored . I had a room as big as a wilderness , where chairs and tables looked like doll house furniture , and on the expanse of polished floor m1-small rugs were no bigger than table mats . Why , in pure ecstasy I began to sprint round my new apartment , till a crochetv old party downstairs sent the janitor to say , vould I please wear nurse 's slippers ! I set up house on one hundred dollars ; besides , I owned a typewriter and plenty of patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First of all , I began to make my wilderness homelike . I engaged a carpenter to make things ; the room did not brag of a wardrobe , closet , or even a shelf . Fle produced a bed and three wide low window seats . The fronts were made of ash , paneled , stained and varnished to match the woodwork . It cost little more than denim valances , to say nothing of the work of putting them on . The window seats had strong hinged lids , inside the boxes were partitioned . " " For what ? " asked the hostess . " Well , there were square places for hats , long narrow strips for shoes , spaces which would hold shirt waists laid flat , others for gowns , skirts and starched petticoats , two for lingerie and one for hosiery . They were bottomless . It made them easier to move , and they looked as if they had been built in.  | On the bottom was pasted a sheet of heavy paper to keep things from the floor . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked one young woman . " Not a bit . It was another paneled box , partitioned to hold the bedclothes on one side and light , crisp frocks on the other . The lid was slats , with springs on top and a comfortable felt mattress . This box had a bottom , and casters . I could pull it about easily when it had to be opened or shut . Covered with a Navajo blanket and tossed liberally with soft cushions , it looked like a big , comfortable divan . I hate beyond anything an ugly marble washstand , indeed , I would rather perform my ablutions with the elm sparrows in the fountain . I had the carpenter make a big , strong screen with casters , then I deputed my neighbor to stencil a decoration on its filling of green burlap . On a row of brass hooks inside its frame I hung towels , a bath mat , a sponge basket , the soap dish , and various toilet necessities . Close by the stand I set a narrow chiffonier with a mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handkerchiefs , also a little cupboard for bottles . " Then I turned to make the best of housekeeping arrangements . As Mrs Whitney says , It was a debatable question whether I was to kitchen in the parlor or parlor in the kitchen . ' One thing I resolved , that all my kitchening should be of the daintiest . Every pot and pan I bought was snowy white , and my fairylike spider was aluminum . I built my kitchen over the low , broad radiator . It was two wide shelves covered with asbestos , then with white oilcloth . At one side stood a tiny gas stove . From a jet above dropped a tubing which was securely fixed to the wall . On the other side hung mv cooking utensils . 117v kitchen was hidden by a grille in equal divisions hinged to the sides below , and green denim curtains fell to the floor . The kitchen door was a table that dropped from the top by chains and afforded a place to work . Inside it was covered with snowy oilcloth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pushed up and latched , i+as of green denim to match the curtains . " lIy cooking outfit consisted of a Lilliputian oven , and pots , pans , forks , knives , spoons , salt box and pepper pot , measuring cup , strainer , toaster , asbestos mat , coffee pot and holders . The long shelf above held sugar , spices , flour , coffee , tea , baking powder and other small necessities , each in a tightly covered tin . The dishpan and towel- ; could not be crowded into my six by five kitchen . They hung low on the toilet table screen . PIy dishes were too dainty to bide , so I set them with a few bits of delicate glass on an upper shelf of the bookcase . My dining table stands by a sunny window , with a fern reflected in its polished top ; in the drawers are stored a few bits of fine linen . I have nothing splendid in my kitchen parlor ; still " - the typewriter girl sighed-a sigh of content " it is home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I can be growly or cheerful , just as my soul desires . " " Ah ! company , " cried the hostess . " There 's a chord worth striking ! Babette , you jolly , happy-go-lucky , hospitable little soul , tell us about some of your famous spreads . " " Alas ! I 'm not like Natlaalie , with the blessed gift of making a place for things , then keeping things in that place . I store potatoes in the waste basket , sugar in the cracker jar , a chafing-dish hides under the piano , you will find doughnuts in my hat box , coffee in the rose jar and other stuffan yvhere I can tuck it away . The last time Vattelina sang here I rave a little spread in his honor . We had Welsh rabbit . The tenor was so interested when it began to splutter that he almost got his nose in it-vou know he is awfully shortsighted . He leaned hi ; weight on the gimcracky little table we were cooking at , and over it went , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could have cried , till I saw that sticky cheese mixture gluing poor Vattelina 's patent leathers to the floor . There was n't a thing left to eat except our dry toast  | and the beer . Two of the boys-as soon as ' they had wiped the tears from their eyes-went down and cleaned out a lunch wagon . We ate mustardy frankfurtcr sandwiches , fried pies- " " Mercv , did n't you have a bad indigestion ? " cried Vathalic . " Not a bit of it , but I lay awake for an hour , I was so mad . An American would have sent me a new rug ; that stingy - Italian said good-bye in the profusest broken English and assured me the mat would be all right if I would comb it . ' Comb it , indeed ! " The night I met Dolly Dorset , the clever English impersonator , the boys were ( lying for an introduction , so I ' phoned one of them to come and bring as many friends as my room would hold . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there were n't fifteen chairs in my tiny parlor , so they perched anywhere . We had just sat down to eat when in walked Charles Van Doren-you know him , the howling swell who leads the germans and engineers the charity ball . He had rushed home to get into his dress suit . I tell you he was impressive . There was n't a seat left when he ca-me ; the music stool , the radiator , everything was occupied . " Here , take this ! ' cried Harrington . He d r a gged something from a corner and plumped the dictionary on top of it . My heart stood still . He had seated Van Doren on my little potato barrel , which I had draped with a bit of oriental eimbroidery . Dolly was giving us an imitation of Richard AIansficld-the funniest thing she does-when Van Doren began to laugh uproariously . We heard a sharp crack , then Van Doren disappeared . He was sprawling full length on the floor , his feet tangled up in the embroidered stuff , the barrel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Jack called . He had never seen my home in a nutshell before , and it interested him . Stav here for supper , ' T insisted , when he invited me to his hotel . I 'll cook  | you such a supper , a beefsteak cooked as mother does it , brown and juicy . ' " ' With onions ? ' cried Jack . " ' Yes , with onions . ' " Done , I 'll get the steak . ' " In he rushed ten minutes later with a beauty of a steak and a quart of onions . Jack watched curiouslv while I plugged the keyhole with absorbent cotton , closed the transom , opened windows and battened cracks about the door with vet towels . Never in my existence have I known onions smell as these did . While I wandered about setting the table , I was limp with terror . Jack thought it a great joke . " If William , the darky janitor , smells it , he 'll go right to Ruxton and I 'll get my walking ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week because she fried eels . Eels are n't a circumstance to onions . ' " I hear somebody shuffling around outside the door now , ' said Jack . " Do n't , ' I implored . He was creeping to the door while those onions fried out their blissfulest odors . Jack paid no heed . He fumbled gently at the lock and suddenly threw open the door . Outside crouched William , his nose on a level with the keyhole . " Get up and come in where you can get a smell that will make you hungry as a horse ! ' commanded Jack . " William was trying to scramble to his feet , but Jack hauled him over the threshold in a hurry , and shut the door . " ' Now , you noser ! ' he cried , what were you looking for " ' " Nothin ' but a smell , massa , ' whimpered he . Mistah Ruxton makes de awfulest fuss ' bout smells , an ' I 've meh ordahs to look out for them . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly sorry for William till Jack gave him a dollar and bundled him out again . Then we ate in peace , but I have n't fried onions since . "
