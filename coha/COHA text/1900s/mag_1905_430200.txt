 |p1064  SOME two years ago , while writing for THE INDEPENDENT a series of articles on making country homes , the queries and comments came in faster than they could be considered . It seemed best at the time to lay over some of these for future discussion . I propose now to heed and to answer the more important . A letter which peculiarly interested me at the time came from a Philadelphia teacher . She wrote : " Will you please , before you drop this discussion of country homes , consider the case of a teacher who has a strong love for the country and is very tired of teaching . You must not think that the great increase of women teachers , in proportion to men , means that we are quite happy in our position . We have been breaking loose from old lines of living and working and have somehow got hold of the schools of the country . The proportion of men teachers to women teachers in 1870 was about equal , but in 1902 it was four to five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile the wages of men teachers has gone up , from an average of about forty dollars to an average of fifty , while our pay remains what it was thirty years ago ? or very near that sum . We are doing the hard work of the schools of the United States , and we are not getting the pay . It seems to some of us that farming is beginning to open a great field ? that is , some departments of farming . I for one have noted with intense interest what has been said in THE INDEPENDENT and elsewhere about women as bee-keepers , as small fruit growers , as managers of dairies , etc . I want to know what is the minimum cost of a small country home . I do not know how to state this case ? accurately , simply because I do not know what I can do ; and others are situated like me . Can you suggest to me any way in which , with a small capital of $2,000 , I can get a country home . and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake is the growing of violets , roses , lilies , etc. , and the management of a greenhouse . With this work I see no reason why I might not grow a pretty good garden of berries and have an orchard of small fruits besides . Tell me a little about the cost , and then indicate as far as you can the running exexpenses for two or three years . When will I begin to get some profit ? Will it pay to borrow money to aid in starting such a movement ? You see I am a good deal mixed up in my plan , and I presume I will mix you up a good deal in your estimates of what I want . Perhaps what I most want is independence . " There is no such thing as a minimum price for a country home . An old homestead of a few acres should be procurable for a sum not to exceed $600 or $800 . Repairs would cost $200 or $300 more . Then you have your greenhouses to erect , and you will have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you intend to raise your own garden produce , as well as your small fruits and your orchard fruits . To do this would not require more than two or three acres of land . You might even get on with a single acre , altho you would have very little room for orchard trees . You should locate , if possible , near a market or a depot ? perhaps a trolley would serve you . This should not enhance the price of the land very largely . In localities there is occasionally a speculative turn which keeps places such as you desire , for a while , at a larger figure . You will , of course , choose a sunny and bright location , and one that is well protected from severe winds . But even after that you will need your hedges and your own windbreaks . I will not advise any one to take up a country residence without this as a first proviso . You will rarely find a properly protected piece of property in the market . Nine farmers out of ten leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all look out for this , altho the larger part of your culture may be under glass . So far as I can observe the very great increase of greenhouse work has not glutted the market . The call for violets and similar plants and flowers , as well as roses and lilies and carnations , is enormously on the increase . You probably expect to begin on a small scale and  |p1065  page deleted  |p1066  selected animals out of common herds . As for keeping bees , you had much better combine it with small fruit growing ; for bees are essential to success in the orchard . For five acres keep ten hives of bees ; for ten acres keep twenty hives . If it is a neighborhood where bees can easily get food and collect honey the number of hives may be increased . I have seen eighty hives doing good work on a farmer 's stands . Of course , this adds to your study as well as to your work , but nothing can be done profitably or pleasantly that is not well understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not ever expect to find out ? there are enough other problems . Bees take especial prejudice against some persons , and these people may as well not undertake their management . These , however , are extreme cases ; and you will probably develop not only a capacity for their care but a real friendship for your pollenizers . They ought to have a few basswood trees to work in ; and these it would be wise for every farmer to plant ? in place of maples . Along our streets we might grow more lindens ( or bassSummer care and winter care of bees must be exact and intelligent . In order to make it profitable you must comprehend the work as a science . A little carelessness will undo the whole year 's profit . Your supers must be put in early ; and your hives must be carefully guarded from moths and mice . There is something about bee-keeping to which a woman naturally takes , and the study of the subject is fascinating to young people ? if not the work . The handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-nets . Some people can handle bees with impunity . I do woods ) , and so our street trees would serve a double purpose . The bees are so fond of this tree that they will stay in it all night . It is not true that they make a great deal of clover honey , provided they have an abundance of food from other quarters . They will collect very largely from your raspberry fields . The mountain ash is also an excellent bee tree ; and it also furnishes a large amount of bird food . Why not combine your ideas , and around your greenhouses and hotbeds have small fruits growing ? especially raspberries , with cherries and plums ; and  |p1067  keep enough bees to add a few hundred pounds of honey to your marketable produce ? You must bear in mind also that the apple orchard not only needs bees , but also feeds them , and very generously . If your acreage is limited you can grow dwarf apples instead of standards , and they will furnish your bees about the best possible grazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than to assume that you intend to adopt some such plan . You will readily see by my sketch of your house and home that while I do not send you so far back with your house as I generally advise for home makers in the country , I do not let you live very close to the street . You must have your house where it will be convenient for your greenhouses , your flowers and your garden . The first of these will explain itself . They must be easy of approach , while your hotbeds are not only easy of access but placed adjacent to your barns . I take it that you will keep a horse and a cow as a part of your garden and floral economy . They enter into the fertilization question quite too largely to be omitted . Nor can we overlook the fact that while you are making your money by selling fruit and flowers largely , it will be true domestic economy to raise for your home use nearly everything that you will require . Around your barn I place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large plot of asparagus and pieplant . These , if skilfully raised , constitute a marketable product of high rank . The drainage of the barn , which sets on a rise of land , comes down directly through and into your vegetable garden . You must make use of every ounce of manure , especially of the liquid . A row of apple trees extends the whole of the rear of your lot ; while a windbreak of pear trees flanks both ends . Instead of pear trees , if you prefer , you can plant the ordinary sour cherry , or if the climate suits , the sweet cherry . These make admirable windbreaks , besides furnishing a large amount of usable and salable fruit . 1 am surprised that the old-fashioned way of planting cherry trees all around the homestead lot has gone out of fashion . I think it is because of the black knot , which for a time made cherry growers a deal of trouble . I take it you understand that no one is going to get either flowers or fruit without trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears , cut it off and burn it . Small fruits fill up one whole corner of your lot ? which I suppose to represent about one acre out of five . If you have two acres only give a half acre to small fruits and another half to plums and cherries . The gooseberry is in growing market demand , and you see that it occupies rows between your plums and cherries . Now you see that I have plotted for you something that may easily come under the head of intensive farming . I have not put all your eggs into one basket . That old lesson needs to be learned over and over again , and especially in the country we find it essential to diversify our employments . You will probably wish to know a little more definitely what I believe can be your income from such a place as I have described . I have presumed that you saved enough of your capital to keep you out of bankruptcy for three or four years . The very first year you will be saved your rent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount of honey , all the vegetables you will use , besides what fruit you will get from trees and bushes bought with your land . This will not be a small item in living expenses , but you will probably have no surplus to send to market ? unless it be that you have secured something of an orchard . Your experience for the next year will not vary much from the first . By the third year you will have a small surplus from your flowers , your berries and small fruits and an increasing surplus from your bees and hens . If you are keeping a cow she will at present add quite as much expense as she will furnish in the way of milk and butter supplies . It will be at least four or five years before you will begin to have a small balance of profit . After this your flowers , your bees , your fruits will all be ' increasing their returns until they make you comfortable and independent . You will meanwhile be living along the line of the Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
