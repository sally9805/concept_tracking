txt Passenger on the Elevated Ill-Used I took the Third Avenue train which left the City Hall station at 7:30 A. M. At the Eighty-fourth Street station my attention was attracted by the conductor punching a young man about 19 years old for no other reason than that he had been standing just outside the door of the car on the front platform . Four policemen were sitting so near that any of them could have put his hand on the conductor , but not one made a move to interfere . When we reached the 129th Street elation the young man got off . The conductor tried to catch him but could not , so he shouted to the station men to catch him . Then they gave him a severe beating , after delaying the train for a few minutes . When the conductor returned he boastingly shouted so that every one in the car could hear him that that fellow got more than he was looking for .                  @ @ @
