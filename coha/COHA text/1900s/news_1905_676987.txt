txt Without disrespect to the Secretary of the Treasury it may be suggested that he was not a happy choice to represent the President and the Government of the United States at the farewell banquet to the International Railway Congress on Saturday evening . He was not a happy choice because his mode of thinking and talking is not calculated to give the most favorable impression of our statesmen to a body of peculiarly able , keen , experienced , and influential men . There was , indeed , a sense in which the choice may be accepted as a good one . Mr. SHAW is a pretty fair representative of the protected and favored class who shape our commercial policy . Though our foreign visitors may not get a favorable impression of our statesmen from him , they may get a pretty accurate one , and may take home with them a reasonably correct notion of what the spirit of our commercial policy is and is likely to be . What the Secretary of the Treasury really did was to convey to these gentlemen , representing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire business interests of all Europe , something very like a threat of tariff war . of retaliation , should any of the European nations pursue a line of conduct which some of them unquestionably intend to pursue . He started ctil with a somewhat grandiloquent statement of the equality of terms granted by the United States . " The Constitution , " he pointed out , " insures to all the earth the right to buy in our markets on equal terms . " We neither grant export bounties nor impose export duties . On the other hand , n-e also have " so far " offered equal terms to all sellers . Our " tariff duties imposed for purposes of protection , as well as those imposedfor purposes of revenue , are equal as between those countries which protect their markets and those which make their markets free . " We " criticise no nation for levying duties either for purposes of protection or for purposes of revenue , provided only "  --  and precisely here is the implied threat ? " they are made to rest no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Treasury then went on to call attention to the fact that the United States has " never yet levied retaliatory tariffs . " And he wound up with these words , which are distinctly minatory : I can therefore assure you , and our own people as well that the world will never he involved in tariff wars or retaliatory legislation so long as the United States pursues its present policy and other countries do not discriminate against those who do not discriminate against them . Consider for a moment the circumstances under which this announcement is made . The Finance Minister of our Government is naturally accepted by foreigners as speaking with especial authority on all matters of commerce , and as speaking not only for himSelf but for his Government . That would inevitably be true of any Minister of Finance in any foreign Government . as we have said , was ad-1 dressing men of influence in business from all parts of Europe . A few weeks since the Government of Germany an-1nouneed to our own that it was about to change its tariff policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of the Treasury . GerMany does propose to levy higher duties on our goods than those she levies on the goods of nations that reduce their duties against her . She does , in the language of our Secretary of the Treasury . propose to " discriminate against those ( including the United States ) who do not discriminate against her , " but who refuse to discriminate in her favor . We may add that this policy is already adopted by France and by several less important commercial nations . It becomes more conspic7 uous for us in the case of Germany because our trade with that country is larger and more varied than with any taller European nation , and is second only to our trade with Great Britain . We need not say that the " equality " in our treatment : of all countries of Which Mr. SIIAW so roundly boasts is not in reality anything to be very proud of . In trade we treat all nations with impartial rudeness . We shut them all in like degree from our markets . And Wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one as of another , and have the same narrow view of the expediency of exchange With one as with another . Owing to our vast and Varied natural resources , to the energy of our people , to the rapid growth of our population by immigration , and most esPecially owing to the perfect freedom of trade within our own wide boundaries , we have prospered greatly . Finally we have reached a stage where foreign trade is valuable , and in . the future must increase in value . Our 1 second largest customer is tired of our attitude of grudging and greedy ex , change and plainly tells us that she will try to bar'us out of her markets unless we let down the bars to our own . And the answer of our Finance Minister is that if she does that we shall retaliate and put up higher bars . It would be the worst possible line to take . We are very sorry that Mr. SHAW was permitted to threaten that we would take it .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
