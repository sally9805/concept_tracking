MY first information about the very well known London artist Mortimer Menpes was that he had a beautiful , queer house and had given a party . But the papers were so full of a great house-warming Mr. Menpes had given during the first week in truly , of ( he duchesses , countesses , cabinet ministers , actors , authors , and artists who had been present , as well as of the house in which they had been received . that my curiosity was fully aroused . The beautiful and artistic Duchess of Sutherland , the Duchess of St. Albans , clever Lady Ribblesdale , lovely Lady Helen Vin-cent , witty Lady Dorothy Neville , Lord and Lady Cranbournc , Arthur Balfour , Lord and Lady Edward Cecil , Ellen Terry , Henry Irving , Mrs. Brown Potter , Linley Sanbourne , Harry Furniss , George Grossmith , and Israel Zangwill had all given the patronage of their presence at this party . I knew London well enough to know that there must indeed be a man behind all of this , to say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ideal Japan . " So , as the surest way of finding out about an artist who could thus receive tribute from all the best that London affords , I went to a source of all wise information . The next time I saw my good friend T. P. O'Conor I asked him about Menpes . There had been no mistake in the question . He was full of the subject , and very enthusiastic . " It is just as impossible for any one to tell you all about Menpes as it is to come to the and of the man himself . He is singularly many-sided . A more up-to-date man in every particular can not be imagined ; that is why he is such a good artist . He might be just as good at a dozen other things ? eertainly , with his many experiences and clear point of view , he would be a peculiarly brilliant journalist . He is one of the most delightful raconteurs of his time . He is one of the crack rifle-shots of England ? many a marksman knows Menpes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a wrestler he has met his men in Tokyo and Kyoto , and they were his . You must by all means meet Meupes . He is not only a man of to-day , but of tomorrow . He will leave a big footprint in the sands of art . And then his house is truly a house beautiful . It is worth a trip across England to see . Yes , by all means you must know Menpes , if you wish to know the London of to-day . " Calling soon afterward upon the artist at his residence , 25 Cadogan Gardens , I was ushered into the drawing-room and given tea out of a real Japanese service by a very pretty daughter of the house . Mr. Menpes himself came directly from his work-room with a long blue and white kimono over his clothes . His sympathy and quiet intelligence at once recalled to my mind Mr. O'Conor 's description of him . Of course we talked about the house . " I cull it a gold house , " he said , " with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true . Your first impression is of carved black wood everywhere over a ground of rich gold . There was also explained to me the dower idea of the house , and the different blossoms to which the various rooms are devoted ? the camellia in the studio , the peony in the drawing-room , the cherry blossom in the dining-room . and the chrysanthemums in the halls . The studio is on what we would call the second floor , but as it is the drawing-room floor , London calls it the first . It opens into the drawing-room , and on occasions the two rooms may be used as one . The ceiling is covered with open-work panels in wood ? the black camellia everywhere on a gold ground , and no two panels alike . The carpet is solid green , with a plain band of black for a border . The light curtains at either end of the room are of apricot-colored silk . In one corner is an enclosure , screened from floor to ceiling with a Japanese structure of carved wood and bronze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great room . The upper part of this screen is a kind of bronze lace , formed of tiny pieces of thin bronze joined together at the edges , yielding to the touch as if it were some real fabric . Below the bronze panels are curtains of orange-colored silk , decorated in hieroglyphic Japanese love - poems . The walls of the room are pure yellow , and Mr. Menpes finds this color very becoming to all of his sitters . From this room one enters the drawing-room . Again the walls are yellow and the general scheme of decoration is the same , except that the carpet is vermilion , and the carving of the wood-work and the wall panels , as well as the bronze-work , represent the peony instead of the camellia . There is a fireplace in this room with a curious oval - shaped mirror over the mantel . There are quaint bronzes and rare porcelains everywhere . On the same floor there is a little gallery lined with books running round an open space above the inner hall . The gallery and hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square ground-glass skylight , receive . at night , light from the same place , as electric lights are arranged to shine through it . All about the house are little Japanese lamps and lanterns in which there are electric lights . The walls of the halls arc a cool green . A fine needle-work panel , gorgeous suns in gold thread on silk , once a temple hanging in Kyoto , hangs in a black wooden frame on the upper landing of the stairway ; and lower down , in the hall , is another with a design of immense chrysanthemums worked in gold . One must indeed live in this wonderful house to know all of its beauties . Of course it cost its owner a world of labor , to say nothing of money . As I said before , it is not a copy of any house in Japan . It is worked out on an entirely new scheme of decorative art , and Mr. Menpes is the father of it all . Armed with his own plans , he went to the East in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of a year employed nearly seventy Chinese and Japanese workmen . These are , he says , all true artists , and quietly conceived and often improved upon his schemes . Metal-workers , woodcarvers , porcelain-painters , silk-weavers , all ? a host of them ? worked upon this veritable artistic masterpiece , which had then to be brought home and put together . Mr. Menpes went so far as to have even his knives , forks , and table service made in Japan , while in the kitchens many Japanese cooking utensils may be found . Among these are all manner of little carved wooden moulds , such as Japanese housewives use for butter , jellies , or ices . The owner can indeed congratulate himself upon the success of his work . He is an artist to his finger-tips , and the house is the best of introductions to the man . That is why I have given so much space to it . One might paraphrase the poet and say , " as the house is , so the man is . " The house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most perfect in the world . It is the full realization of a dream . Of the man who made it , and lives in it , much could be said . There are a hundred good stories about him which can be heard about London . One Mr. O'Conor told relates to an experience in Mexico several years ago . Menpes was staying with a number of railroad Americans ? such scum of the earth as pass for Americans in Central America . Refugees from every dark corner of the world , deadliness of every description , a gang of utterly hopeless scoundrels . Menpes unexpectedly found himself alone with this body of brigands . They regarded him as a mere wandering painter who could use no other weapon than his brush . They were full of mescel , and not very comfortable companions in a lonely desert . They began to " rag " the artist and to hustle him about . Instantly Menpes the artist became Menpes the crack-shot , and offered to beat them at their own best game . He seized a revolver and gave some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , and the artist stepped . from a very awkward position into one of assured triumph . Speaking of his early life and the development of his work , Mr. Menpes says he began his artis-tic career as a baby sketching on the floor , as he lay on his stomach . This was in South Aus-tralia , and the artistic instinct soon so stirred within him that he moved to a more artistic . atmosphere . As an artist 's life in Australia was then an impossibility , he soon came to London and the art centres of South Kensington . Here he studied to some good but no great purpose . It was not - until he came to Pont-Aven in Brittany that he got his real start in art . This was , he says , an amazing nest of French and American painters ? just the crowd to stimulate a timid young artist . After this , he says : " On leaving Brittany I came across a robber who changed the course of my life , a man well known in artistic London , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to rob me of every bit of furniture in my house , on the plea that be was cleansing me artistically , although subsequent discussions revealed to me that he had pawned the whole lot . He then took my life in his hands and attempted to model it on lines of his own . It was only after I had come in contact with Whistler that I heard a man call himself The Master . He taught Inc much . Not so much in picture-making as in living within one 's range , with a full comprehension of one 's limitations . For no man in the world knows his limitations better than Whistler . At this period , of course , I was one of the school . It was a very feverish school , living a very reckless life , and about the only solid work it did was to decorate a room which it hired as a club . We felt this would revolutionize the future of art . " How long did that last ? " I asked . " Oh , the school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out and gave independent exhibitions on my own , account . These exhibitions led to a series of travels . I did much work on my own Imes , and got a world of enjoyment out of it . Not the least enjoyment is the handling of an exhibition ? there is the whole revelation of human nature in it . For instance , to my first Japanese exhibition in Bond Street there came one day an old retired general . He confided to me that he had been in Japan , and had his own theories on the painting of a Japanese sky . " You boil a pound of rice for three - quarters of an hour , " he said , " then strain off the liquor , which you must use as a medium for your water-color , " Then patting me on the back , he added : " I am glad to help you in your artistic career , young man . " As he was leaving the room he turned round solemnly and said to me : " Remember , you can cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibitions and their subjects , which will be discussed further on . Speaking of the present and the future , Mr. Menpes said : " I am now engaged in completing my house and in painting portraits . My house is part of my life 's scheme , and I have placed it in a fashionable part of London in order to be near my sitters . My studio is a side light , not the typical studio light . I do n't flop my sitters down in a chair beneath a top light and pose them . I simply allow them to wait about and sit down where they wish , and when I have got a characteristic pose I get them to keep it as nearly as possible , but to talk or listen , as they wish , while I make innumerable small studies of expression . I collect as much material as possible , pencil drawings , color notes , and so on . In portrait-painting so much depends upon the atmosphere created by you and the sitter . I defy you to paint a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Savoy A lunch . I struggled to be conventional when I started portrait-painting . I lunched and dined my sitters all over London , but it only resulted in blurred blotches of color . " Besides telling many reminiscences of his artistic life , Mr. Menpes has of course whole new fields to draw from , and tells you much that is amusing from the experiences of Menges the crackshot , or Menpes the prize-fowl raiser . I asked him what pictures of all the many which he had seen round the world with his artist 's eye remained in his mind . I remember two he described . One was a tobacco-factory in Seville , with over a thousand beautiful women rolling cigarettes ; another was a market - place in Tehuantepec , Mexico , a market - place filled with women , certainly the most beautiful women in the world , and not a man admitted , except perhaps the artist . Think of two or three thousand beautiful women , all dressed in Tyriau-dyed skirts and ehemisettes , with superb carriage and exquisite figures ! For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bed of silver ? the silver sand of the Mexican desert . Of course a serious appreciation of Mr. Menpes 's work , of its original technique , could only come from an artist . To a layman , however , it gives a fine impression of originality and strength . The rambling career , with little devotion to any particular school ? in other words , the unconventionality of his art education is plainly connected with the originality of his work . His methods range in all schools , and indeed out of all of them . He has not hesitated to move about in any direction that seemed to promise a harvest worth gathering . Beyond a certain amount of drawing from the antique , a little study of anatomy , and some drawCI.  - -  No. 505 , - 75 ing and painting from life , his South Kensington School training seems to have amounted to very little . Perhaps his best growth was gotten in Brittany at Pont-Aven . There was a freer , more independent atmosphere , more suited to his ideas . Here he staid two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeds battling with each other there , nevertheless working steadily and indefatigably . Mr. Whistler 's influence has undoubtedly most impressed and affected his work . Here was the Master doing what the young artist was seeking to do ? experimenting , inventing , breaking away from rules and traditions , but always keeping in view the purest of ideals in art , the union between originality of intention and perfection of craftsmanship . For is it surprising that under such leadership Mr. Menpes should have developed equal skill in oil , in water-color , and the technique of etching . Up to this time he had exhibited at the Royal Academy , the Grosvenor Gallery , and other shows , his pictures being well noticed by the experts . Having worked out his field of Normandy and Brittany , he took a new step into a new field . He went to Japan , and spent eight months in that heaven of artists . He at once began to work with Japanese artists , to learn whatever they could teach him , and he says that Kyosai , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him many good hints . The result of this visit was an exhibition in Bond Street , which was one of the chief attractions of the art season of 1888 . After this he made a noteworthy step in a new field ? a large dry-point etching of " The Officers of the Archers of Saint Adrian , " by Franz Holz . This exacting task was so well done as to be quite a marking-point in his career as it came to public attention . This great plate finished , however , the nomad spirit boiled in his veins , and the great East called him again . Instead of Japan , this time he selected India , Burmah , and Cashmere . His pictures from these countries show a definite purpose . His wish was to realize the brilliancy of Indian sunlight , thedazzling luminosity of atmospheric effects , rather than to make studies of local color and native types . To secure this end he adapted a peculiar method of using oil paint , applying it to the canvas in such a way that the surface of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this device , and by avoiding hard definition in the rendering of light and shade masses , he succeeded noticeably in suggesting the shimmer of heat and blaze of light which in the tropics blanches the most vivid colors and reduces them almost to a harmony of warm grays . The results of this expedition and a number of fine dry-points made up another successful show . There have been since then almost annual exhibitions . Venice followed India-Then the East came in for a second turn , and another idea of light and color was-worked out . France , Spain , and Morocco . all added pictures to a later exhibition , . when the chief characteristic was an effort to make color swim in a luminous atmosphere . All these methods can not be described here , even in the blunt language of a layman ignorant of art terms . It may be said generally about these pictures that at first the transparency of thepigments was accentuated by applying them as dry as possible to a white priming . Later they were mixed with petroleum in order that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water-color as well as the richness and permanency of oils . The next year came the visit to Mexico , and almost a new line of work resulted , in which the chief inspiration was not aerial delicacies or subtleties of gradations , but chromatic combinations amazing in strength and brilliancy . This exhibition was held to be one of the most remarkable of the artist 's achievements , both in method and subjects treated . A later exhibition consisted of watercolor drawings of ceremonial processions , and studies in oil , water-color , and black and white of Japanese life . Mr. Menpes also devoted a great deal of labor to the rediscovery of practically a lost art ? printing in colors from etched plates . In 1 this he was quite successful , as well as in other ordinary etchings . Some of his most beautiful portraits and miniatures are etched on ivory . It is to portraiture that the artist is now giving most of his attention , and in this his work is as original as elsewhere . He paints little portraits which may have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great canvases which must be hung where they will go , instead of where they will look best . How successful he has been in this latest tine of work may be judged by the reproductions here given of his work .
