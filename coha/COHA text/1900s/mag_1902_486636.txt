That the Council must have a County Hall , few intelligent people will deny , though it might be remembered that the British Government still has a Parliament House so small that if all the members of Parbament were to take the trouble to turn up , many could not even get in . The County Council has outgrown the building iu Spring Gardens which it inherited from the Metropolitan Board of Works , and various departments are now lodged in offices scattered throughout the neighboring streets But that , to secure a hall for itself , one of the most beautiful and complete pieces of dcmestic architecture in all London should be destroyed , and this , too , at an enormous expense , is quite another matter . After Inigo Jones and Wren , England has had uo more distinguished architects than the Adam Brothers . Robert Adam was an artist of distinct originality , though his inspiration was classical . He developed a style of 11 , s own , and was strong enough to impose it upon the architects of his day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his work was confined to domestic architecture ; but in this he triumphed . Mansions still survive here and there in the country to testify to his genius ; he is also to be studied in some of the spacious houses of Portland Place , familiar to every American who stops at the Langham Hotel ; but he never did anything finer in its way and more-completely rounded out than Ine row of houses on Ade1phi Terrace , above the Embankment Gardens , overlooking th , river , near Charing Cross . And all the surrounding quarter , known as the Ade1phi , is full of his work  --  houses with doors and windows that architects and students come from far to copy , and ceilings and fireplaces that have become models for the decorator I say nothing of the memories clinging about all this quarter , m the very names of the streets ? Robert , John , Adam  --  called after the brothers , and , to go further back , after the Duke of Buckingham of ill fame ; in the record of tenants  --  from Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who have lived in this little quiet corner , and succeeded each other in its beautiful old houses and chambers . These would be purely sentimental reasons that carry no weight in politics . Nor do I Mad that the architectural plea weighed with the Councillors . Only one or two made the sacrifice of Adam 's masterpiece an argument against the scheme , and they were assured by an ardent Progressive that , if that were all , matters could be set straight by building the new hall " in the Adam style " ! ? a remark that gives the measure of the average County Councillor 's intelligence where art is concerned . If sentiment and fine architecture alone had stood in the way , I am afraid that already the hammers or pick-axes of the destroyer would be heard in the Ade1phi . But , luckily , the financial side of the question had to be faced ; ? 900,000 was the price of the site as it was before the first old brick had been thrown down or a new cornerstone laid . Economy has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the most extravagant municipal body , there comes a moment when the rate-payers can not be ignored . It is too soon to forget the heavy debt with which the new street has burdened the municipality , and the more sober Councillors stopped to ask what they were going to get for their money . And at once the absurdity of the whole scheme became manifest . For , if the Council finds it must have a new hall , and is willing to pay for it , every one must agree that this hall should be given the dignity , and even splendor , befitting the headquarters of the rulers of the largest and wealthiest capital in the world . But , on the Ade1phi site , a County Hall would be totally invisible from the north , the east , and the west ; on the east side , curiously enough , overshadowed by the Hotel Cecil , the building which , before it was turned into a hotel , was offered to the Council and promptly refused . Though but a stone 's throw from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no entrance upon it unless , as has been whispered , the scheme should later on have been found to embrace a Strand frontage at an additional enormous outlay ; though overlooking the Thames on the south , it would have no direct approach from the Embankment , unless , as also is likely , provision has been privately made for ripping up the Embankment Gardens and bUilding an imposing entrance on the river front . In a word , ? 900,000 would have been thrown away on an insignificant site  --  insignificant , that is , for the purpose  --  buried in a series of back alleys and culs-do-sac . It is no wonder that the Council 's critics have been asking what lay beneath it all . It is the sort of scheme in which , at home , honest men would immediately suspect a job . The whole movement is the more inexplicable because , when the new street from Holborn to the Strand was first projected , the idea was to reserve the space at the southern end , where the avenue ie some day to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . Here , indeed , it might have been erected with becoming magnificence , and something of that respect for order and design which in modern Paris has helped to reconcile one to the loss of the old town . When a certain number of architects were commissioned to prepare plans for this street and circus , the County Hall was an important and central feature in almost all . But , for some unknown reason , after the architects had been well paid with the rate-payers ' money , no more was heard of the competition , and , according to the present plan , the new avenue , at its southern end , is to be flanked on one aide by Short 's , a well-known public house , on the other by the Gaiety Theatre , a sort of music hall . Again , while the public was being assured that such a fine site as the Ade1phi , at ? 000,000 , was a wonderful bargain , to be grabbed at once before the price went up , as it was sure to , the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster Bridge , to cost ? 150,000 less , was dismissed , apparently , as not worth discussing . And yet here also the County Hall would have commanded the river , and , moreover , have been within a few minutes of the Houses of Parliament and almost all the Government offices  --  without question a , consideration , since so much of the Council 's business is connected with that of the state . Another suggestion , recently made , but outside of the Council , has also its advantage : the triangle , which every one who has been to London will remember , formed by Trafalgar Square , Cockspur street , and Pall-Mall East , a site in the very centre of London , the very heart of the Empire , which , if in any other capital in the world , would long since have been filled by a building of public importance , instead of clubs and shops and private offices . For the moment , however , the matter seems to have been laid aside that the Council may turn its attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , from the rapacity of the American company promoter , who threatens to run the entire metropolis  --  if not all England  --  for his own profit But one thing is sure . If the public , in a patriotic outburst , supports the County Council in opposition to Mr. Morgan and Mr. Yerkes , it will have to pay for the privilege of patriotism . To compete with private enterprise in order to save public money has no place on the programme of political " progressives . " Indeed , it is the growing extravagance in municipal government that is so discouraging . The Borough Councils , in the first flush of their new power , are even more reckless than the County Council . In the City of Westminster , which happens to be my borough , the rates  --  that is , the local taxes  --  have increased all but four pounds within the year , though for ten years previously they had varied but by a few shillings . And yet the street in which I live , and a great many others , are kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Italian hill-town . There is nothing to show for the money except the vulgar coronation decorations last summer ; a few sand-boxes ; a series of street-signs ( white panels with black and red lettering , neatly and inappropriately framed , already grimy in the thick London atmosphere ) , and another series of absurd notices , hung up on the street-lamps , directing pedestrians to keep to the right  --  and of no possible use to anybody , except on those rare crowded occasions when a handful of police can regulate the traffic a great deal better . And what goes on in Westminster is going on , in varying degrees , all over London . Extravagance is the order of the day . The County Council 's action in the matter of the Ade1phi is simply characteristic of the modern tendency . But it seems better than most of its measures as an example , because , while so little , if anything , was to be gained by the wholesale squandering of public money , so much was to be lost . MADAME DE ERUDENER . PARIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Krudener appears but for a moment in French history . In all the accounts given of the invasion of 1815 , , she is represented as having exercised some sort of mystical influence on the Emperor Alexander , who , with his brother sovereigns and allies , held for a time in his hands the fate of France and of the dynasty of the Bourbons . But little is known of her , and M. Joseph Turquan has tried to satisfy our curiosity with regard to this extraordinary person . He has entered Madame de Krudener in his already long series of " Souverainee et Grandes Dames " Turquan can not be called an historian in the strict sense of the word ; he is content to collect original documents , he makes use even of the gossip which is found in newspapers and of accounts given of past events by more or less credible witnesses . He is not a critic , and  --  his judgments are too often inspired by his personal prejudices ; as , for example , in his book on Madame Recamier . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his present volume , styled ' Une Illumines an 19e si  --  cle La Barone de Krudener , 1766-1824 , ' and made up from the accounts of her contemporaries , from letters and coedited documents . M Ch . Eynard had already published in Geneva two big volumes on Madame de Krudener , but they have never fallen under my eye , and M. Turquan says that they are very rare and can no longer be found Sainte-Beuve did not neglect Madame de Krudener , but his account is far from exhauStive . Barbe-Julie von Wietinghoff was born at Riga , in the cold province of Livonia , where she spent all her early years ( the date of her birth is uncertain , but it was probably 1760 . Her father was a rich landlord , . two of her ancestors had been grand masters of the Teutonic order . She was taken by her parents , when she was a girl , to Spa , and afterwards to Paris , where she remained during the winter of 1777-1778 . On her return , she was married at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat , who had already been married twice . In 1784 , she had a son , Paul , and soon afterwards left for Vienna , where her husband had been appointed Ambassador . She was twenty years younger than he , he seems to have been very cold and pedantic , and she was quite the reverse She stayed a long time at Venice and adopted the Italian manners of the time , as they have been depicted by Stendhal . She never appeared except escorted by a staff of elegant young men . She became at Copenhagen the mistress of one of her husband 's attaches , and her adventures soon became so public and so numerous that a separation took place between her and her husband . She went to Paris , where she arrived in the month of May , 1789 , at the time of the meeting of the States-General . She has traced a portrait of herself at the time in a novel called Valerie , ' which was published many years afterwards . " Valerie has something peculiar which I have not yet seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much grace , much more beauty , and to remain far from her People do n't admire her , perhaps , but she has something ideal and charming which forces attention One would say , on seeing her so delicate , so slender , that she is a soul . However , the first time I saw her , I did not find her pretty . She is very pale , and the contrast of her gayety , - of her lightness , and of her face made to be sensible and serious , produced on me a singular impression " In , Paris she became acquainted with M. Suard , an academician ( well forgotten now . like many other Immortals ) She had found Baron de Krudener too old , but accepted the attentions of Suard , who was twelve years older than the Baron . She threw herself into his society , became acquainted with Bernardin de St. Pierre , the author of ' Paul and Virginia , ' and the Abbe . Morellet Suard took a wife at the age of fifty-two . not without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consoled herself , and on a journey in the South of France made at Montpellier the acquaintance of a handsome lieutenant of dragoons She returned to Copenhagen under his protection , and announced herself to her husband as fleeing from a country where the Revolution was raging Baron de Krudener was weak enough to allow her to come back to his house , where she had the impudence to bring her lover , the officer , es a sort of secretary . This was more than Baron de Krudener could bear , he sent his wife back to her parents at Riga . The French officer returned to France , though he was a nobleman , he remained and fought in the Republican army . He became a general under the Consulate . In 1793 , Madame de Krudener went for her health to Berlin and Leipzig , in the latter city making the acquaintance of the brilliant Count de Tilly We have a letter of hers , written from Leipzig . addressed to Bernardin de St. Pierre , which was reproduced in the complete works ' of , the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells of her future plans of life . She speaks in it of her children , of her son , of her little girl , whom Bernardin de St. Pierre used to call " Her Beatitude " Krudener was appointed ambassador to Berlin , and his wife joined him there , she had for a time a salon where she received Count de Tilly ; the Chevalier du Douffiers and his friend Madame de Sabran , to whom he had recently been married at Breslau ; several French emigres , among others M de Chenedolle , well known afterwards by his great devotion to Chateaubriand , and Rivarol , the pamphleteer . Her restless mind was not satisfied in Berlin ; her ambition was to return to Paris , and her health became again a pretext . She made several stops on the road  --  at Teplitz , where she took the waters ; at Lausanne , at Geneva ; at Coppet , where she paid a visit to Madame de Stael . When she arrived in Paris she found it in that turmoil of pleasure which followed , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her place in the new society ; she became the mistress of the singer Garat , who was all the fashion at that time , the " incroyable des incroyables . " This liaison did not last long , and Madame de Krudener was soon ashamed of it , In her last letter to Garat , she says : " It was not you that I loved , it was a phantom created by my imagination . . . . I see you now as you are , and I must confess that I never loved you . " Krudener died at Berlin from an attack of apoplexy ; his wife lived in retirement for a short time at Lyons , but soon resumed her ordinary life , under pretext of showing the world to her daughter . She was seen again dancing the " shawl dance , " which has been described by Madame de Stael . But she wished now for something more , she wished to have a literary reputation like Madame de Stael , and wrote the novel ' Valerie . ' I doubt if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krudener enlisted all her friends in praise of it , and she herself took great pains to spread it . and recommend it to the public . She wrote what we call " r  --  clames ' ? ( puffs ) , which were inserted In the press . She was a precursor in that line , and had an advertising agent . " All this , " justly says Sainte-Beuve , " is neither delicate nor handsome . " She writes to a friend : " I thank you for your verses , they are charming . Could you not , through your relations , get some from the grand feiseur De17,112 ? Delille translated Virgil into French verse . Never mind the contents , they would be useful to Sidonie her daughter You know how much I love her ; the world is so stupid ! " The success of ' Valerie ' was great . People compared It to ' Werther ' ; hats were made " a la Valerie . " Madame de Krudener thought she had reformed the public Forgetting her own life , she writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former lady companion " The success of ' Valerie ' is complete and unheard-of . There is in it something supernatural . Yes , my friend , God would have it that these ideas , this purer morality , should be spread in France , where they are less known " She was entering now on a new phase ; she was becoming an apostle , a preacher . She sent her book to Bonaparte ; he threw it away , and returned not a word of thanks to the author . Thinking that the volume had been lost , she sent a second copy , magnificently bound . Bonaparte noticed the binding , glanced over the book , and said to his librarian : " It seems that Madame de ' Rael has found her Sone : after ' Delphine , " Valerie ! ' A worthy pair ! The same Pathos , the same bavard , age The women will be pleased with this sentimental extravagance . You may advise this mad Madame de Krudener , from me , to write her books henceforth in Russian or in German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame de Krudener ? never forgave Napoleon . She left Paris , and we find her back in Riga in June , 1805 . Her life , so unedifying thus far , took a new direction : she became excessively pious . Her religion took a mystical form . It was at this period that she entered into relations with Queen Louise of Prussia ( after Jena and Auerstaedt ) . She spoke to her of the misfortunes of Prussia , and of the Russian armies which were marching against Napoleon . She used the figurative expressions of the Bible , and there is no doubt that the unhappy Queen fell somewhat under her influence , and accepted her consolation and words of hope . Madame de Krudener visited the Moravian brethren , and at Carlsruhe she became acquainted with an oculist , Jung Stilling , who pretended to have direct communication with God She was well disposed to adopt illuminism ; she had trances , and lived for a time in Stilling 's house . She visited in Alsace Oberlin , a holy man who had christianized populations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She was looking in every direction for extraordinary religious character 's , but it did not prevent her from cultivating and increasing her worldly acquaintances . She had a correspondence with Mlle. de Stourdza , a lady-in-waiting of the Empress of Russia . In a letter written on the 27th of October , 1814 , she predicted , in the figurative language of the prophets , the downfall of the Bourbons , who had just been restored- " The storm advances , those lilies which the Almighty had kept , emblem of a pure and fragile flower which had broken an iron sceptre , . ? . have appeared only to disappear again . " These letters were shown to Alexander , who was much struck by their prophetic language . He bad himself a great tendency towards mysticism He wished to see Madame de Krudener . She met him just after the landing of Napoleon at Frejus , when Alexander was on his way to Vienna . When she left the Emperor , he was conquered , she had foreseen everything , she had the secrete of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , and as soon as she arrived he called upon her ; he saw her afterwards every day . Had Madame de Krudener anything to do with the wording of the extraordinary Act of the " Holy Alliance " ? The Emperor Alexander held the pen ; was she the moving spirit ? The style of the Act would almost justify the affirmative . We must-leave Madame de Krudener here . The Allies once gone , she fell back into her usual life of worldly agitation , intermixed with politico-religious conversations . French society never wholly adopted hcr ; her ill conduct had been too notorious , her literary merit was too small She died in the Crimea on the 25th of December , 1824 . Correspondence . THE MAIN QUESTION TO THE EDITOR OP THE NATION : SIR I have been greatly interested in your weekly comment and editorials on the coal strike . You have devoted a great deal of space to wholesale condemnation of Mitchell and his followers , but I have looked in vain for any word of enlightenment as to the proper course to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , have sought redress for grievances , or made demands for a more equitable share of what they help produce , and have failed to obtain satisfaction . You ridicule trade unions and their " windy spouters " of leaders . In what other way shall labor protect itself ? It quite often happens that workmen have real grievances The Nation has grudgingly admitted some to the miners Their demands for a larger share of what they produce , either by increased pay or shorter hours , are sometimes just . When these are denied , what then ? When good , conservative workmen ( there are some , you know ) have tried to get a hearing for their grievances and have been met with a refusal which is none the less unsatisfactory because it is courteous , what should be their course ? Grin and bear it ? Are workmen to be compelled to accept every condition which an employer chooses to impose ? Do you not know there are employers of labor who would grind the life out of a man if they were not kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business by refusal to work and by keeping others from doing so ? I am a non-union workman ; I am no sorehead . I have been working for seven years for a very fair firm in a good trade , and receive first-class wages . The firm I work for is insured in an accident insurance company . Should an employee be injured in the performance of his or her work , the case is turned over to this company If the accident is a slight affair and unavoidable , or not due to the negligence of the employee , he may be paid for time lost . If the acci dent is a serious affair , resulting in maiming or permanent injury , and the employee sues for damages in the courts , the insurance company fights the case for the firm , and assumes all the charges incident thereto . Now , if the employer has a right to insure against the stupidity or negligence of an employee , why has not the employee the right to insure against unreasonableness in an employer , unjust conditions , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A poor kind of insurance , you say , which does not insure ; but it is the best they know , and it has been partially and indirectly effective . All that labor has to-day is not due to unions ; a large share is due to politics , a very small part to philanthropy , and certainly labor unions have had some share in bringing about the improved conditions under which men work to-day . The insurance has insured a little . What scheme have you for a more effective insurance ? The case of an employee injured in a factory and suing for damages is being tried in the courts by the insurance company . In other words , " the fight strike is on , call in the tithes of all the insured union band , they will be paid without question . " The case of an injured employee is being fought , therefore it is unjust . " The strike exists , therefore it is just . " The employer is fighting the case with money he has not earned . " The strikers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned . " I do not Want to take too much of your valuable space . During the last three or four weeks I had hoped some one of your more enlightened subscribers would feel impelled , by your exaggerated position , to write some word of protest or interrogation . I have read the Nation for some four years with great profit and keen pleasure . I appreciate the justice and truth of a great deal you write concerning labor unions . I am only one of thousands of nonunion men who deprecate the strike , execrate the boycott , and have nothing but the harshest condemnation for violent interference , or interference of any kind , with a non-union worker , but who feel , nevertheless , that , wrong as are some of the methods of the union , they have some justice in , and cause for , their position Granted the strike is anarchy and the purchase of votes with the offer of favorable labor legislation criminal . Take these away , what means remain to labor of obtaining fairer conditions under which to work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there has been no enlightenment for the strikers or the great army of workers , union and non-union , whom the coal strike , or any strike , directly or indirectly affects . What light have you to offer , not on the coal strike  --  we shall soon have all we want of that  --  but on how to avoid such strikes without placing an armed soldier over every disaffected worker ? ? Respectfully yours , HENRY CHEQUER. 7 Pinion STREET , SOMERVILLE , jiLses Nothing seemed to us more imperative , in the late crisis , than to divest the question at issue of all extraneous considerations . Granted that - an army of workingmen in virtual control of the output of a necessary of modern industrial and domestic life may conspire to stop work as lightly as if they were employees of a sweat-shop in a great city ? a postulate which as moralists we can not admit ; granted that they had a right to build up their organization by a system combined of stress of class opinion , boycott , . and persecution , directed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we shall never give our support ; shall we proceed from this to allow the right to terrorize the coal region and prevent the prosecution of mining by means of non-union labor , on the spot or ready to flow in if safety is assured ? In other words , shall labor be free in this country whether a strike is pending or not ? Our answer is , So should it be , so must it be if we are to remain a nation of freemen . The sins of the operators , the sins of the miners up to the time of their going on strike , we put aside for discussion at the proper moment . The issue , as made up , was whether the operators should give over the direction of their business to an outside organization  --  or to any organization ; and whether they should be violently debarred from filling the places made vacant by the strikers by free contract with non-union men ? We feel that the country owes them a debt of gratitude for their firmness in both particUlars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only conceivable methods in a government like ours . All else are revolutionary . Constant appeals to public opinion , open deliberations , entire abstinence from menace or persecution , united with sober living and exemplary behavior , will not fail of their effect with the American people , though it may be only in the long run. ?
