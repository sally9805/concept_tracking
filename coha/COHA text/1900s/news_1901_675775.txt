txt From present indications it is probable that President Shaffer 's strike order , issued last night to the Amalgamated Association members in the employ of the American Steel Hoop Company , the American Sheet Steel Company , and the American Tin Plate Company . will be obeyed , and the great struggle between the Amalgamated Association and the steel companies will be on in earnest to-morrow . In the union mills of the three companies against which , a sVike has been declared , it Is predicted that not a wheel will turn to-morrow . An effort will be made also to close clown some of the non-union mills of the companies and to cripple the rest . The Amalgamated people are very sanguine of success . " The strike was not of our own seeking , " said President Shaffer to-day . " It was forced upon us . We were not contending for wages , but for principle  --  for selfpreservation . The tin and sheet people will not be able to turn a single wheel to-morrow . We have our forces thoroughly organized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not heard to-day from a single lodge in answer to my strike order . but an answer is not necessary . The order will be promptly obeyed by all our men . But there will be no trouble . Labor organizations have changed . The Amalgamated Association is not the association it was twenty years ago , not even five years ago . The men are more readily controlled ; in fact , we have our men under control . " Developments to-day indicate that Pitts . burg is going to be a pretty lively strik ' centre . The most interest attaches to the Painter mill on the South Side and to that of Lindsay &; aleCutcheon in Allegheny . Bash mills are controlled by the American Sheet Hoop Company and have hitherto been aggressively non-union , and much ( Upended upon the action taken by the men in these plants . The employes of both mills held open meetings to-day and both decided to strike to-morrow . The Painter mill employs about 400 men and the Lindsay &; McCutcheon mill about 300 . I. W. Jenks. manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the attempt to be Rade to tie up the two mills , but he had heard such strike talk for several months past . Mr. Jenks said both mills would resume to-morrow morning as usual . The fight at the Painter mill is to he made the fight of the strike . Both sid-s will make stubborn resistance . If iii . ' Amalgamated people can close this mill they believe they will have won the gre , , ter part of the strike . The mill is not only an important one , but the Steel Hoop Company has for years succeeded in thwarting the efforts to unionize it . President Shaffer was asked to-day if he had set a time when , no settlement having been , effected . he would extend the strike to all the subsidiary steel companies of the United States Steel Corporation . Ile said he Must decline to make his plans known at present . It may be said . h , , ae ? - er , on the strength of reliable information , that the strike within its present limits is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference last week the representatives of the Steel Corporation were repeatedly warned that the association wa-s much stronger than they knew . They were even told of the organization of mills of which they had ' no knowledge . But the steel men would not believe that the association was as strong as it was claimed to be . Thus it is believed the first purpose of the association is to show its strength by confining the strike to three companies . When that show of strength has been made , whatever it may prove to be , the association expects the companies to ask for another conference . If the companies show no inclination to make a settlement the strike will be extended to three more companies . If the trust will not yield then the strike will be extended to such independent companies as sell their finishe  --  I products or raw materials to companies against which a strike has been declared . Should the strike attain such proportions it would be likely to go still further . The Amalgamated Association and the Federation of Labor two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was agreed that the - association , when on strike , could also call out the steel men of the federation . The latter has organizations in many mills whose workmen are nit eligible to membership in the association . In describing the final conclusion of the conference In the Hotel Lincoln on Saturday afternoon . President Shaffer said that after the final proposition of the manufacturers had been taken up , and from courtesy on the part of the workers has been discussed , there was a painful silence for about five minutes . The workers waited for some further remark on the part of the manufacturers and the latter appeared to be waiting for a remark from the workers . Finally one of the manufacturers ' committee broke the stillness by saying : " Well , I guess there isno further use in waiting for other developments . The men have nothing to offer and the manufacturers have gone as far as they can in justice to themselves . " President Shaffer replied that he accorded with this view . If the manufacturers had no other proposition to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Warner Arms , President of the American Steel Hoop Company , said then : " I am sorry that our friendly relations in the past should have been broken in this way : we have done everything in an and , cable manner . With this breach once opened . it must be understood that the onus is on the side of the Amalgamated Association and the public will understand this . "
