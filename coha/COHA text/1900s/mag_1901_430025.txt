 | T0-MORROW is the future which is near enough to be quite clearly and distinctly conceived , and yet is never quite attained . The exegesis i.e. , Scripture interpretation ) of the twentiethcentury is much more difficult to conceive , and will be antiquated in the twenty-first century . The exegesis of tomorrow only produces the lines of to-day 's , but will never be antiquated , because it is ideal . It will never , indeed , be attained . But it can be indefinitely approximated . Perhaps it may be imagined that the science of exegesis does not change ; or at least that there is no very marked change from decade to decade since the vagaries of allegorical interpretation , making the spoons and snuffers of the tabernacle symbolize the Christian graces , and the scarlet woman of Revelation the Pope or Napoleon Bonaparte , were consigned to the limbo of theological curiosities . I assure you such an idea is erroneous . The science of exegesis has made enormous strides during the nineteenth century , but it has still greater strides to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the revolutionizing results of criticism . Less than twenty years ago criticism meant scarcely more than the study of textual variants , the minute changes of reading which have crept into the text of the New Testament in course of its transmission , and which in less than one case in one thousand materially affect the sense . Criticism to-day means the study of the origin as well as the transmission of the text . It asks not only the comparatively simple question , What did the author write ? but , Who was he ? and How came he to write as he did ? The difficult and abstruse but vitally important problems of authenticity , date , sources , occasion , credibility , are all involved , and upon their solution depends in large measure the value if not the meaning of the writing in question . But not only has the term criticism , by the necessity of growth , come to include the higher as well as the lower , or textual , so that no man can to-day be esteemed competent to interpret the Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their origin ; the term exegesis as well implies a different method from that of twenty years ago . At that time traditional theories of the historical conditions which so largely determine the sense of Scripture writings  | were either deemed so certain , or critical theories so uncertain , that comparatively little use could be made of this principal source of light upon the author 's meaning . Moreover , the battle was but half won over the crude dogmatism of what we may call eisegesis ( i.e. , reading into the text our meaning , as against exegesis , i.e. , reading out the author 's meaning ) . Advocates of different theological systems were then still hauling their drag-net through ten centuries of Jewish literature in search of phrases to set up as proof-texts , making havoc of the author 's sense in order to secure the authority of his name in support of their own ; and against this egotism , intrenched as it was in popular favor by the pious pretense of being ? Heaven save the mark ! ? " Scriptural , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fixed rules of grammar and vocabulary . In the monumental works on Biblical grammar and lexicography , and the great concordances to Old and New Testaments , produced during the nineteenth century , we have enduring bulwarks , impregnable so long as men have skill to employ them , against the inroads of arbitrary interpretation . They are our firmest guarantee that the Protestant standard of faith and practice will not be turned into a laughing-stock under the gibe , Scripture means whatever the individual interpreter wants it to . Our highest tributes of honor to the Geseniuses , the Buxtorffs , the Redpaths , the Thayers , Winers , Moultons , and Geddens , will be none too high for the men who have forever silenced this jeer by disposing of the arbitrary interpreter , and restoring to the Scripture writers the right to mean what they say whether in agreement with modern theological views or not . When Hebrew and Greek words and constructions are proved to have a definite , specific meaning , instead of being at the mercy of the hunter for proof-texts , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a science , rather than a craft of mental jugglery . All honor , then , to the great masters of Biblical grammar and philology , and may we prove the sincerity of our praise by acquiring a mastery of the superb machinery they have bequeathed to us . And yet the very emphasis laid upon rigidly scientific philology , necessitating microscopic analysis of single words and phrases , has proved in some respects almost disastrous . The very type of " grasshopper exegesis " antagonized was unintentionally re-enforced by the unavoidable concentration of study so minute , to the comparative neglect of the larger context . If a class took six weeks to get over three verses of John , their ability to apply the argument from dominant Johannine ideas would not be great ; and yet , after all , it is this argument from context , and above all the larger context of the writer 's entire product ? yes , and of the literature and thought in which his ideas appear to have been molded ? which must finally dispose of the grasshopper exegete . The popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate nuggets of divine utterance dropped from time to time , but all of a piece as to value . and gathered by the mysterious work of the canon-makers into one bag , from which they may be drawn at random , aggravated by the Massoretic division into verses . which Robert Stephens in 1551 extended for convenience of reference into the New Testament , receives but too much aid and comfort from such minuteness of method . And if in one sense we appear to be honoring the Scripture by devoting such extreme labor to the analysis of the smallest words and phrases , and the discrimination of the minutest shades of meaning . it is to be feared that the very honor may be perverted into a promotion of that bibliolatry which characterized the scribe and Pharisee , and which , in spite of our Lord 's explicit denunciation , has been for centuries the stronghold of all that was most bigoted , most intolerant , most unchristian in his own Church . For nine pupils out of ten who have never known any other method of exegesis than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dead and dry thereafter as Egyptian mummies , the very name of exegesis will be a nightmare , and a critical commentary will be the ninefold wet blanket with which the last lingering spark of Pentecostal fire in Apostolic words is extinguished . It is like botanizing in a laboratory on the dried specimens of a herbarium . With sufficient violence to nature the process can be learned , results can be achieved , results of indispensable importance have been achieved . But , after all , to appreciate flowers one must  | know them in their natural environment ; and to know , to love , and to utilize woodland , farm , and meadow for what they are to the hunter , the husbandman , and the lover of nature is something which , when sacrificed to mere laboratory analysis , makes us not the gainers but the losers . Fortunately , there is no need that we should sacrifice it . Exegesis in its nature should be inspiring , as its subject is inspired ? not in the dry , scholastic sense , but in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciously touched with coals from off the altar of God , who " speak that they do know , and testify that they have seen , " who pour out their souls in ardent , impassioned earnestness of conviction , because mastered by the eternal truths of which God has given them glimpses . They are men who cry out with the prophet : " The lion bath roared , who will not fear ; the Lord God hath spoken , who can but prophesy ? " and with the Apostle exclaim : " Woe is me if I preach not the gospel ! " To be a true exegete is to range one 's self alongside these men , find their environment , take their point of view , fight their battles , until we think their thoughts after them , till our hearts echo an Amen to their ringing words , and our pulses throb with the impulse to take up and herald their glorious gospel , if need be to suffer for it , as they suffered , rejoicing that , though heaven and earth should pass away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can conceive of two things , and only two , which can make that a dull study which , by however laborious effort , brings us into living , vital contact with men baptized in fire and the Holy Ghost , with writings which even now are the greatest factor in the transformation of the world from the kingdom of the beast into the kingdom of the Son of God . One of the two would be a pedantic rabbinism teaching men to search the Scriptures with a microscope because they think that in them they have eternal life , so that , though these testify of the Man of Nazareth , yet they never come unto him that they may have life . Disciples of such a school are convinced that the Scriptures are allimportant , and , drawing the false inference that therefore each separate clause and syllable in itself is all-important , they can not see the wood for the trees . One tree , one branch , one twig , absorbs them , and they hear not the sound of the rustling in the tree-tops as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wearisome indeed is the servitude of the letter where the sweep of the Spirit has passed on and left us plodding . And equally wearisome must it be to the man whose soul really questions whether the importance so long attached to these Biblical writings is not , after all , one half pretense and the other half mistake . Suspect that even the abiding results of the vast libraries of learning spent in the elucidation of these Biblical writings are largely wasted because the writings themselves have no such unique importance as has been attached to them , and the mastery of the subject will prove indeed a dull study . There are those who think that such is the unavoidable result of the higher criticism , and who oppose it accordingly . If a knowledge of the processes , generally simple and humble enough , through which these writings have come into being and into the position of authority which they occupy , begins to supersede in the public mind the childlike notion of a mysterious , miraculous origin , the result must be , they reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been greatly exaggerated , and a corresponding indifference to them . Reluctantly , I admit that there does seem to me to exist a certain type of criticism the motive and animus of which are scarcely more than this . Believing that the Biblical writings owe their honor in preponderant degree to a factitious authority , their paramount influence being due , not to their intrinsic worth , but to a false notion of their origin , critics of this type naturally deem it a service to the truth to unmask the pretense . Now , the more we have of bibliolatry the more we shall have of this type of criticism . which finds all the justification it has in bibliolatry , and all the victims it can claim among those who never had a vital love for the Scriptures through personal apprehension of their worth , but only a superstitious awe of them for the assumed miraculousness of their origin . If this is all that is meant by faith in the Bible and its inspiration , then , indeed , that faith has much to fear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , however  | needful , its task will be one of destroying its own roots . For what has produced the study of the origins of the Biblical writings if not the vital interest we have in their content ? And how can that interest survive if it depends upon a notion of their origin which it is the tendency of investigation to destroy ? But there is another type of criticism , thank God 1 which otherwise conceives its task . Conscious though it is that the authority , inspiration , and value of Scripture are often wrongly made to rest , not upon its intrinsic power of kindling the spark of spiritual life , but upon notions of its origin regarded as more truly divine , because more extraordinary and mysterious , than the humble , unobtrusive processes out of which they really come , criticism of this type yet feels its mission to be , not to destroy , but to fulfill . It seeks to become the servant and not the enemy of exegesis , to investigate this story of the origins of our sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal as divine , at least as much as the abnormal ; partly that the knowledge of these origins may illuminate as never before the doubly sacred page , and bring the reader into that close and living contact with the writers which shall make him know by the burning of his heart within him that they were men inspired of God , vessels of the Pentecostal fire . Thank God for such criticism ! and thank God for the thousands of students who to-day declare that it has made the Bible for them a new and living book , and torn away the veil of scholasticism from their eyes I am well aware that there can not fail to be a disappearance of a certain type of factitious reverence for the Scripture writings , as criticism , whether constructive or destructive , dissipates the notion that they owe their authority to the miraculous circumstances of their origin . This is the common type of honor paid them . But can we truly say that it promotes to any appreciable degree the reading of them with practical , vital interest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the most abnormal and magical conception of their origin and nature are these the readers who are most inspired by them ? If not , the loss from the disappearance of belief in an inspiration which failed to inspire is more apparent than real . Multitudes who declare that the critical theory of the Hexateuch has deprived them of the religious solace they found in the tradition of its Mosaic authorship , when questioned , are found to have the vaguest idea of its contents , and far less interest in its relation to the progress of divine revelation in the history of Israel than the humblest of the higher critics Criticism , destructive and constructive , will inevitably dissipate much facitious and nominal reverence for the Scripture writings , for the same reason that the evolutionary theory of creation to many minds seemed inevitably atheistic . Whether it be a Bible or a world that God is creating , an insight into the how he does it , the wonderfully humble , simple means that he employs , will inevitably suggest to a certain type of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work in this simple way : the thing must be creating itself . Now , the whole study of the origins of the Scripture writings and their relation to contemporary thought and events is directed to nothing else than the " how " of God 's working in this incomparable spiritual creation . Accordingly , the apparent loss in interest and reverence will be great in direct proportion as this interest and reverence have been founded , not on their intrinsic nature or redemptive power , but upon a theory about them . The real loss will be a very different matter . It will be like the transference of a bad bill receivable which has long swelled the column of assets , to the and loss account where it belongs . We have lost ? what ? An illusion that threatened us daily with bankruptcy while we trusted it . And the gain ? We have begun to understand the Scriptures genetically , which is almost equivalent to ssaying we are making the first beginnings , popularly , at understanding them at all . To the creadit of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to destroy the refuge of bibliolatry by a study of the historical processes out of which were brought ? we say not by what power ? the sacred writings and the canon , we may still place the present tendency to transfer the ground of Scripture authority from a rabbinic to a Christian basis ; to find the evidence of inspiration in present power  | to inspire rather than in an alleged experience of the writers in the unknown past . To the credit of criticism , comprehensively conceived as the most fundamental , vital prerequisite of interpretation , we must place a revival of interest in the Biblical books for what they are and can do as literature ? a revival truly unprecedented . Side by side with an indifference born of growing doubt as to the traditional grounds of Scripture authorityan indifference which our fathers would have met by stern compulsion , enforced hours of secretly hated " Bible study , " and verses memorized by the score and hundred , but which to-day meets us , even in unexpected quarters , in a really appalling ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of whom I have spoken already , that the study of Scripture origins has transformed the Bible for them from a fetich into a channel of the water of life . I have dwelt thus at length upon the higher criticism , historical and literary , partly because it is by far the most important phenomenon in the Scripture study of the last half-century , as the spirit of the age itself has been rightly characterized by Professor Paine as pre-eminently a spirit of historical investigation ; but also because , whether for this reason or some other , the science of exegesis seems now to have reached a transition point . the most momentous since the leadership passed over from the Alexandrian school of Clement and Origen , with its insane vagaries of allegory , typology , and symbolism , to the Cappadocian of Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia . Then . once for all , the Church laid down the grammatico-historical as the only legitimate method of Scripture interpretation . Then , once for all , a bridle of restraint was thrown upon the subjective dogmatism which imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictate . Since that time we have been engaged in perfecting this sole legitimate method , which honors the Scripture writers by permitting them to set forth their eternal truths in forms which to us may be obsolete . But hitherto the emphasis has all been laid upon the first term of the compound . We have been grammatico-historical in our exegesis , until exegesis has seemed to mean nothing more than a kind of Biblical grammar and philology . Seminary chairs have been endowed under titles which implied that the occupants were expected to engage chiefly in teaching the sacred languages ; as if exegesis meant no more than hermeneutics , and the student 's highest ideal were to be the making of one more translation or serving on some new revision committee . I have before expressed my appreciation for the splendid , laborious services of the philological exegetes and textual critics of the past generation . Would that twenty years ago I had appreciated at their true worth the minute and painstaking studies in grammatical and lexical exegesis to which I listened here , with their conscientious system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our teacher , with Puritanic asceticism , feared to relax into mere delightful reading and historical discussion , such as made for us the real charm of his instruction ! May the laborious work of that generation obtain the meed of praise it deserved but did not seek ! Yet it is now clear that the time has come when methods of exegesis must change , or the science itself be choked in the dust of its ponderous tomes . For what else has the study of grammar , vocabulary , construction , use of language , and history of textual variation been carried almost to the last degree of perfection , and all the results indexed , shelved , filed away and labeled within easy reach , whensoever decisions taken may be called in question ? For what else have meantime the archeologist , historian , and higher critic been feverishly at work , theorizing , disputing , destroying , reconstructing , till out of the chaos , often sneered at as hopeless , begins to rise an edifice of accepted results ? For what else has the Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the exegesis of to-morrow and the new century might be historico-grammatical , that we might begin our study of the sense with a study of the times , the thought , the circumstances , the mind out of which the phrase took form , and , understanding our subject genetically , understand it as never before ? This I take to be the vital change which is on the eve of taking place in the science of Scripture interpretation . The change from the exegesis of  | to-day to the exegesis of to-morrow will be a change from grammatico-historical to historico-grammatical , with all that the change of emphasis implies . But some one will say : " The change , even if desirable and practicable , comes too late ; this age has outlived the time when the Bible could claim its unique rank . Literature in even the humblest home is abundant , cheap , and sometimes good . The churches are empty , the preacher has lost his influence , or struggles to maintain it by competing with the Sunday newspaper in the extreme recentness of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absolutely ' up-to-date , ' how can Biblical interpretation obtain a hearing ? Who wants to hear the Bible expounded ? " In my opinion , some of those very men whose absence we most deplore from our churches are they who want it=-men who , when they go to church , want the minister to talk his business and not theirs , who want the meaning of the Bible and not of current events , politics , and social science , who want the bread of life and not another bucketful of Sunday newspaper froth . Whether I am right or not in the notion that there still is such a thing as a hunger and thirst after righteousness , not oversupplied with sermons on the mount ? whether I am right or not in my notion that the very most " drawing " and " up-to-date " subject that a minister could discover would be such exposition of the Bible as the thoroughly equipped historical critic and exegete could give if he would and dared , I will do you young men the honor to assume that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete . The classics of Greek drama , philosophy , history , oratory , of Latin prose and poetry , may . The education of the daily newspaper and novel may produce authors who will cast into the shade not only Shakespeare and Milton , Goethe and Dante , but consign to oblivion the misnamed immortals of Parnassus . It may be that we shall witness this , though just at present the tendency of increasing culture would appear to be rather to add a greater luster to classic fame and a larger influence and greater popularity to the literature of Greece and Rome . But when may we look for the decadence of the Bible ? I will tell you when . One of two things must first occur : Either men , to theeverlasting shame , decadence , and rui must cease to care for that ideal of a vine humanity regnant over a universe order , peace , and love , the revelation of which forms the essential organic unity of the Book of books , and which culminates in the portrait of Jesus of Nazareth , Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , better way must be found for bringing men into closer , more vital and spiritual , more practical and effective contact and sympathy with it . Some better means of implanting that ideal and that life must be discovered than the appreciative , intelligent reading of the writings which come to us touched with its fire , breathing its aroma , conscious of its presence , impassioned and inspired with the knowledge that in Him they have seen the Father . Until some other literature has appeared which can bring the life of the careworn toiler , the household drudge , the high and the lowly , the poor in spirit , and the intellectually and morally great into touch and sympathy with a " human life divine " and a " victory that has overcome the world , " the place of the Bible will be unique and unquestioned . None of us here have any lack of faith in humanity as craving , however blindly , this water of life ; nor in the Bible as the one perpetual channel to it . Only its " inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . who are here to make it subservient to the parched spiritual thirst of the world , must be inspired by it , or your exegesis will never bring its inspiration to bear upon others . How shall you do it ? In one word , learn to sympathize with its characters and writers . Study yourself into the circumstances and thought of the period . Fearlessly discriminate between what is local and temporary in the author 's conception , and so belongs but to the garment , and what is eternal principle , and therefore constitutes the essence . You must be able to say , With all my heart amen and amen to what is of the latter . whether in Isaiah , in Amos , in Paul , or in John . Above all , if the life of Jesus himself ? the heart of it all ? is to be a true ideal to you , not factitious , not good because others have declared it so , but good and absolutely good in your own soul 's eyes . you must follow , step by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put yourself in His place . Even of His incomparable words and deeds you must be able to say ? as you will say when you have a historical appreciation of the whole context of thought , belief , and circumstance ? " That is the very thing that I would have wished to say and do . Heroes of a part of life I have had before . This is my hero of heroes , the hero of the whole . " Such , then , is the result for yourselves first , and thereafter for others , which I pray may come through historico-grammatical interpretation , the ' exegesis of to-morrow . If we realize but a portion of the ideal , our reward shall be great , immediate , and enduring .
