OF old . muskets drove the Abna- kis off the coast of Maine . To- day , money is driving away another race . Between Kittery Point and Quoddy Head " resorters " have acquired hundreds of headlands and thousands of islands . A phalanx of cottages fronts the sea . More than half the States in the Union are represented in these summer colonies . Cove and cape , the coast is pretty well monopolized by nonresidents ; " no-trespass " signs are so thickly set that they form a blazed trail . The man from the city resents intrusion . For that matter , the queer squatter people who have been dispossessed find little relish in being stared at as human curiosities . Therefore they have hidden themselves in the deep gashes of the coast cliffs ; their little huts are now at the head of crooked coves where pleasure craft do not venture ; or they have located on little nubbins of islands that city people do not buy . for these islands may be approached only at flood-tide . And in their retreats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent intrusion as heartily as do the rich folk on their reserves . So the " queer folk " live alone ? and it is said that isolation develops eccentricity . The ocean creeps to the doors of their huts , and the winter waves thunder in their ears ? and there are those who say that the din of the sea beats curious ideas into the head . Even the Maine " native " himself , the thrifty farmer who sells his produce to the city " sojourner " or takes summer boarders , does not understand the queer folk of the lonely coves very well . The nooks that they have chosen for hiding-places have no roads leading to them . The islands that they have pre-empted have been " set off " by act of the Legislature from the nearest coast towns , in order that the towns may not have the unfortunates on their hands as paupers . These people who have been abandoned dwell in a sort of " no man 's land . " They do not pay taxes , they do not vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ridge of coast ledge or down that stretch of water ? for fashion has picked most of the choice spots on the Maine coast for its sojourn . But the queer folk are not interested in any display that fashion may make . They are not envious , they do not want to beg . Where penury and pride meet in the cities there are heartburnings . But the man tossing in the battered dory in the swash of the millionaire 's yacht neither sighs nor glares , provided he be one of the queer folk . For the queer folk are queer in one respect especially : they dwell content in their own world . which is often a world of illusion ? for solitariness and the sea breed strange thoughts . Ossian Dustin , of Newcastle , would not change places with a millionaire , so he says . Yet Uncle Ossian , at eighty , lives alone in a little but with a dirt floor , and earns about fifty dollars a year by sawing fire-wood and doing odd jobs . But fifty dollars supply his frugal. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote to hunting for Cap'n Kidd 's treasure , in the buried existence of which he implicitly believes . ? ? The ease of Uncle Ossian illustrates the type of that content that relieves these hidden human tragedies of the Maine coast of some of their pitifulness . During most of his long life , as often as he has found opportunity , Uncle Ossian has hunted and dug along the ragged Lincoln coast . He has toiled nights , for the most part , believing that in the night a treasure-seeker can best circumvent the enchantments laid on buried pirate spoils . He has kept vigil oftenest in the region of Cod Lead Nubble . He searches with a treasure-rod made by his own hands . He has the tip of a cow 's horn , plugged with wood and containing various metals . In the wooden plug are stuck parallel strips of whalebone , and he clutches these strips , one in each hand , and walks along , balancing the tip of horn . When he passes over the famous iron pot the tip , thus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried treasure . There is nothing remarkable in Uncle Ossian 's quest , for other men in Maine have hunted for Kidd 's treasure . But his radiant courage and his unfailing optimism are striking . He believes that he " is always right on the edge " of finding the gold . He says his spade has struck against the iron pot several times , but that enchantment has whisked away the treasure . lie expects that eventually his own charms will prevail over the powers of evil . He believes that the long waiting and the disappointments have been merely a test of his courage and good faith ? remarkable philosophy in a man who is eighty years old and has not succeeded . He is reanimated occasionally by the sight of a figure all of shining gold that comes rowing up the reach from the sea , and he is confident that this is a good spirit sent to guide him to the treasure , and that the spirit . will sometime prevail over the imps who watch the iron pot . Uncle Ossian affirms that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he says that the money will " come in handy " in his old age , and that he shall first buy a stone for his mother 's grave , and then a house with a floor in it for himself . It can scarcely be said that Uncle Ossian 's unfailing cheerfulness springs from any philosophy of life that he has evolved . But after our talk I came out of his dingy but with the feeling that probably some of the proud folk in the cottages down the bay needed pity more than he . On Little Spruce island I found three old men , brothers ? William , Daniel , and Nehemiah Shanks . They have lived there all their lives in a tumble-down little shelter . They are melancholy old men . They are contented , but the sea has brought to them a strange , brooding , wistful solemnity . and Daniel never married . Nehemiah has had a poor little romance that broke his heart . When he was young he used to go with his father to Portland to sell their fare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken was his mother ? for no one except the Shanks family has ever lived on Little Spruce . A woman of the water-side in Portland made him her prey for the sake of his little hoard of savings , married him , induced him to forge his father 's name and draw the family savings from the bank ? and then deserted him . He went home with his confession of wrong-doing . " Then you must look out for the boys after Pm dead , " said his father , forgiving him . Nehemiah has spent his life " looking out for the boys , " who are now infirm old men . " It is my duty in return for my father 's pardon of my wrongdoing , " he told me , " and I have tried to do my best . I am the youngest , and I am best able to work . " For more than twenty years William has never come out of the but into the sunshine . He told me that he feared the sun might heat his brains and interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a blanket hung across one end of the hut . William sits behind this blanket and fixes his eyes on the sunlight that enters through a knothole , and " composes . " He states that now he is the author of a thousand pieces of poetry . He has committed nothing to paper . He has memorized all of them , lie says . While William idles , Nehemiah tills the little garden , catches fish , digs clams , and cooks . He is cheerfully the burden-bearer , and with some pride says that he is the head of the family ; for when his father imposed the trust on him he did so with a ceremony truly patriarchal : he gave into Nehemiah 's hands the staff on which he had leaned for many years , saying that it should be the badge of Nehemiah 's authority . Nehemiah described the scene to me , tears trickling down his wrinkled cheeks . Memory was only a partial spur to this grief . Daniel , a f ter more than sixty years of obedience , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another flood had been prophesied to him in a vision , and that he had been ordered to build an ark on Little Spruce . Little Spruce is owned by a lady in Boston , as part of au extensive holding of islands . The Shanks brothers have been permitted to remain as squatters on condition that they do riot disturb the standing timber . Nehemiah gave this promise to the man ager of the estate . Daniel , though threescore and ten , took the family axe , hand-saw , and hammer and proceeded to his labors on his ark . Nehemiah stood in front of the lordly spruce that Daniel was about to attack with the axe , and in the name of the Shanks family forbade him to chop . Daniel had the zeal of monomania and insisted . Then Nehemiah brandished the family staff and threatened to chastise the disobedient son of their father . Daniel , in a frenzy , made at his brother with the axe , routed him , captured the years ago a woman , as old as he , came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fourteen years she was off that patch of island only twice . " Hermit Tripp , " as he was called , believed that Kidd had buried his treasure on Bushy . Old and decrepit as he was , he began to dig the island . He wore out shovel after shovel at his task . When he died he had shovelled nearly half the island off into the sea , cleaning the earth down to bed-rock . He died in August , 1908 . On the night of his death a summer gale swept the coast , wrecking cottages and flattening acres of trees on the main near Bushy . When the old woman realized that Tripp was dying she took a big hand-bell and , though so weak and old that she could walk only with difficulty , she went out on the high land of the island and rang the bell with all her strength , hoping that in some lull of the gale the sound would be heard on the main . At midnight she went to the but to minister to the old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shore , ringing the bell , blinded by the lightning , drenched by the rains , and blown about by the gale . People heard and came off to the island the next day . But Bushy Island is one of those " set-off " places , a no man 's land so far as the law goes . Three towns at first disclaimed responsibility for the burial expenses of a pauper . The old woman stayed alone with her dead a second night . Then came men and dug his grave , a pebble-toss from his hut . and laid him there . Some one read a bit from the tattered old Bible that was found in the house . Those who had buried the old man went away and left the old woman alone . Chance and idle curiosity brought me to Bushy one day . I had supposed that charity had provided a home elsewhere for the lonely tenant . But she was still there . She was ill , she was hungry , she had not sufficient strength to walk or to build a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a scanty supply in a jug . It is not necessary to go into the details of the measures promptly taken for her relief . At first she concealed her name . We discovered what it was from some old letters that were flying about the little yard . She " had been some one " once on a time . She has a brother living , a worthy and prominent . man in an inland town . Ile came promptly when I communicated with him , and went with me to visit his sister in the but on Bushy Island . He had not seen her , had not heard from her , for many years . Ile had sought for her , but she had disappeared . He and she are the only ones left of a well-known family . One can imagine how fiction would have handled this reunion . But real life has its own grim methods . It . was high tide and the launch swung close to the corner of the hut , under which the waves were lapping . The brother hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " he implored . She gave him only a careless glance when he sat down in the unspeakable shelter . " For God 's sake , take me out ! " he gasped . " I ca n't stand this ! " We were not in the place ten seconds . He had not heart or strength to make this forlorn creature know him for what he was . He hurried into the launch and left the island . This is how fact tersely dismissed a situation that fiction would have lingered over . It is proper in this connection to state that later the brother appointed me his agent and almoner , and before the fall grew late the woman was removed from the island to a comfortable home , where she is now cared for . Her mental faculties that had been impaired by her privations have been regained in a measure , but she has never made any inquiries regarding her family . On our visits to her we find her reading her Bible and , to use her words , " preparing my soul for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attention a character who ought to be interesting from a sociological point of view . He is an addition to the varied army of vagrants ? he is a water tramp . While search for some honest persons who would take the old woman as a boarder was in progress , those interested in the case carried cooked food each day and plenty of dainties . She declared that she felt perfectly safe to stay alone nights ? and , in fact , the but was too wretched a place to serve as a lodging for any person except the poor old creature who had become accustomed fo it . Now appears a human derelict in a barnacled old dory ! He seemed to sniff those food delicacies from afar . He billeted himself on the poor old woman , coming in the edge of the evening , remaining the night , and departing before charity came again with heaped hands . This especial water tramp has been a peregrinator in Casco waters for many years , a stolid , weather-beaten man , and even the gulls of the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . There are a dozen or more of his ilk scattered alongshore . The city man who comes down to his cottage in the spring and finds a window forced , the left-overs of his larder devoured , and his summer clothes gone , has this gentry of the coast to thank . The water tramp steals only what he can eat and what he can wear . He dwells in a cottage as long as it suits his taste or convenience , or until the crackers , canned goods , and firewood are gone . Then he moves to the next . He is not a good housekeeper , and the cottager who - finds his debris in the spring has a bad quarter of an hour and a lively desire for vengeance . If he will keep sharp watch , he will find his old coat on the back of a " dory vagabond . " But it does n't trouble the water tramp if he is sent to jail . He goes up-country stoically , and returns to seek his living in the same old way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty thieves with almost the proportions of a modern Viking . He came coasting along from Nova Scotia in a gray and seamed old Hampton boat , leisurely seeking adventures and three meals a day , and arrived in the Perna-quid region . He lingered there for some weeks . His name was MacTush , he had the swagger of a border chieftain , and his hair was the hair of a Norseman. and he found favor in the eyes of a wife whose husband was away upon the Grand Banks on a " mack'rel-chancin " trip . So the stranger stole the wife , four children , and such furniture from the house as could be stowed in the Hampton boat . He sailed back to Nova Scotia . As time went on the wife regretted . But it was not regret for the abandoned husband . Here once more fact differs from fiction . She was sorry that she had not been able to take more of her belongings . The Viking 's but in Nova Scotia was but scantily furnished . She kept remembering certain choice things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of lack of room in the Hampton boat . Sho urged her new lord to go back and get another load . The story of how she urged came out later in the Lincoln County court . The Viking went back a few months after his first foray . The wife told him that the house would be locked up and the husband away to the Banks once more . The freebooter was removing the rest of the furniture ? finding the house untenanted , as the wife had prophesied ; but he was apprehended by friends of the absent husband . The judge in imposing sentence stated that a thief who would steal a man 's wife , four children , and half his furniture , and then come back after the rest of the household goods , was too much of a rogue to expect mercy , and 7,1facTush is in jail for a number of years . Loads Island , off the coast of Bristol , occupies perhaps a more anomalous position than any other land along the Atlantic seaboard . It has a considerable population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and are intelligent . They . and their ancestors have dwelt there for more than one hundred and fifty years . But the men of the island have never voted in any election , town or State or national . They have never paid any State , town , or county taxes . They resisted the draft at the time of the Civil War , and drove the rocks . They say that they do not need the protecting arm of State or national government . They raise money for schools and roads , elect municipal officers to administer affairs , and seem to get along very comfortably as an independent principality . Flattering overtures have been made by Bristol ; by coming into the fold the islanders would receive State school money , have an opportunity to vote , and obtain other advantages . But Londs Island will not affiliate . There has never been a crime committed on the island , no one ever locks his door , and almost every one is a relation of some one else . While Bonds Island is genially beckoned into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder from Phippshurg ? the town that contains the site of ancient " Augusta , " pioneer of all New England settlements . As a " no man 's land " Malaga has more striking peculiarities than any other island alongshore . There are about fifty persons on it , of all grades of negro blood . and most of them descendants of a runaway slave who came and hid there more years ago than any man about there remembers . These people form a strange elan . They have married and intermarried until the trespass on consanguinity has produced its usual lamentable effects . They are as near to being children of nature as it is possible for people to he who Are only a stone 's throw from the mainland and civilization . They lack entirely the spirit of thrift and of providing for future emergencies . Winter after winter , through all the years , they have shivered and starved , but never does November find a wood-pile on Malaga , nor a week 's supply of food in reserve . To counsel on economy and to preachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . A coast missionary took in hand one especially improvident family of six ? father , mother , and four children well grown . Spurred by him , they fished , dug clams , sold bait to trawlers , and at the end of the summer had saved about seventy dollars among them .

Charity , after a few experiences with the " Malagaites. " as they are called by their indifferent neighbors on the main , grows a bit discouraged .

A while ago the agent took along a notary and had marriages performed between six couples whose naive ideas of wedlock had not reached out to the fact that a ceremony was necessary . In summer all the people of the colony work as best they are able , but the scope of what they can do is so limited and the returns i%roney so small that it is not surprising that winter finds them with hands empty . Women put on trousers and boots and dig clams with the men . Occasionally farmers on the main hire the women to work in the fields . The men are too lazy . The woman who earns the most money is one who lives in what was once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main . As she can not stand upright in her house , she climbs upon the roof and there toils at her tub . Certain amateur sociologists have been wondering and planning what to do with Malaga and the Malagaites . Popular subscription has erected a neat little schoolhouse , in which a teacher , paid by the State . began her work in November , 1908 . The children will be taught how to read and write , and the women will take lessons in sewing and darning and patching . There have been few needles on Malaga in the past .
