 | FROM Rangoon that morning the steamer was to sail for England by way of Colombo . Before the tender left the wharf , the port doctor had aligned the cabin passengers for the plague , and with temperature bulb and pulsesearching fingers had countersigned each for health . Now , in his own boat , he came to the steamer , swinging far down the stream , to examine the crew . These , patient Mohammedans , had for an hour awaited him , standing in two long lines on the upper deck , starboard side , well aft . Deliberately he went along , feeling pulses and noting temperatures , and as , with eloquent thumb but no word , he signaled approval to one after another , a dusky face would grin expansively and a joyous native leave the deck and dive below . But near the end of his labors he paused unusually long and made an unusually careful scrutiny . It was a young man , not much more than a boy , the searching fingers lingered on , and when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit and go ashore , wild terror made his dark face livid and horrible to see . From that moment he was a thing sealed for loathing and abhorrence . His companions of the forecastle drew back from him , the observing passengers hurriedly shrank to right and to left , the white sailors gave  | him a wide berth , and , as he reappeared with his little bundle , the first officer shrieked at him to keep to the other side of the deck . Down the swung stairway he crept , the palsied image of fear , his hands so tremulous he could barely cling to the railings , his eyes wide and like glass , his knees seemingly scarce able to bear him up . Halfway down the side he paused and his terrified gaze swept the coldly menacing faces above him and below , while his lips worked dryly and men thought he would cry aloud . In all the eves that met his he saw not one gleam of pity , not one show of help , and plainly overawed he crawled on . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him aft and aft , until , with his bundle , he clung desperately outside the rail and just above the rudder . And then , on the steamer , the first officer turned to soothe the cabin passengers . He said : " It 's nothing . You need not be alarmed . Nobody gets the plague but the blamed natives . " That was the word I was waiting for .  | I knew it was coming . Like insects , heat , and buffalo butter , it had been an inevitable feature of every Indian day . How many pictures the sound of it recalled ! " But is n't the plague very bad in Rangoon , you know ? " the cautious Briton had asked , in the Calcutta tourist office . And the agent had replied , with scornful mien : " Plague ! What is the plague ? We never think about the plague . Literally , we pay no more attention to the danger of catching the plague than to the danger of catching cold . Do n't you worry about the plague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agra I had asked the Cawnpur man whether the plague was not prevalent in his place , and he had whiffed his cigarette and answered : " I suppose likely it is , but , you see , we do n't hear about it . The plague is confined entirely to the natives , so of course we do n't know . " And day after day , whenever an English resident appeared , some one was certain to ask him ,  | " How about the plague ? " And he was certain to reply , " The plague is nothing ? no one gets the plague but the blamed natives . " Yet of the " blamed natives " ( men , women , and children ; not dogs as you might infer ) the plague in India carries off more than one million a year . One in fewer than three hundred dies of it annually . Month after month it goes spreading its way through the country , increasing its appalling death-lists , slaying more this year than it slew last year , certain to slay more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most pertinent answer to its existence is the almost universal refrain , " No one gets the plague but the blamed natives . " When first the visitor to India hears that remark , he ascribes it to the eccentricity of one individual , perversely ambitious to shine as callous or flippant . At the one hundredth repetition , he is obliged to admit that the sentiment is real and general . In the end he comes , however reluctantly , to the belief that , in spite of the humane instincts and conscientious labors of thousands of good men and women , the phrase is not far from typing the habitual , though doubtless unconscious , attitude of the governing class in India . Why bother us about the plague ? The plague is an affair of the natives ; they bring it upon themselves . What can we do ? Every year a thousand visitors to India , harassed on every side by evidences of the devastating epidemic , ask , " What is the government doing to stamp out or stem this frightful disease ? " And a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves driven in their own despite to the same answer , " It is doing practically nothing . " Yet the experience of Europe through many centuries has proved that the plague can be annihilated by any country that will take the trouble to adopt the simplest measures of sanitation . Once it raged horribly through the Continent and in England . In London it caused the deaths of 117 , - 435 persons in the first half of the seventeenth century ; and in the great epidemic of i665 , chronicled by De Foe , 68,596 persons died of it . Visitations of the plague were wont to thin the population centers all over the Continent , where now its very name is forgotten . With no weapon but cleanliness , governments in Europe made of plague epidemics an inert entry in the dusty annals of medicine . In India the horrible thing stalks on almost unopposed . I know of no fact stranger , or less credible , or less welcome ; but there it is , clear in the mortality figures , clearer still in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , that the problem is too vast , or too complicated , or too peculiar , or that the resources of the government are too small , or that the sum of money needed is too colossal . We can believe in the kindness , sympathy , and humane alertness of the gentlemen that conduct the affairs of India . We can say we feel sure that they will do all that human power can do to change such a terrible situation , and with that general statement rest content . Or we can push aside the whole subject as one at the other end of the world in which we have neither concern nor interest . But no excuse and no explanation changes in any way the awful fact . The only part of the civilized world in which controllable epidemics are left to hew their way , with slaughter more terrible than the slaughter of a hundred battlefields , is India . Not that the government views the situation with absolute indifference ; I do not mean that . In 1899 it appointed a commission of medical experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , to investigate the whole subject and devise means by which the epidemic could be suppressed or checked . I suppose that medical history contains hardly an instance of a better piece of investigation . From months of tireless inquiry in all parts of India , from thousands of witnesses , from the patient sifting of facts gathered with labor and peril , the commission compiled the model report for all such bodies . Conscientious , painstaking , complete , and perfectly lucid , it is an immense and invaluable work . The commission found that the safeguard against the plague is common sanitation , and that the way to suppress it is to introduce cleanliness and to stop overcrowding . More than that it could not do . When the commission was appointed the annual plague deaths in India were fewer than one hundred thousand . When it made its report they were fewer than eighty thousand . Now they are more than one million . In the face of this amazing record , I sup-  | pose it would be superfluous to say that the recommendations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very good government , as we have been taught by English authorities to believe , and most capable in building railroads and beautiful courthouses . But the recommendations of the commission have not been followed , and since that report was made the annual plague deaths in India have increased thirteenfold . Yet , as I have averred , the government remains not quite callous nor indifferent . It maintains a medical staff , whose business is to study the plague and report thereon . It has , at Bombay , a great and well-equipped station in which the bacteriological aspects of the plague are under ceaseless scrutiny . And it has a serum ( Haffkine 's ) , an injection of which is said to insure for six months immunity against infection . I made some inquiry about this serum . A young English medical officer told me it is really an excellent thing , but of little avail here because the natives do not like it . " You see , " he said , " the plague is all the fault of the blamed natives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and submit to the injection they would not have the plague . " " That seems reasonable , " I said . " Why do n't they come in ? " " Well , you see , they are so stupid . The first time the injection was tried there was some little error in the mixture , I do n't know what , and the doctors shot it into a batch of eighteen , and all of them died in about ten minutes , and now the natives are prejudiced against it , and will not take it if they can avoid it . That is what you must contend with in India ? stupid prejudice . It is the people 's own fault if they have the plague . But you need not worry about it ; nobody gets the plague but the blamed natives . " If it were only in regard to the plague that the government held its hand from the thing needful , you might think that the plague problem was too tremendous , that it overwhelmed the authorities , that no effort could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India of absolutely unnecessary and easily preventable famines , and the other millions that die of preventable fevers and of the needless miasmas in Indian cities , attest that it is not merely the size of the plague problem that paralyzes the Indian government . There is something radically wrong in this country . Take note of it . Elsewhere in the world , all lines of race and class division disappear before great disasters ? shipwrecks , famines , epidemics , earthquakes , conflagrations . No one cares whether the distressed persons are of his own nation or circle ; all are fired with the one blessed purpose to succor and relieve . It is not so in India . What is it that makes this glaring exception to the universal rule of human kindness ? What is it that makes an epidemic in India of less concern than a threatened famine in a small area of Japan ? Why is it of less moment that one million perish here of the plague than that one hundred die in Catalonia because of an earthquake ? Why do the English residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionate in other respects , feel so little interest in the sufferings of their dark-skinned neighbors ? In India the common ties of humanity have been crushed out by the perfected systems of class and rank . In India no man has any bond of brotherhood outside of his own order . In India hatred has taken the place of the instinctive interest in human welfare that elsewhere has been the uplifting power of mankind , and men , scorning those below them , scorned by those above them , live in isolated planes where alone they have human fellowship . In India the ideas of class division , class hatred , the supremacy of the idle and the inferiority of the toiler have been carried to their logical end . And this unconcern is the perfect fruit . Elsewhere we know , or are beginning to learn , something of the strength and possibilities of these ideas . But elsewhere men are novices , botchers , apprentices in the science of caste : in India they know it all . There no man reared in this frightful doctrine feels sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life until he knows whether that other man is of his own order . There , among the millions reared in this doctrine , human society is merely a succession of steps where every man hates and loathes the man below him and recognizes no bond nor obligation of humanity beyond his own level . With other men he can hold no intercourse . Just as with a certain degree of hatred he must look down upon the man one step below him , so that feeling must be multiplied as his eye traverses the descending scale . If , in the course of life  | or affairs , it becomes necessary to transact business with the man on the lower step , he bawls his orders with every expression of abhorrence , and , wherever the influence of Europeans is not strong , if from his inferior he must take money , as in making change , the coins must be thrown upon the ground , whence he will stoop to gather them ; receive them directly from the hand of his inferior he will not ever . No wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no relief that it might bring in time of direst distress , could make it other than a thing abhorred . In the fixed scale of descent some classes are merely inferior , while some are " unclean , " or " untouchable " ; but from whatsoever class a man be born in he has no escape but death . Children born in an " unclean " caste remain " unclean " ; children born in an inferior caste remain as their fathers were . Nothing that they can do can in the slightest degree change their situation . They were born " unclean " ; their ancestors were " unclean " ; their descendants will be " unclean " till the end of the chapter . And what is it that constitutes their " uncleanliness " ? The fact that they work ? nothing else . They may be most estimable persons , and of irreproachable life and habits . Centuries ago their ancestors labored with their hands ; hence , now , these must labor with their hands . To labor with the hands , to do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , to produce , to add to the world 's store of wealth and comfort , is " unclean . " Hence , by all men that do not labor with their hands , all these must be despised . Nor can the person thus degraded hope to change his occupation , and thus affect his status . He can not hope that some day he and his children will cease to labor with their hands , and thereby cease to be " unclean . " In India the son of a carpenter is a carpenter ; the son of a shoemaker is a shoemaker ; the son of a barber is a barber ; and the son 's sons will continue the father 's calling so long as the system lasts . Every artisan in India looks back upon a line of ancestors that followed his occupation , and knows that by no chance shall his son do otherwise than trace again his own toilsome steps . He knew from his earliest consciousness that this was so ; that his place in life was absolutely fixed for him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , nor integrity of character , nor industry , nor zeal , nor skill , nor invention , nor discovery , nor improvement , nor celerity , nor knowledge , could change by the breadth of a hair the place that he should fill in the world so long as the breath might remain in his body . He might become the best shoemaker in India , invent new ways of making shoes and new materials for them , amass wealth and gather learning , acquire all the lore of all mankind , become the most distinguished scientist of the age , and men of other nations might come long journeys to see and talk to him and treat him with respect ; but in India he would still be a shoemaker , would still be " unclean , " all the men of the ranks above him would turn from him with abhorrence , the touch of his hand would be contamination , and he must do reverence to every ignorant and greasy Brahman that came his way . And so must the lot of  | his sons be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this most hideous and fatal system , all labor with the hands is degrading and all persons performing it are despised , different degrees of " uncleanliness " depend upon the character of the labor performed . Thus , to give a few illustrations from many , a weaver is less " unclean " than a carpenter , a carpenter is above a housecleaner , a house-cleaner is above a streetcleaner , and a street-cleaner is above the pariah or no-caste man . Every trade or occupation has its exact place , arbitrarily fixed , in the scale of degradation . If a house-cleaner should sit on the same bench with another man and discover the other man to be a street-cleaner , he must hasten to the temple to be purified , and until he has been purified he has lost caste , he is degraded . If a carpenter , going home at night , should stumble over a shoemaker lying ill or wounded in the way , he must by no means render succor ; he must flee to the temple to be absolved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty , drink of a vessel and subsequently learn that the vessel had been touched by a carpenter , he must by purification restore his damaged rank . It is not enacted statute on the one hand , nor merely custom on the other ; nor is it a matter of feeling or of personal dislike . It is religion and basic faith and iron custom , inviolate for hundreds of years , sanctioned , upheld , and strengthened by one government after another that has perceived its immense potentialities in dividing and restraining a subject people . Above all the men that labor with their hands , in whatsoever way , are the tradesmen and shopkeepers , also with subdivisions into classes , above the tradesmen is the useless and now almost idle warrior class , above the warriors is the Brahman or priestly class , and with these grand divisions the structure of the system is complete . Wealth or material situation or success has nothing to do with the caste of any man . You may hire for your cook or valet a Brahman of the purest strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been on the verge of starvation . The meager beggar to whom you toss alms in the road may be of a very high caste ; the well-fed groom , resplendent in gorgeous livery , flashing by on a carriage that cov- ers the beggar with dust , is very likely of a caste a mile below the beggar . Time no more than effort can break down these walls of division . One of the wealthiest and most distinguished families in Calcutta , the famous Tagore family , lost caste about two centuries ago . Members of this family have received honor from the government , have conferred great benefits upon city and country , and have been noted for their numerous charities and benefactions . One exerted himself all his life to further native education ; another helped to endow Calcutta University . All are enormously rich , and all bear enviable reputations for goodness , honesty , and philanthropy . But the wall of caste has never fallen for them ; they are still hated and avoided by their countrymen , exactly as they were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is many a ragged artisan that would not sit on the same bench with a Tagore nor touch the end of his robe . Pain , suffering , penury , even death itself , is nothing to the Hindu compared with the loss of caste . Many a Hindu that in the old days would yield nothing to the most fiendish tortures quickly surrendered his secrets when threatened with something that would contaminate him ? a piece of cowskin , perhaps , or a glass of water that had been touched by a pariah . In , I suppose , thousands of cases , persons that have hopelessly lost their caste have abandoned their homes and wandered miserably along the roads until death overtook them . Thousands of others have thrown themselves into the Ganges , or deliberately starved . Three Brahman girls , who had been degraded by a Mussulman , went before a judge to demand vengeance , and when the judge declined to interfere killed themselves in the courtroom . At a town called Buj Buj , a widow lost caste by falling in love with a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family degrades the others also , her eldest son immediately swallowed poison and died , and his remaining brethren fled the country . A husband shares a wife 's degradation ; a wife goes down the steps with a husband . For more than one hundred years a Brahman family of Santipur has been outcaste because one member fell in love with the daughter of a shoemaker . Even when the rajah himself interposed to remove the ban his efforts were unavailing . The  | barber would not shave them , the potter would not sell to them . My bearer or guide through a great part of India , a Jabalpur man , told me this story . He said that in his town was a young man that had studied in the English schools , had associated with missionaries , and had gradually imbibed lax notions of caste and the orders of society . With one thousand other youths he had sat in a great shed of bamboo mats , and had taken the examination for the Bombay University . In preparing for that examination he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetters , free to do as they pleased and make their own careers . And it seemed to him that the whole system of caste was rather foolish and useless . He was of the weaver caste , which is clean . He married the daughter of a man in the shoemaker caste . She also seems to have imbibed heresy , for , instead of having the wedding procession , the cradle carried through the streets , and the high-priced mummery of the priests , they went away and were wed in European fashion . When the young man 's father heard of this he sent for his son and asked , " My son , is it true that you have thus slain your father and mother and degraded them before all men by wedding out of your caste ? " The young man said that so far as the marriage was concerned the statement was true enough , and the old man fell dead at his feet . The bane of the system is enormous and manifold . That it has destroyed enterprise and paralyzed progress in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungeons of the past ; that solely because of it India lives now in the first century instead of the twentieth ; that the system stands as the impassable barrier against every new idea ? all this is only a part of its sum of evil . For it is because of this system that millions starve to death in India , and nobody cares ; that the government tax-collector wrings from the toiling peasant his last drops of sweat and blood , and nobody cares ; that these terrible pictures exist of wanton and riotous superfluity on the one hand and of want and pain on the other , and nobody cares ; that the plague kills one person in every three hundred , and nobody cares . Why should we care about the sufferings of creatures that all our lives we have been taught to hate and to look upon as far lower than horses and dogs ? How can we exert ourselves to relieve the necessities of those that we believe it pollution to touch or speak to ? But you may think the British government has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no responsibility for caste in India . Not for its origin , @#  | that is true ; but for the continued existence of caste the British government has every responsibility . Next to the priesthood , the strongest influence that upholds caste and makes it the intolerable burden of India is the British government . Not a priest observes caste more scrupulously nor inculcates it more assiduously . Whatever the government has to do in relation to the Hindu is invariably done with exact regard to caste . In the prisons the prisoners have cooks of the right gradations of caste to prepare their food . In the army every precaution is taken to avoid treading upon caste prejudice . In famine times , when the government is issuing relief to millions , Brahman cooks are secured to prepare for starving Brahmans the food that will save them from death . Again and again , as in the street-car lines and the railroads , it has been proved that the government can , if it chooses , sap the root of this huge blight and destroy it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because it is caste alone that keeps India in subjection and makes British supremacy cheap and easy . Ask any intelligent Anglo-Indian ; he will tell you . If there could be anything like solidarity or united feeling among the two hundred and ninety million Hindus , the crust of the volcano whereon Britain sits to extract the wealth of India would break through in five minutes . Much , of course , is to be allowed to the fact that , in the last analysis , the caste systems of India and of England are not truly alien ; so that often the English resident in India is not particularly impressed with an essential difference in his environment . Yet , in estimating the causes for the strange apathy of the English conscience toward India , the investigator is left no doubt that , first of all , it springs from something else . For , having been long inoculated with this notion that caste must be sacredly maintained , that caste is the bulwark of British rule , that without caste " we should have to begin again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , compassionate men , become indurated to conditions they feel they must not attack . For the work that would eliminate the plague would utterly disregard and break through caste distinctions . In other words , caste chains India a prey to the plague , as for centuries upon centuries it has chained India a prey to every international thief and conqueror going , from Alexander to Clive . You read how Tamerlane drove like a knife through the country , his army a handful compared to the vast hordes that surrounded him ; how with insignificant strength he placed his foot on India 's neck and forced upon her a line of monarchs that ruled nearly four hundred years . You read how Nadir Shah , the Persian , with no more than one hundred and sixty thousand troops , mastered India , captured Delhi , and carried off the great peacock throne and inestimable riches . You read how the Mahrattas expelled the Mughals , and the English expelled the Mahrattas . You read how India wearied of British rule in 1857 , and how a corporal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now you see 140,000 people ruling 296,000,000 , for the most part hating their rulers and feeling the tremendous revenue drain that their rulers exact , and yet submitting without a struggle to the foreign domination . And for all these mysteries is the one explanation ? caste . However much an Indian may resent the yoke of a foreign lord , he would , as a rule , rather submit than join hands with his inferior . However keenly the toilers of the country may feel the weight of the monstrous tax burden they bear , they will not unite to throw it off by force , and the British government witholds from their hands every other means by which they could redress their wrongs . Hence the spectacle of nearly three hundred millions of people taxed into periodic famine , and misgoverned into perennial epidemic . Go among the Indian farmers and observe them plowing with crooked sticks and threshing with wooden flails , as their ancestors plowed and threshed four thousand years ago . Caste ! Observe this great area of wonderfully fertile soil that produces so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go into the Indian workshops and see the artisans working metals or making brick , or weaving cloth with the implements of primitive man . Caste ! Observe the incalculable waste of effort and energy , the huge unprofit of cheap and uninformed labor . Caste ! Take note of this vast and joyless population , the men that stretch out their lives in barren toil for meager subsistence , the sad-faced women that never smile , the children that never play , the millions on millions of lives that never have  | known hope , nor comfort , nor sufficiency . All caste ! Why should a man seek better methods for his work , when he knows that no effort nor attainment can better his condition ? Why should he try to improve his poor little mind , when he knows that he and his children are doomed to the one pit of misery for ever and ever ? Why should he devise or adopt better instruments or cultivate more land or raise better crops or increase the earth 's productiveness , when he knows that for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of rice and a hole wherein to crawl ? Every invention that has blessed mankind has come from enfranchised poverty led on by opportunity and seeking to improve its condition . Where conditions are fixed immutably by birth , where poverty has no opportunity and democracy is unknown , there isno invention , no advance , no hope , no enlightenment , but men and women wallow on from birth to death , dull and listless as their beasts . These , then , are the results of the idea that the men that labor with their hands are a class apart from and below the rest of mankind , when that idea is allowed to work itself out to its logical end . This is the result of class distinctions , when they are allowed to bear their natural fruit . How admirable seems the whole system , viewed in the light of India ! You stand some day in Piccadilly , the police lines stop the traffic , the lower orders on the omnibuses are halted , and the sidewalks are filled with tiptoeing crowds because some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Backstairs , is going out to drive . Beautiful sight is the Duke of Muckamuck going out to drive ! So handsome look the outriders ! So brilliant are the trappings ! So important looks the duke ! So inferior seem the common orders ! Well , in India they have carried only a little further the idea contained in the stopped street traffic , the brilliant outriders , the beautiful duke . Only a little further , and here is a country of inexpressible wealth and bewildering resources made by its class divisions the hopeless prey of pestilence , famine , and misery as of every conqueror that has a long sword and a strong arm . It , too , has beautiful dukes and handsome outriders and glittering pageants , its then of vast wealth and gorgeous palaces and exalted rank . But when the invader came , all these were of no more defense than burnt paper ; the only men that could have turned him back were the men that labored with their hands , whose strong backs were bent above the anvils , whose two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these men class barriers had made the union impossible ; of these men ages of degradation had broken the spirit and warped the minds . Can a dog fight for his country ? Is it possible a cur should have the strength and spirit and initiative to hurl back a Tamerlane ? Frightful are the retributions exacted of the nation that wantons with autocracy . In the cases of Greece , Rome , Spain , France under her kings , they were memorable enough , but all of these together fade before the spectacle of troubled and soulless India . A HIGH-CASTE TYPE
