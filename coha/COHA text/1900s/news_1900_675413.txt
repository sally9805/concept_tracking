txt That part of the report of the Philippine Commission where the Commissioners point out that the problems of civil government in the Philippine possessions are too complex , new , and difficult to be intrusted to any but men of proved ability and high character is deserving of the careful attention of President . If a Civil Governor is to be sent to Luzon to administer the affairs of nine million people unused to our institutions and strangers to our laws , he must be a man of first-rate capacity who measures up to that great work and its responsibilities , or the President will have many ocl casions before he leaves the White House to regret deeply that he ever heard of the Philippines . A hasty choice would very likely be a poor one . What is the need of haste ? What is the present need of changing the status uf the Philippines ? The political society of those islands is not settled . The conditions range from peace in some parts to war in others . It may be long before peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile we can never say confidently what is going to happen next . But the requisite power and the requisite elasticity to meet all the changing conditions are found in the military government of the islands under the direction of the President . To lay aside that freedom of action now for the more rigid forms of a civil establishment might be both a source of embarrassment to the President and of injustice to a people as yet most imperfectly prepared for the rule of an American Civil Governor . Very likely the President may wish to meet some of the criticisms of the anti-imperialists before the campaign opens by conferring upon the Filipinos the supposed benefits of a civil government in which they will have some part . In the fullness of time civil institutions and home rule will be blessings for the Filipinos . But they might be curses now , and to us as well as to them . The Administration may well be slow to let itself be hurried into an unreasonable policy by the unreasonable course of the anti-imperialists.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
