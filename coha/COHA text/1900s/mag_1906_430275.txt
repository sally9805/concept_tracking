 | THE Old Town was set in a meadow , green grass to the right of it , green grass to the left of it , stretching away toward the horizon until in the south and east it came up against the black moor , and toward the sunset a little way met the sands of the western sea . What sport was there for boys in such a country ? My own boys asked me that question with something of impatience on a walk through those fields , for they had been sizing up the lads of their own age on baseball and found them no good . They threw the ball " just like girls . " Not many days after one of them came home with a bruised nose and an increased respect for Danish muscle . It was good for fighting , anyhow . But , in truth , we did not run to baseball when I was a boy , and as for fighting , we had no more than was good for us . When any Uitlander bragged , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't have time for either , so busy were we with our sports . There was the brook that led to the old manse , hidden quite behind a windtossed thicket of scrub-oak that had run over the sunken walls since the days when bishops were fighting men who went clad in iron to the wars . The brook was barely a step wide , and we boys could easily jump over it in places ; but the wild birds built their nests in its banks in spring , and up where we had our early bonfires it widened into a dark still pool , hedged in with mint and forget-me-nots , where wary trout were always darting from the deep shadow . I go to seek that pool first thing when I return to the old town now , and it is not changed . But the boys of to-day seem to have forgotten it . And then the creek that meandered through the meadows miles and miles from the great peat bog where our winter fuel came from , making one turn more tortuous than another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly alive with yellow perch and their silver-scaled neighbors , whatever you would call them . We called them " skaller . " I could go to a dozen of them blindfolded , I think , even now , fifty years after , and bait my hook and throw it in the exact spot where a perch is waiting to pull the cork under with one quick , determined jerk . No nibbling about him ; his mind is always made up and ready . Sometimes in my dreams I sit on the edge of the creek in one particular spot I have never forgotten , with feet hanging over the edge , the slanting sunlight on the dark waters , red-finned perch and silver fish darting hither and thither , and the soft west wind in the grass ; and then I am perfectly happy . Our ambition did not rise to five-pound pickerel in those days . Maybe there were n't any . My little boy and I found plenty two or three years ago , and little else . My pretty fish seemed to be gone . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust on dry land . If he had , we got square with him . We ate him in turn . They had reduced the catching of him to an exact science . Drop your fishbait there , right in the edge of the rushes , so ? a swirl and a sudden tightening of the line ! Let him run , and take out your watch . Eight minutes to a dot , and he is off again . That is when he turns the bait around in his mouth and swallows it , having lain by eight minutes waiting for signs of treachery . Now , pull him in . Here he is , hi 1 what a big fellow . It was up here by this turn that I shot my first duck . It was in the winter vacation and I had found out that here , where there was a stretch of open water , a flock of black-headed ducks were at home . I burrowed through six feet of snow to the water 's edge and shot one of them with my father 's old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I threw my clothes in the snow and jumped after . Ugh ! it was cold . I dodged the floating ice as well as I could and kept turning the cakes over and over , looking for my duck , but it was  | not there . It was not till I had climbed ashore again and dressed myself with chattering teeth that , happening to look under the bank where the current had cut the earth away , I saw it sitting composedly on the little shelving beach below . I can feel now the throbbing of my heart as I leaned over , and , reaching down with infinite stealth , caught it by the neck and yanked it up . The pride of that homeward procession with the head of the duck flapping from my gamebag ! and then , after all , the cook had to wring its neck . In my joy I had forgotten to kill it . The shot had merely wounded it . But , if you did not run to fishing ? as what healthy boy does not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forest sounds big . All there was of it was a patch of woodland some twenty or twenty-five acres in extent , but to us in the mellow autumn days it was an enchanted forest indeed . For under the gnarled oaks , only survivors of the sturdy giants that had once covered the land , as the names of half the villages bore witness , and had filled the seas with the bold viking 's ships , was a wilderness of hazelbushes that was the special preserve of the Latin School boys on Saturday afternoons , or when we had " month 's leave . " Month 's leave was an afternoon off , which the school might choose itself once a month , if it had been good . Then a committee of the oldest boys went to the Rector with the observation that it was a fine day for play , while the rest of us stood with beating hearts , and if the gout did not pinch him just then , he would say , " Yes ! be off , " and with a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks , and for the woods , if it was in autumn . The boxes were to hold the nuts ; the crooked sticks served a double purpose : they were for walking-staffs on the homeward way , for the forest was two miles away ; once there , they were indispensable to hook down the limbs with . The hazel bushes grew in the twilight of the woods much as dogwood grows with us , and were mostly big enough to climb , but the nuts were on the farthest branches that could only be reached and stripped by pulling them down . That was fine fun , with enough tumbles to make it exciting , and a very substantial reward if judgment were used in picking . The supply so laid in often lasted past Christmas , and we had little else . Walnuts were too dear . The winter storms that drove in wreckage from the Gulf Stream strewed our coast , indeed , with Brazil nuts . Sometimes whole shiploads of them , one would think . But they were good only for making bonfires . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a kernel in one of them . It does not seem to me that life could be worth much in the Latin School without those nutting expeditions . And so , when I went there with my own boys , and , after wading through the old bog where the stork stalked up and down fishing for frogs , we came to the cool shade of the forest and found it hedged in with cheeky American barbed wire and signs up warning intruders off , my spirit rose in instant rebellion . This was a double disgrace not to be borne . And once back again in the land of freedom I planned to defeat that wretched barb-wire fence . Not only must it go , but the forest itself must belong to the Latin School , or else the undisputed right to go nutting there forever ; and while I had it in mind I thought I saw a way to drive in the edge of democracy by vesting the control of it in the boys , with the proviso that at least once a year they should invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my day they fought at the drop of a hat ; the recollection of the bitter feud between them stirs my blood even now when I think of it . But alas for the best-laid plans of mice and men ! I was told , when I moved to the attack , that times had changed ; that school was dismissed at two o'clock , not at five , nowadays , and that therefore month 's leave as we knew it had gone out of existence ; that Latin School and " plebs " were part of the same system these days ; hence the strife of the old times had ceased ; and that anyhow boys rode cycles and made century runs and such things now where we went nutting . Truly , the times do change . I am glad I was a boy then , if I am a back number now . Maybe they ride right through the  | heath on their senseless runs , and do n't stop to pick Raevlinger . If they do , I am done ; I have nothing more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the creeping heather in the sterile moor , quite like our blueberries , only there are many more of them . Very likely you would think them sour ; we thought them heavenly , and there is enough of the boy left in me to back up that opinion even now against the riper judgment of the years . We gathered them by the bucketful and came home with black faces and hands and terrible tales of the " worms " ? i. e. , snakes ? we had encountered in the heath . And , indeed , it swarms with these poisonous reptiles to this day . But , now as then , a fellow can keep out of their way . Some of the dearest recollections of my boyhood are of the long tours I made through this lonesome moor , where a rare shepherd knitting his woolen stocking and a gipsy 's cart are often the only " humans " one meets in a day 's journey . Met , I should have said perhaps , for in another generation even the moor will be a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand acres of heath land in the Danish peninsula has been planted with seedling pine , American pine , that has grown up finely , and a great and salutary change has been wrought , no doubt . But if there is to be a day without moor , without heather , without the sweet honey the bees gathered there when the broom was purple , and without Raevlinger , I ? well , I am glad I was a boy when I was . Which brings to my mind an adventure of one of my lonely trips in the heath . This one went far , extending over a whole vacation week . I had come at the end of a long summer day to an inn where they gave me a big box bed to sleep in ; and I had barely got into it when a lot of scratching under me made me aware that a family of rats shared my couch . But I was too sleepy to care , and we snuggled up together and did one another no harm in the night . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard of it . She had a great dread of rats . It was on that same trip that , coming to the shore , I supped at a fisherman 's hut on smoked dogfish and thought it the finest I had ever tasted . I was a boy and hungry . But I do not know why it should not be good . The dogfish I am thinking of are the small sharks that infest the North Sea coast in great numbers . They ate the flesh and sold the skin for sand-paper in those days . It was scratchy and did very well for that purpose . Touring to the shore was on the official programme of the grown-ups , and is yet ; only those trips do not quite reach the shore . Out in the mouth of the river lie a number of islands where the grass grows exceedingly rich and sweet . When the last is cut and stacked , the Old Town goes a-picnicking . The people drive out with well-filled hampers in the wagons . There is no occasion that I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make merry and tumble one another in the hay , a certain number of stacks having been given over to them for their enjoyment , and , when the sun sets over the ocean , they settle down to enjoy their supper in the grass . Those were times of rejoicing for us boys , who went along of course . But our real shore days were very different . Then we got up with the sun and walked the four miles to the beach , which at this point is very flat and wide . When the tide is out there is a stretch of quite half a mile of white sand to deep water . Over this the flood-tide comes stealing in so stealthily yet so swiftly that it takes a pretty good runner to get to the land without very wet feet or worse , if he is caught far out by the turn in the tide . We would sometimes bring home quite a store of amber from these trips , and then little files would be busy for days making hearts , sabots , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearts were the most popular and also the easiest to fashion . We made those things ourselves , and it was a sort of manual training not to be despised . " Treading " flounders was a unique kind of fishing that took a whole day from earliest dawn , but always turned up a bigger yield of fish than we could carry home . We followed the outgoing tide , tramping with bare feet in the soft  | page deleted
