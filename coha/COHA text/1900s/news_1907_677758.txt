txt WASHINGTON , Sept . D. ? Represents tive John A. T. Hull , Iowa , chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs , delivered some plain speech to-day on what he called this " infernal talk of self-government for the Philippines . " He said he believed Secretary Taft himself was weakening on that subject . " We are not going to sell the Philippines , " Mr. Hull said . " So what 's the use of wasting time talking about it . I regret that we have them , and we will get lots of grief out of them . But the only thing to do is to face the music , and do the best we can . We will gre.du , ally build up a self-respecting people by getting more of our own kind over there . " I would like to see more inducementS given to Americans to go to the Philippines , and less discrimination against them there . I can say this now freely , because I have no financial inteIests of any kind there . I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of money that put into a lumber venture in the Islands . The plain truth is , that no American Capital can be induced to go there until we stop some of the foolish discriminationsthat are now imposed on American business men , and give certain advan. tages to which the Islands are entitled . We must give free trade to the Islands and definite inducements to our people to go there and invest their capital . X do not believe in awarding monopolies , but if some Americans start a sugar es " tablishment or a big lumber industry , believe in dealing directly with them and making ' concessions that will be to their advantage . " ' Under the present situation we practically balk every American in business ' over there by hedging him about with all kinds of unjust discriminations . Ot course , the natives suffer in the same way . This must be stopped , and encouragement given instead . My investment was a. total loss , because or unfair and unreasonable discriminations . When Spain owned the Islands the natives had one nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would also stop this infernal talk about self-government . We must put an end to stimulating these half-civilized people with the idea that they are fit to govern themselves . We are going to keep them , and some day , if they are fit to govern themselves , they will have a Gov --  ernment like our other territories . They will not be fit for this for fifty years , and in the meantime we must stop this independence talk among the people over there . " I would say to them : . ' If you are good we will reward you , and if you are not good we will spank you , but under all conditions we are going to keep yoo.k When they understand this they will set . tle down . As things are now , they M. , terpret our kindness and indulgence tie fear . Many of the leading natives told me this when I was last in the Islands . " There is room for great economies in the administration of the Philippines Government . There are entirely too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governoth now , where ten would be ample . There are three Governors on the little Island of Panay , which is only ninety-two miles wide and thirty miles long . " I think Taft has changed his views with regard to the Philippines lately . The people over there are just beginning to understand this , and are getting down on him . Mr. Taft is a great big man , with a big brain , and he is a splendid optimist . He believed in the beginning that the Philippines would develop more rapidly than they have , and he thought they would be ready for self-government much sooner than events have proved . There are no people who develop more rapidly than the Filipinos up to a certain point , but when they reach that point they stagnate . " Mr. Bryan 's theory regarding the Philippines is the worst possible. - It would make possible all kinds of misdeeds without the power to correct them . If we are to surrender any authority at all we must turn them loose and let the world scramble for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
