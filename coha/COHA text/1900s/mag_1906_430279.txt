 | eighteen-cent Bohemian and the seventeen-cent Lithuanian . They are common laborers . They have no skill . They need no skill . They can be stood up against a carcass and given a push and their industrial education is complete . The average hourly rate of wages paid to common laborers in the stock-yards certainly equals , and probably exceeds , the average rate paid in other industries in Chicago . In the fifty-third Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor can be found the rates paid to common laborers in many industries throughout the United States . For the last year covered by that Bulletin ? namely , 1903 ? the rate paid in the packing industry was seventeen and one-half cents an hour . The rate in most other industries was lower . In the building trades , for instance , it was only sixteen and three-quarter cents an hour . In the glass industry it was only fifteen and one-half cents . In the brick industry it was only thirteen and three-quarter cents . These figures do not prove that the packers are philanthropists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock-yards for so low a rate of wages as he is willing to accept in other industries . Employment in the stock-yards is disagreeable , and , more than that , it is irregular . The level of hourly wages is therefore slightly raised . It raises itself . The packers do not raise it . They are neither malign nor sentimental . They simply pay the price at which they can get what they want . If Mr. Armour is to be stoned , the mob should consist entirely of large employers of labor who pay their laborers twenty cents an hour when they can get them for eighteen . Mr. Armour would then have a fair sporting chance for his life . Nevertheless , the fact that Mr. Armour is only following ordinary business principles in the hiring of labor does not alter or mitigate the other fact that Mr. Armour 's employees have wretched homes and live wretched lives . Mr. Armour is not responsible for the fact that in his business he needs three common laborers for every skilled artisan . But the consequence of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common labor district living on common labor wages . It is in that district , of all districts in America , that common labor can be seen in nakedest form and in largest mass . There the concentration of an enormous industry has created an almost feudal domain of central factory-castles and of hoveled industrial peasants . There the development of scientific methods of reduction has almost eliminated the skilled artisan , and has left a sodden , monotonous heap of mere breathing muscle . There the competitive system has stripped labor of all mediaeval legal protection in the way of minimum wages , and has reduced it absolutely to the exact commercial value of each ounce of muscular effort . It is in the stock-yards district , therefore , of all districts in America , that the labor question , the mere , bare , common labor question , rises most violently from its universal lodgment in the blood of society and shows most spectacularly on the skin . It is all a monument to Competition . The packing industry as a whole begins the process of competition by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced to spend his money for meat , he will spend it for breakfast food or for vegetables or for milk . This universal competition between industries is stronger to-day than ever before . In order to grapple with it , the ideal which the packers set before themselves is cheapness of production . Within the packing industry itself there is a competition equally unremittent . Every plant competes every day with every other plant in the reduction of expenses . No amount of consolidation on the part of the owners of the different plants will check this competition as long as the managers of the consolidated industry are men of average capacity and of average greed . As cheapness of production is the aim of the industry as a whole , so in the case of each individual plant the aim is again cheapness of production . Finally , in each individual plant the laborers compete among themselves in offering their labor at the lowest possible  | rate at which the offensiveness and the irregularity of employment in the stock-yards can be endured . The Irishman competes with the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German ; the Pole with the Bohemian ; the Lithuanian with the Pole ; the negro with the Lithuanian ; the unmarried negro with the married negro . The last twenty years have been one long process of competition by which the cheaper and lower workingman has driven out the higher type . To-day the negro has come to be a familiar sight . If there were a motto to be placed over the portals of the stock-yards , it should be a certain passage from Charles Kingsley 's " Cheap Clothes and Nasty : " " Sweet Competition 1 Heavenly Maid ! Nowadays hymned by all as the groundwork of society , the only real preserver of the earth ! Why not of Heaven , too ? Perhaps there is competition among the angels . And perhaps Gabriel and Raphael have won their rank by producing the maximum of worship on the minimum of grace . " Among the mass of unskilled men in the stock-yards , with their average hourly wage of seventeen and one-half cents , there stand a few skilled artisans whose wages are much higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the display of skill is greatest . Yet even in this department the unskilled men are in the majority . In a gang of two hundred and thirty cattle butchers , the " butcher aristocracy , " there will be one hundred and forty-four men who get less than twenty cents an hour . Fifty-seven men will get as much as twenty cents , but less than thirty . Ten men will get as much as thirty cents , but less than forty . Five men will get forty . Three will get fortyfive . Eleven will get fifty . The average wage for the whole gang will be twentyone cents an hour . If all the members of the gang had been " all-around " cattle butchers under the primitive system , they would each of them have earned thirty-five cents an hour . But the work has been subdivided till all the important skilled parts of it can be done by a few men . These few men get more than thirty-five cents an hour . Meanwhile most of the work has become so mechanical that anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of the gang -- are pushed farther below thirty-five cents an hour than the skilled artisans are pushed above it . The average for the whole gang , therefore , drops from thirty-five cents to twenty-one . The gainers are the packers and a few skilled men . The losers are the " anybodies . " It is another case of competition . The best men win . The fittest survive . Admirers of competition can point to the eleven rapid workmen who by specialization and competition have attained to a wage of fifty cents an hour . Charles Kingsley might perhaps be more interested in the one hundred and fortyfour men who by specialization and competition have been thrust down below twenty cents . Up to this point the wage discussed has been the hourly wage . It has been shown that the hourly wage compares by no means unfavorably with the hourly wage in other industries . If the fifty-cent man worked ten hours a day six days in the week throughout the year , he would have an average weekly wage of $30 . If the **25;149;TOOLONG man worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly wage of $10.50 . But actual wages fall far below this level . Work in the stock-yards is irregular . The shipments of cattle vary . There is a daily variation and there is a seasonal variation . The daily variation runs from , say , thirty thousand cattle on Wednesday to , say , three hundred on Saturday . Therefore the men will work full time on Wednesday and hardly at all on Saturday . The seasonal variation is an even greater hardship . In summer there are comparativeiy few animals to be slaughtered . Therefore the average work-day is much shorter in summer than it is in winter . Can the packers control these variations ? They do not own the ranges . They do not grow the cattle . They buy the cattle in Chicago . If consolidation were carried to its logical conclusion , and the cattle were grown by the same firms  | page deleted  | The packing industry in Chicago is only forty years old . It started in a swamp . Two forks of the Chicago River run along its northern exposure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were tanks of sewage . Chickens could walk across their surface on the scum , and almost on the odor . The packing-houses themselves were wooden shanties reposing on mud . Between them the streets were mud . The area covered by the pens and the packinghouseswas just about one square mile . Within this square mile there came to be 250 miles of railroad track . Along the borders of this square mile , crossing the public streets at grade , were yet other miles and miles of track . Overhead there were wires . Overhead also , but sweeping down through every particle of air , there was smoke ; smoke from the locomotives , smoke from the chimneys of the packing-houses , blinding smoke , choking smoke , smoke that seemed to catch the stock-yards odor and make it a solid substance . Every spray of sacred green perished from the cursed soil . Even to-day the lawn in front of the Swift offices has the pallid and timid appearance of a badly frightened stranger . Yet the Swift family lived for years within two blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this climax of the rough-and-ready , catch-as-catch-can methods which made Chicago famous . Inside the packing-houses there was never any attempt to protect the health of the workmen . Many of the packers had themselves handled living and dying and dead animals . Nothing shocked them . The rule in force was a simple one . They applied it to themselves as well as to others . Here was a certain job . It implied blood and a dark room . It paid a certain number of cents an hour . Did the man want it ? Let him have it . He endured the blood and the dark room and got his money . When the packer gave him his money , the packer 's duty was discharged . If the man finally decided that he did n't like the job , he could quit . This was a free country . He could go and start a bank . This simple rule lasted down to the time of the recent outburst of public criticism . To many individual workingmen the packers were personally generous . To the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply paid them the price at which they would undertake an irregular and offensive employment . Certain features of work in the stockyards would , of course , be difficult to remedy even if the beef business were a philanthropic experiment . The hide cellar , for instance , must be wet . And it must be dark . And it must have no currents of air . Otherwise the hides will spoil . Yet men must work in this place in order that the country may have leather . The situation is like that in many other trades . Specialization in industry has resulted in keeping a man at one particular kind of work till his health is in danger of being impaired . Sewer bricklayers , for instance , are frequently incapacitated for life at the end of a few years ' service . The answer to such problems will have to be found in a vast system of transference from one industry to another . The hide cellar is an illustration which holds good in many other parts of the stock-yards . The cooling-rooms must be damp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all allowance has been made for inevitable hardships , there yet remain many others which are not inevitable . By the expenditure of a comparatively small amount of money , by the payment of a slight sentimental tribute to decency , the packers could long ago have done a great deal to safeguard the health of their employees . The fact that they could have done this is proved by the fact that they are making a start at doing it now . A few rude lunch-rooms are being set aside for the young women in order that they may not have to eat in the same room in which they are preparing food for the market . A few locker-rooms are being installed in order that the men may have an opportunity to change their clothes and may not be obliged to walk home wet and dripping through the cold air . Running water is being introduced into certain rooms in order  | page deleted  | versity of Chicago , drew up such a comparison a few years ago . He showed that , after making allowances for differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same basis , there were 133 deaths in the stock-yards district for every 100 in Hyde Park . For children under five years of age the difference was even more tragic . For every 100 children dying in Hyde Park there were , for the same population , 162 dying in the stock-yards district . Yet during the last few years the stock-yards district has improved . This is not said for the purpose of praising the packers . They have had nothing to do with it . It has been done by the community . Most of the railroad tracks , for instance , have been elevated , and the rest of them will soon be elevated . The importance of this improvement is enormous in a district where the death of a wage-earner may mean the poorhouse for his family . The pavements are better . It is no longer poss'ble , as it used to be in certain parts of the district , for a child to fall into the gutter and disappear in filth . One of the two forks of the Chicago River , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed out . This was done in order to improve the sewage system of the whole city . The inhabitants of the stock-yards district were benefited incidentally . Best of all , however , four new parks have been placed in the stock-yards district by the South Park Board . These parks are perhaps the only beautiful things in the whole district . They bring with them grass-plots , trees , shrubbery , swimming-pools , charming buildings , outdoor and indoor gymnasiums , baseball fields , refreshment-rooms , library substations , reading-rooms , and assembly halls in which the people of the neighborhood may meet to hear lectures , to see stereopticon views , to promote local improvements , or just to be sociable . These parks are among the best in the world . With all these improvements , of course , the stock-yards district remains a common labor district , the basis of its culture being the common laborer 's wage of seventeen and one-half cents an hour , or $10.50 a week , depressed by variations in the work-day to an average Weekly income of from five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community from the local government , receiving as a community practically no benefits from the packers , the people of the stock-yards district have made three great efforts to benefit themselves . These were the strike of 1886 , the strike of 1894 , and the strike of year before last . The most marked difference between the final strike and the others was in the point of violence . The union issued explicit orders forbidding violence . There were fewer arrests in the stockyards during the strike of 1904 than there had been during any other hot summer even when no strike was in progress . The most important thing done by the union before it called the strike of 1904 was that in many departments it reduced the amount of work turned out by from fifteen to twenty-five per cent . The men claimed that they had been cruelly " speeded up . " In 1884 a " splitter " would divide the backbones of sixteen cattle an hour . In 1894 he had been " speeded up " to the point of handling thirty cattle an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And although the strike was called because the union insisted upon a minimum wage of eighteen and one-half cents an hour for the common laborer , it is more than probable that the packers might have conceded that demand if they had not felt that the existence of the union meant a continued restriction of output . It is difficult for an outsider to tell whether a gang is being " speeded up " or not . The men work so mechanically that to an untrained observer they might as well be derricks and pulleys . It seems undeniable , however , that excessive physical strain has produced many cases of nervous prostration in the yards , just as excessive mental strain has produced it in downtown offices . If the men reduced output to a point which cultivated laziness among the most expert workmen , it is equally true that the  | page deleted
