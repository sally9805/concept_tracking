WHEN in the year 1843 appeared the first volume of Modern Painters , by a Graduate of Oxford , the world of English connoisseurship was ruled by conventional notions which are hardly now understood . These notions had been a/ gradual growth out of the teachings of the academic schools of the decadent period of Italian art , with additions from the pseudo-classicism of Winkel- mann , and the pedantic antiquarianisms of the school of David . Sir Joshua Reynolds had formulated his rules of the " grand style , " and Fuseli had elaborated his ideas of beauty and sublimity . Sir George Beaumont , the leading English exponent of convention in landscape subject , gave a true illustration of the state of feeling which some of these ideas had induced in the minds of amateurs when he said to Constable that the tone of a landscape painting ought to resemble that of an old Cremona fiddle . In English landscape art , which during the eighteenth century had been rising into importance , the main sources of inspiration ivere the ' art of Claude and Poussin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is worthy of note that these earliest forms of land- , scape as a separate branch of art arose at a period of general artistic weakness and conventionality . By the seventeenth century the ideals and impulses which had given life to the best art of the Renaissance had lost their power over the artistic imagination . Men of genius were rare . Rubens , Van Dyck and Rembrandt , Claude and Poussin , were exceptional men of their time . The fine qualities of the works of Claude Lorrain were involved with mannerisms derived from the landscape backgrounds of the more conventional historical figure painters , whose renderings of the forms of rocks , trees , and herbage gave no ex- pression of those specific characteristics , and finer structural elements of form , in which resides so much of their essential beauty . The Dutch landscape art was free from these mannerisms . It was a men . ifestation of a fresh and wholesome , though an unimaginative , pleasure in the landscape itself . But it had mannerisms of its own , and the Dutch landscapist had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuyp , Rays . dael and Hobbenia , take the most commonplace landscape as they find it , and patiently and laboriously portray its more obvious features , and its most trivial details , with singular inattention to that which is most worthy of expression , and not seldom with inexcusably bad drawing . The art of Richard ' Wilson , the first notable English landscape painter , was mainly founded on that of Claude . It reproduced Claude 's conventions of composition and his mannerisms of drawing , though it was not without some fine qualities which show that Wilson had native capacity for better things than the artistic conditions of his time could call out . Gainsborough , on the other hand , who soon followed Wilson , seems to have been more influenced by the Dutch school . But being endowed with a higher order of genius , and a more independent spirit , he introduced a fresher style under the direct inspire . tion of nature . Gainsborough 's art was . in fact , tending in a new direction . It was leading away from mannerisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural expression of poetic feel . ing . But the conditions were not yet ripe for a wide departure from the conventional paths . During the early part of the nineteenth century a remarkable development of landscape art had arisen in // England which , though still largely based on the school traditions , was at the same time quick with a new life drawn from the feeling for the beauty of nature , which had been strong in the English race from the time of Chaucer . Men like David Cox , Copley Fielding , Peter De Wint , and Thomas Girth were now producing works full of idyllic poetry , and were entering into the various moods of pastoral and wild nature with a sincerity of feeling that was altogether new in landscape subject . Front and Harding had developed veins of feeling , and modes of expression , that were still further removed from the older conventions , and Constable had completely broken away from the traditions of the schools , and had taken his canvases out of doors in the effort to give the absolute truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other artists of the early English landscape school , though in different degrees possessing poetic sentiment , artistic aptitudes , and passion for nature , were men of limited powers . Not one of them was endowed with the highest order of genius . Their range was narrow , much of their drawing was feeble and often false , their handling , except in the case of Constable , was mannered , and their coloring was conventional . But one man had arisen among them of a vastly larger calibre . Turner had , before the close of the first decade of the nineteenth century , begun to show a range of powers and an order of gen , ius which distinguished him among his contemporaries , and led him to heights of achievement which place him in the category of the greatest masters of design . The creative imagination was in him as a fountain of perpetual inspiration . After his earliest period of apprenticeship , every work that he produced was stamped with the creative spirit which , governed by an insight that goes to the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fewest expressive characters , an ideal conception . Turner 's art , though based on the underlying principles of all great art , was unconventional . It dealt with new motives and new materials . The inspiration of nature was its strongest element ; but the aspects of nature which engaged the master 's attention were not those of common observation ; they were those in which the essential power and beauty of natural things are most manifest . The greater harmonies of light and color , and the more subtle and significant characteristics of organic form , were used by Turner as elements of design in such a way that each work of his hand was both a poem and a commentary on the visual aspects of nature from the point of view of beauty . To the artistic dilettanti of the day such art was incomprehensible . It seemed to subvert all of the established canons . The puerile mannerisms of Claude were looked upon as the authoritative generalizations of the grand style in landscape , and at the same time it was affirmed by the critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such , in brief outline , was the state of things in the English world of art when Ruskin came forward with his first volume in defense of the new landscape art in general , and of the art of Turner ? , in particular . The work was , in fact , almost exclusively an enthusiastic attempt to vindicate Turner . For the author felt , and proclaimed from the first , that while there was much to be admired and cotnmended in the works of other masters of the early English school , the art of Turner was incomparably superior from every point of view . Ruskin was only twenty-three years of age at this time ; but he was already singularly well prepared for his work , both by native aptitude and by cultivation . Indeed , few other critics of art have entered upon their tasks with so good an equipment , and in so admirable a spirit . He was himself endowed with artistic genius , though it was a genius for observation , 440 John Ruskin as analysis , and description , more than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults and limitations . His natural temper gave him a strong confidence in his own judgments , and he early acquired a habit of emphatic affirmation , while his ardent enthusiasm often led him into extravagant praise of what he admired , and his easily excited indignation not seldom found equally unmeasured expression in sharpest invective against what he deemed erroneous . The strong terms in which some of his criticism is couched , as where in the preface to the second edition he speaks of the leaders of attack as " content if , like the foulness of the earth , they may attract to themselves notice by their noisomeness , or like its insects exalt themselves by virulence into visibility ; " or again , where he describes a critic of Black-wood 's Magazine as a person of " honest , hopeless , helpless imbecility , " were not so uncommon at the time they were written as they are now . This style of speech was a survival of that of the Grub Street pamphleteers of the eighteenth century , or of the early quarterlies . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of his work , and only on occasions when strong terms might be excusable . His early training as the only child of wealthy , admiring , and over - attentive , though sternly exacting , parents , seems to have favored , rather than to have checked in him , the natural disposition of youth to overrate the importance of its own wisdom . His self-confidence and his lack of respect for the judgments of other men , when they came in conflict with his own , were sometimes unpleasantly apparent . But notwithstanding such defects and limitations as this implies , Ruskin 's early writings on art and nature have a character which is not now always fairly estimated . And their power is not likely to fail while English-speaking people remain open to impressions of beauty . an Art Critic . In his childhood he showed a passion . ate fondness for nature . Ranges of blue hills gave him the keenest pleasure , and he early formed a habit of descriptive writing while on journeys through the country , both in England and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him great delight . He was especially drawn to the landscapes of Turner by his own love for mountains , and he soon began to copy the engravings after Turner 's designs , which were then appearing as illustrations in such works as Rogers ' Italy and Poems . At the same time he conceived a strong admiration for the drawings of Samuel Prom. , ? whose remarkable lithographs of the picturesque architecture of Flanders and Germany appeared in the year 1833 . On a Continental journey at the age of fifteen , he passed through Flanders and Germany , and over the Alps into Italy , verifying Front and Turner by the way , studying the subjects of each , and comparing their art with the nature which had furnished its materials . He thus got an insight into the selective processes of each master , which could not be reached in any other way . He made drawings at every point in imitation of them , until by degrees he naturally developed a style of his own . The eight of the Alps awakened in him an interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a study of their structural forms gave him an understanding of Turner 's marvelous mountain drawing . He had , for a time , instruction in drawing from a master of the old-fashioned type ; but he learned more by his own independent practice from Front and Turner , and from nature under the guidance of the works of these masters . In 1835 he had instruction from Copley Fielding , President of the Old Water Color Society , and at a later time be had lessons from Harding . From the pen and wash drawings of David Roberts , also , he learned a good deal , and he subsequently made much use of this econom- John Buskin as ical method of work in his drawing from nature and architecture . But while appreciating the qualities of the works , and feeling the value of the precepts , of these men , he recognized their mannerisms and their narrowness of range . In London and Paris he had studied the works of the old masters of landscape , Claude , Poussin , and Salvator Rosa , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully the characteristic passages of such works of art , and to make extended written notes on them . The active attention which this effort to delineate compelled opened his eyes to many things , and impressed them on his mind . In the Academy exhibition of 1836 Turner gave the first evidence of his more mature style , and by his pictures of this year Ruskin was deeply impressed . He saw now that what Turner sought was the ideal truth of nature , that he portrayed Nature in her " supreme moments , " in her finest forms , and in her vital energy , ? Nature as she was revealed to a discriminating eye , and to the poetic imagination . The recognition of this led him to reflect on the relations of art with nature , and to more extended investigation of both nature and art in the manifold aspects of each . Every step of his progress impressed him with the truth , as well as the pictorial power , of Turner 's art , and developed in his mind a burning indignation at what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work . Thus equipped , and feeling thus , he began the essay which grew into Modern Painters . This was , he tells us , at first intended to be a short pamphlet en ; titled Turner and the Ancients , but it grew under his hand into five stately volumes . That his philosophy of art , when Ile was at the age of twenty-three , should not have been in all respects complete and satisfactory was natural enough . But on fair examination it will , I think , // be found in the main entirely sound , though over-statements , and even errors , are not wanting . It has not always been correctly represented . It has , in fact , not seldom been inexcusably misrepresented . The affirmation , for instance , has frequently been made that according to Ruskin all perfection of art consists in the exact imitation of nature . Nothing could be farther from the truth . This is shown plainly enough in the opening of the work where he defines great art as that which conveys to the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and says ; " If I were to say , on the contrary , that the best picture was that which most closely imitated nature , I should assume that art could only please by imitating nature " ( vol. i. p. 11 ) . And in what follows he clearly recognizes , what he consistently maintains throughout his writings , that there is a distinction to be drawn between representative art and art as such , in itself . In representative art there must be truth to stature , not to make it art , but to snake it representative . No argument should be needed to establish the truth of this proposition , which has been recognized at all times in respect to art which represents the human figure , and never more fully than in recent times , when the almost exclusive training offered in professional schools of art has consisted in the rigorous delineation of the human body , including elaborate studies in anatomy as a means of insuring truths to nature . The truth that is necessary in human figure subject is equally so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the painter what the keyboard is to the musical composer is quite correct ; but it does not prove that the painter need not be true to nature . It only shows that the artist must use what he draws from nature in an artistic way , in a way analogous to that in which the musician uses the musical scale . But the analogy be- tween nature and the keyboard is not a close one , for there are harmonies ready made in nature that do not exist in the musical scale . The objects of the natural world are not abstract elements like the notes of the keyboard . There is a closer analogy between abstract lines , colors , and tones , and the musical scale . The artist may use these abstract elements and produce works of art which , like architecture and pure ornamentation , are quite independent of any truth to nature in the sense that representative art is dependent on such truth . But Ruskin in Modern Painters ' deals primarily with landscape painting , and landscape painting is a representative art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wishing to vindicate j Turner on the score of truth , though he nowhere maintains that this truth constitutes the essential character of Turner 's art , or any other art , he starts out in this first volume with an extended analysis of truth , meaning thereby , as he explains ( page 20 ) , the faithful statement of natural fact . In developing this part of his subject he may often seem to be advocating literal transcript of nature , which indeed he does as a temporary discipline , but never as a final end of art . The counsel given at the close of the first volume ( page 417 ) to the young artist to " go to nature in all singleness of heart . . . rejecting nothing , selecting nothing , scorning nothing . . . and rejoicing always in the truth , " has often been quoted as if it contained a summary of the author 's whole art teaching . But an attentive reading of even this first volume will show that this is not the case . Thus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rejecting bona fide imitation , and seeking to convey the impression of nature . And he affirms that there is , in consequence , a greater suns of essential and impressive truth in their works . While among many other passages to the same effect throughout the work , we find in the third volume ( pages 40 , 41 ) the following statements : " The last characteristic of great art is that it must be inventive , that is , be produced by the imagination . . . The highest art is purely imaginative , all to materials being wrought into their form by invention . " And again ( vol. iv . p. 16 ) , " Great landscape art can not be a mere copy of any given scene . " Pas . sages like the one first referred to , and the statement ( page 416 ) that from young artists nothing ought to be tolerated but simple bona fide imitation of nature , " are in no conflict with this . The one relates to the early training of the artist , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is prepared to exercise the freedom of art . And they are in complete accord with the teaching of all other competent authorities . Sir Joshua Reynolds , for instance , enforces the same piinciple where he complainsa that " the students never draw exactly from the living models which they have before them . " And again ( vol. ii . p. 66 ) where he says , " Our elements are laid in gross common nature , an exact imitation of what is before us . " There is thus nothing that is fundamentally peculiar in Ruskin 's teaching as to the importance of truth to nature as a foundation for all representative art . He merely applies to the newer art of landscape painting the principles that have been universally enforced in the painting of the human figure . But the question as to the truth of Turner 's art is another thing . Can it be possible , it has often been asked , that those strange canvases in the National Gallery are defensible on the score of truth to nature ? Ruskin 's answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different orders of truths with which the artist may be concerned . There are the more obvious , unessential , deleted material mate of the many small things of which the greater are composed . And he shows here , also , that the qualities of largeness and breadth in a work of art result from the habit with great composers of regarding the relations of things , rather than their separate nature . Breadth , or largeness of treatment , in composition is thus seen to be independent of scale . The artist does not need a great canvas in order to work in the grand style . In the Elements of Drawing we have a further analysis of composition . The sense of pleasure in rhythm and metre is here said to be happily a common possession of all orders of minds , while power of composition is rare and unteachable . Yet some simple laws of arrangement , deduced from the works of great composers , are set forth with unexampled acuteness of insight and lucidity of illustration . Among these are : The Law of Principality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some kind of sympathy between objects is marked , and under this law symmetry is treated ; The Law of Continuity , the establishment of some orderly succession in the arrangement of objects more or less similar ; The Law of Curvature , which includes the modulations of curves . Under each head the principles are discussed in a clearly intelligible manner , and in such a way as to stimulate enjoyment of some of those qualities which , more than all others , make a work of art to be a work of art . This is very rare . Most writers on composition give us little more than arbitrary rules and vague generalities . The subject is a difficult one , even in respect to the more obvious principles involved , while the more subtle laws of design are too fine to be grasped by the intellect alone , and are apprehended only by the artistic imagination . The more competent writers on the fine arts feel the difficulty , and say little about composition . Thus Sir Joshua Reynolds , through all his writings , has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most explicit direction to the student on this head being , " to put all things in a beautiful . order and harmony , that the whole may be of a piece . " Ruskin 's artistic apprehensions were of wide range . He understood the essential oneness of the arts ; and thus he was led to consider the principles of architecture , sculpture , and the so-called minor arts , as well as of painting . His interest in architecture was awakened early . An admiration for the picturesque drawings of Samuel Prout had led him , as we have seen , to verify Prout in the cities of Flanders and Germany , as he had verified Turner in the Alps ; and his architectural interest appears always to have been governed primarily by the painters ' point of view . It was thus natural that the architecture of Italy should appeal to him with a special attraction ; for in Italian building of all epochs , the painters ' habits of conception and treatment are strongly emphasized . The structural logic of the best northern building is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Gothic of the north was not yet understood . The light , the warmth , and the color of the broadly walled Italian art gave him the keenest delight , and called out his most ardent efforts in analysis , description , and graphic illustration . His monumental architectural work , The Stones of Venice , has probably done more than any other book to awaken ad-miration for the beauty of the enchant-ing city of the sea . In an earlier essay , The Seven Lamps of Architecture , he had already formulated what he regard-ed as the fundamental principles of ar-chitectural design . Under the first of these , The Lamp of Sacrifice , he affirms that all noble architecture is produced in a spirit of ardor which prompts the builders to do their utmost , to spend rather than to save , both in labor and materials , that the monument may be- John Ruskin as come a worthy embodiment of noble aspirations . In the chapter entitled The Lamp of Truth he discusses the question of architectural deceits , supporting his conclusions by cogent reasonings ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions by carefully reasoned arguments . The charge of dogmatic arrogance , which is sometimes brought against him , is therefore hardly warranted . Yet mistaken affirmations are frequent , and are sometimes made with vexatious assurance , as , for instance , where ( page 55 ) he states that the decline of Gothic art is marked by the " substitution of the line for the mass . " But Gothic architecture is essentially an architecture of line , rather than of mass. lie makes this statement in connection with a discussion of the development of window tracery , and this whole discussion is erroneous because he mistakes the late survivals of plate-tracery in Norman Gothic for examples of early Gothic work . No right theory of Gothic development , or any branch of it , can be drawn from the pointed architecture of Normandy in any period , and least of all from the later Gothic of that province . Ruskin was , however , true here according to his lights . The early Gothic of France was practically unknown when he was writing . And there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Gothic skeleton of the best period , the lines were not attenuated , or accented with painful sharpness , or excessively multiplied . The piers and shafts had a full-rounded breadth and even massiveness , as compared with those of the decadent Gothic ; and lines were not used ornamentally in needless tracery and panelings , as they were in the flamboyant Gothic style . True Gothic art , like all other good art , had a monumental simplicity and severity which , as contrasted with the flamboyant linear complexity , may rightly enough be characterized as massive . But this is not the // sense in which Ruskin here supposes Gothic to be massive , as an examination of the passage will show . A truer statement of the cause of Gothic decline is given on page 61 where he says , " It was because it had lost its own strength , and disobeyed its own laws . " The law laid down in the chapter on Beauty that everything is ornamental that is imitative of nature , and the converse , that what is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted , though the qualifying considerations added greatly modify the bald statement . The emphatic condemnation ( page 97 ) of the Greek fret , and other kindred forms of ornamentation , must be regarded as shortsighted and indefensible , while on page 129 the doubtful conclusion is reached that " all arrangements of color , for its own sake , in graceful forms , are barbarous ; and that , to paint a color pattern with the lovely lines of a Greek leaf moulding , is an utterly savage procedure . " Yet cue now know that the Greeks themselves painted the leaf moulding , and Ruskin has himself I illustrated the subtle beauty of the lines of French missal illuminations , in which the exquisiteness of abstract color arrangements constitute an equal charm . The Stones of Venice abounds in misconceptions and mistaken affirmations ; but these are largely due to the state of ideas and understanding in respect to mediroval architecture half a century ago . I have said that Ruskin 's interest in architecture was primarily pictorial . I do not , however , mean that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a limited extent he felt this strongly . He has , in many parts of the work , shown a just , and even an acute , sense of the elementary structural principles of ordinary wall , column , and arch construction . But beyond this he has hardly understood the more important types of medieval building on their structural side . What he recognized was enough for his purpose in respect to those forms of architecture in which the basilican elements predominate ; but it was not enough to enable him to appreciate the very different structural character of the Byzantine architecture of /St . Mark 's , much less was it adequate to an understanding of the organic Romanesque and Gothic art . The structural character of a given monument was not what primarily impressed him , and in consequence he is often led into error . Thus when , after his eloquent general description of the church of St. Mark ( vol. ii . p. 70 ) ? which has the beauty of a poem ? he comes to what he calls a sketch of the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , and he declares ( page 74 ) that " the first broad characteristic of the building , and the root nearly of every other important peculiarity in it , , is its confessed incrustation . " The great Byzantine structural system of the dense on pendentives , so ' magnificently carried out here , which is the essential governing characteristic of the edifice , is wholly overlooked . The incrustation is but a superficial adornment , which this building shares with many others of various types , as notably the basilican churches of southern Italy and Sicily . It is a splendid and appropriate mode of adornment for such a building ; but it is not an integral characteristic of the architecture itself . Further misapprehension , and even confusion of thought , are shown on page 80 , where it is laid down as a " law " that " science of inner structure is to be abandoned " in architecture like this , for since " the body of the structure is confessedly of inferior , and comparatively incoherent materials , it would be absurd to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But what higher refinements of construction could be attempted in any case ? The inner structure proper to a system of domes on pendentives being fully , and grandly , carried out , any thing more would be superfluous . The broad expanses of wall and pier were not sought by the designer as a field for the mosaic incrustation . He did not have to abandon anything in order to obtains them . These expanses are natural to the structural system employed , and must have been the same ( as they are in the similar church of St. Front of Pdrigueux ) had the body of the edifice been of solid stone , instead of brick . And again , on page 98 , it is affirmed of the church architecture of the Middle Ages , that what we now regard in it with wonder and delight was then the natural continuation , in the principal edifice of the city , of a style which was already familiar in domestic building . " Let the reader , " he says , " fix this great fact well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I would desire here clearly and forcibly to assert , that wherever Christian church architecture has been good and lovely , it . has been merely the perfect development of the common dwelling-house architecture of the period . " And still further : " No style of noble architecture can be exclusively ecclesiastical . It must be practiced in the dwelling before it is perfected in the church . " This is not the place for discussion of this point ; but it would be more true to say that all great architectural styles have been primarily ecclesiastical , extending the terns ecclesiastical to include every form of religious monument from the Egyptian temple down . But we need not pursue these things further . We are not reviewing Ruskin 's works , we are merely gathering from them some illustrations of his general teaching on the fine arts . His equipment as a critic was , in respect to architecture , inadequate . His strongest work is Modern Painters . The Seven Lamps and The Stones of Venice contain much that is fine and enduring . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his theory of architecture is not so sound as his theory of painting . Yet his inter- John Ruskin as est in architecture was strong , and his imagination and eloquence enable him to impart to the reader of his architectural works something of his own noble enthusiasm . The value of these works consists chiefly in this , and in this they are unlike most other books . His main interest was in painting . He had himself a painter 's genius of no common order , and a brief consideration of the character of his artistic work will help us to understand better his qualifications as a critic of painting . Through all his life the practice of drawing with the lead pencil , the pen , and in water colors , formed usually a large part , and often the best part , of each day 's occupation . He was in no sense a mere amateur , except that he did not make his art a means of livelihood . Few men who have practiced the art of painting as a profession have had so fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand was remarkable , and nearly all of the vast numbers of his drawings exhibit rare subtleties of expressive execution . His sense of form was keen , and his feeling for color was exquisite . His work was not only refined in respect to both of these qualities , it was also strong . He worked with a clearly understood aim , and he knew well how to suit his method , in any given case , to the most direct and economical accomplishment of this aim . When his subject was an extended scene , fine in composition , and subtle in proportions , he would generally , in his mature period , limit himself to lead-pencil outline . The line , in such cases , was a soft and brokers one , wonderfully suggestive of the mystery and fullness of nature , as well as true in its course ; and the outline was more or less supplemented with expressive , though hasty , markings , suggestive of details as well as of solid masses . I have before me such a drawing made in 1876 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A winding reach of the Simplon road , with a high // retaining wall above , and another wall with an undulating parapet below , is seen in perspective on the left . To the right the mountains fall away into a vast hollow . In the middle ground is a grandly composed group of buildings with towers , whose masses mate finely with the natural features of the scene ; and beyond the great hills close in on either side , leaving a vista through which the eye catches a more distant range . It contains but an hour 's work , yet the sublimity and the poetry of the Alps are in it . In other instances , where the subject called for it , he would add a rapid suggestion of chiaroscuro , laying broad shades with the side of the lead , sometimes , in haste , rubbing in finer tones with his finger , and deftly painting , as it were , with the pencil point . In still other cases , a broad color scheme ? is washed in with water colors ; and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eye was quick to discover a good subject , and in all such work he had a quite Turnerian power of seizing the expressive lines . To understand the source of this power we must look back to his earlier work , of which , also , a good ex. ample is before me . It represents a shoot of hawthorn , outlined with lead pencil , and faintly tinted with watercolor wash . This drawing insist have been executed about the year 1850 . The delicate precision of this outline and the frank skill with which the color wash is struck are consummate . The whole character of the beautiful thing is set forth wills marvelous expression of its vigorous energy and tender elasticity of growth . The aim is limited to the rendering of these essential qualities , and the means are at once simple and adequate . This drawing is engraved in plate 52 of the fifth volume of Modern Painters . Ruskin made vast numbers of such drawings , and it is , I think , safe to say that no other man has delineated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Art Critic . and such masterly power . The line , in these earlier drawings , is firm and even , like the line of Raphael and da Vinci . The sureness of his hand is wonderful . In the later work he slowly developed a style in which the firm even line gave place to a freer and more broken treatment expressive of mass and mystery , rather than of keenly marked contours . An example of this later manner of rendering leafage represents a group of dried autumnal oak leaves . Here the qualities to be set forth were the beauty of organic structure , and of surface flexures , ruling the torn raggedness of the shriveled , wind-blown spray . It is wrought broadly with the water-color pencil , in purple and brown , with loaded body-color in the lights . No lead-pencil outline is visible , and no minute elaboration of contours occurs ; but the forms are rapidly swept in with marvelous skill and with subtle sense of action . I know nothing comparable to it but the more sketchy work of Tintoretto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also did much , at first in the manner of Prom , but with a superior refinement and beauty . In preparation for The Seven Lamps , and The Stones of Venice , he made many drawings , and in these he developed a manner which was his own . The economical methods of lead pencil and wash , or pen and wash , were genorally employed ; but occasionally he went further , and made large and elaborate water-color drawings of architecture . Among the most beautiful of these is one of the south porch of St. Mark 's , made in 1876 , and now in the possession of Professor Norton . In its massive structure and opalescent color this drawing is most noteworthy . In all renderings of architecture he gives the entire visual aspect of a building as it stands to-day , with the marks of time and the softening touches of nature . He sets forth tho total pictorial charm , rather than the purely architectural char- acter , of a given monument , or detail . In addition to such drawings from nature and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the works of great masters of painting . He did this as a means of study , and as for this end complete copying is generally not so useful as the making of abstracts in line and color , he rarely made complete copies ; but from nearly all of the great Italian masters , from Giotto to Titian , he made studies in outline , or Biol. ple renderings of color schemes . Less frequently he made more finished studies of parts of works that particularly interested him , and among such studies is the remarkable one of the head of Carpaecio 's sleeping St. Ursula , now in the SW-field Museum . While in these copies he strove hard in each case to be faithful to his original , and rarely failed to secure a trustworthy record of it , he was yet unable to efface himself . He could not make a mechanical copy . He naturally emphasized the qualities which chiefly appealed to him , and his own genius is delightfully recognizable in every such study . An essential feature of Ruskin 's phi-losophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral conditions , and the reaction of art itself upon moral character . It is this which constitutes the chief peculiarity of his teaching ; and it is on this point that this teaching has of late , in some quarters , been most en-ergetically opposed . Of the proposition that moral conditions influence the arts , and determine their quality , there call , however , be no serious question . The works of man inevitably reflect his char-acter , moral or immoral , as the case may be . And the fine arts are always man 's fullest expression of himself . It does not , however , follow that a great artist is always a man of the highest moral principle . It is undeniable that many great artiste have had grave moral weaknesses . Individuals are not wholly responsible for their moral tendencies ( thought they John Ruskin as ; i ? e for their moral conduct ) . But man 's work is not a reflection of himself as as individual alone . Where great art exists there must have been tine moral fibre somewhere back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in his predecessors . ' The artistic power of a person , or of a people , is largely a matter of inheritance . If an artistic nice , actuated by high ideals , develops like the Greeks a noble art , the artistic power will not instantly fail when the ideals are forsaken ; but it will not long survive in its integrity . The relaxed moral restraints and the coarser sentiments of the later Greek civilization are mirrored in the later art of Greece . As to the influence of art upon moral character , it has been thought that Ruskin has formulated some questionable conclusions on this head , as where in the opening of the Oxford lecture on The Relation of Art to Morals , he states that one of the functions of the fine arts is that of " perfecting the morality or ethical state of men . " It has been denied that art has any power to exert a moral influence . History , it has been said , shows that familiarity with the greatest works of art has not availed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same may be said of all moral . forces . They are always powerless against determined resistance . It is only where some favorable disposition exists that any moral influence avails ; and where this does exist it is impossible to believe that all forms of expression of the beautiful have not their influence in quickening the moral sense . From the time when he began to write on social matters his art teaching has been involved with theories which have met with not wholly unmerited opposition . His ideas on social and political order , while springing from a noble heart , and containing a vast amount of wholesome truth set forth with matchless eloquence and prophetic fervor , are // weakened by fundamental misconceptions , and even by temperamental per-verseness . His doctrine of authority , as laid down in ' rime and Tide ( pages 72-79 ) , has in it too much of the arbitrary element ; and the impossibility of enforcing it under existing conditions does not seem to occur to him . He presupposes an entirely wise and incorruptible central authority , with a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no individual in the state could escape . For a social reformer he was not well equipped , either by nature or by education . He did not see that men must be led in freedom . He did not respect freedom . He did not see that character can be formed only by voluntary conformity with the divine laws of life . Repression and compulsion , while necessary , under existing conditions , for the maintenance of outward order , have no potency to reform human nature . Ile desired to enforce principles of right living , and the slowness of men to conform to such principles made him impatient . But a reformer needs vast patience . Impatience , anxiety , irritability , and excitability are weaknesses which unfit a man to help his fellows ; and with all his genius and all his nobility of soul , Ruskin had these weaknesses in large measure . He also had a large share of the common weakness of egotism . Into his teaching on social order he put himself too much . In his later years his self-confidence became almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He suffered acutely during these years . What seemed to him the reckless pursuit of commonplace material ends in the world around him kept his mind in a state of hot indignation . He could see nothing hopeful in the signs of the times , and lie became incapable of faith in ultimate good . The disfigurement of the landscape by the inroads of mechanical works , and the wanton destruction of great monuments of the past , pained him 450 The Quest after Music . to the quick . He felt that everything was going hopelessly to the bad . Thus his later writings are often weakened by querulousness , and vitiated by fallacies . Yet even in these the generosity of his nature , the tenderness of his sympathies , and the noble elevation of his aims are always manifest .
