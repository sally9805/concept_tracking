txt Wall Street had an exciting clay of it yesterday , stock-marketwise , with total dealings on the Exchange amounting to over 1,200,000 shares  --  the record day for the year . Irresponsible talk of a " corner " in Louisville and Nashville , which in the early trading rose over 5 points to the highest price on record ; suggestions that there might be a repetition of the Northern Pacific episode of May last ; forecasts of an unfavorable crop report , showing the 1 condition as of April 1 of Winter wheat , , i and a flurry in call money  --  these , the " corner " talk primarily  --  were the influencing factors in the day 's developments . These developments consisted chiefly in the advance in Louisville and Nashville on tremendous dealings  --  nearly 280,000 shares of the stock being dealt in  --  and in sharp declines throughout the f remainder of the list , caused by selling coming in I ! part from timid or weakly margined holders ; in part from the professionals , and in part from shorts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long side , in order the better to protect their accounts in the event of a further rise in Louisville and Nashville . How severe were the declines forced as a result of this concentrated pressure will appear from the following partial list of net losses in representative stocks , Louisville and Nashville all the while holding strong : St. Paul , 2% ; St. Paul preferred , 2 ; Northwest , 21/4 ; Big Pour , 1% ; Colorado Fuel , 1% ; ' Westinghouse . 6 ; General Electric , 114 ; Wisconsin Central , 1% ; Wisconsin Central preferred , 2144 .

At no time , however , was there anything approaching demoralization  --  this , for the reason that the public is not in the market to any extent , stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the close of the day a number cf prominent bankers gave it as their opinion  --  based , they declared , on private information come to them  --  that all danger of a " corner " in Louisville was past , and that the general stock market position is altogether sound . A COSTLY ERROR . Of course the overshadowing feature of the market was the movement in the Louisville stock , and the incidents and reports attending it . At the outset it may be said that had it not been for the error of a stock broker on the floor of the Exchange it is doubtful if the stock would ever have jumped as it did jump in the early trading from 114% to 120 ? this remarkable rise being the forerunner of the " corner " talk . It seems that the broker in question received an order to buy 2,500 shares when the stock was around 116 . Through a mistake the order was taken as one to sell . and the 2,500 shares were accordingly sold without having any appreciable effect on the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereupon being compelled to rush into the crowd , and not only to cover his short stock , but to go long of the 2,500 shares , which he had been ordered to buy . That is to say , 5,000 shares had to be purchased , carrying the price up to 118 . At that figure some stop loss orders were reached , and these , executed by the same broker , lifted the price to 120 . The error cost the broker something like $15,000 . The following running record , taken from the tape , shows the nature of the transactions at the time : 1.000 shares , 117% ; 2,000 , 1173/4 ; 500 , 1171/2 ; 300 , 117% ; 300 , 117% ; 500 , 1171 , . ; 1,200 118 ; - 1,200 , 118% ; 200 , 118% ; 1,500 , 119 ; 100 , 119% ; 500 , 119% ; 500 , 119% ; Z000 , 1191,6 ; 1,000. 119% ; 2,000 , 119 ; 400 , 118% ; 1,000 ; 119 ; 100 , 119% ; 100 , 120 ; 600 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , . after much irregularity , fell to 115% , then rallied several points , then again fell , and finally closed at 118 , making a net advance of 3% points . At the end of the day the stock was loaning " flat " in the loan crowd , and in some quarters it was said that there still remained a. short interest of ' about 25,000 shares . All day long the Street was busy discussing the stock , the why and the wherefore of its movement , the probable buyers , and the probable sellers . Early in the morning the impression was that there might be something in the report that the Southern Railway was buying for control , but as the day wore on this theory found fewer and fewer adherents , and finally the opinion grew that the movement from its very inception was nothing more nor less than a clever manipulative game on the part of J. W. Gates and certain of his followers . Among these , it may be said on authority , the Moore Brothers are not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a positive denial from President Spencer of the Southern Railway that his system was - in any way concerned in the purchases : from the repeated assertion of August Belmont . Chairman of the Louisville Board of Directors , that Mr. Gates was back of the whole movement , and from a well-authenticated story of a " scene " on the evening . previous at an up-town hotel between Mr. Gates and his followers . As this last story runs . ' these adherents of Mr. Gates went to him on Wednesday evening , declared that the talk of a " corner " might seriously hurt the rest of the market in which they were interested , expressed themselves as satisfied with their profits as the stock then stood . ( 1141A ) and concluded with the statement that they must insist that the pool dissolve . To this Mr. Gates is said to have answered , with much wrath , that he would take up the Louisville holdings of the complaining gentlemen at a price two points above ' , the then market price , but that hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with ? ' him . As /the gossip continues , the upshot of it all was that the pool remained intact , and continued its operations yesterday . ? In view of this , little attention was paid to a number of fresh reports suggesting other reasons for the advance in the Louisville stock , such , for instance , as that the Pennsylvania Railroad is to lease it on a guaranteed 6 per cent , dividend basis , or that the real purchaser is the Seaboard Air Line . . THE TREASURY STOCK SALE REPORT . The talk persisted throughout the day that the report was true that some days ago the Louisville and Nashville Company had sold 50,000 shares of its treasury stock in the open market , and that as a result ( inasmuch as this stock ' will not-be a good . ' delivery until listed , which ordinarily takes - thirty days ) the management found ' itself in the position of being technically short of the stock , and , being unable to borrow against the sales , compelled it to go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock so sold . Chairman Belmont yesterday refused absolutely to discuss this phase of the matter . It was suggested , ? however , that it might not be necessary for purchases in this manner ; that Directuponorof t - to the ** 13ter prevailed and deliver to the company their own stock . A feature of the trading in the issue during the day was the sale of not a few blocks of stock , " seller , ten days . " This was taken to signify selling for London account , the sellers having ten days ' time for delivery of the stock .. Southern Railway shares did not maintain the advances scored on the day previous , the common selling down fractionally on dealings in 136,000 shares , and the preferred 1% on transactions involving 8,000 shares . It was reported at the close of business that a meeting of the Governing Committee of the Stock Exchange had been held to consider the status of the Louisville and Nashville affair , and prevent any stock market disturbance . At the office of the Secretary it was said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received at the office of President Keppler , but , notwithstanding these denials , the report was said by several stock brokers to be true .
