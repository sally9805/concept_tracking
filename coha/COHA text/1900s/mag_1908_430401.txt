 | CRIMES and misdemeanors are defined as public wrongs , since they affect not only the individual , but likewise the community . A brief inquire into the nature of modern criminal statutes indicates that they are usually , founded upon natural laws or upon principles which appeal to mankind as right . " In proportion to the importance of the criminal law , " Blackstone says , " ought also to be the care and attention of the legislature in properly framing and enforcing it . It should be founded on principles that are permanent , uniform and universal , and always conformable to the dictates of truth and justice , the feelings of humanity and the undeniable rights of mankind . " It is. evident1v , undesirable to increase the number of crimes and criminals . Crime is a very serious matter . ' New crimes never should be created unless there is an absolute necessity for their creation , and when such necessity clearly appears , the law creating the new crimes should be permanent , and not subject to change from year to year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by the good accomplished by the laws defining the new public wrongs . Applying this measure to our game laws , we observe that the game has diminished with startling rapidity , notwithstanding the creation of hundreds and possibly thousands of game law crimes . Without fear of contradiction I say that no man living can say how many crimes there are , and Blackstone , were he writing today , would be appalled at the number , and would despair of listing them . It is evident there must be a better way of making the game abundant than by the further increase of the number of game law crimes . 1 believe when the 3.000.000 guns in the United States are told that they must look after the game . and that it is neither disgraceful nor criminal to do so , many will undertake the necessary work , and that all will be benefited . When we observe that the game seen in our Eastern markets is imported , for the most part . from countries which have not created these new crimes , we are forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is far better for the community than an abundance of crime without any game . The wild food-birds evidently are intended for food , and , as I have said before . ' cheap food for the people is more  | important than indifferent sport , and the food question should , therefore , he first considered by the State . It follows that laws which prohibit the rearing of the wild food-birds for the market and which define such transactions as public wrongs or crimes , altho they may be urged by some sportsmen as being in the interest of sport , can not be said to be " conformable to the dictates of truth and justice , the feelings of humanity and the undeniable rights of mankind . " Anv one who is at all familiar with our game laws must admit that they are not founded on principles that are permanent , uniform and universal . The legislature is asked to change the game laws every year . That which is criminal one year is not criminal the next , and the reverse is equally true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the term of imprisonment and the amount of the fine are not only different in different States . b.rt they differ often in many counties of a State , and the most intelligent lawyers will decline without careful and oftrepeated examinations of the statutes to v just what is criminal and what is not criminal , and their difficulties are always increased while the assemblies are sitting and for some time after their adjournment . Dr. Palmer , of the United States Department of Agriculture , who , in all probability , can name more game law crimes than any one in the United States , refers in a bulletin to the increasing complexity of the laws and the prevalence in some States of county laws , and says " but as some are inaccessible cud others are likely to be changed at any time , a complete and accurate summary of them is impracticable . " He also says : " In the number of bills introduced and in the general demand for change of some sort , the record of 1907 is second to that of no previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equaled by the legislation of 1905 . " Mr. Harry V. Radford , whose good works in restoring the " elk. " moose and beaver to the Adirondacks are well known to sportsmen and naturalists and who was active in helping to build up the present system of game laws , says in a letter which came while I was engaged in writing the foregoing lines : You have converted me fully to your theory of game preservation . . The incubus of innumerable laws is a kill-joy to sport . We are worried to death while shooting for fear we may be breaking some law . There are so many , not even a sporting editor can hope to remember them all . We must carry a ' big book . " There is no fredom , no democracy , no Americanism about it . " And this State is at this moment revising ( no , has just revised ) the entire code of game laws . It seems to think the secret lies in fixing up the law . Legislatures juggle with and mix and muddle it every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to think they arc reaching the golden mixture of perfection ? a kind of modern alchemism . " I had written that the Colorado laws protected the last herd of buffalo at all times , but that the last buffalo in the Colorado herd was dead . Mr. Radford evidently had the buffalo in mind at the same time , since in his letter he says : " No amount of restriction has saved the buffalo . But he is increasing steadily , tho slowly , within large preserves . In the future I shall see that no moose , wapiti and beaver , in which I am so much interested , are released on preserved lands in the Adirondacks ? not on State or public lands . I find they thrive best on the former . I held the opposite view once , presuming the public would be more interested in their safety if released on State lands ; but I find the public is a poor factor to count on . " It would be impossible-within the limits of this paper to enumerate the crimes due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to any one . A description of them would be of little value , since it is absolutely certain that they will be much changed within a year . There are , however , certain crime groups which we may profitably examine in order to determine if the laws creating the new crimes are founded on principles which are permanent , uniform and universal and always conformable to the dictates of truth and justice , the feelings of humanity and the undeniable rights of mankind , and to determine , further , if the laws creating the new crimes are absolutely necessary and if they are beneficial or harmful . One group of crimes may be designated as the " game-hog " group , since the laws creating these crimes had their origin in the repeated assertions of an editor that all who shot many birds in one day were " game-hogs . " These laws are intended to increase the game by limiting  | the number of animals which can be taken legally in a clay by each gun . We observe that the daily bag limit for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different in many counties of a State . We find upon an examination of the statutes for a series of years that the bag limit laws are ever changing to suit the whims of those who are engaged in deciding for others whether it would be best for them to take three or five or some other number of grouse or quails or woodcock in a day , and we find that those who suggest this kind of legislation are especially fond of variety , since they have different numbers for each species of game , and juggle them yearly to gratify their fondness for change . This kind of lawmaking has grown to be an annual industry of vast and ever increasing proportions . One hundred and thirty ill-assorted game laws were presented to the legislative committees of one State last year . A punishment for violating the bag-limit laws is uncommon . At a meeting of the Harris County ( Texas ) Game Protective Association , one member , a prominent building contractor , stated he would do his best not to fracture the law , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunshot he did n't believe he would be able to resist the temptation to take a shot at it . Another member thought under those circumstances a man would be excusable , but that after violating the law he should walk up to the captain 's office like a little man and pay his fine . This means of enforcing the law is evidently unreliable . Bag-limit laws are especially harmful , since they prevent the increase of game by individuals and by syndicates of sportsmen and farmers . Why should anything be increased , at some expense , when it can not be utilized It should no longer be a crime to shoot and market game from preserves . If the bag-limit laws are not repealed , they should at least be amended , so they will not restrict those who wish to make the game plentiful . The crime area can be largely reduced . In some places where it has been reduced the game is wonderfully abundant . ' Another group of crimes has been created by laws prescribing the seasons when the different species of game may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the different States and often in counties of a State ; they are changed much from year to year , and usually end in a prohibition of shooting at all times or for a period of years . They are in no wise permanent , uniform or universal . The laws which prohibit the taking of game in the spring are an exception . These laws easily can be made permanent and uniform thruout the country , and when once made , in all probability they will not be changed . They quickly become known and are easily understood and remembered , since the entire season when the birds are nesting or when they are too young for the gun is included . The shooting of game in the breeding season is clearly mala in se , and all , excepting a few persons who for years have been accustomed to shoot game out of season , readily agree that the laws prohibiting spring shooting are " conformable to the distates of truth and justice , the feelings of humanity and the undeniable rights of mankind . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the birds are strong on the wing and in excellent condition for the table ; " when the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder in the stock , " and when it is a pleasure to be out of doors with dog and gun . Under ordinary circumstances there should be nothing criminal about the taking of grouse and wild fowl in September and partridges or " quails " in October and as late as the end of the year or even until February 1st . The laws which prohibit shooting save for a short season beginning when the late autumn storms mar the pleasure of the outing , or when the ducks have deserted the marshes on account of the ice , ' are only justifiable on account of the necessity of  | saving the game from extinction . Since they provide for fines or imprisonment they should be uniform and permanent . It certainly should not be legal to shoot in one county and illegal to shoot in another county at the same time . Another group of crimes which seriously affect all of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the open season or during certain portions of the open season and after certain dates following the close of the season . These laws , like the others , are constantly changed and are often different in counties as well as in States . At first glance the sale of any food which is wholesome , seasonable and palatable does not appear to be a felony . It is an old and well-established legal principle that altho game belongs to the State or crown when alive it becomes the personal property of the person shooting it when it has been legally taken . In the United States , however , it is held that the dead bird , altho legally taken , belongs to the State , and the number of crimes , of course , has been multiplied . The incentive to propagate and increase game disappears at once when it becomes known that the game can not be legally owned or handled even after it is shot . It seems remarkable that a single bird has survived since it is well known that game can not exist long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again we observe that the game has rapidly diminished since the laws were enacted prohibiting its sale and creating many new crimes . This legislation , therefore , has not caused the best results obtainable for all of the people , who are said to own the game , and no one can deny that if the remnant of game now living can be quickly multiplied so as to reduce appreciably the cost of meat , to increase the value of the farms , to give employment to many people in the country and if , at the same time , crime can be much diminished and , in all probability , it can be made a thing of the past , so far as shooting game in the autumn and the sale of it are concerned , our legislation should be so shaped in the future as to bring about such good results . There can be no doubt that land values have rapidly decreased during the past twenty years in the United States , and that many farms have been abandoned . There can be no doubt that practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lands where game is made abundant rapidly increase in value , are always tenanted , and that agreeable employment is provided for many people in the country . In Scotland , during the period referred to , land values have been tremendously increased by shooting . Lands which a few years ago were practically worthless now yield millions of dollars annually because the game has been properly looked after , ' and a good part of the money comes from America . There are many game law crimes which are fanciful ; some even cause a smile whenever they are mentioned . It is a crime to photograph a deer without paving $10 in Wyoming . It is a crime to sail on the bay on the Lord 's day to see what the clucks are doing or " to locate them for a future day , " as a North Carolina statute reads . It requires a wide stretch of the imagination to regard a person as a criminal ( who has paid a non-resident license fee of $25 and who has shot a partridge ) because he attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is criminal , however , in all States which absolutely prohibit the export of game . Another group of crimes has been created by laws prohibiting the killing of certain predaceous animals at all times or during certain seasons . Skunks , crows , minks , foxes and other animals which destroy game and poultry are said by naturalists to do a certain amount of good catching mice , grasshoppers , etc . They do not deny that these animals take game birds and their eggs , and in part it is well known that they must be controlled in places when it is thought de-  | sirable to have game for the gun . ' There is a great variety of opinion about the amount of damage caused by each species of vermin and the laws are often changed to meet the views of those who are engaged in deciding if it would be best for others to have skunks , crows and other vermin on farms which they own or rent for the shooting . 0ne or more crimes is created in the interest of each nest robber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would decide in favor of leaving the matter to the game preserver so far as his lands are concerned . To be consistent , those who urge this kind of legislation should insist that wolves be not destroyed on sheep ranges ; but such laws would not appeal to many as conformable to the undeniable rights of mankind . I doubt much if a jury of farmers , de vicinitate , would convict a farmer for killing a skunk if the evidence disclosed the fact that it was shot while engaged in robbing a henroost . The constable of Chippewa County , Ia. , however , was sent to jail for shooting without a license when he killed the mink which destroyed his hens and geese . ' In the last report of the California Commission " ' one and one-half dozen owls are included in a long list of seizures , and their disposition is given as " donated to hospitals and asylums . " Some owls are noted game destroyers and possibly these were caught red-taloned by the person who became a criminal on their account . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and also for the halt and blind who dined on owl . This , however , is more game than mama hospitals have seen in recent years . There are many laws making it a criminal offense to export game or even to transport it within the State . The moving of desirable food is , of course , not wrong in itself , and as I have pointed out " it seems a poor way to increase anything by making it contraband . The game rearer must be excepted from such legislation if the increase of game is desirable . The best that can be claimed for this kind of legislation is that it may have delayed the extermination of the game . We insist that it has prevented the increase of game by many who would increase it provided it seemed profitable to do so . Now that the ruffed grouse has become a rare bird , worth $3 and perhaps more in the market , the temptation to ship and sell it is large and the slight investigations which I have made to ascertain what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much danger of arrest and will be , in all probabilitc , until they become extinct . A gamekeeper would certainly prevent the taking of many of the birds in his charge and would make them so plentiful that those taken hardly would be missed . Laws which make the trapping and sale of live birds for propagation criminal offenses , of course , tend to diminish the game since they prevent its sensible increase . Laws of this character certainly are not founded on the principles above mentioned , which should underlie all criminal enactments . The California Commissioners , observing the folly of such laws . say : " While the letter of the law forbids the sale of pheasants or quail it is our contention that the spirit of the law is to prevent the sale of dead birds for market purposes , but that permits should be freely issued for transferring the birds from one party to another who desires to propagate them . " It is not likely , however , that many officers who make their living sharing the penalties collected in game law cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be violated even by intelligent game officers . They should at once be made uniform and permanent thruout the country ? permitting the utmost freedom in the handling of game for propagation . It is eminently proper that the State should prohibit the shipping of thousands of birds to be scattered by the State officers of another State in places where no one properly will look after them since , as we have observed , vermin will take the larger part of them . ' And it is a selfevident proposition that the sportsmen and gunners who have exterminated the indigenous game will quickly dispose of any remnant of the imported stock which may be left after vermin has freely dined  | for a good part of the year . A tremendous waste is prevented by the laws prohibiting such transactions which are evidently mala in se . With all the foregoing facts in mind it seems unfortunate that the game officers are required to make many small arrests : to rummage continually in the ice boxes of hotels ( without search warrants in many States ) and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of those arrested but of sympathizing ' friends sometimes , when the arrest seems to he prompted by a desire to share in a fine or for other reasons which may not seem good . It is most unfortunate that they must rely much upon informers who share the penalties and that the number of people engaged in this business is large . We must expect our present excellent game officers to be rapidly replaced by politicians now that large State game funds are created and now that the patronage must be much increased to handle a multitude of crimes . The Minnesota State Board , in its last report , well says : " The board 's opinion , Governor , is that politics and game protection , like oil and water , will not mix , and wherever tried , game and fish protection stiffer and no one is real ; benefited . " In Minnesota the sale of trout from preserves is permitted and crime so far as the fish is concerned has become a thing of the past . The executive aent of the Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the markets are supplied with trout and , so far as they call observe , without loss to the public waters . Whv should not the people have game in abundance from similar sources if tile crimes due to the game laws thus can b made to disappear ? A New York woman wrote to me some time ago saying she wished to go to the country and rear pheasants : she asked if , in my opinion , it would he profitable . I wrote to her that she would he a criminal ( ! ) if she sent one to a New York dealer or hotel . The letter of this woman ( a stranger ) prompted me to write much that I have written for THE INDEPENDENT . I care very little about big bags of game or the sale of it . I really belong to the modern landscape school of sportsmen , since I regard the health-giving exercise and the pleasures of the ramble in the autumn woods and fields as fully as important and entertaining as the shooting is . The game , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shooting undeniably is a pleasure , excelled by none , for those who shoot . I regret , as every sportsman must , the end of field sports , which clearly is approaching . I regret , as every citizen must , that crime due to the game laws evidently is increasing . California " is PROUD TO SUBMIT " a tabulated statement showing " the increase in the number of arrests from year to year and the amount of fines during the past ten years . " The making of new crimes seems to he in its infancy . Many fanciful restrictions of sport are being considered . The prohibition of the use of pointers and setters seems to be the most important of the new fancies which have come to the writer 's notice . The desire for this change , with its attendant crime , has appeared in several States . One game officer recommends it in his report . The necessity for new restrictions increases rapidly as the game vanishes . The laws for the most part are amateurish in charac ter ; they usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles which should underlie criminal enactments , and it certainly is unwise to continue this reckless crime making . In concluding this series of papers , the writer again urges those who wish to perpetuate field sports in America to undertake the sensible propagation of game under some agreeable arrangement with the farmers . The society of game preservers , I am sure , will insist that all restriction be removed from those who make game plentiful . There is danger of the State game departments becoming governmental sideshows , exhibiting many curious crimes . with special police to look after them . They should he changed to advantage and made largely civil departments , with officers engaged to look after the increase of game . They should distribute  | any seed they may have for distribution to those who will agree to multiply it in places where the new criminal laws are neither needed nor wanted . The people must bear the burden of making game plentiful , just as they bear all other burdens when anything is increased . America quickly can be made the largest game producing country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
