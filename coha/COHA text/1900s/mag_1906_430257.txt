IN the attempt of the French to - secure a permanent control in Morocco , in the intervention of Germany , and in the assemblage of a Moroccan conference at Algeciras in Spain , we may witness the prelude to the closing act in the drama of Moorish independence . Very possibly the young Sultan , Abd El Aziz ; * may prove to be the last independent ruler of the Drisite dynasty ? a dynasty which dates back no less than some 1,200 years . According to the chronicler , Ibn Khaldun , in 788 Idris , a great-great-grandson of Hassan ( who was a son of Ali and of Fatima ) , had fled from Arabia , and , passing around by the Desert of Sahara , had come up to Tangier . where he was amicably received by the Berbers . Ed Dris or Idris . as it is pronounced , was fleeing from the dread of death at the hands of the Khalif El Mehdi . It may seem rather a far cry from circumstances connected with the present day to go back so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously enough , no less than four of the chief personages who were concerned either in my capture or in my subsequent release were all descendants of this very Idris : First , the Sultan of Morocco . who paid the indemnity of $70.000 in order to secure my release ; secondly , the young chereefs of Wazan , who brought up a relief expedition to  | bring me supplies and who remained with me : and , thirdly , Raisuli , who was my captor . The fact which I gave you here concerning this Idris and a good deal of the other matter is taken from the first volume of M. De Slane , page 24 , of " Le Tresor de Chronologie du Moyen Age de Maslatrie , " which is one of the most complete and celebrated chronicles which we have . It had pleased me to place myself thus . as it were , on the boundary at Tangier between our Western life and the life of the East ? of the old world . But it was one thing to look , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely like those of the time of Idris , or even farther back ; it was quite another thing to be snatched away from one 's home and friends and family and to be plunged into the lawless condition of such a period . THE LAND OE THE EXTREME WEST El Moghereb is the name by which Morocco is known in native official documents . The inhabitants , however , speak of their country as " El Gharb . " This term , " El Moghereb , " signifies the land of the extreme west ? that is , of the extreme west of the African Continent . It is probably derived from the verb which means to sink , or the sunset ; so that in English it is sometimes described as the sunset land . The varied domains of this vast territory ? almost as large as either France or Spain ? are protected from the desert winds which sweep over Algeria and Tunis by a barrier of snow-capped mountain ranges ? those of the greater and of the lesser Atlas , forming , as it were . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spur strikes out and runs down at right angles to the seacoast and terminates in an abrupt eminence known to the ancients as Mount Abyla and to the Arabs as Djebel Moussa . The range itself is known as the Riff Mountains , and offers a splendid barrier or defense toward the east ? that is , toward Algeria . It was among these mountains that we were taken prisoners . The population of Morocco has been variously estimated at from so trivial a number as four million up to seventy million ; but , as none of our authors who have made these statements have been able to base their reports upon any census , it is the vaguest kind of guesswork . The country gives to strangers who do not know it the impression of being very sparsely populated , because the natives avoid the neighborhood of the highroads . This is due to the continual passage of troops , and because the inhabitants are subjected to what is called the system of supplying " rnoona. " ? a system which enables travelers to procure letters from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads the necessity of supplying food , not only for the travelers themselves , but for all their escorts ; so that it is a very serious tax ; and the natural consequence is that the inhabitants avoid the neighborhood of the highroads as much as possible . Therefore the travelers going back and forth see very few inhabitants in the few villages that still remain . But people who know the country better ? the merchants and others who travel in the country itself ? realize very soon that it is much more densely occupied than would appear from the highways . THE BERBERS-THEIR ANTIQUITY About two-thirds of this population are probably Berber or of Berber descent . These Berbers are the aborigines . They are a purely white race and a very energetic and vigorous people . The term " berber " itself is possibly derived from the Semitic root ber , which means land . Therefore " berber " would mean " land of the land or it may be simply a corruption of the Greek term " Barbaroi , " applied by the early Greek navigators to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast along the southern shore of the Mediterranean . Hence we have  | the nomenclature of the Barbary State including Barka , Tripoli , Tunis . Algiers . and Morocco . These Berbers antedated Phoenician . Carthaginian , Roman , Gothic . Byzantian. and Arab occupation by centuries upon centuries ; it is probably one of the oldest races ; and there are certain ethnologists at the present day , at the head of whom is an Italian writer named Sergi , who maintain that the theory of those successive invasions of Caucasians , about which we have all read , and which are generally believed to account for the origin of the races of southern Europe , did not furnish the main part of the population of the Mediterranean basin , but that the latter was derived from these Berbers , a white race which has many resemblances to the ancient Etruscans . They are quite like the pictures also of some of the ancient Egyptian dynasties . THEY HAVE ALWAYS WITHSTOOD SUBJUGATION These people have always been opposed to any attempt to bring them under control , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive governments for any great length of time . Their desire is never to recognize any more authoritative control than that of their own village elders . It is from this , race that the two great sects of the early church of the fourth and fifth centuries , known as the Donatists and Cercumceliones , are descended . These were really a sort of Christian nihilists , a sect which swept away many of the towns and villages of the Roman senators ? a destruction which was finally- completed by the great Arabic invasion which swept over much of that country , and which seems to have been itself on very friendly terms with these Berbers . The Berbers , as you are all very well aware , joined the Arab invaders and formed a large contingent of the Saracen tribes who overwhelmed the Gothic kings of Spain . They did not speak of themselves generally as Berbers ; they called themselves Schleuh described the various dialects of their tongues as of the Schilhak language . They could not even understand or communicate with the Arab tribes without an interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can not communicate at all with their fellow Arabian laborers . The name " Morocco " can be traced to the Roman designation of Mauritania , the natives being called in Spanish " Mauros , " " Moriscos , " and finally " Maros. " and hence in English " Moors . " The word " Morocco " may also be an effort at approximation to Marekshe , the southern capital of the country which we know as Morocco City . Whatever may be the origin of the term " Berber , " these people speak of themselves as " Schleuh . " When the successive Arab invasions , beginning in 711 , broke upon the country ( that was in the year 200 of the Hegira ) this Berber population was ultimately driven by the Arabs from the plains and from the richer valleys and forced to take refuge among the Atlas Mountains ; and in these mountain ranges they have always remained , a thorn in the side of the Arab rulers and a great menace and danger to the people of the lowlands , whenever the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sultan at the head of affairs . THE JEWS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR There are two other important factors among the population ? the Jews and the negroes . The Jews are mostly exiles from Spain and Portugal , having been driven out after the Moors had been expelled from Spain . The Jews were driven out by the Inquisition , and a great many of them came over to Morocco and settled there . Others went as far east as Turkey . Still others visited other countries . Those who settled in Morocco were almost all confined to a special quarter of the towns , entitled El Mellah . This word Mellah means salt , and it  | conies from a very curious feature in the customs of the country . Whenever rebellions break out ? and they are very frequent occurrences ? the soldiers in Morocco have instructions to bring in as many heads as possible . These heads have to be preserved and salted , and nobody likes to execute this commission ; consequently the Jews were compelled to undertake this revolting task . THERE IS NO DISTINCTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which the famous Bokhari guards were recruited . Some of these negroes occupied very high official positions . I may say , as it is an interesting question to us here , that after the death of the late Sultan of Morocco there was an interregnum of six years before the young Abd El Aziz was old enough to take the reins of power . During that time a negro regent named Ahmid ben Maussa governed , who was one of the most able rulers Morocco has ever had . He kept the country in perfect order and was very much respected by all who knew him . There is no distinction of color line in Morocco . The question is simply what is a man 's capacity . It does not matter what the shade of his complexion is in the least . The gentry of the country are mostly drawn from those Moors who were expelled from - Spain , and who returned to Morocco . All those who have any descent from the Prophet are called Chereefs . This word is derived from the root " Churf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old with honor . To say that anything is cliurfa means that it has become distinguished through time and circumstance . So that this is a sort of title of nobility ? religious and secular . THE BETTER FAMILIES Some of the better families still claim that they preserve the keys of the houses occupied by their ancestors in Granada , Cordoba , and Toledo and the other Spanish cities . The women of some of these families at the notheastern capital , Fez , wear embroidered upon their high scarlet head-dresses a golden key , a sort of symbol of this descent . I know some of these families who claim to still possess these keys , but I have never seen any of the keys . One consequence of the apparently long residence of the ancestors of these particular families in Spain is the extraordinary fairness of the complexion of a great many of their descendants even at the present time . For instance , the minister of foreign affairs at Tangier , Hadj Mohammed El Torres , whose name you sometimes see in the papers , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his name indicates , he is a descendant from one of these very families from the city of Tetuan . The explanation of this fairness of complexion is supposed to be the well-known fact that many of these Mohammedan chieftains of Spain intermarried with Gothic women . They are very proud of this and strive to keep it up and not to cross their blood . Consequently strangers who visit Morocco are very much astonished to find so many absolutely white men . THE SULTAN HAS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED ALLEGIANCE TO ANY OTHER POWER The Sultan , as you all know , is an autocrat . Neither he nor his ancestors have ever acknowledged allegiance to any other power . The confusion which exists on this point among so many people in this country is due to the fact that the neighboring province of Algiers was for a long time under the control of Turkey and was governed by Turkish beys . But the Sultan of Constantinople , who greatly desired to extend his control over Morocco , was never able to do so on account of the opposition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabiting the range of hills between Morocco and Algeria . They never allowed the Turkish government or its representative in Algeria to get a foothold in their own territory .  | The authority of the Sultan may be described as somewhat tempered by the Ulema . These Ulema are the " learned in the law . " The name comes from the verb " elm " or " ulm , " which means to learn . " They , together with the Chereefs and the Marabouts , are really the only authentic representatives of popular opinion in a country where there is no press . One of the greatest mistakes that this young Sultan committed after the death of that great negro regent was that he paid no attention to the opinion of these Ulema . He has had occasion since to greatly repent of this error . THE LAWYER IS ALSO A CLERGYMAN There is no distinction between professors of law and theology in any Mohammedan country , for the reason that the whole code is extracted from the Koran itself ; it is based upon Koranic precepts or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sayings , attributed to Mohammed or to his immediate successors . From this work we get the whole body of the law ; so that any one who is a member of this class of the Ulema or who , in other words , has taken his degree at the university or at the great mosque of Idris may be either a cleric ( or divine ) and go into the mosques and preach , or he may enter the mosques to devote himself to education as a professor . It all depends upon his power to attract classes . He does not have to ask permission from any authority , but can take up his quarters and hold forth , as lawyers and clergy all pass through exactly the same education and can occupy at pleasure one post or the other . Indeed , my family solicitor at Tangier was an incumbent of the principal mosque there and read the service regularly every Friday . He was a capable gentleman and , so far as my experience with him went , a very honorable and straightforward character , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions do not come to the people directly . They have gone through the hands of a series of commentators . it rn whom are derived the different religious sects of which there are four very prominent ones . They are called the Hanifi , the Chaafi , the Hanbali , and the Malaki . This last is the prevalent sect in Morocco . The only Mohammedan countries I know which are followers of this particular rite , which is the most narrow of all the sects of Mohammedanism , are Morocco and Afghanistan in Asia . To come back to the situation in Morocco , I should tell you a little about the peculiarity of the government . The government functionaries , from the Sultan down to the lowest grades , form what is called the Mekhazen , which is derived from a verb " hzn , " meaning " to bind . " I believe the word was first applied to that portion of the land or of the crops which , according to tradition , was set aside for the government and over which administrators were appointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief administrators of this treasury or magazine , they are the beneficiaries of the term and they are called the Mekhazen . The government of Morocco is always spoken of as El Mekhazen and the officials , from the Sultan clown to the guards and minor employees , are termed Mekhaznia . Curiously enough , from this word Mekhazen , meaning " a warehouse , " we probably get our expression " magazine . " The Sultan resides half the year at Fez , founded in 807 by the same Idris , and the other six months at Marakche , founded in 1130 , during the reign of Abd El Mumin , the monarch who built a great tower at Rabat and who also played a great role in Spain . Some of the principal Saracenic buildings there were erected under the influence of his reign . THE DIPLOMATIC CAPITAL/H . Tangier became the diplomatic capital on account of the extreme inconvenience  | to the foreign legations , with all their ministers and family establishments , of being obliged to follow the court in its continual migration from one capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no roads and many dangerous rivers to be traversed . Therefore the foreign consuls who would not have been safe in the interior remained at Tangier , and the Sultan appointed officers and delegated ministers of foreign affairs and of finance to treat with them at Tangier . Hence it is only occasionally , when some question of great importance has to be negotiated , that special missions are sent to the capital where the Sultan happens to reside . It is a very great affair , the departure of these special missions with their numerous guards . Great preparations are required , and it is quite an imposing sight to see the minister with his secretaries and attaches and his own legation guards , together with the imperial escort and standard in front , leaving Tangier on one of these expeditions . The name by which Tangier is known to the Arabs is Tanja . Tanja means clay . It also means a little clay vessel for cooking that the natives employed . Curiously enough , the classic name was Tingis , which is not very far removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an attempt of the English geographers to make the name conform to Algiers . Now Algiers itself is quite a misnomer , because the Arabic name for Algiers is El Gezire , meaning the city of the isle , from an island off the coast . They called the province itself " Der El Gezire , " the Land of the Island . The Roman name of the province about Tangier was Tingitania , established during the reign of Emperor Claudius . TANGIER AT ONE TIME BELONGED TO ENGLAND In 158o Alphonso of Portugal occupied Tangier , and in 1662 it was ceded to England as a part of the dower of the Princess Catharine Braganza when that princess married Charles II of England . Another part of her dower was Bombay , which was the origin of the great AngloIndian Empire . The Moors were just as well armed as the British in those days , and , owing to the improvidence of Charles II , they were a good deal better fed , because the garrison which occupied Tangier was left so unprovided with food that upon some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and clothes in order to get a little money to buy bread . In those days the arms of the Moors were probably superior to those of the English , and the latter were not able to hold the place long , owing to the constant attacks of the Moors . There are , however , some very well-known names that appear on the register during that English occupation of Tangier . We have the Earl of Teviot , Lord Dartmouth , Pepys , notable for his diary , and the Rev. Launcelot Addison , the father of Charles Addison , the writer ; and in a work which is extremely interesting , by Lieutenant Colonel Davis , " The History of the Second Queen 's Royal Regiment " ( now the West Surrey ) , it is stated that John Churchill began his military service in Tangier under the command of Colonel Kirk , who played such a sanguinary role in the Cromwellian wars of England during Jeffreys ' sanguinary assizes . In reading John Morley 's life of Oliver Cromwell I found to my great surprise that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromwell 's daughter , was confined in the Moorish castle at Tangier ; and there is a letter on record from his wife petitioning that he might be removed to some establishment in England , where she might provide him with the necessities which his station required . This particularly interested me , as my - youngest stepson , who has frequently resided with me in Tangier , is a direct descendant of this same General Fleetwood . Another little incident that amused me  | was that on coming here on the steamer last spring I was told on board ship that there was a family in New York called Tangier Smith ; that the founder of this family had been one of the English officials at Tangier during the English occupation of those 22 years , and that the family had always been known as Tangier Smith ; that the official in question returning to England had secured a grant of land in Long Island from King Charles , and had thus helped form one of our oldest settlements in colonial times . I was wondering whether my informant was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ; but when I went to one of the hotels in New York the very next name to mine on the register was Mrs. Tangier Smith . Up to about 1839 the naval power of the Sultan was supposed to be equal to repelling any aggression by any of the greater maritime powers , and some of the minor European states actually paid an annual indemnity to the Sultan of Morocco in order to protect their flags from aggression by the Salee rovers . The Sultan fitted out these pirate ships to go forth and capture vessels and bring them into port and hold the crews for ransom . If they were not ransomed the crews were sent up in the interior to work in gangs . The suppression of the rovers was largely due to the attitude taken by the United States , together with other powers like France and England , and to men like Decatur and Stockton.  | THE ENTRANCE OF FRENCH INFLUENCE On August 6 , 1844 , the French bombarded Tangier . This was a retaliation for the protection which the Moorish government had afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his forces upon Moorish territory when he was pursued by the French . In 1960 a Spanish force under General Primm marched up from Seutta to Tetuan and took that town after six weeks of severe fighting . Afterward the Moors recovered the place by means of a heavy indemnity ; but they had learned one great lesson , viz , that the wild charges of their own cavalry were helpless to protect them against troops who were supported by modern field artillery . This event led to an extraordinary change in the attitude of the Moorish government and people toward foreigners . However , this more amicable behavior of the natives was not due to any liking for us , but rather to the fear entertained of their own authorities , who , under pressure from the foreign consulates , punished with extreme severity any aggressions . The natives soon learned to value the intervention of foreigners in their behalf , and even sometimes paid a considerable price for such protection against the cruel exactions of their own governors . Not only did foreigners enjoy a remarkable security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their position during the entire reign of Umlai El Hassan might be described almost as that of privileged guards of the nation ? a position which I regret to say was often abused by officials and especially by the native proteges of the various consulates.  | THE BEGINNING Or DISORDER In 1894 Umlai El Hassan died . This Sultan was perhaps the ablest ruler Morocco ever enjoyed . and was as remarkable for his personal appearance as for his courteous manner and signal merits . His young son , Abd El Aziz , nominally Berbers in the neighborhood of Fez. rallied around this Pretender and even threatened Fez itself . For a short time the Sultan 's troops were so aroused that many of them deserted with their arms to the enemy , and the Sultan himself barely escaped capture . Since this experience Abd El Aziz has not ventured to leave Fez , excepting for a few weeks on a single occasion , lest the city should open its gates to the Pretender . The weakening of the Sultan 's hold upon power was followed by a marked alteration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . It was evident that the singular immunity and advantages we had so long enjoyed no longer existed , and it became a question as to whether it was wise to remain in the country . There were , however , many reasons why I hesitated to abandon my considerable interests in the country . I was at the time president of an international commission charged with the administration of the town of Tangier ; nor did I imagine that I myself would be exposed to any immediate danger , much less that I should be carried off as a hostage by the Berbers , or that the squadrons of our navy and the orders of my release here in Washington would become factors in the immemorial struggle between the Berbers of El Moghereb and the Sultan of Fez and Morocco . THE SURPRISE AND CAPTURE succeeded to the throne upon his father 's death , but did not assume the reins of power until the decease , in 1900 , of the Great Vizier , Ben Hamed Ben Mousa . A year or two later an adventurer known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Aziz , and many of the We had moved up two days before this startling event to Aidonia , our summer residence , on the Spartello headland about 5 miles from Tangier . The house which we had here erected is an unpretentious villa overlooking the entrance to the Straits of Gibraltar and surrounded by grounds some 300 acres in extent , embracing many varied features of woodland and of precipitous rock . This lovely locality has , however , been sadly spoiled for us by the alarm and insecurity caused by the Raisuli raid .  | The memory of that evening is indeed associated with an ineffaceable sense of horror . We had gathered in the drawing-room directly after dinner , when we were startled by loud screams from the servants ' quarters . Followed by my stepson , Mr. Cromwell Varley , whose wife and two daughters , just home from school at Geneva , completed , with Mrs. Perdicaris , our family circle , I rushed down a passage leading to the servants ' hall , where I came upon a crowd of armed natives . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these intruders might be a party from a neighboring village . Our night guards were supplied from this hamlet , and we supposed that they , like ourselves , had rushed in to learn the cause of the uproar , which we , at the moment , attributed to some renewal of a quarrel that had broken out on a previous occasion between a young German housekeeper and our French chef de cuisine , when the latter , irritated by some insulting allusion to the French defeats at Metz and Sedan , had attacked the housekeeper , when , as now , we had been startled by her screams . As I turned to inquire of these natives who crowded about me as to what had occurred , I saw some of our European servants already bound and helpless and , at the same moment , we ourselves were assailed by these intruders , who struck us with their rifles . At the same instant  | our hands were roughly twisted and bound behind our backs with stout palmetto cords that cut like knives . Varley , who made a fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the rifle blows would split his head , while his hand was cut to make him Once outside , our assailants endeavored to drive us down to the stables , but we managed to make our way toward a guard-house , where a couple of government soldiers were stationed rather as gatekeepers to attend visitors than for any purpose of defense . let go his hold upon one of the gang , whom he had liked to have strangled . At this moment the housekeeper , hearing our voices , rushed across the hall from her dining-room , where she had locked herself in , and , just as we were driven out of doors , we saw a blow aimed at her head and she fell to the floor . This was the last we saw , then , of any one in the house where I have never since set foot . RAISULI By a lamp in front of this building we saw our guards , our gardeners , and other native servants under cover of the rifles of . another party of mountaineers , while a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attired in the handsome dress worn by the native gentry . One of my men was reproaching this personage bitterly for this unprovoked aggression .  | The leader of the mountaineers raised his hand and , in low but emphatic tones , declared that if no rescue were attempted nor any disturbance made , no harm would befall us and in a few weeks we should be safely back among our people , adding , " I am Raisuli ! the Raisuli ! " surrender any money or valuables in the house , and that some political object had probably dictated this attack ? one which had been so unexpected and suddenly executed that neither our guards nor our grooms and gardeners , nor the Spanish workmen employed upon the estate , nor this , as I afterward discovered , being his clan appellation , since this chereef , or native nobleman , is known among his own followers as Mulai Ahmed ben Mohammed , the Raisuli . On hearing him declare his name I felt at once that the affair was possibly more serious than I had hitherto anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a mere summons to we ourselves had been able to make any defense , all of us having been simultaneously attacked and overpowered before we were aware of any impending danger . Raisuli had indeed been reported to be on the warpath for some time past , but as his operations had been confined to outlying native villages or to the smaller towns , no one imagined he would attack any one in the immediate neighborhood  | of Tangier ? where I myself , as president of an international commission that administered the affairs of the town , was in a position to requisition by telephone the entire available military force . Approaching him , bound as I was and in evening dress , I said to him in Arabic , " I know you by name , Raisuli , and I accept your safe conduct , but we can not go with you thus . We must have our overcoats , hats , and boots . " " Which of your servants shall I have released to return to the house for what you require ? " replied Raisuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on duty that evening . On indicating Bourzin , his bonds were cut and he was released ; but as he did not immediately reappear , Raisuli became impatient ; still he allowed another of my servants , a Spaniard , to also be released , and the latter quickly executed his commission . We had not time , however , to put on our boots before we were hurriedly made to mount . Several of our horses had been brought up from the stables , but either because it was feared that Varley might escape or because he had been wounded , he was put upon a mule which the mountaineers had brought with them , while I was allowed to select which of my animals I would  | ride . As I apprehended a long journey , I chose the youngest and most spirited of my horses . Before we mounted our hands were freed , upon giving our parole that we would not endeavor to escape . This was an immense relief , for those palmetto bonds cut into the wrist , while the constrained position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , allowed to hold the bridle ourselves , but were led off by the mountaineers , whose rough handling threw my horse into such a frenzy that it was with difficulty that I could keep my seat . Just as we were starting , Bourzin reappeared and volunteered to accompany me , to which Raisuli assented , and this attendant was also allowed a mount . Two of the mountaineers clambered upon Varley 's horse , a big chestnut , which was not saddled , while the saddle which had been hastily placed upon my horse was one that had been cast aside and the girths were rotten . As I learned afterward , this selection was due to a mistaken attempt of one of my grooms to save our saddles . He did not realize that they were required for our own use , and when he had been ordered to produce the saddles , had thrown this one to the mountaineers , declaring that the good saddles were all under lock and key at the house ? a mistaken zeal , which cost me , later on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus we were led off along the dark avenue beneath the overhanging branches of the trees . " At least , " I thought to myself , " At least the ladies know nothing of this horrible misadventure ! " since I pictured them as still awaiting in the drawingroom our return from the servants ' hall , to explain the uproar and the screams of the women . Very different , however , had been the alarming experience of the other members of the family during the few minutes which had elapsed between our leaving the drawing-room and our departure with the mountaineers . As we learned six weeks afterward , the ladies had presently followed us from the drawing-room , but when they reached the servants ' hall we had already been driven out of doors . As Mrs. Perdicaris endeavored to join us , one of the mountaineers , seizing her , threw her violently backward , down a half flight of stone steps onto the pavement , while Mrs. Varlev was pitched on top of her .  | The women servants , who alone had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women rushed past the mountaineers to the telephone , and before these savages realized her intention she called up the central office at Tangier , telling them of the attack and of our capture . Before she could say more she was torn from the instrument by the angry natives . At the same moment the screams of a pretty native servant struggling with the men , who were dragging her off , aroused my wife , who , despite the fact that she was seriously hurt from her fall , rushed to the woman 's assistance and Ayesha 's cowardly assailants , fearing Raisuli 's displeasure , hastily retired , balked of their proposed prey . Mrs. Perdicaris was then herself assisted to the front hall opening upon the portico or pergola , where she came upon Bourzin . Instead of bringing us our things , Bourzin stopped to reassure my wife , inventing a statement to the effect that I knew the leader of the band and had in the past rendered Raisuli a great service , and that we were now amicably coming to some arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , both the family and the servants , might be killed . As my wife listened she heard my voice from without as I addressed Raisuli and , noticing that I did not speak in tones either of excitement or alarm , she concluded that Bourzin was telling the truth ; consequently she waited near the door for my return , and in the meantime Bourzin slipped away , unnoticed , to rejoin me . THE MARCH BY NIGHT Needless to say the ladies waited in vain for our return , and when at last they ventured out onto the pergola all was silent . We had disappeared . As for ourselves we were led rapidly along the avenue leading away from the direction of the town , our horses being forced over the dry stone wall which encircles the property and driven along by many a bow from the rifles of our escort , as the men dragged the unwilling animals over rocks , through the underwood and brambles , and across the numerous watercourses , down toward the plain of Bubana to the west of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many an exciting steeple-chase or game of polo , looked as we now negotiated its water jumps and barriers in the darkness . Here and there we came unexpectedly to the ' steep cuttings of water-courses or to deep pools , which our captors made no attempt to turn nor to choose the easy places ; but as the fellow who held my bridle would hesitate upon the verge of such descents , my horse , pressing forward to escape the blows from the rear , would either step upon the heels of the man in front or push him unexpectedly over the edge , when all three of us would come rattling down into the water , into which we splashed , stumbling over the big boulders , each such incident terminating in a sharp blow upon my horse 's nose , administered by the angry native so soon as the latter recovered his footing . Ultimately I was , however , grateful even for these unpleasant interludes , since I was thus kept from reflecting upon the ulterior anxieties implied by our capture , owing to the effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town at a distance of several miles , our party struck across the fields toward the east , making in the direction of the track leading to Tetuan . Here the going was easier and we had more time to consider our situation . Varley and I , however , were intentionally kept apart from each other . Later on we found ourselves for a few moments within speaking distance , and my companion asked how I thought this business likely to end . " From what I have heard of Raisuli 's character , " I replied , " I hope we may not  | be ill-treated , for should it be deemed necessary to starve or torture us into signing for a heavy ransom , I believe we shall be left to these ruffians . So long as Raisuli himself is in view , I do not think we need apprehend any violence . " " I do not see him anywhere at present , do you ? " inquired Varley . The men who led our animals now warned us to be silent . It was therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as dawn broke and when a halt had been called on a hillside , we saw Raisuli himself emerging from the gloom . As he rode up I recognized the horse on which he was mounted as one I had lately purchased for my wife . This horse had been admirably broken to the saddle , but so soon as he was left to his own devices he became a terror to the grooms . What , then , was my surprise to see the horse kneel in order that Raisuli might dismount , and , after the latter had thrown the bridle carelessly over the horses 's neck , the animal stood , never offering to move as Raisuli advanced toward me . Hastily dismounting , I approached the chieftain , insisting that I should be allowed to communicate with my friends , explaining to Raisuli that I was an invalid and that unless I could procure the remedies I required he might at any moment have a dead prisoner instead of a live one on his hands . Raisuli made no answer ; he merely drew forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he extracted a sheet of European note paper , an envelope , and a pencil , which he handed me , none of these being articles used by natives . I at once wrote to my wife , and then asked if my letter could be sent to El Minzah , our town residence , whither I presumed that my wife would have gone after what had occurred at Aidonia on the preceding evening . Raisuli asked me whether I could guarantee that his messenger would not be arrested at Tangier . I answered , " Certainly ! My people will realize that any such detention would injure me ! " Hereupon he called one of his followers and taking the man aside gave him his instructions . From where I stood I could see that the messenger did not at all relish these orders . However , after further insistence , the man looked up to Raisuli with an expression of devotion , and , stooping , kissed his leader 's mantle in token of submission . I then bethought me also of writing to the young Wazani chereefs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request Raisuli did not so easily accede . However , ultimately he produced further paper and envelopes , and the messenger , taking both my missives , mounted one of my mules and rode back to Tangier . We were now furnished with turbans and Moorish haiks or mantles , as the party did not wish to have it seem that any strangers or Europeans were with them . As the sun rose above the hills these mantles and the turbans added to our discomfort , as the heat became more and more oppressive . About one o'clock we were halted for stream , and the two natives who preceded me , mounted on Varley 's horse , allowed the animal to drink . In vain I endeavored to prevent the man who was leading my gray from approaching the chestnut , as both horses were great fighters ; but the thick-headed mountaineer , paying no attention to my admonitions , led my horse into the stream . In a moment the two animals were upon each other , while the natives were falling about in the water , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two horses reared and bit and fought each other , while I kept my seat as best I could under these trying circumstances . Luckily I did not fall and ultimately  | both horses and their leaders were dragged out onto the further bank by the united forces of the entire party and we proceeded on our way . About one o'clock we were halted for luncheon in a valley between the hills , where there was neither shade nor cool water to drink , and the only food produced consisted of a few very gritty dried figs , a little hard and pungent cheese made from the milk of goats , and a glutinous and limp , yet exceedingly tough , galette or cake , which is the only form of bread used by the poorest natives . The few mouthfuls I tried to swallow sickened me , so we were only too thankful to mount as soon as we could . In vain I tried to learn where we were going . Raisuli had remained in the rear and the surly mountaineers would not answer our queries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now led , became steeper as we penetrated further among the hills , and about four o'clock I met with the accident I had so long apprehended . As we came to the bank of a rapid torrent , that was confined between steep and slippery rocks , my gray took the water jump ; but not so did the sullen native who held the bridle ; consequently there was a crash and , my horse rearing to recover himself , the rotten girths parted , and away went both the , saddle and rider , backward down the steep declivity . It seemed to me yards before I brought up on a ledge of rock with , as I for the moment apprehended , a broken back and dislocated thigh . Here I lay quivering with pain until Varley came up , and , a little later , Raisuli . I told him of how the man 's stupidity had nearly cost me a broken limb . Raisuli reproved the man in question , and this fellow was replaced by another guide or jailer . I was hoisted with difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and we proceeded upon our melancholy journey . I felt I could not long endure the pain due to my fall , since my leg was already swollen from the thigh to the instep , while I was also numb with the weariness of this protracted ride , which had already lasted throughout the entire night and the better part of the day . Every hour the country grew wilder and the road more abrupt . We only passed within sight of one miserable village , clinging to the steep hillside , and here the women and children came out to hoot and jeer at us , evidently realizing the situation and rejoicing over our sorry plight . Nor could I learn how much longer this weary march might continue to tax my failing strength ; yet all this was trifling compared with what was yet to come . A little later we reached the crest of a hill , from which we looked down upon a wooded vale , beyond which rose a rockcrowned eminence . Pointing to these bristling crags , my attendants told me that beyond these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . It seemed to me , wearied as I was , that it was impossible that I could endure so many more hours of fatigue and pain ; but there was no help for it , since short of this undiscoverable village there was , it seemed , neither food nor shelter to be obtained . Descending into the wooded valley , we crossed a stream , and the party halted beneath the giant oaks which stretched their wide-reaching arms above our heads . Here we halted for an hour 's rest before we began the steep ascent ? a path which took us up through a narrow cleft or gorge at the back of a great mass of the cliff that apparently had slid forward during some cataclysm of nature , leaving this open breach . Passing behind the fallen mass of rock , we climbed the narrow gorge , so narrow that we had great difficulty to protect our knees as our horses struggled up the steep . And this was the gateway , the portals , giving access to Raisuli 's lair . We had vet several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated on the southern shoulder of this mountain called Nazul . As the evening light faded , the track , which led often along the outermost edge of these lofty heights , overhung such precipitous descents that a single false step of my horse , which was now trembling with fear , might have cost me my life . It was not until near midnight that we reached the hamlet , and I was deposited in a miserable hut composed of two rooms . The thatch had in part been blown away , and when , a little later , it came on to rain we were in a deplorable plight , since the floor of beaten clay soon became a soft ooze . Thus we passed the night , without beds or any convenience . Of sleep I knew nothing , since , between the pain from my fall and the annoyance caused by innumerable creeping pests , I did not close my eyes . Indeed , this expedition cost me sixty hours without sleep and almost without food . Raisuli , becoming alarmed at the report of his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hut on the second day after our arrival and asked whether he might enter . I was only too glad to see him and , holding out my hand , I bade him welcome . He seemed greatly relieved at my tone and manner , expressed his regret at finding me in such a condition , and added that had he known that I was in such feeble health he would have endeavored to capture some one else ! RAISULLS PROPOSALS This was but indifferent consolation , after all I had suffered . Still , when Raisuli went on to say that we were to consider ourselves not as prisoners , but rather as hostages , I confess that I felt relieved . " Your horses and the arms I have taken from your dependents , " he continued . " will all be returned to you . I ask nothing from you ! " I did not , however , feel so pleased when he explained that prior to our release he would exact from those who had inflicted so many wrongs upon himself and his people the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops now operating against him at the foot of the hills . Second . The removal of the pasha , or military governor , of Tangier from his post . Third . The release of all the men of the three Kabvles , or hill tribes , under the leadership of Raisuli who were at the moment confined in the prisons of Tangier or elsewhere . Fourth . The payment of an indemnity of seventy thousand dollars , to be recovered against the Oolad Abd-el-Saduk . Fifth . That Raisuli should be made over-lord of the villages of Zeenats and of Breeje ! As Raisuli concluded , I felt like saying . " Why not ask to be proclaimed , out and out , Sultan of Morocco ? " In fact it seemed to me that it was quite as likely that the Sultan , Abd El Aziz , would agree to renounce the throne in favor of Raisuli as to accede to such conditions as the latter proposed to demand before consenting to our release . I literally felt my heart sink as I was thus informed of the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , of the orders which , even at that very moment , had been issued here in Washington ; thanks to which energetic action on the part of our government my release was subsequently secured . But , to return to my talk with Raisuli . " The indemnity you ask from the Abdel-Saduk family , " I said , " will ruin them . " " Precisely , " he replied . " They have inflicted worse than death upon me . It is precisely in order to be revenged upon them that I have carried you off . "  | THE HISTORY OF RAISCLI He then proceeded to recall the cir - cumstances of his own capture by the then Pasha of Tangier , Abd-er-Raitman Abd-el-Saduk , an incident that all at Tangier knew of at the time , some nine years prior to my present misadventure . Raisuli , then as now , had been up in arms against the government , owing to an attempt on the part of the Pasha of Tangier to force upon the tribes of Beni Emsauer , Ben Idder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaid of their district , an appointment in contravention of the arrangement sanctioned by time and custom , whereby these Berber tribes were entitled to the nomination of candidates to these posts , from which candidates the Sultan 's government selected the governors , or kaids , of the district . Abd-er-Rahman having failed in his attempt to establish his creature as kaid over these three tribes , united under the leadership of Raisuli , sent to the latter proposing an amicable settlement of the points at issue . The latter , trusting to Abd-er-Rahman 's safe conduct , accepted the pasha 's invitation , and while seated at the latter 's table was seized , in violation of the governor 's solemn assurance , bound , and sent to Mogador , where Raisuli was chained in a sitting posture to the wall and where he thus remained four long years , during which he was never able to stand during the day nor to lie down at night . The object of this cruel punishment was to cause Raisuli 's death , the cowardly pasha not daring to openly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering was due to a member of one of the foreign legations at Tangier . While on a special mission to the capital this official had informed the Sultan of the circumstances of the case . Abd El Aziz immediately issued an order to release Raisuli from his chains , excepting the fetters or anklets which confined his feet Subsequently , after five years ' confinement . Raisuli was unconditionally restored to liberty . His property , mostly in flocks and herds , had , however , been appropriated by his agents or partners . Failing to obtain justice , Raisuli had called together some of his more faithful adherents and had raided the zereebas or farms of his faithless associates , two of whom had subsequently been killed in an attempt to surprise Raisuli , himself . This incident had again placed Raisuli under the ban . Forces were sent down from the capital with orders to bring in Raisuli , dead or alive . It was these circumstances that had led the latter to effect my own abduction in order to bring the pressure of a threatened intervention by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus enable Raisuli to demand a free pardon for himself as a condition of my own release and also the payment of a heavy indemnity in order to be thus revenged upon the treacherous pasha , the cause of all his troubles . That the Moorish authorities were fully alive to the necessity for immediate action was shown by the arrival the very next morning of an emissary from Hadj Mohammed Torres , the Sultan 's delegate minister of foreign affairs at Tangier . Torres had entrusted these negotiations to a cousin of Raisuli himself , a certain Sid Hassan . In accordance with Raisuli 's suggestion , I gave this agent a note to Minister Gummere , the American representative at Tangier , together with other letters to my family . This opportunity , which Raisuli allowed me without any restriction , proved an inestimable blessing , and the knowledge that I could thus communicate at pleasure with family and friends relieved the situation of its worst feature . I had always had a peculiar horror of being carried off and held to ransom , a misfortune which is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of such outrages than to himself . Therefore I felt grateful to Providence that since such a misfortune had overtaken me , I had at least fallen into the power of the most kindly and gentle of brigands imaginable . Indeed , I had never conceived of such a situation as that in which I found myself . HIS PERSONALITY In so many respects the man interested and attracted me in spite of all my natural motives for dislike . Raisuli was at once so gracious and dignified , not to us only , but to his own wild adherents , who evidently idolized their chieftain , whose position among them seemed that of the head of a Highland clan in the olden times . He could not bear to hear a child cry , while on several occasions I noticed his care even to avoid allowing the bees collected on his cup to drown , as I saw him lift them out with his spoon or finally empty the cup itself onto the grass . Then , too , he was so quick to see the humorous aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point as though he had been born in County Galway itself . In fact I discovered to my consternation that I was beginning to like the man in spite of my natural resentment . I found myself unconsciously accepting his contention that he was not a mere brigand or cattle-lifter , but a patriot struggling to rescue his Berber followers from the tyranny of the corrupt chereefian officials . His charm of voice , the natural poise and dignity of his manner , his self-control under provocation , all betrayed a superior character . He is in fact a born leader and with a certain statesmanlike quality . He deplored the condition of his country , the feuds which separate the tribes , the many deeds of violence , and the blood so uselessly shed . In fact , this strange experience while in camp with Raisuli at Tsarradan began to assume an aspect of unexpected and idyllic charm . The life of the natives : the little touches of more gentle human character ; the tiny child who offered me fruit , which I at first declined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's face , and then the radiant and almost ridiculous satisfaction of the little fellow when I pretended to enjoy his half-ripe offering ; the many attempts of the wild people about me to propitiate me ; their curiosity as to our own manners and customs , as when one venerable inhabitant of the village led me gently aside to inquire why we walked so energetically up and down the village green . " For health 's sake , " was my reply . " Indeed ? " said the old Mohammedan , " and may I ask how many such daily turns , up and down , it may require to keep a Christian in good health ! " ? all afforded matter of interest and reflection . And then when the first answer from our home reached us , and we learned that already cablegrams had been received from Washington announcing that the squadrons under Rear Admirals F. E. Chadwick and Jewell , then coaling at the Canaries , had been ordered to Tangier to secure our release ? and , above all , when I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so generously taken in our misadventure ? when we realized all this , words can not describe the emotion called forth by these evidences of interest and good will . The next great excitement was the arrival , about a week later , of the relief expedition headed by the two young chereefs , Mulai Ali and Mulai Ahmed , sons of the late grand chereef of Wazan and of his English wife . Their approach was heralded by discharges of musketry , fired , as Raisuli informed me , by the inhabitants of the various villages on the route , a different route to the one by which we had been conducted . These discharges were to give Raisuli notice that strangers were entering the district , for " not only are you the only foreign- ers , " said the chieftain . " who have set foot among these Beni Arose people , but we do not even allow natives from other localities access , unless in some especial case like the arrival of these friends of yours , and , " he added with a grim smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When at last the long line of men , mounted and on foot , with its train of baggage animals , appeared we were not a little gladdened by the sight . Mulai Ali , the elder brother , pitched his camp near at hand , and after a long conference with Raisuli , the younger of the Wazani chereefs returned to Tangier to communicate to our own officials the state of affairs . Not only had our friends sent us a handsome tent , with furniture and supplies of every description , but also a cook and servants to wait upon us , so that we suffered henceforth no undue hardships of any sort , while the presence of Mulai Ali , who speaks both English and French , was a most welcome addition , although our intercourse with " The Boss , " as Varley and Mulai Ali dubbed Raisuli , diminished materially . Another event also tended to augment my anxiety , which was the arrival of two very evil-looking emissaries from Bou Hamara , the pretender to the throne , and who wrote urgently , insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , care . I had so suffered from my tiresome ride to Tsarradan that I felt I would far rather be shot where I was than be dragged off to die upon the road to Taza , situated in the very heart of these cruel mountains . Raisuli explained that the Pretender wished to secure our persons to use as a shield in case he himself should be too hard pushed by the Sultan 's troops . HELP FROM MY COUNTRY While standing near Raisuli one day on the village green , of which we were now allowed the freedom , one of his followers came up from Tangier , almost breathless from his haste , to report the arrival of the two American squadrons . The man described how the eight frigates had entered the bay , one after another . He told of the anxious deliberations of the Moorish authorities and of the alarm of the native inhabitants , who feared the town might be bombarded . The man declared that the place was mkloub , or upside down . I watched Raisuli with anxiety , lest apprehending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief and his own capture , he might endeavor to drag us to some more distant and inaccessible retreat . What was then my surprise when looking up with a bright smile , he said , " Well , I think I can now congratulate you ! " " I do not understand you , " I replied . " I mean , " answered Raisuli , " that the presence of these vessels will lead the authorities at Tangier to make such representations to the Sultan as may result in his acceding to my demands , and then you will be able to return to your friends . " This calculation of the insurgent leader was soon proved to have been justified , since a runner carrying a dispatch , one of four copies of the same document , each carried by a separate courier , was held up by some of Raisuli 's partisans , and thus we learned the , to us , grateful information , which was confirmed by the arrival of Sid Hassan a few days later to say that His Chereefian Majesty had been most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forwarded to Fez . THE DISPOSAL , OF THE RANSOM MONEY Raisuli was now confronted by the problem as to what disposition he was to make of the seventy thousand silver Spanish dollars which he demanded for our release . Here at Tsarradan there were no iron safes , nor so much as a house with a cellar , while the thatch of  | skaff , or dried reeds , the only roofing of the houses , offered but poor security should he leave so much coin stored in a village where he himself was but a transient sojourner . To the great amusement of Mulai Ali , and to my own considerable astonishment , the solution of this troublesome question which Raisuli proposed was that " La Senora , " as the natives called my wife , should receive the seventy thousand dollars from Torres and deposit the money to her own credit in Tangier at the bank where we were accustomed to cash our checks , and that he , Raisuli , might then draw upon Mrs. Perdicaris as occasion should require . I , however , entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal , and when I explained to Raisuli the suspicions to which such an arrangement might expose us , he at once said that he would be the last to wish to place us in such a position . It was finally arranged that the younger of our Wazani friends should bring to a certain village half way between Tangier and Tsarradan twenty thousand dollars in silver and the remaining fifty thousand in certified checks on the Comptoir d'Escompte , the French bank at Tangier , together with the prisoners whose release Raisuli had demanded , and that our captor should accompany us to this village , of which the Sheik , El Zellal , was one of his adherents . These negotiations occupied some time and led to many Tourneys of Sid Hassan back and forth from Tangier to Tsarradan . After six weeks , and on the evening preceding our departure , we strolled from the village green with Mulai Ali ; nor were we now , as had always hitherto , been the case , accompanied by any of Raisuli 's men . During our walk we fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made some allusion to two unfortunate Spanish children , for the boy at least was but a child , though his sister was fifteen . This brother and sister , the children of a poor charcoal-burner , had been stolen about two years prior to our own adventure , nor had they been recovered , despite the pressure exerted by the Spanish authorities at Tangier . We now learned to our horror that these unfortunate children had been carried off by the very man in whose hut we had spent so many sad hours , and that they had not only occupied the very room where I slept , but that after a long detention they had been ultimately killed in the garden and were buried not far from where our horses were tethered . This discovery showed the lawless character of these Berber followers of Raisuli , and also that we ourselves had been in more danger than we realized , had any mishap to Raisuli occurred while we were among these savages , for such these Berbers really are , possessing neither a written language nor any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white race boasts . I confess that during this our last night in that wretched hut , the scene of the sufferings and humiliations of those unfortunate Spanish captives , I scarcely closed my eyes . OUR RETURN The next morning it was still dark when our men began loading the packmules , and we reached the crest of the mountain , which lay between us and Tangier , just as the sun rose . Never have I anywhere witnessed a scene of more wild and fantastic charm . A slight mist hung about the base of the rocks , whose peaks and turrets were now flecked with crimson or lilac , now shaded with purple , by some passing cloud . On our left rode Mulai Ali , arrayed in a silk bournous of spotless white , followed by all his men , while on my right Raisuli bestrode his gray charger . The dark , thick cords of twisted camel 's hair crossed about his white turban , and the  | cartridge belt over his broad chest made him look every inch a man of daring deeds . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , rather , I rode the black horse which Raisuli had ridden on our way from Tangier , and as we climbed again , but in how different a mood , those rocky steeps I told the latter of my surprise at the horse 's behavior . A smile played upon the chieftain 's lips as he answered , " Oh ! that is easily explained ! Did you not know that before you purchased that horse it belonged to me ? " " I did not , nor , " I added , " do I seem to have known as much of your affairs as you evidently knew of mine ! Still , " I continued , " this does not entirely explain the very different behavior of the horse . I can understand that you could , by the use of spur and bridle , compel the horse to kneel in order that you might dismount , but I am still at a loss to account for his standing obedient and motionless when you had left him to his own devices ! " " This is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " he continued , " you Roumi are of too easy a disposition . You spoil your wives , your children , your servants , and even your very horses . These animals , " he said , " are quite intelligent enough to know that they must obey our wishes , even when we are not in the saddle ! " " If these are your views of how we should deal with men , women , and even with animals , I will mention the fact to the Sultan when I next see him , " I replied jocosely . " Yes , " continued Raisuli , in the same strain , " and if His Chereefian Majesty indulged in fewer European fads , and had a little more grip , and would use the spur more freely , he would have a better seat in his saddle , " referring to the expression that the throne of the Sultan should be his saddle . We continued during the entire morning in a northerly direction . Our path after taking us over the lofty crest of Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again led us along the crest of a line of hills ? a path at ' times so narrow that we were compelled- to proceed in single file . At such moments our escort trailed out over half a mile or more , passing between steep slopes or even abrupt precipices on either side of us . From these heights we could see the distant sea and the Spanish coast beyond , and at last Raisuli pointed out to me a white fleck upon the distant sands of the nearer African coast which he said was Tangier . About noon we found ourselves looking down upon a village many hundred feet immediately beneath us . Here a halt was called . This was the eyrie of El Zellal , a semi-fortified place , hanging on to the steep hillside , half village , half Zereeba . Raisuli sent forward some of his followers on foot to be sure that no government troops were hiding within the village , the approach to which was through a tall gateway of masonry , and when his men reappeared , signaling that no foes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do as you see me do ! " As he spoke he spurred his steed violently ; whereupon the animal , squatting upon his haunches after the manner of a dog rather than that of a horse , slid down the steep descent . Congratulating myself that my own horse , having been trained by Raisuli , probably possessed the same accomplishment , I followed suit , as did the other mounted members of the party , and presently we all found ourselves gaily tobogganing down the steep hillside and through the gate right into the village , where we had some difficulty in pulling up at the entrance of the residence of El Zellal himself , so abrupt was the incline or downward grade . Here we were detained , owing to the absence of Mulai Ahmed , the younger Wazani chereef , who did not arrive at the appointed hour with the ransom and Raisuli 's men who had been released  | from prison ? a delay due in part to the difficulty of bringing with him , in addition to other impedimenta , a huge mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure so many hours in the saddle . In the meantime we waited amid a solemn silence , except when some muchrequired food was served , and as we sat there it might have seemed more as though we were in some house of mourning rather than in one so shortly to become the scene of our eagerly desired liberation . THE ARRIVAL , OR THE RANSOM At last the mules bearing the silver dollars , carefully packed in boxes , arrived ; but now luncheon was again served in honor of Mulai Ahmed , and must be partaken of , after which the bullion was counted in another room . Here I was presently summoned , and invited to seat myself between Raisuli and Mulai Ahmed , while a group of the more important natives , including El Zellal , as well as men from other localities , were ranged around the room . " The silver , " said Raisuli , addressing me , " has been counted ? twenty thousand dollars , as stipulated , in Spanish dollars ; but these letters , " showing me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comptoir d'Escompte , the French bank at Tangier , " of the value of these , which are supposed to represent fifty thousand dollars , I know nothing . However , I will accept them on your personal guarantee , but on that condition only . " When I had examined the checks certified by Torres and by El Gannam , the Sultan 's delegate minister of finance , I gave the required assurance verbally , and Raisuli , leading me to the door , where I found my horse waiting for me , bade me adieu , saying that he had learned to look upon me as a friend , and that he hoped I cherished no ill feeling on account of my detention . He furthermore assured me that should any danger menace me in the future , that not only he himself , but any of the men of the three tribes under his orders , would hasten to my relief . Thus I left him , and pushing on as rapidly as we could we were soon in the midst of the large armed escort which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems there had been some rumor of an intention on the part of other tribes to secure our persons after we should have left Raisuli and to 1- , , ld us for further ransom . Fortunately our further journey suffered no delay other than that caused by the transport of the litter , of which I was most thankful to avail myself , since I had twice suffered while at Tsarradan from severe nervous prostration . This reminds me to mention with a grateful heart that my wife having applied to Admiral Chadwick , when she learned of my second attack , to inquire whether a surgeon could be detached from one of the vessels under his cornmand , every medical officer in the fleet at once volunteered to go and attend me , even though warned that they might be themselves detained by Raisuli . We did not reach Tangier until long after dark . As we were pushing forward in the gloom of evening a company of native cavalry , which had been sent out to report our arrival , galloped up , and so soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to announce our coming , as to which there was even yet grave anxiety . An hour later and we could see the town lights , and also those on the mastheads of the vessels in the bay , and we could even make out that these were answering signals from the United States consulate in the town . Yes , our friends now at last knew that we were near at hand . I struggled out of my litter and onto my horse and presently galloped through the gateway of my home , amid the acclamations of friends and neighbors . As I descended from my horse Admiral Chadwick himself , who had with Minister Gummere awaited my arrival even until this late hour , for it was now nearly  | midnight , grasped me by the arm , and thus was I literally restored to my family by the gallant officer in command of the fleet which the United States government had so generously sent to my rescue . But for this strenuous and successful intervention I might still be detained among those mountains . Upon this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we owed our rescue to other agencies . To the joint exertions of my friends , Minister Gummere , and to the British Minister , Sir Arthur Nicolson , I am deeply indebted ? indeed , I can find no NOTES ON MOROCCO MOROCCO in the early days of the Christian era was one of the granaries of the Roman Empire . Her lands today are no less rich ; but , owing to the lawlessness of a weak government and a strict prohibition of the exportation of grain and cattle , they are now for the most part abandoned and have been untilled for many centuries . Morocco contains about 250,000 square miles , one-half of which , or an area almost equal to that of North and South Dakota combined , is covered to a depth of six to nine feet with a black loam which rivals in fertility the soil of our prairie states . Her location makes her too valuable to leave undeveloped . Morocco at present exports annually only $5,000,000 worth of beans , skins , hides , fruits , olive oil , and wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , sugar , tea , and hardware . The country is rich in the deposits of copper , iron ore , antimony , and rock-salt , and gold and silver are reported . The country is generally mountainous , the Atlas range , which attains an elevation of nearly 15,00o feet , traversing it in several parallel chains from southwest to northwest and sending out numerous cross spurs . The climate in many sections is delightful and very healthful . In no country in the world probably does woman have such a low status as in words adequate to describe what I owe to as well as Admiral Chadwick , . : - not merely for their untiring efforts on hehalf of Varley and myself , but for the sympathy and solicitude of which my wife was the recipient throughout these long six weeks , so much more trying to her even than to ourselves , since she indeed was the greater sufferer . With this expression of my gratitude to the government and to the people of the United States , I conclude this account and beg to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to so long a narrative . Morocco . The usual practice of the Mohammedan of Morocco is to divorce his wife after he has lived with her six or seven years , even though she may have borne him children . He then takes a younger and more comely partner , while his former wife must be satisfied with any husband she can get . After several years with her second husband , she is once more discarded , and marries again ; and so the process goes on , each marriage being lower in scale , until she dies in poverty and wretchedness of the meanest description .  |
