txt The cable brings across the ocean the dictum of Sir JAMES CRICHTON BROWN , vouched for as an authority on mental diseases , that " rapid locomotion Is a craze , involving blindness to natural beauty . " Comfort rather than beauty is what the experienced traveler looks for , and he Is blind indeed if he expects to find comfort and speed combined . The motorist , it is true , looks for neither comfort nor beauty , nor for speed except as a means to an end . Excitement is what is wanted by drivers of 50 or 100 horse power cars and the sense of superiority in competition . But most of us travel by rail or steamer , and are free from such considerations in proportion to experience . And this is truest of all regarding ocean travel . A busy man can perhaps find compensation for the dust and disturbance of extreme railway speeds if he can save anthour of a business day in a journey between , say , New York and Boston , or New York and Chicago .

On the other hand , such inconsiderable gains are at the expense of vibration and lack of steadiness which blemish an experience deserving to be a pure joy . Upon this account it is good news that the Hamburg-American Line is following the White Star Line in abandoning construction for extreme speed . Its new boats will be huge , with every luxury , and making special appeal to those fond of comfort and a feeling even at Sea of something quiet under foot . This will leave the Cunard and North German Lloyd Lines to cater to those who must have speed and records at every cost . It is singular that the reaction against the speed mania should begin upon the ocean , and it will be encouraging if it extends to other forms of locomotion . It is doubly desirable , for extreme speed has no compensation for those who are ridden over , however it may be for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
