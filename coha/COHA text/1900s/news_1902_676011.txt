txt District Attorney Jerome predicted last night that unless the present excise law is repealed the reform administration Is doomed to defeat and will land exactly where the Strong administration found itself four years ago . He added that the enforcement of this law during an administration 's whole term would mean that New York would not see the return to power of a reform government before the dawn of another century . These predictions were made in the course of a speech before the Men 's Club of the Judson Memorial in Washington Square . Mr. Jerome 's remarks caused some restlessness on the part of the audience , among whom were many church-going people , two ministers being on the platform . His address was at times interrupted by the singing of hymns by worshippers in the adjoining room . It was a large assemblage which greeted the District Attorney , and there were enough- people out in the square to hold an overflow meeting unable to gain admittance to the small hall . Mr. Jerome was loudly cheered by those in the street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were many in boih assemblages , were must demonstrative . Mr. Jerome spoke on the subject , " The Saloon and Sunday . " Though he had announced that he would answer all questions put to him bs ; aany one in ' the audience , he d:d not get chance except to reply to some written questions sent to him . To charges he made against the State Legislature , Assereblrran Finch iI of - the Fifth District replied : MR . JEROME 'S SPEECH . The District Attorney was introduced by the Rev. David A. , the President of the club , and on the platform sat the Rev. Mr. Judson . The District Attorney said in part : " I am glad to be here to-night to speak upon a subject in which is my whole heart and what I consider to be one of the greatest questions with which the City of New York is vexed . The saloon evil , the social evil , and the gambling evil have done more to degrade public life than all the others combined . We have got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strongly than the others . It has got to be met with calm , courageous judgment , and not by the dogma or theory of the saints who are trying to make New York a Garden of Eden . " Long ago a body of , intelligent men , idealists though , established the economic ' man : The logic put forth for the creating .. , Of this mythical ' . , person was conclusiveand unanswerable . But in practical , every-day life , there is no economic man . You 4 may sit down in your study and postulate and frame laws to do with the theoretic man , bait you have , got to go out into the masses and see the sinning , suffering , hoping person to get at the question in a practical way . When you deal with the drinking man you are not dealing with ' bums and ' drunks , ' but you are dealing with the bone and sinew of the city . We have got to the situation where we loog to legislative statutes to remedy all evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the statute books . It has got to have more behind it than men who go to Albany to make or repeal laws which later are found to be unconstitutional . " Laughter and applause . The District Attorney then related many instances of the laws of various Stares which were unenforcible because they were against public sentiment . , " Thomas Brackett Reed , " he said , " told me a story which illustrates how the prohibition law works in the State of Maine : " In Reed 's own county which for decade after decade had gone overwhelmingly Republican , they elected a Democratic Sheriff . He told the people that , though he took his oath of office he would not live up to it . He kept his of fice for three consecutive years on this platform , until the Republican nominee got wise and was elected on the same promise . " When you have a law that public sentiment is opposed to . then it can not be enforced by local authorities . There are , I figure , 250,000 males who patronize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ' rule the City of New York by their votes . Many go to church , and drop in after and take a drink . You must get rid of the idea that these men are bums and drunks . They are the men that work ; they are the men that Abraham Lincoln liked  --  you may call them the plain citizens if you like . Lots of others do n't go to church . ? I do n't blame them . I do n't go to church . I do n't want to go . " You can not blame people for not going to church when you consider the milk diet which they are fed upon . Murmurs and laughter.l You ca n't blame it on the ministers . They ca n't be expected to deal out spiritual nutriment fifty-two Sundays of the year , when you consider their small salaries , . and deliver inspiration each time . Why not pay them like you pay your docter and lawyer ? " " You have no right to go and saddle the man who wants his drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to saddle you with his ideas . The saloon can not be closed , and we may as well look the question squarely and manfully in the face with sagacity and impartiality , and not appear like a parcel of cranks . " The drinking men have got the power , and , having the power . are gding to exercise it . They are going to vote for the Mayor who will appoint a Police Commissioner who will not obey his oath of office . If this- excise law is not repealed . this administration will land just where the Strong administration landed , and we will have another administration like that the awful havoc of which we are doing our best to undo . " If you ever get an administration which will enforce this law during its term , then there is n't one here who will see another reform administration , nor will one be elected before the dawn of another century . THE AMERICAN SABBATH . " We hear a great deal about the 4merlean Sabbath . Who gave us the right to establish thistheory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , AmericanGermans , are an economic , industrious , truth-telling people  --  more truth-telling than the Americans . They do n't care especially for the Sunday saloon , but they resent being told they can not go there if they want to . " What good will penal statutes do when you know how worthless many of our criminal laws are ? Do n't try to drive them to your faith , for just so surely as you do you will be again In the hands of the grafter . ' Thewsertion that the open Sabbath will encourage intemperance and lead to Worse thirws is contrary the experience of other ; ' countries . Great Britain is none the worse for it . At present , we can buy tobacco , confectionery , soda water , newspapers , and many other luxuries under the law on Sundays . " The Raines law sandwich and the dry ' Sunday are ridiculous . and bring the law into derision . It is hypocrisy , which is even a greater sin . John Raines inflicted this hypocrisy upon us , but up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , , - and I wo n't mention what he discovered on John Raines 's desk . Whenever you give a body of men option on a great question-alike this one , then you surely are going to have blackmail . " in this country , different than any other in this respect , the liquor dealer and his family are ostracized . The saloon business in other countries is looked upon as st respectable one , and when men come here to engage in it and carry on their vocations they regard themselves as decent citizens , and you have got to regard many of them as such . " I nearly lost my health when I went to Albany , meeting with rebuff after rebuff in trying to secure a hearing for my scheme . The best I could do was to have it thrown out . The cowards ! They did n't dare to bring it before the House , so that we could learn whether the rural countieswere going to dominate our State municipalities . Applause . " You can watch , fine , and imprison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that persons can write messages showing how taxation has been reduced , but it will not stop them selling liquor . . " It is their business , they can not leave it , and the law has forced them to degrade themselves ' against their wishes by forcing them to run houses of assignation . " Assemblyman Finch answered Mr. Jerome in a rather acrimonious . speech , which , owing to the attitude of his hearers , was considerably toned down before he concluded . " The Assembly , he said . " could never help New York City for the reason they could not find a majority that would agree on the question and send it up to Albany . The only person who seemed to agree with Mr. Jerome was Mr. Jerome himself . He came to Albany and said : " I 'll tell you what the people want . I have got it in my pocket . ' " Before I start off on a wild errand I want to know what the majority want . and so I told Mr. Jerome that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARGES MAYOR WITH BAD FAITH . He Declares Mr. Low in Presence of John C. Sheehan and Mr. Jerome Pledged the Three-Platoon System . Policeman J. J. O'Brien of the East Sixty-seventh Street Station declared last night that Mayor Low had made an anteelection promise that the three-platoon system should not be abolished , and a poststnauguration promise that the two-platoon system would not te restored until the patrolmen had been given a hearing . These statements were made at a meeting of the Fellow-Citizenship Association meeting , Seventy-sixth Street and East River , last night , where the present administration and the three-platoon .. police system , compared with Commissionef Partridge 's two-platoon insistence , was under discussion . President Max L. Shallek presided and Major Ebstein , Deputy Police Commissioner , was present . Major Ebstein made two brief speeches . When he first took the floor he complimented the association on its work , and then said in part : " My connection with the Police Department is quite recent and what I know about it has been learned during my connection with it . Perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too harshly , and to expect too much in too short a time . But the people expect to pay policemen liberally and have a right to expect in return the very best of police service . " I will say right here that I have no doubt that before the present administration goes out the Police Department and its administration will be satisfactory . The Police are specifically instructed to enforce about fifty laws besides being generally directed to enforce them all , and under the law the gambling or excise questions are not made any more-important than others . " Policeman O'Brien said : " I believe that the platoon system is best for the people of New York , and I admit that the Police Commissioner is having a very hard time , and that he is an honorable and upright man . But when the threeplatoon system went into effect last August the patrolmen did not expect that it would cost the citizens any more money than before . We claim that there are enough policemen in New York to give us all a decent tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our families . " There has been a good deal said about a certain promise . Well , there was a promise made , and it was made to me in the presence of Mr. Forties , President of the Board of Aldermen ; John C. Clark , and John C. Sheehan and Mr. Jerome , who is now District Attorney , investigated the three-platoon system , and when I went to see the gentleman who is now Mayor , Mr. Low , he said the three-platoon system would non be touched , and he told me to go back and tell my side partners that it was satisfactory . ' Then Policeman O'Brien read a letter which die said was from Mayor Low and dated Feb. 28 , in which the latter stated that the three-platoon system would not be abolished until the patrolmen had had a hearing before the Police Commissioner , and what they had to say would be received with an " open mind . " " A week later , " said Policeman O'Brien , " it was abolished and we got no hearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
