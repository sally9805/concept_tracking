 | The following article , which is the substance of an address to the National Geographic Society . is largely derived from two handsome volumes by Mr Gardiner F. Williams , " The Diamond Mines of South Africa . " a new edition of which has been recently published by B. F. Buck &; Co .. of New York . In this work Mr Williams gives an interesting account of the Zulus and other South African natives , of the Boers and of their terrible struggle with the Zulus , of the coining of the Englishman . and the discovery exploitation , and development of the wonderful De Beers mines . NOWHERE else on the face of the earth is there an assemblage of workers of such varied types of race , nationality , and coloring as are to be seen in the South African diamond fields . There is hardly a nation of Europe or colony of the British Empire that has not some representatives . There are adventurers from the United States , Mexico , and South America , and white men from all the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every shade of dusky hue shown by the tribes that range from the Cape to the Equator . Even the American Indian is not unknown in the fields , one specimen at least having resided there for many years . Add to this motley throng a sprinkling of dark East Indians , Malays. and Chinese , and the kaleidoscopic shifts and colorings of this babel in the diamond fields may be dimly conceived . Only about one-sixth of the workers in the mines are whites , and the larger part of these are employed above ground on the floors , in the workshops , and in the offices of the mining companies . The majority of the white workers above and below ground have their homes in Kimberlev and the other neigh-  | boring mining towns . Wages paid to European day laborers on the surface range from 10s. to 15s. ( $2.40 to $3.6o ) a day ; mechanics receive higher pay . which ranges from 16s. 8d. to r pound ( $4 to $5 ) per clay , and white miners arc paid the same rate . Miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which their earnings are usually materially increased . Employees ' houses in Kimberley are scattered through the town and many of them own their own homes . Some of the miners ' houses cost 500 pounds or over . In the mines operated by the De Beers Company alone more than eleven thousand African natives are employed below and above ground , coming from the Transvaal , Basutoland , and Bechuanaland , from districts far north of the Limpopo and the Zambesi , and from the Cape Colony on the east and the south to meet the swarms flocking from Delagoa Bay and countries along the coast of the Indian Ocean , while a few cross the continent from Damaraland and Namaqualand and the coast washed by the Atlantic . The larger number are roughly classed as Basutos , Shanganes , M'umbanes , and Zulus , but there are many Batlapins from Bechuanaland , Amafengu , and a sprinkling of nearly every other tribe in South Africa . Many travel hundreds of miles , and some more than a thousand miles , in order to reach the diamond fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak and emaciated that they are almost worthless as laborers for weeks afterward . The natives , as a rule , are generally muscular , sinewy men , but not fleshy . Their feet are broad and flat , but their legs and arms are commonly well rounded and their thigh and shoulder muscles are large . The living skeletons who come in from the far interior districts of Africa gain flesh as rapidly when they reach a field flowing with meat and porridge as lean cattle do in green pastures . In the early years of the mines the raw recruits were hooted at and sometimes pelted with stones by their kinsmen at the mines , but of late years this rough greeting and hazing has very largely passed away . THE DE BEERS COMPOUND For the lodging and feeding of this great force of native Africans special provision is made by the erection of large walled enclosures , called compounds , at the mines and on depositing floors . There are 17 of these compounds on the diamond fields . twelve of which are owned by the De Beers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beers mine , and the description of this will serve for all , as they a , re essentially alike except in size . Fully four acres are enclosed by the walls of the De Beers compound , giving ample space for the housing of its 3,000 inmates , with an open central ground for exercise and sports . The fences are of corrugated iron , rising ten feet above the ground , and there is an open space of ten feet between the fence and the buildings . At the northern end of the compound there is an entrance gate . Iron cabins fringe the inner sides of the enclosure . divided into rooms 25 feet by 30 feet . which are lighted by electricity . In each room 20 to 25 natives are lodged . The beds supplied are ordinary wooden bunks and the bed clothing is usually compose 1 of blankets which the natives bring wi : : them or buy at the stores in the compound , where there is a supply of articles to meet the simple needs of the native &; Besides these stores there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention is promptly given , and a church for religious services , conducted by missionaries delegated by the various church denominations . During week days this church is also used as a school for the instruction of the natives . Compartments with entrances opening through the walls are set apart for latrines and cared for with strict attention to sanitation . In the center of the enclosure there is a large concrete swimming bath , in which most of the natives are at times found ( living and swimming , as is vividly shown in the accompanying illustrations . If any fail to show the  | necessary regard to cleanliness they are compelled to keep themselves clean . A competent manager is in charge of the compound and his assistants are intrusted with the charge of preserving order and enforcing the compound regulations . The natives look upon the manager as their great white chief . He settles any disputes which may arise among them . and in conjunction with the mine manager investigates any complaints in reference to the amount of pay which has been allowed them or any punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , needless to say , is contrary to the regulations . The compound is lighted by electricity , arc lights being hung within and without the enclosure . When a newcomer or a number of natives , for they usually come in little troops , apply at the gate of the compound for employment , the applicants are admitted into the compound only by the immediate direction of the manager or his assistants . As soon as they enter , their clothes are searched to prevent the smuggling in of liquor , playing cards , or other forbidden articles ; then the officer in charge of the dispensary examines each separately and carefully . No diseased man is given work , and any suffering from contagious diseases are sent at once to a quarantine building outside the compound , where a temporary provision for such cases has been made . Within 24 hours a second examination of every one admitted who shows any symptoms of the disease is made by a physician in the employ of the company who daily visits the compound . To enter the service of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the compound and work continuously and faithfull v for a period of at least three months or longer if he so desires . At the expiration of a contract the applicant may leave if he chooses or his contract may be renewed indefinitely . Some of the natives in De Beers compound have been employed continuously for ten years or more in the service of the company , for  | the more industrious prefer the certainty of wholesome food and steady pay to the shifting to any other occupation that is open to them or to return to their old savage life . The ordinary dress of the natives in the compound is a woolen shirt , trousers , and shoes . They rarely wear any underclothing , and when at work in the mines a pair of ragged trousers , a blanket , or old breech cloth will often be their only covering . Occasional visitors to the mine are startled by the native disregard for cover ; but the natives are commonly alert to pass the word " umfas " ( woman ) from one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the native workers on the level ahead scramble for cover or hiding . ' When any injuries happen to the men from accidents in the mines , the suffering natiyes show remarkable fortitude in bearing pain and enduring the necessary surgical operations . Their blood is warm and pure , and cuts in their flesh , or bruises , heal very rapidly . They suffer most from diseases of the lungs , especially phthisis and pneumonia , which are common maladies of the native tribes outside of the mines as well as within the compounds . They can readily obtain fresh vegetables and fruit , but the common choice of food , such as mealie meal and meat , exposes them to attacks of scurvy . ATTEMPTS TO STEAL THE DIAMONDS No corporal punishment of the natives by white employers is allowed . If a boy is unruly he may be placed in a room by himself until he can be taken to jail and charged with whatever offense he has committed . The most common offense is petty thieving . There can be no doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice and cause heavy losses to the diamond mining companies if it were not for the compound system . which makes it impossible for natives to take any diamonds out of the compounds with them . A fine wire netting is stretched over the top of the compound to prevent the sly tossing of precious crystals over the walls , to be picked up by confederates outside the mining areas . Precautions are also taken to prevent the smuggling away of diamonds from the compounds . and all communication by the natives with persons outside the walls is carefully restricted . Until the expiration of his contract , no native can go through the compound gate except by special permission or when he is taken under guard before a magistrate for some offense . If convicted . when his term of imprisonment expires or after he has paid his fine he must return to the compound and complete his contract . Before leaving the compound his clothes and person are thoroughly searched to prevent the disappearance of diamonds with them . Gems were sometimes found secreted in clothing , or shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in fact . in anything that the natives were allowed to take out with them . Even this close inspection did not bar the practice of stealing . and there was an inexplicable trickle of diamonds from m looked-for quarters until it became known that natives on the point of leaving the compound were swallowing diamonds and conveying them away . Tit 1895 one native had the nerve and capacity to swallow a lot of diamonds worth X50 pounds , and did not appear to suffer from this strain upon his digestion . There has been only one authentic instance where a native has embedded diamonds in his flesh ; this was done by by a native in De Beers convict station , who made an incision under the shin bone and concealed several small diamonds wrapped in a rag . This native had symptoms of tetanus , and the visiting physician searched the man 's body . and finding an ugly looking wound on his leg , cut it open , and to his great surprise found a rag full of diamonds . The native soon recovered , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no apparent fear of swallowing any stone which can be forced through the throat , and in one instance a diamond as big as a large chestnut and weighing 152 carats was hidden for seven days by this means . The swallowing of a rough diamond is evidently so easy , but so difficult to detect . that it was necessary to put an end to the practice by providing a longer period of detention and search . At the close of their contracts , natives whose terms of service have nearly expired are placed together in a commodious room capable of holding two hundred men or more . They enter this room entirely naked . Their clothes and baggage are deposited in sacks marked in accordance  | with the number on the arm band . Blankets are supplied for clothing and as wraps when sleeping . They are fed , and generally well cared for , free of cost to themselves . While in the detention room they are under strict supervision of white guards , so that any diamonds they may have swallowed must be left behind before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies for over seven days . At the end of five days of detention , generally on Saturday morning , they are released . Meanwhile the clothes placed in the sacks have been  | thoroughly searched , and departing natives are not allowed to take away with them anything but soft goods . In fact , they are even required to leave their boots behind , for cunning smugglers used to insert diamonds in their boot heels so neatly that the trick could not be detected without cutting away the greater part of the sole of the boot . Boots and shoes and other articles which are not allowed to be taken from the compound are sold or given away to customers or friends before their owners leave . It may be that De Beers compound is a " Monastery of Labor , " as was wittily said by a lady visiting the fields as a correspondent of the London Times , but the testimony of all careful observers on the ground affirms the beneficial effect of the restrictions from dissipation and the general good cheer of the workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American witness , wrote of his inspection of the men of the compounds : " These chaps are well cared for , contented , and happy , as proven by the fact that many have been there for years ; and the secret of it lies in their not being able to get drink . " WINNING THE DIAMOND The diamonds exist in a hard blue ground which millions of years ago gushed up from the interior of the earth and filled the throats of volcanoes . Thousands of tons of this blue ground  | are brought up daily from a depth of more than one thousand feet and spread over the floors . These floors are made by removing the bush and grass from fairly level stretches of ground . After clearing the face of the ground it is hardened and smoothed with heavy rollers until it is fit for use . After the blue ground has been spread out , it is necessary to wait patiently until the sun and rain have contributed their service in disintegrating the breccia . The effect of the exposure of this curious compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue , which are as hard as sandstone when freshly taken from the mine , soon begin to crumble on the depositing floors . To hasten the disintegration , the bed of blue is liarrowed several times to turn up the bigger lumps and expose fresh faces of the ground to the sun . Spans of mules were originally used to drag the light harrows used in those days , but steam traction engines are now employed to draw wheeled harrows with huge teeth back and forth across the floors . So the great spread of the floors looks like some vast plowed farm where the laborers are preparing the soil for seed . Washing The diamonds are invisible . During the fifteen years of my charge of the De Beers mines I have never found a diamond on the floors . Under normal conditions soft blue ground becomes sufficiently pulverized in from four to six months , but it is better to expose it for a longer period , even f , a whole year . The ground is then carried in automatic trucks to the washing machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud and passed through a series of pans and screens . Fifty per cent of De Beers ground , when well pulverized , will pass through a screen with holes onesixteenth of an inch square . When the day 's work is completed , the pans , through each of which three hundred loads have passed , are emptied or " cleaned up , " and the concentrated deposits of diamonds , mingled with other heavy but valueless minerals , are then sent to the pulsator. which separates the diamonds sufficiently for the sorting tables . The work of picking out the diamonds by hand from the concentrate on the sorting tables was , of course , necessarily slow and tedious . It was the only divis-  | ion of diamond mining and winning which seemed beyond the application of blind and unconscious machinery . But men today are not inclined to admit that anything greatly worth doing is impossible . A series of experiments was initiated by me with the object of separating the diamonds from the heavy valueless concentrates with which they are associated . An ordinary shaking or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation was tried without success . One of the employees of De Beers , Mr Fred Kirsten , was in charge of the experimenting . under the supervision of the late Mr George Labram , the manager of the large crushing plant and afterward mechanical engineer to the company . Notwithstanding the fact that the specific gravity of the diamond ( 3.52 ) was less than that of several of the minerals associated with it . so that its separation would seem a simple matter , it was found in practice to be impossible , owing to the slippery nature of the diamond . The heavy concentrates carried diamonds , and diamonds flowed away from the percussion tables with the tailings . When it seemed that every resource to do away with the head sorting had been exhausted , Kirsten asked to be allowed to try to catch the diamonds by placing a coat of thick grease on the surface of the percussion table with which the other experiments had been made . Kirsten had noticed that oily substances , such as axle grease and white or red lead , adhered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he argued to himself , if these substances adhered to diamonds and not to the other minerals in the concentrates , why should not diamonds adhere to grease on the table , and other minerals flow away ? In this way the remarkable discovery was made that diamonds alone of all minerals contained in the blue ground will adhere to grease , and that all others flow away as tailings over the end of the percussion table with  | the water . After this was determined by thorough experiments , more suitable shaking tables were constructed at the company 's workshops . These were from time to time improved upon , until now all the sorting ( except for the very coarse size ) is done by these machines , whose power of distinction is far superior to the keenest eve of the native . Since the discovery of the affinity of grease for diamonds , experiments have been made with rubies and sapphires from Burma , and it was found that grease caught these gems with the same certainty that it catches diamonds . After a thorough trial a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constructed and are now working on De Beers concentrates . Each shaking- table is made of corrugated cast-iron plates in five sections , with a drop of about an inch from one division to another . Thick grease is spread on the plates to cover them to the top of the corrugations . Strange to relate , the descending diamonds stick on the face of the grease , while all other minerals pass over it . Only about one-third of t per cent of diamonds is lost by the first table , and these are recovered almost to a stone when the concentrates are passed over the second table . The discrimination of this sorter is surely marvelous . Native workers , although experienced in the handling of diamonds , often pick out small crystals of zircon.or Dutch boart , by mistake ; but the senseless minx is practically unerring . It will catch rubies , sapphires , and emeralds as well as diamonds ; but , so far as it has been tested , it will not cling to anything but a precious stone . The grease which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ' work . owing to its becoming more or less mixed with particles of water . It is then scraped off the tables , together with the diamonds adhering to it , placed in a kettle made of finely perforated steel plates . and steamed . The grease passes away to tanks of water , where it is cooled and is again fit for use .  | Formerly , of 12,000 loads , which is about the daily average of the quantity washed at De Beers and Kimberley mines , 16o cubic feet had to be assorted by hand . When the stones are cleaned they are carefully assorted with reference to size , color , and purity and made up in parcels for sale . For several years past the Dc Beers Company has sold in advance its annual production to a syndicate of London diamond merchants who have representatives residing in Kimberley . When the bare statement is made that nearly five million truck-loads , or more than four million tons , of blue ground have been washed in a year , the mind only faintly conceives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old craters and laboriously washed and sorted for the sake of a few bucketfuls of diamonds . It would form a cube of more than 430 feet , or a block larger than any cathedral in the world , and overtopping the spire of Saint Paul 's , while a box with sides measuring two feet nine inches would hold the gems . Diamonds are so highly prized and so imperishable that the amount of these gems in existence may almost be reckoned as the total of the world 's production , ranging in value through hundreds of millions of dollars . Mr Kunz does not estimate a loss of 5 per cent in a hundred years , and the South African diamond fields alone have contributed over $400 , - 000,000 in value to the world 's stock . Yet the demand increases apace with the world 's growth in wealth , and no diversion of the world 's fancy is apparent .
