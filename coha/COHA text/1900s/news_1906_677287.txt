CASSATT FOR A RATE LAW . Wants a Liberal Provision for Court Review  --  He Defied Carnegie . An interview with President Cassatt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear in the forthcoming number of Pearson 's Magazine . In it Mr. Cassatt makes plain that he is , and always has been , in favor of Government regulation of railroad rates  --  with a liberal provision for a court review . " I have for several years believed that the National Government , through the Inter-State Commerce Commission , ought to be in a position to fix railroad rates whenever the rates established by the railroads themselves are found , after complaint and hearing , to be unreasonable , " said Mr. Cassatt to Mr. Creelman. " provided , of course , that there shall be right of appeal to the courts . " Experience has shown that closer relationship and mutuality of interests are necessary to prevent the covert and destructive warfare between* American railroadse which produced the secret rate and rebate system . " It is only right , therefore , that the public should have the means of protecting itself against even a remote danger suggested in the increased power developed by this wholesome and from every sound standpoint necessary spirit of alliance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for my associates in the Pennsylvania Railroad Company , I am generally heartily in accord with the position taken by President Roosevelt . and we have been all along . I told the President himself when he made his first recommendation on this subject to Congress , more than four years ago , that I believed him to be right . " But it is equally important that the American people should recognize the grave necessity for greater harmony of action and interest between the railroads of this richest and busiest country in the ' world . " We have trampled out the secret rate and rebate system , which was not only ruining the railroads , but also made equal and fair conditions of business impossible in America . The secret rate system can never be revived again unless the railroads are prevented by unwise legislation . from maintaining such relations among themselves as will insure the maintenance of reasonable and stable rates . " Mr. Creelman makes a few remarks of his own on the ' Pennsylvania Railroad system and Mr. Cassatt . His conclusion is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far out of reach of " muck-rakers " and sensational magazine critic . He says that when Mr. Cassatt became President of the Pennsylvania Railroad seven years ago the Carnegie Steel Company and not the Standard Oil was the greatest of its rebaters . The Pennsylvania abolished secret rebates , cutting off Mr. Carnegie with the rest , Mr. Carnegie went to see Mr. Cassatt , but pleaded and threatened in vain . Mr. Carnegie , accorling to Mr. Creelman , said that unless the Pennsylvania continued to grant him secret rates , he would construct a line from the West through Pittsburg to the Atlantic seaboard that would destroy the primacy of the Pennsylvania system . Mr. Cassatt 's answer " was , In effect , that the continent was wide and that Mr. Carnegie could do whatever he pleased , except get secret rates or rebates for his freight on the Pennsylvania lines . " " Then , " says Mr. Creelman , " Mr. Carnegie choked and went away in a rage . " TRIES TO SAVE GRANDCHILD .
