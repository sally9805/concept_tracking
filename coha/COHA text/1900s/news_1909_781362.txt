txt The Navy Department will try to held Naval Constructor J. G. Tawresey responsible for the disaster to the tug Nezinscot , which foundered between Portsmouth and Boston on Aug. when Acting Assistant Surgeon C. E. Trotter , attached to the Portsmouth Naval Hospital , and three other men lost their lives . The tug capsized because she was overloaded . Constructor Tawresey 's alleged responsibility . lies in the fact that he happened to see her before she left the Portsmouth yard and suggested to her Captain that she was too heavily loaded . Now the department seeks to hold that , having such a suspicion , the full performance of duty on the part of Constructor Tawresey required that he should insist upon a listing test before permitting the tug ' to sail , and that when he did not insist he became responsible for the subsequent disaster . Five enlisted men are to_the he tried at the sane time chi charges of neglect of duty in connection with the loss of life . But so far no court has been appointed to try anybody for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Frank H. Bitter , chief boatswain 's mate , who was second in command on the tug and had charge of the boat ' after the Nezinscot capsized , the master having been lost ; Gec-rge H. Pratt , chief Machinist 's mate ; William Fitzgerald , seaman , and . V. F. Tillotson and C. F. Underwood , firemen . The charge against these men is one of the most unusual in the naval service , that of deserting comrades in danger of their lives and of failing to attempt a rescue . Acting Secretary Winthrop has appointed a court-martial to meet at Ports  - -  mouth next Monday to begin the trial of the-cases . It is headed by Rear Admiral N. E. Niles , Governor of the Naval Home at Philadelphia . Lieut . William P. Cronan. now at the Newport conference , is to be Judge Advocate . Constructor - Tawresey. is one of the best men in the construction corps , and has a fine record . It was merely by chance deleted 2 lines where she was loading , on business not at all connected-with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck him , from . his casual observation , that she was being overloaded , and he suggested that to her master . The Captain did not agree with : Constructor Tawresey , however . apd the constructor went along about his business without giving further attention to the tug . After the disaster a board of inquiry met at Portsmouth and reported that no blame attached to any one for the accident . Since then word has come to the department regarding Constructor TavY-resey 's suggestion of overloading . The tug was carrying anchors and spare parts to the battleship fleet , which was about to go to the southern drill . grounds , and the department has become convinced that she was overloaded , and that that was the cause of the disaster . When the department heard about Tawresey 's connection with the matter he was asked about it , and at once replied , confirming the report of his suggestion . In the view of the department this is a serious situation for him . It is held that although he had no business with the Nezinscot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suspected she was overloaded it became his duty to insist upon having a listing test before permitting her to sail , and that in failing to do so he was negligent of his duty . The charges against the enlisted , men are based upon the statements of one of the survivors of the Nezinscot , who accuses them of what amounts to cowardice . His - charge has - special reference to the loss of Surgeon Trotter . It is charged that Dr. Trotter left his place on a life raft which he had procured and went to the assistance of one of the accused men , who was struggling in the sea . He got the sailor to the raft and the man took the place Dr. Trotter had relinquished . But when Dr. Trotter sought to get on the raft again he found he made one too many and the raft would not sustain them all . The result was that before he could get any other means of support he became exhausted and sank . During this struggle it is charged the other four enlisted men made stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officers who were in danger . Altogether this will be one of the most remarkable navy courts-martial ever held .
