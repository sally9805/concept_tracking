SIR : The death of Francis Thompson on November 18 will start strange thoughts in the minds of lovers of English poetry . How easily we forget ' In the year of the publication of his " Poems , " 1893 , his was the name most discussed in the gatherings of the literary . Perhaps no poet 's first book , not even Swinburne 's " Poems and Ballads , " had provoked more discussion or been more generally acclaimed . Coventry Patmore , writing in the Fortnightly , boldly declared that the level of his achievement was higher than Crashaw 's . H. D. Traill likewise aligned him with the classics , and most wonderful of all , the Edinburgh , forsaking its tradition , heralded the arrival of a great singer hitherto unknown . Then came stories of the struggle Thompson had made , of the many defeats , how he had taken to the anodyne of Coleridge and De Quincey , how he had been found holding horses in London , and what not . Then there was the fascination of his religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monastery in Wales . How true all this was we do not know . Yet it is certain that he who had written " The Hound of Heaven " had passed through deep waters . He was no longer young for one publishing a first volume , and the book itself was not large . Its quality , however , was unmistakable . The manner , too , was new , though in a sense it was as old as Donne or Cowley or Crashaw . No nineteenth-century poet 's soul had been so uneasy in its body , none had felt such spiritual torture , not even Verlaine in the prison at Mons. Here was a new accent : I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds ; Tel ever and anon a trumpet sounds Pious the hid battlements of Eternity , Those shaken mists a space unsettle , then Round the half-glimpsSd turrets slowly wash seam : This surely was authentic . The nineteenth century had not heard many such bursts of song , none ever on such a theme . In the temperament of its maker there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hungry yearnings that seemed directed at once at heaven and the flesh , now a passionate spirituality and a shrinking horror of the earthly that sounded like an echo of St. Bernard 's " Preparation for the Last Judgment " ; then again rhapsodies like the " Corymbus for Autumn , " clogged with impossible adjectives that troubled till they cloyed the sense ; or clear startling renditions as in his " Poppy " : Like a yawn of fire from the grass it came . He could be tender , too , and his poems on childhood are among his best . If we dared pick , for instance , only the following four stanzas from his " Daisy , " it would be a well-nigh perfect lyric : For standing artless as the air , And candid as the skies , She took the berries with her hand And the love with her sweet eyes The tallest things have fleetest end : Their scent survives their close . But the rose 's scent is bitterness To Into that loved the rose : She looked a little wistfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye had a mist on it , And the leaves fell from the day . She went her unremembering way , She went and left in me The pang of all the partings gone , And partings yet to be . The lines quoted are enough to show that the future will , have some reckoning to make with their author . Yet he had many and grave defects . His execution is often inexcusably wretched ; he can not strike his note and hold it ; when hard pressed he stuffs the gap with monstrous words and his ear fails him . The technical accomplishment which is always there to save Verlaine 's worst is not evident even in Thompson 's best , and it is perhaps for this reason that he has fallen so hopelessly far behind even his own deserts . His first success he followed up with " Sister Songs " in 1895 , and with the " New Poems " in 1897 . There was no progression ; he was no longer a " new poet , " and the faults seemed more glaring now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointed , perhaps  --  and we strongly suspect it  --  that complex of contradictory qualities which . constituted his temperament was unstable , and when the resolution came , as it must have come with years , the furor poeticus was gone . In any case , the poet lapsed into silence , and doubtless it will mean little to the latest generation of readers to learn that Francis Thompson is dead CHRISTIAN GAUSS .

In reading Mrs. Wharton 's new novel , " The Fruit of the Tree " ( reviewed in the Nation of October 17 ) , I have been struck with its similarity in central situation to Ibsen 's play , " Rosmersholm , " a similarity , so far as I know , not yet pointed out by the reviewers In " Rosmersholm " the hero , Rosmer , is an idealist and would-be reformer , whose wife is incapable of sympathizing with his high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca . West , who has become a member of the family , has developed an intimacy with the husband , and is fully in sympathy with him In fact , Rebecca is largely responsible for Rosmer 's new philanthropic theories and plans . She is a young woman of strong personal charm . " Whom could you not bewitch , if you tried ? " one of her enemies says to her She is also in love with Rosmer , and sees that he will never accomplish anything while his wife lives Beata is a nervous invalid . By skilful suggestion Rebecca makes her believe that her death is necessary to make Rosmer happy , and to preserve him and Rebecca from shame . The unhappy Beata throws herself into the river Rosmer soon discovers that he is In love with Rebecca , and asks her to marry him , but under the conventional influences of Rosmersholm Rebecca has experienced a change of heart She now believes that she has no right to marry Rosmer , and steadfastly refuses him , but without giving him any reason for doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her responsibility for Beata 's death , at the same time declaring her love for Rosmer . Rosier is in theory an emancipated man ; but , as his friend Kroll says , " All this has only been a matter of the intellect ; it has not passed into the blood . " He is horrified and repelled by Rebecca 's confession : at once he loses all faith in her . One thing only can restore his faith : that she should " go the same way that Beata went . " She expresses her willingness to do so ; he is incredulous , but at the last moment is convinced of her sincerity , and leaps into the river with her . From this bald account of the play the extent of its similarity in situation to the novel will be evident . The three central characters of " The Fruit of the Tree " stand in the same relations to one another as Roamer , Beata , and Rebecca . Amherst , like Rosmer , is a man of " advanced " thought , an idealist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympathy with her husband 's theories . Justine Brent , like Rebecca , is a friend of the wife who comes into the family , becomes intimate with the husband , and sympathizes with his aspirations . Like Rebecca , she is a girl of singular personal charm and persuasiveness . " There 's nothing you ca n't make people believe , you little Jesuit ? " Amherst says to her To save Bessie from needless anguish , Justine gives her an overdose of morphine Afterwards she marries Amherst . Her motive , unlike Rebecca 's , is unselfish , but the outcome is the same that Rebecca planned . Like Rebecca , Justine conceals her share In the wife 's death as long as she can . Amherst distrusts the woman he loves , as Rosmer does , when she makes her confession " Like many men of emancipated thought , he had remained subject to the old conventions of feeling " There are obvious and important differences , illustrating in an interesting way the difference between Norwegian and American taste , but the parallel is sufficiently noticeable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance may be entirely accidental , and in any case Mrs Wharton , by her masterly treatment , has made the situation her own But I think it would not be difficult to trace Ibsen 's influence elsewhere in her work Lily Bart , for instance , is a sort of American Heada Gabler . At all events , the similarity I have been speaking of seems worth pointing out . HOMER E. - WOODBRIDGE . Colorado Springs , November 17 . JOHN HARVARD AND HIS TIMES To TEN EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR ? Your critic 's kindly reference +o me in his review of Henry C Shelley 's " John Harvard and His Times , " November 21 , prompts me to say that if I was not the discoverer of our John Harvard 's English home and parentage then certainly Dr. Rendle was not , and the credit must be awarded to an earlier explorer , viz , the late Col. Joseph L. Chester , who first called attention to the fact that there was a butcher in Southwark named Robert Harvard , who , dying in 1625 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in the winter of 1881-2 that Chester made known this fact and suggested that this John Harvard might have been the one who came to New England and gave name to our ancient college . If the mere fact that there was a John Harvard in Southwark of apparently the right generation is enough to warrant the declaration that he was our man , then , I repeat , Col Chester is to be credited with its discovery . But that gentleman was a trained genealogist , and knew very well that proof was needed to establish the connection , and that the one who should find that proof would rightfully be acclaimed as the real solver of the problem . From Col. Chester not only I , but many others , knew that John , son of Robert Harvard , was living in 1625 , and we took it for granted that his baptism would have been entered upon the parish register . I could have gone for it any day from the moment I first settled down to my work in London , with the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years afterwards ; but I should have been no nearer ' to the solution of my problem The parish register could not tell me anything about that . There were other Harvard families , other John Harvards . Who was our John Harvard ? That was the question to which I was trying to find the answer , and I found it , as I had expected , in the probate records . When the wills of Thomas Harvard and Mrs Katherine Yearwood were found , , the English home and parentage of our John Harvard ceased to be a problem . It only remained for me and others , including Messrs . Rendle , Smith , Dunkin , etc , to , glean additional facts an our various fields , and thus increase our knowledge of the man and his surroundings . One of these additional facts , of course , was this very record of baptism , which then , and then only , became important ( in the sense of interesting ) , since at enables us to form some idea of his age , and furnishes Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What caused me regret was Mr. Shelley 's reference to what he Was pleased to term an " ungenealogical wrangle " between Dr Rendle and me He is mistaken . I never engaged in a wrangle , or whatever else it may be called He has evidently confounded me with the late Mr. John r Hassam , who had my " Gleanings " published and furnished the Introduction , Co which undoubtedly Mr. Shelley refers . The first I knew of that Introduction was when the finished pamphlet reached me . My connection with the work had ceased when I sent my notes across the ocean to the society 1 was sorry to see Mr. Hassam 's first comments , just as I have been sorry since to see a portrait of me inserted in one of the bound volumes of my " Gleanings . " In both instances my consent was not asked , nor was I informed beforehand . Before closing let me call attention to a fact not noticed , so far as I know , by anybody thus far . The Rev Nicholas Morton , minister at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying in 1640 left a will of which I made an abstract which appears in my " Gleanings " That will shows that he had recently married the widow of John Harvard 's brother Thomas . This is especially interesting in view of the fact that Charles Morton , his eldest son by a previous match , later ( in 1686 ) following in the footsteps of his father 's friend and brother-in-law , came over to New England , settled in Charlestown , became a minister of the church there , and also vice-president of the college named after that friend . HENRY F. WATERS Salem , Mass. , November 22 . THE , " STATE PAPER OFFICE " AND THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : It is a remarkable fact that reputable historical writers of the present day should continue to refer to documents in the " State Paper Office , " London , when that repository has had no legal existence for more than fifty years and no material existence for forty-five years In Larned 's " Literature of American History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greene 's " Provincial America , " 1505 , 1V1unro 's " The Seigniorial System in Canada , " 1907 , and Avery 's " History of the United States , " Vol . III , 1907 , not to mention less important publications , the term is still used , and the impression is left that there is in London to-day a " State Paper Office " containing valuable documents and maps relating to American history . Were it not that this error has been repeated so often by scholars of rank , it would not seem necessary to call attention to it here . The facts are these ? In the middle of the nineteenth century , except for a few scattering groups of papers , the great bulk of the State Papers , Domestic and Foreign , the Home Office and Colonial Office papers , and the papers of the Board of Trade , were in the State Paper Office , a building ' erected for the special purpose in 1830 , fronting St James Park , where the India office now stands In 1848 the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Keeper of the State Papers , the records should be transferred to the custody of the Master of the Rolls ; and on March 5 , 1852 , an order in council was issued requiring " that all records belonging to Her Majesty , deposited in any office , court , place , or custody , " other than those mentioned in the Public Record Office Act of 1818 , should " from henceforth be under the charge and superintendence of the Master of the Rolls , " subject to the provisions of that act When , therefore , in1854 , Sir Henry Hobhouse died , the State Paper Office and its establishment were consolidated with the Public Record Office , ( / founded in 1838 . The former maintained a separate existence as a branch Record Office until 1862 , when the site being required for the new Foreign and India offices , the building erected thirty-two years before was pulled down and all its contents , not already removed , were transferred to the building between Chancery and Fetter Lanes . The term " State Paper Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wholly incorrect , while its use as a synonym for the Public Record Office is misleading ? and without official warrant CHARLES M. ANDREWS Johns Hopkins University , November 21 . REDUCING THE DUTY ON ENGLISH ART To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR . I notice this morning that a " provisional agreement " has been " arrived at " between Mr Whitelaw Reid and Sir Edward Grey , to swap British art for American drummers ' samples , by a reduction of the duty on English art . No American artist in Europe is  --  if he is worth anything  --  afraid of competition in Europe , where there is at present no tariff , though there is a certain amount of justifiable jealousy towards Americans But , if this agreement is carried out , and if the duty on British art is alone to be reduced . and not that on Continental art , the result will simply be that British shop-keepersI mean experts  --  and British painters who ca n't dispose of their work here or on the Continent , will have a better chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean American art lovers As a matter of fact , the tariff has never kept the work of an eminent , an acknowledged European artist , out of the country . Has it kept out the Romanticists ? Where are the best collections of Monet ? In my own work , what European etcher has been prevented from showing and selling his prints ? What illustrator from contributing to the American magazines ? The tariff has kept out cheap and unsalable rubbish . It has never for one moment interfered with a modern , a living European artist I have been connected with more than one American show of European art , and I know what I am talking about . But if England is to be given a preferential arrangement , what will happen ? France , Germany , Italy , who alone have helped America in this struggle , will , I hope , prevent American artists from ever showing , from ever studying , and from establishing schools , clubs , and students ' refuges in those countries What has Great Britain done for American art that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , the Academy has from its beginning been a harbor for American painters  --  some of them . But he s England welcomed American artists to its schools ? To be sure , these schools are not worth attending Even Englishmen who wish to learn anything go to France . Has the British nation encouraged American  --  or any other  --  save its own art ? And in payment we are to allow anything unsalable. so long as it is British , to be dumped on us . What I mean is this take the tariff oft everything  --  no artist over here would object to that , ridiculously sentimental and inartistic and unbusinesslike as the idea is  --  or let it alone . But why toady to England , the most inartistic nation on the face of the globe ? JOSEPH PENNELL London , November 23.
