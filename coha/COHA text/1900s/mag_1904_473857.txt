THE order was simple enough , merely to the effect that an unknown derelict reported as being seen on the 3d of the month in latitude 34 ? 16 ' and longitude 73 ? was to be sought out and destroyed without delay , but the officers and crew of the revenue-cutter Windom , stationed at Norfolk , hailed it with delight . They had been in port almost a month , and the prospect of a cruise after a derelict came as a most welcome break in the monotony of routine duty . Few preparations were necessary , as derelict-hunting during certain seasons , principally in the months of September and October , forms an important part of the revenue marines ' official schedule , so within three hours of the receipt of the order the cutler was steaming past Fortress-Monroe , bound out . The importance of the quest was apparent to all , from the captain down , as the position of the derelict at the last report was in the direct route of steam-vessels sailing between the Gulf of Mexico and the English Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every day such a menace to commerce was permitted to remain afloat meant a day of peril to ships nearing the coast . After passing the capes the cutter was driven at her utmost speed . The distance to the spot where the derelict had last been seen was about two hundred miles , and as it was shortly after five in the afternoon when the cutter dropped Cape Charles light , the abandoned craft should be in sight soon after dawn . As drifting derelicts are at the mercy of every vagrant wind and current , however , the captain of the cutter took the seamanlike precaution of slowing down in the middle watch , and also doubled the lookouts . The early morning hours dragged interminably . Very few members of the crew , except the tired fireman fresh from the stoke-hole , found occasion to sleep . In the officers ' quarters there was much speculation as to the identity of the craft , and whether her cargo would repay the trouble of salving . The first lieutenant , who acted as gunnery expert , told what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stranger . At break of dawn a loud hail came from the bridge . It was the welcome announcement that a vessel had been sighted , and in much less time than is taken in the telling , the cutter 's entire crew was on deck . Aided by his powerful glass , the captain saw a blotch on the distant horizon , which presently resolved itself into a hark standing to the northwest . " We 'll have to look further , " he said , with evident disappointment . " That craft is no derelict . She 's got a crew aboard . " With the hope that the hark might have sighted the abandoned ship , the cutter 's course was altered and she steamed within hailing distance . A brief conversation elicited the fact that something resembling a drifting hulk had been seen not three hours previously , but as it was too dark to distinguish details , the skipper of the bark was not certain . It was a promising eine , however , and the cutter steamed away again . Shortly after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been keeping a steady watch ahead called out that he could see something resembling a topmast above the rim of the horizon . A. few moments later another spar appeared , and then a tremulous line , which finally assumed the shape of a hull . Even at that distance it was possible to see that something was wrong on board the craft . It was apparently a two-masted schooner , but the maintopmast was gone , and what appeared to be a mass of wreckage encumbered the after-deck . As the revenue cutter rapidly lessened the distance , the strange vessel was seen to yaw and pitch , as if not under control . There could be no further doubt . It was the derelict . The cutter steamed to within a few hundred yards , and preparations were immediately made to send a boat . The weather was ideal for the work in hand . The sky was clear overhead , and there was just enough breeze to temper the heat of the summer day . The sea was calm , with a slight lifting swell from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . In the boat , which was in charge of the first lieutenant , were placed materials for firing the derelict if that were considered the proper course , and also a case containing two hundred pounds of guncotton . A small electric battery with a quantity of wire was also taken along . Any possibility of salving the derelict had been abandoned , as it was apparent from her sluggish rolling and the condition of the hull , as seen through the glass , that her case was hopeless . All that remained was to end her career by tire or explosives . The first lieutenant of the cutter was a man of long experience in such work . As the small boat ran under the lee of the derelict , he seized a trailing rope and climbed over the side . The scene that met his gaze was just what he had expected . The decks were strewn with an indescribable tangle of wreckage . Twisted and snarled masses of the rigging hung in festoons from the broken mainmast ; the port bulwark was gone for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and aft a part of a spar , evidently the broken topmast , protruded from the roof of the cabin , which it had penetrated in its fall . From below-decks came a sullen swashing of water . The port quarter was gone , cut away as if by a huge knife . leaning far over the stern , the first lieutenant caught sight of several letters of the schooner 's name . There were only three ? " Sta ? " and it was impossible to tell what they represented . The home port was too far under water to be visible . From the top of the after-companion it was seen that the entire cabin was awash . Floating about were pieces of splintered furniture , scraps of paper , and two or three sudden articles of clothing . There was nothing resembling a body , and the lieutenant made no further investigation . By this time the boat 's crew had dragged on board the case of guncotton and the other apparatus . It was decided to blow up the derelict , as the hull was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main - hatch was opened it was seen that the hold contained hard wood in logs . It was this which had kept the shattered hull afloat . Under the lieutenant 's directions the boat 's crew work expeditiously . The guncotton with its detonating primer was lowered into the hold as far as possible , and the two firing-wires connected . Then the ends of the wires were taken in the boat to a safe distance . When all was in readiness the first lieutenant stood up with his finger on the key . There was a moment of silence , then with a dull roar a column of water and dust , intermingled with fragments of deck planking and logs , shot high in the air . The small boat heeled over , almost gunwale under , but skilful handling brought the how around in time to meet a huge . curling , foam - capped wave that came tumbling from the spot where the derelict , now a mass of broken timbers , had stood . The sea quickly subsided , and it was seen that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire fabric there remained nothing larger than a part of the after-house , and it was apparent this would quickly go to pieces during the first rough weather . The surface of the ocean in the immediate vicinity was covered with a great mass of debris , ? logs , spars , timbers , and other flotsam , ? but the action of the waves was already beginning to disintegrate it . After a time , satisfied that nothing further could be done , the revenue cutter returned to Norfolk , whence a report was sent to Washington that another menace to marine commerce had been swept from the seas . And the incident was closed . It is curious to note that on practically the same day that the TTniterl States revenue cutter destroyed this derelict , a British tramp steamer , the Grimsby , was performing similar work some nine hundred miles to the eastward . The story is told tersely , but with graphic force , in the steamer 's log , and runs as follows : " August 9 . ? Shortly after eight bells , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 ? 9 ' , a derelict was sighted three points of the port bow . Steamed to within quarter of a mile and sent life-boat with Second-officer Murphy in charge . Derelict proved to be the German ship Stuttgart from Bremen , laden with mixed cargo , and evidently bound to United States . On receiving report from Officer Murphy that the craft was a wreck and a menace to commerce , ordered him to set it on fire . This he accordingly did , starting a blaze in the cabin and also in the forecastle with the aid of four gallons of kerosene and a quantity of dry shavings taken from this steamer . The derelict burned like tinder , and when we got under weigh again , after waiting several hours , there was every indication that she was burnt to the water 's edge and would founder in the first gale . Nothing was found on board to indicate why she was abandoned . It was my impression she was sound when the crew left her , and had received her damages during the heavy weather which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be mistaken . " Subsequent information proved that Vra .. ( NUL ? No ? 644 ? 3 13 the captain was mistaken . The Stuttgart had sprung a leak during a heavy gale , and it was only at what appeared to be the last moment that the German skipper and his crew consented to leave their ship at the behest of a passing steamer . The subject of derelicts is one of the utmost importance to seafaring men in general , but especially so to the large transatlantic steamship firms . It seems strange , in view of the ever-present menace afforded to ocean traffic by derelicts , that no systematic plan has been adopted looking to their destruction . From time to time spasmodic efforts are made to interest the various governments in the subject , but without results as yet . Several months ago the New York Maritime Exchange appointed a committee to prepare a petition for presentation before Congress , praying that steps be taken to call an international conference on the general subject of derelicts . This petition recites in detail the serious peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drift nt the mercy of the wind and the waves . especially in the much-travelled steamer lanes , and renews with emphasis a recommendation made at the International Marine Conference held at Washington in 1808 . This recommendation was as follows : " It is recommended that a steam-vessel of about 800 tons displacement be built which shall be especially fitted and adapted to the service of taking the ocean in bad weather for the purpose of blowing up or otherwise destroying wrecks and derelicts or bringing them into pert ; such vessel to be built under the direction of and attached to the Navy Department , and that particular attention be paid to her strength , and to the strength , size , and character of her boats , owing to the fact that the services of such vessel are required principally just after a storm , when the seas are still running high and when no ordinary boat could take the sea . Special design in the hull is required on account of having frequently to tow vessels submerged . " The general plan as outlined provides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York or Norfolk . Telegraphic cominunication will be maintained with all the Atlantic coast ports , and on receipt of word that a derelict has been reported by sonic incoming vessel the little cruiser will put to sea on her mission of salving or destruction . The work will require a high order of professional training , including a thorough knowledge of ocean winds and currents , as derelicts are not prone to remain long in one spot . One of the principal objects of the petition is lo persuade the United States government to seek the co-operation of other maritime powers . As the maritime laws now stand , every shipmaster who takes time and labor to destroy any derelict found in his path lays himself liable to a suit for damages on the part of the derelict 's owner . Cases have been known where such owners have brought claims on the plea that their apparently abandoned vessel might have been salved , or in any event should have been left alone until certain supposititious efforts looking to that end had been exhausted . For this reason it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relinquish their rights and title after their property has been abandoned a stipulated time , and also other laws providing a reward or sonic form of compensation for shipmasters who make special efforts La destroy derelicts . Until the present time the task of ridding the seas of abandoned ships has been left to war-vessels and revenue cutters . To the personnel of the navy the work is not only interesting , but also instructive . There is no more welcome sight to the crew of a man-of-war than the outlines of a derelict looming above the horizon . It generally means gunnery practice with some of the elements of actual warfare . It also means a break in the monotony of sea routine , which to those who have had experience is something not to be lightly disregarded . Derelict-hunting , as we have seen , is considered an important part of a revenue cutter 's official duties . In fact this marine branch of the Treasury Department is now doing the work intended for the special cruiser above mentioned . In addition to this governmental work there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Hydrographie Bureau , which through itsvarious stations located at the principal seaports endeavors to keep the merchant marine informed of the whereabouts of all known derelicts . A pilot chart is issued each month , plainly indicating the latitude and longitude of floating obstructions as reported by shipmasters . In addition to this , certain bulletins and special reports are sent out through a mailing-list including practically every shipmaster in the United States . This service is entirely free . The information is considered so important that it is seldom a captain sails without sending one of his officers to the nearest branch hydro-graphic office for the latest reports . The statistics collected so far state that the average number of derelicts annually sighted in the Atlantic is 232 . The year 1893 was the most prolific , 41S floating derelicts of every degree being reported to the bureau . The field apparently sought by these abandoned ships is in the Gulf Stream off the United States , north of 300 latitude and west of 60 ? west longitude . In this area at least nineteen derelicts are constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains careful watch , especially after the fall of darkness . There is something peculiarly fascinating in the thought of these strange , ragged , and broken tramps of the sea drifting over the bosom of old ocean at the beck and call of each listless wind . Abandoned and worthless hulks though they are , there is a romance about them that is irresistible . Take the remarkable case of the Formic B. Wooiston . Left by her crew off the American coast in 1891 , she drifted for three years and six days , covering in that time more than ten thousand miles . In the course of her wandering she followed the Gulf Stream over to England , then took a jaunt down the European coast , and finally , true to her country , returned by devious ways over the equator hack to America , where she was wrecked three degrees north of the spot where she started adrift . The schooner B. R. Woodside , another famous derelict , began her career several hundred miles east of Savannah . She started off toward Europe by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canary Islands , and turned hack to within twenty miles of her starting-point . Then she drifted smith to the islands off Florida , became mixed up in a storm , and went zigzagging across the ocean . She crossed her own path a number of times , and was sighted by forty different shipmasters , who made haste to report her manoeuvres to the Hydro-graphic Bureau . She was a particularly dangerous specimen of the genus derelict , and there was great relief in marine circles when it was reported that some enterprising craft had picked her up and towed her to Abaco , New Providence . The honor of being the most remarkable derelict probably belongs to the Fred B. Taylor , the craft that was run into by the Trave in 1892 . The sharp bow of the transatlantic liner cut the sailing-vessel squarely in half , and by all rules of marine procedure should have sent her to the bottom . Strange to relate , however , the two parts remained afloat , and each started off on its own book to become a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally brought up on Wells Beach , and the bow , guided by an inshore current , went south and came to grief opposite the Carolinas . The following extracts from the Hydro-graphic Bulletin , published weekly by the Hydrographic Bureau , will give a clear idea of the method used in keeping track of derelicts . It will be noted that each abandoned vessel has a number by which it is recorded " 3197-11 -- -May 12 ? Lat. 47 ? , Ion . 42 ? , passed the derelict and dismasted bark Record. ?

( New York IT erald . ) " Here is the concluding history of a derelict which had been reported fifteen times , and which had haunted the transatlantic steamer lane for weeks . Fourteen different craft had sighted her , and it was not until the Rappahannock , a freighter , came along that this most dangerous of menaces to marine commerce was removed by fire . Waterlogged , with decks awash , and only a part of her masts showing above the surface of the sea , there was no human possibility of sighting her from the lookout of a swiftly moving passenger-boat on a dark night . There are romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that go rolling and drifting at the mercy of the wind and the wave , but there is tragedy too .
