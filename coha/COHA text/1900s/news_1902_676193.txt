txt Nobody is better entitled than GROVER CLEVELAND to offer counsel to the Democratic Party of the United States . It may be said that nobody is so well entitled to offer such counsel . For not only every Democrat , but every patriotic citizen whose memory goes back to those times must remember with admiration , even if he do not remember with gratitude , that GROVER CLEVELAND was the President who , having his own re-election . by the admission of everybody , full in view , deliberately put it at hazard in order to inject into the commonplace politics of the time *hat he regarded as an important and a neglected issue . That was not " politics . " But it was manliness . And accordingly , though he lost for that time upon the issue which he challenged , at the next trial he won . It is the same issue that he now brings it the attention of his political associates . the issue of tariff reform . The present President of the United States has committed himself to the amazing proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Mr. RoosEVELT isdiirn at that entrance is quite shut out . But the people of the United States . Republicans as well as Democrats , are coming to have their own ideas upon that subject , ideas which are very far from being those of the President . And at this juncture it is that the ex-President enters to advise his party , not only that the tariff , the bestower of favors and maker of privileged classes , has everything to do with the trusts , so far as the trusts are injurious to the pub-11 : welfare , but that the Republicans are awakening to that fact , and that it behooves the Democrats to beware lest their own issue be taken from them . The danger in American politics to-day , according to Mr. CLEVELAND , is the same as the danger which materialized in British politics half a century ago , when it was said that " the Tories caught the Whigs bathing and stole their clothes . " By recalling his party to its historic standards , Mr. CLEVELAND has done it a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his appeal meets from the managing politicians of the party . He points the way to honorable victory . It will not be his fault if the way is not taken .
