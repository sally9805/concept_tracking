To the agreement between our government and Japan 's no objection has been raised in this country , save one of a technical nature . Senatorial prerogative and jealousy are ruffled by the intimation that the document is not to be submitted to the Senate . For the Democratic minority of the Foreign Affairs Committee , Senator Bacon asserts that any agreement of the kind , - without the approval of the Senate stamped upon it , is " not worth the paper - upon - which it is written . " This criticism of the mere form of the negotiation does not seem vital or even very important . The agreement does not purport to be a treaty . If it were , and if it undertook to bind this country to Japan in an offensive and defensive alliance , even of the limited kind seen in the Anglo-Japanese treaty , it would have to be submitted to the Senate ; but nothing of that antbitious and revolutionary sort has been attempted by Mr. Root . He has made to Japan a declaration , as it were , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common interest . Either country could ignore it and go to war ; but , then , treaties do not prevent nations from making war if they are bent upon it . Unless there is a sound motive and an honorable purpose behind a treaty or an agreement , neither is worth much . And if the agreement entered into with Japan does really express the common mind of the two countries , as regards the matters covered , and if there is an intention on both sides loyally to abide by it , then the technical objection amounts to little . The status of the negotiation is much like that of Secretary Hay 's concerning the Open Door in China . In that , too , there was no question of a treaty or an alliance ; but an exchange of notes proved of the greatest value . Secretary Root 's undertaking is of narrower scope , but deals with a situation even more critical . That our relations with . Japan have been strained for three years past , it is useless to deny . In both nations a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerate trifles , and dwell too much upon points of Eric-tion . It was to this kind of lurking apprehension and mental inflammation that Mr. Root addressed himself ; and it seems to us that the solution hit upon will be of immediate practical effect , and of lasting value as an exam , ple of peaceful adjustment of difficulties . The instrument agreed upon rests on a basis of mutual respect . Japan disclaims any designs upon our territorial possessions , as we upon hers . This at once disposes of the Japanese " swoop " upon Hawaii , or the Philippines . In China and Manchuria , where trade interests are common , the agreement guards each side ; and in case anything arises to disturb conditions in the Orient , the two governments agree to " consult " with each other , and to act in common , if a way be found to do so In short , the agreement emphasizes the stake which both Japan and the United States have in the maintenance of peace , points out the many ways in which they can cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding as good morals and the national conscience , no more and no less . The way in which this achievement has been hailed abroad as a great work for peace , is a good measure of its importance . Foreign commentators know that if either party to it were to violate the contract , no court exists to inflict punishment , except the court of international public opinion . But the impalpable writs of that court are gaining in respect with every year . International goodwill is an asset which the richest nation can not throw away ; and a repute for honor among sister-nations is a thing which the mightiest will not to-day disregard . It is upon these simple principles that the agreement with Japan is founded . At last , it appears , there is to be a radical overhauling of the Navy Department , undertaken by Secretary Newberry . The necessity of a reorganization has been felt by every recent Secretary who has been in office long enough to master his duties . So long ago as 1885 President Cleveland , in his annual mes sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to espeCially direct the attention of Congress to the close of the report of the Secretary of the Navy Whitney , in which the humiliating weakness of the present organization of his department is exhibited , and the startling abuses and waste of its present methods are exposed . The conviction is forced upon us with the certainty of mathematical demonstration that before we proceed further in the restoration of the navy , we need a thoroughly organized Navy Department . But Mr. Whitney 's appeals were in vain ; he , too , had to content himself with the shifting of duties between the bureaus . Nor did it avail him to recall to the memory of Congressmen that ten years previously , in the investigation of the Navy Department of 1875-76 , an able officer , Commander D. McW . Fairfax , had informed the.HoueeNaval Committee that " the bureau system was gradually undermining the discipline of the Navy Department , and must sooner or later be changed . " Secretary Herbert , in 1894 , dwelt on the incessant friction between the bureaus , all coordinate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , also urged strongly that the department should be reconstituted . It was during his administration , we believe , that the captain of a battleship received orders from one bureau to sail from the New York Navy Yard at once and was threatened with court-martial by another if he did so . Mr. Long , in 1899 , declared that the bureaus of steam engineering , construction , and equipment should be consolidated , since all their functions related to the preparing of a ship for sea , and in 1900 he repeated this recommendation . The facts , then , are indisputable . The strange thing is that the abuses have persisted through so many administrationi . The decision of the Supreme Court , in the matter of the two-cent-fare law of Virginia , is important , both in itself and in its implications . We may be sure , for example , that the corporations in this State , which are thinking of testing the constitutionality , of the Public-Service Commission law , will instruct their counsel to read , mark , and inwardly digest- this decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , on all fours with the New York body . The former is a creation of , the new State Constitution ; the latter of the Legislature . The functions of the two are , however , in many respects similar Both are empowered to fix rates . To do that ? was alleged by the Virginia railways , as by opponents of our Public Service Commission , to be a judicial act ; and judicial powers can not be delegated . But the Supreme Court has now decided that it is a legislative act . This does not mean that it is final , or can not be inquired into by the courts , If its effect , in a given case , is confiscatory , its enforcement can- be enjoined . But the act itself is not judicial . This being So held for Virginia , would surely be so held for New York also . By so much , therefore , the probability that our statute would be upheld by the Supreme Court as valid , is heightened by- the decision , The prevailing opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious and disputed province of law  --  what may be Called the twilight zone which lies between the State courts and the Federal courts . It will be remembered that efforts have been made in several States to prevent cases arising under railway-regulation laws from being taken before Federal judges . In some instance 's , severe penalties have been proposed for even attempting such a course . On this question of the fundaMental right of appeal the opinion of the Court , as read by Mr. JuStice Holmes is very explicit : A State can not tie up a citizen of another State , having property within ' its territory , invaded by unusual acts of its own officers , In suits for redress in its own courts . So , that is ended . , At the same time , the Supreme Court is desirous , in practice , of showing all deference to the State courts The gist of the decision is to send back the whole case for trial before the Virginia Court of Appeals . The railways should have exhausted their recourse for justice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes : The Stath had endeavored to impose the highest safeguards possible upon the exercise oC the great power given to the Corporation Commission by providing for app-eals to its ' highest courts . It was Only a just recognition of the solicitude with which -- the rights of the railroads had been guarded that they should make sure that the Staie , in - its final action , would not re-sheet what they thought their- rights to be , before resorting to the Federal courts . If the rate should be affirmed by the Court of . Appeals , and the railroads should still regard it as confiscatory , they would be at liberty to renew their application to a Federal court . This seems to be common sense , and it lays down a general rule which the Supreme Court may be expected to follow . It should do much to allay any feeling which may have been growing up that the Federal courts are too prone to ignore or over-ride the State courts , On the other hand , State Legislatures will doubtless be slower , after this decision , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tf Mr. Taft 's choice of Mr. Hitchcock as his Postmaster-General is open to any censure , it is because Mr. Hitchcock was the campaign manager . In consequence , the appointment may appear to some as a payment for that labor . It must , however , be admitted that if Mr. Hitchcock had remained First Assistant Postmaster-General , his promotion would be hailed as particularly desirable . For Mr. ' Hitchcock , like Mr. Cortelyou , has worked his way up through the government service Hence his appointment to the Cabinet should be another stimulus to the great body of civil servants in Washington . None the less , there should be more sensitiveness in regard to the practice of rewarding political managers with high office . Of course , a President must form his estimate of a man , in part at least , on the basis of services to the party . Had Mr. Hughes , for ' instance , not been reelected Governor of New York , Mr. Taft would have done well to consider him for a Cabinet position because the Governor 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity that should be enlisted in leadership . To obtain high office by intellectual contributions to party ' success is an historic and eminently proper way of advancing one 's self . Since we can not train our Cabinet min- isters in Congress , after the good English fashion , it is es-PdcialIrlegitimate to qualify as . adviser to the President by proVing one 's fitness on the stump or in the party councils . It is when we ' come to the purely executive side of party management that drawing the line between the fit and the unfit is difficult . Critics will be moved largely by the effect of the example set by selecting Mr. Hitchcock , rather than by any objection to his promotion . They will doubtless ask whether it will not induce the mob already asking for minor offices to believe that the smaller places are also to go to men " who had their coats off during the campaign . " - Fortunately , we have made great progress since the days when only a few " doctrinaires " denied that the spoils belling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidents from that shocking rush for jobs , which , in Mr. Garfield 's case , led to assassination. , Rewards are less frequently- given for mere machine work ; and . the publication of campaign contributions will make it more difficult , hereafter , to assign an office to a man merely because of his cash payment to the National Committee . For Mr. Hitchcock 's case there is , of course ; abundant precedent . Mr. Roosevelt early , rewarded Hanna 's right-hand man , Henry C. Payne of Wisconsin , by making him Postmaster-General . Mr. Cortelyou was already in the Cabinet when he managed Mr. Roosevelt 's campaign of 1904 , but his transfer to the Postmaster-Generalship came soon thereafter . Indeed , this office , with its enormous patronage , is by custom specially reserved for-valiant party laborers , one reason , perhaps , why the postal service has never been more successful as a business enterprise . Justice to President Roosevelt demands , however , a recognition of the fact that in his distribution of Cabinet offices he has been much less guided by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his wish to recognize the various elements in our cosmopolitan electorate , It has meant far more , to him , to give representation to our Jewish and Catholic fellow-citizens , and to- have a genuine Sputherp , Democrat at his Cabinet ' table. ? : whether Mr. Taft will be guided by similar motives remains to be seen The promotion ' of Gifford Pinchot , who has been , such an , admirable Chief Forester , , would meet with hearty approval . Anything that makes for efficiency , both in the Cabinet itself and-out of -- it , will-be-acclaimed ; and the oftener a man is appointed because of peculiar fitness , the more disreputable it will seem to - put a , man : into the Cabinet merely for - the money . he has paid or the votes he can swing . Some of the advocates of protection show a curious obtuseness in regard to taking a personal interest in laws which will affect their own pockets . Mr. Dingley was a woollen manufacturer , but found no impropriety in working for increased duties on the product of his mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city council or a head of department shmild have an interest in a contract upon which he himself was to pass officially . In principle , it comes pretty near the offence of Senator Burton of Kansas , who violated the statute forbidding members of Congress to act as attorneys for private clients before the government departments . But Representatives seem free to admit in the hearings by the Ways and Means Committee that they have a personal interest in certain ? tariff rates . Thus , when the lumber schedule was under discussion the other day , Congressman Joseph W. , Fordney of Indiana remarked : " I have been in the lumber business ever since I was a boy . " He also stated , alluding to lumber manufacturing : " I am in the manufacturing business in the South , in the State of Mississippi " ; and again , referring to the lumber business on the Pacific Coast : " I am in the business out there . " Even more striking was the case of ex-Congressman M. B Rhodes of Missouri , who asked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 a-ton . He read from one of his own letters : " I have personal knowledge of the situation , because I am interested in the mining of barytes . " He explained to the committee ; When I was in Congress I introduced a bill in the Fifty-ninth Congress which sought to fig a specific duty of $5 a ton on crude ore , because I believed at that time that that would give us ample protection . Thus protection appears to abrogate the maxim that a man shall not be judge in his own cause . The process of " chloroforming Tim " is now complete . The Taft cottage at Hot Springs witnessed the last act of the tragedy  --  or is it a comedy ? After a conference on Sunday Mr. Woodruff announced his withdrawal from the race for the Senatorship in favor of Secretary Root . Of course , Mr. Woodruff " profoundly appreciates the unanimity and earnestness " with which ho has been " appealed to by the organization and the members of the Legislature " from his " home county of Kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to him " from every section and almost every county of the State . " But with that delicacy of sentiment which has marked his Whole political career he feels that " the power of the State organization should not be used by the chairman of the State Committee to further the candidacy of any one person against another . " Moreover , Mr. Taft wishes to have Mr. Root in the Senate , and therefore Mr. Woodruff magnanimously makes the Great Renunciation . Of course , this means that there will be no opposition to Mr. Root 's election . The only- ominous feature of the affair is Mr. Taft 's statement that Mr. Woodruff " has established his claim to the gratitude of the Republicans of New York , and also of the country at large . " This looks as - if Mr. Woodruff 's claim to something " equally good " were in some-way to be recognized . The decision of the Unionist Peers to kill the Licensing Bill in the House of Lords will intensify the difficulties - of the Liberal Prime Minister It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the bill as it left the Commons , but it had been hoped that they would pass it with some amendments , especially as several bishops favored it as a temperance measure . The outright killing of the bill , therefore , raises once more the- question whether Mr. Asquith will dissolve and appeal to the people , with a programme of radical reform of the Constitutional position of the Lords . Probably , the Premier will find it wisest to pocket this affront and wait until a break comes on some more vital question . - The Lords have accepted worse bills  --  the Trade Disputes and Old-Age Pension Bills  --  without protest . They have thus laid themselves open to the charge that they rejected the Licensing Bill in order to favor " the trade , " and to gain the popular support of those workingmen who want cheap beer When the Viceroy of India ' abandons his inspection trip and returns to Calcutta heavily guarded , when lieutenant-governors and district superintendents are being attacked by bomb-throwers , EnglishMen'must take the Hindu disaffection seriously The relatively small number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dispatches , is still large enough to prove the strength of the new Nationalist movement among the natives . Japan 's sudden rise has taught - its lesson quickly , as everybody but a few civil service officials expected . And the Indian government must deal with the Nationalists , not as a pack of fanatics or murderers , but as a political party having a popular cause . English newspapers sn India and at home are already conceding the wisdom of a policy of concession and conciliation . It may be , as the Calcutta Englishman holds , quite impossible for the British to give In- , ' dia. a Constitution at once ; there may be too many dishonest natives in power for that . But a progressive scheme of reform yielding steady increase of political knowledge , privilege , and influence to the governed is feasible  --  and ordained by the great awakening of the East . All the evidence indicates that the unpopularity of the German Emperor still continues . It was thought that his yielding to the Chancellor and the Reichstag , with public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of joy and renewed loyalty . In fact , however , his act seems to have been received with a certain relief , it is true , but with little enthusiasm . The talk is still of a great constitutional crisis . One cause of this persistent coldness towards the Kaiser undoubtedly is that he made his concession appear both ambiguous and grudging . When a sovereign has to surrender , the wise thing is for him to do it heartily and completely . William II might have learned something from Elizabeth of England . When she and her Ministers tell : into a controversy with the House of Commons and the nation , over the question of monopolies , the Queen knew how to retreat gracefully . Macaulay wrote : There seemed for a moment to be some danger that the long and glorious reign of Elizabeth would have a- shameful and disastrous end . She , however , with admirable judgment and temper declined the contest , put herself at the head of the reforming party , redressed the grievance , thanked the Commons , in touching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weal , brought back to herself the hearts of the people , and left to her successors a memorable example of the way in which it behooves a ruler to deal with public movements which he has not the means of re- - sisting
