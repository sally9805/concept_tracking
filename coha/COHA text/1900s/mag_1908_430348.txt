T HE Empress of Japan , in which Randolph and I sailed from Victoria for Yokohama in the summer of 1894 , proved to be an ocean palace , clean and comfortable , and , much to my delight and appreciation , the saloons were decorated with quantities of Japanese plants and shrubs . The Chinese waiters , too , were a novelty . Dressed in their butcher-blue or white , they looked picturesque . Among the passengers were Baron Speck von Sternburg , now German Ambassador at Washington , and Mr. Villiers , the war correspondent of " The Graphic . " We were greatly interested and excited at the thought that we should find Japan in a martial state , as the Chinese and Japanese war was then at its height ; and , not knowing Japan , we anticipated stirring scenes and sights . Great were to be the doings of Mr. Villiers , who expected to go at once to the front . On arriving , we found that the harbor of Yokohama was laid with torpedoes and submarines , and the captain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was glad to leave the ship , as the Pacific had been anything but peaceful . Rough seas , gray and leaden skies , constant rolling and pitching , besides the monotony , had begun to weary us . Immediately on anchoring in the harbor , we found ourselves surrounded by a shoal of craft of all sizes and shapes , from a steam-launch to a sampan , Japanese junks hovering on the outside of the crowd . I watched the motley crew for some time , their various costumes ? or the want of them ? amusing me much . On a government launch were some little military men , dores sur toutes les coutures , coming to greet the Japanese officers we had on board . Much bowing and scraping took place . We were surrounded by sampans trying to get out of the way , manned by coolies dressed only in white cotton Eton jackets and a bright bit of blue stuff bound round their heads , a great contrast to the gorgeous uniforms . We were not sorry to get ashore and betake ourselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looked very dejected , as they were not allowed to join the army . Mr. Villiers managed later to get to the front , but with such restrictions that I imagine his reports could have been of little value , as he was denied the use of the telegraph , and everything he wrote had to be submitted to the minister of war for supervision . We were told that there had been a great Japanese victory the day before , and this made the war more popular than ever , although we could not see many signs of rejoicing . I gathered from the different people I met that the situation was being forced by the government , to create a diversion from internal troubles . I was told that the English in Japan rather sympathized with the Chinese , whereas , when later we went to China , we found the situation there just the reverse . Although the Chinese had the men and the money , they hated fighting , as was proved by the result of the campaign . I have always thought that the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular in not being allowed to reap the fruits of their victory . Even in the recent Russian war , although conquerors , they were not allowed a free hand . After the cold of the Pacific , the damp heat of Yokohama was very trying , and we stayed only a few days before going up to Myanoshita , in the hills . Before leaving Yokohama , I went to the theater , which certainly was unlike anything I had ever seen before . We sat on the floor of our so-called box , and had tea like the crowd . And such a crowd ! It was an endless source of interest and amusement to watch them , whole families ? mothers-in-law and daughters-inlaw , children of all ages , and parents of different generations , fathers , sons , and grandsons . All had their dinners with them . Little trays were produced ? tiny boxes full of rice ; bowls containing weird food-stuffs , pink , white , and green ; seaweed on rice cakes ; raw fish , and nameless yellow condiments ; tea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . The Japanese can not understand Europeans putting milk in their tea , as , according to them , it has a strong smell . The children were dressed and undressed during the entr'actes , and people smoked , slept , ate , talked , and fanned themselves . It was certainly a great contrast to see a little " musme " such as Pierre Loti describes , daintily dressed in the gayest of kimonos and smartest of obis , sitting between a coolie wearing nothing but a loose cotton jacket and an old hag nursing a baby . Although it was true that most of the men had little on , and the thermometer was 85 degrees , the atmosphere was not impossible , as I am sure would have been the case in a European theater under similar circumstances . The plays have usually fourteen or fifteen acts , and last all day , and sometimes two . This particular one not having an actress such as Sadi Yacco to interpret it , was quite unintelligible to me ; but I admired the grace of the actresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed their tight clothes . Imagine my surprise when I found out afterward that they were all men ! Up to a few years ago men and women did not act together in Japan , the theatrical companies being composed of either one sex or the other . But a change has come over them , and there are now mixed companies . One afternoon I visited the nursery gardens of Bohmer , where I saw quantities of the stunted shrubs and trees so dear to the Japanese heart , and with which they love to decorate their miniature gardens . I bought several , including a century-old maple about ten or twelve inches high , the tiny leaves of which were at that moment bright red . On my return to England I gave this little tree to the Princess of Wales , who was delighted with it ; for all I know it may still be alive . The whole place was perfumed by the gold and white " moxa , " and I longed to bring some away , as well as the huge gardenia and daphne plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron Sternburg , who was with me , proposed that we should walk back from the gardens , but we soon lost ourselves , and , hot and dusty , took refuge in an invitinglooking tea-house while we sent for a jinrikisha . The place was evidently not frequented by Europeans , as the little maids who waited on us hovered about me with the greatest curiosity , and before I could stop them , one had put on my gloves , another had seized my hat , which I had  |p595  taken off , placing it on her greasy , black locks , and a third was strutting about with my parasol . At last they became quite obstreperous , and it was only when my companion promised them sake that they left us in peace . On leaving Yokohama , we said good-by to our steamer friends , and started by train for Myanoshita . At the station there was a great crowd : naked coolies ; tradesmen in flowing kimonos , carrying Mrs. Gamp umbrellas and topped by monstrous pot-hats ; artisans in blue cotton tunics , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs in white , or inclosed in a circle of black on a red ground ; to say nothing of masses of women . The married ones were easily recognized by their shaved eyebrows and blackened teeth , in which hideous custom they indulge in order to remain faithful to their husbands , but which conceivably might produce the reverse effect on the husbands themselves . Among them were a number of girls , their shiny hair stiff with camelia oil , and adorned with combs , tiny chrysanthemums , and coral beads , their painted faces breaking into a smile if you looked at them . The motley crowd , which was reinforced at every station , walked , stumped , and toddled into the train , which consisted of a few diminutive carriages more like a glorified toy than anything else . Most of these people were mounted on clogs , making a loud and curious noise . After two hours of slow winding between soft-green hills covered with feathery vegetation , we arrived at Kodga , where we got into a tramway ( made in Birmingham ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comprised endless villages . The weather being hot , the inhabitants , including the babies , were carrying on their various vocations in front of their open houses , minus their clothes . All seemed hard at work and good-humored . The Japanese are proverbially fond of children , who , for fear they should be lost , are each made to wear a little metal ticket with name and address attached . Attractive as they untloubtedly are , it is a mistake to say that they never cry ; and it is equally untrue to say that smells do not exist in Japan . Defective drainage and stale fish do not , as a rule , remind one of the " perfumes of Araby . " We stopped occasionally to change the wretched horses . Japanese horses have no quarters , and are sorrylooking quadrupeds ; Chinese horses , on the other hand , have no shoulders . At Yumoto we all got into jinrikishas , each with two men , one to pull and the other to push , and we proceeded at a trot up the stoniest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tea-house , where the landlady , with much in-drawing of breath ( to show her civility by not breathing in one 's face ) and with much bowing and rubbing of knees , gave us Japanese tea in the usual cups without handles , and the pink-and-white cakes one sees everywhere , impossible , dry , musty horrors . Our jinrikisha-men , the perspiration pouring from their brown bodies , took off their white jackets ( their one garment ) and proceeded to wash and dash water over themselves from the pump near by . The pump was pretty and picturesque , consisting as it did of two bamboos , one brown , the other dark green ; in one of which there was a large bunch of wild flowers , while from the ' other the clear mountain stream poured into one of those delightful big Japanese tubs . The face of my maid ( a prim , highly respectable person ) was a study as the men resumed their mushroom hats and girded up their loins afresh . In consequence of my having treated them to sake at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fujiyya Hotel . The place looked pretty and quaint , and the calm and peace were welcome , but it was disappointing to find the hotel full of Europeans , mostly pale , jaded people from Hong-Kong , Shanghai , and even Singapore ; come to recruit in the fresh air of Mvanoshita , which is 3000 feet above the level of the sea . We passed a pleasant fortnight there . I never tired of the mountains , with their changing shadows , deep gorges , and rushing streams and cascades , with here and there a peep of the sea in the distance to rejoice the eye . The vegetation was a great source of interest and pleasure , it was all so new and so attractive : on our journey up I counted fifty-five different kinds of agricultural products and shrubs . The number of little villages and houses dotted about everywhere afforded a good glimpse of Japanese peasant life . All  |p596  seemed hardworking , contented , and good humored . One day we went to the Lake of Hakone , carried thither in straw chairs supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable mode of progression . They had a wonderful way of changing places with one another to relieve the load on their shoulders , and doing so without shaking one in the least . At a bend of the mountain path we suddenly came upon a large Buddha carved in the side of the rock . Innumerable prayers in the shape of bits of paper stuck on sticks were planted before him ; his legs were crossed , and the soles of the feet were turned up to show that he never sullied them by contact with things earthly . The look of eternal peace which characterizes all the effigies of Buddha is due , I think , to the closed eyes being so far apart , the serene and slightly smiling mouth adding to the unfathomable expression . Japanese photographers are such excellent artists that they always manage to find the most picturesque point of view . If , in visiting some place , one does not follow in their footsteps , one is apt to be disappointed and think they must have idealized . These were my feelings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the lake in two sampans , our noses in the air , gazing at the clouds for the point de mire of all japan , Fuji-yama , the great , the sacred . But as usual she had veiled herself in a cloud of mist , and not having as yet seen her , I was fain to be content with her presentment on my new kimono , which I found on returning to the hotel . We walked back part of the way over very rough ground steaming with sulphurous springs , Mr. Le Poer Trench , the English Minister , had arrived , and we were delighted to make his acquaintance ; and also that of Professor Basil Hall Chamberlain , whose book , " Things Japanese , " over which I had been poring with enthusiasm , is a standard work for all Englishspeaking people . They brought us the news of the great battle of Pyong-yang , where the Japanese claimed to have killed 20,000 Chinamen ; and of a naval engagement where six Chinese and three Japanese ships were sunk and blown up . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time been very long in Japan . His health was not of the best , as the climate of Mexico , his previous diplomatic post , had not suited him . A thin , pleasant man of about forty-five , I found him a great acquisition . We used to take long walks together , climbing the most precipitous hills . The three weeks of absolute rest at Myanoshita did Randolph much good , everything was so reposeful , from the quiet Japanese landscape , with its soft grays and greens , to the bevy of little " musmes " who waited upon us , moving silently and swiftly about in their stocking-feet , always smiling and gentle . Intending to go to Tokio , we were obliged to retrace our steps to Yokohama , where we stayed two nights . There we found considerable excitement in the harbor over the arrival of four large German ironclads on their way to Korea to " watch " the progress of the war . We could not but think it a pity that the British seemed so apathetic and unrepresented . The Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English government had rather given in to them over the last commercial treaty . So at least thought the English residents and merchants . The war was the one topic in the town . I went to a popular theater to see a play representing the battle of Pyong-yang . It was densely crowded , and with difficulty we got places in the gallery . In the last act the Chinese troops , represented by three Chinamen , were perpetually being killed by twenty Japs , who rushed about bugling incessantly , brandishing swords , letting off rifles , and enjoying it madly . In the center of the revolving stage was a cardboard town which was presently lighted up with red lights , the climax being reached when a small , yellow general in a smart European uniform rushed out from the smoke , and in a piping treble made a speech to the army of twenty , all there to a man . At this a paroxysm seized the audience , and they became so excited that we fled . Wata , my jinrikisha-man , asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance to Tokio was only eighteen miles , we took nearly two hours to get there . We met a train full of soldiers going to the front ; there was much cheering , and many sayenaras were exchanged . Fuji-yama , or " Fuji , " as they  |p597  affectionately call her , showed herself for the first time . The top alone was visible , and that only for a few moments , the " Peerless One " retiring again behind the clouds . The expedition to the top is , I believe , very tiring , but most thrilling . Descending , one " toboggans " on one 's feet through the ashes . This was done by Sir Harry Parkes and his wife forty years ago , they being the first Europeans allowed to ascend the mountain , which up to that time had been held sacred from the foot of the Western stranger . I was astonished to find Tokio such a vast place ; it covers an area as large as that of London . The distances are enormous , and I pitied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small remuneration . We went to the Shiba Temples and saw the tombs of the shoguns . The inner temple is full of large stone-and-bronze lanterns , which are the offerings and tributes to the dead from their royal relatives . To go into the ternple we had to take off our boots , while an apathetic priest looked on , his shaven head shaped like an emu 's egg , and his somewhat tawdry kimono making him appear anything but prepossessing . We duly visited the shrines , admired the beautiful frescoes and lacquered ceilings ; the goldlacquered doors of great value ; the carvings , ten or twelve inches deep , representing flowers and birds marvelously true to nature ; and , last but not least , the plain stone urn over the grave of each shogun , the only ornament being the three gold asarum leaves , the crest of the Tokugawa royal family . Next we went to the tombs of the forty-seven ronins , the brave and wonderful men , who , having revenged their ruined and murdered master by killing his powerful enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tomb of the chief ronin , 0-ishi-Kura Nosuke , was covered with flowers and paper prayers , and there was a large basket of cards hanging on the door , to which of course we contributed ours . Mr. Trench invited us to luncheon at the British legation , where we met , among others , Captain Brinkley and Professor Chamberlain . The legation showed signs of the last earthquake , which must have been a severe one , as evidences of it were everywhere . Although more than two months had passed , repairs were still being made . Another day we lunched with Captain Brinkley , to see his wonderful collection of china and bronzes . Captain Brinkley , a resident of Japan for over forty years , was the editor or proprietor of " The Japan Mail . " A man of great influence and vast information , he was most pleasant to meet . Every notable person who came to Japan , or wished to write about the country , consulted him as a walking encyclopedia . He told me that of all the searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that of Lord Curzon of Kedleston ( then George Nathaniel Curzon ) . For four hours he plied him with questions ; which , notwithstanding Captain Brinkley 's knowledge of the country , were often difficult to answer . He spoke of him with unbounded admiration as being the cleverest man he had ever met . Captain Brinkley 's wife , a Japanese lady who had been married to him some years , did the honors of his house with that wonderful grace and gentleness of which Japanese women alone seem to have the secret . The extraordinary refinement and high-bred look of a well-born Japanese is most attractive . Dressed in a kimono of neutral-tinted silk , with a discreet obi , and a soft , palepink cr1 , or collar , and with a beautiful , old gold-lacquered comb in her shinyblack hair , this lady presented a very different appearance to the bedizened geisha , with the rainbow-colored garments which is the accepted European idea of Japanese women . The late Mrs. Bishop , writing about Japan , says that to one who has lived there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison loud and vulgar in their voices and manners . Through an interpreter , an English lady who seemed a sort of dame de compagnie , Mrs. Brinkley and I were able to carry on a conversation . In speaking of their education , obedience , I was told , played the greatest part . " There are the three obediences , " said my hostess , " the child 's obedience to its parents , the wife 's to the husband , and the mother 's to the eldest son . " Presently we plunged into the mysteries of " Peach bloom , " " Sang de bmuf , " and " Famille verte " as bit by bit the celebrated collection was brought in from a godown ,  |p598  or fireproof house , next door . In this custom , Captain Brinkley copied the Japanese , who always keep everything of value in such a place , each house having one of its own . A few objects are particularly selected according to the season of the year , and are placed in an alcove in the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are sent back , and others arc brought in their place . In this way the treasures can be properly appreciated , and each time appear as fresh revelations . The Japanese consider , not perhaps without reason , that Europeans crowd their houses in an absurd manner , and make them look like shops . We ended our pleasant day by being taken to see the houses and gardens of Mr. Iwasaki , a magnate of Tokio , our host having arranged the visit beforehand . After a long drive in a landau , which was driven by a Japanese coachman garbed in a dark-blue kimono and mushroom hat , with a belto , or groom , dressed in the same way , on the box , we came to the two houses . One was European , full of fine things , while the other , in which the owner lived , was Japanese . Having removed our shoes , we were taken over it . I wish I could describe its fascinations ; but where there were no ornaments , no furniture , no pictures save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color anywhere , it is difficult to say wherein lay the charm . And yet it was charming . The fineness of the matting , the beauty and workmanship of the woodwork , . the lacquer frames of the screens , which were so adjusted that they parted  |p600  at a touch without a sound , the extraordinary cleanliness everywhere , and , above all , the different little courts on which the rooms looked , were delightful . The bath-room particularly pleased me . Made of some light-colored wood , it shone like satin and felt like it . A delicate carving round the base of the wall , representing flights of birds , formed a dado ; two large wooden tubs of the same wood stood at the end of the room , encircled by brass bands beautifully polished , and half a dozen tubs of different sizes stood on a low table ; the window looked out upon a small court with one large magnoliatree and a very old gray-stone lantern , Another room , a sanctum sanctorunn where the " tea ceremonies " were held . gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , prickly bushes , and rushing torrents spanned by stone bridges , made the urbanities and rigid etiquette of these ceremonies appear a pleasant contrast . The smoking-room , made by opening and closing a screen , looked out upon a lake artificially and cleverly planned , with beautiful trees and shrubs on its banks , and rocks of strange and varied colors . These rocks alone cost a fabulous , 1 sum , and had been brought from a great distance . The lake was fed from the sea , and as the sun was setting we watched the fish jumping high in the air . Walking round the gardens until it was nearly dark , every turn of the path presented an absolutely new aspect , the variety being marvelous . The gardens and houses covered twenty-four acres , and seemed four times that size . On our return to the European house , we found rows of servants and tables set out , with all manner of cakes , sandwiches , and tea , waiting for us . As Mr. Iwasaki did not live there , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me he thought it was a delicate Japanese hint to him not to bring strangers too often . Japanese , unlike their European brethren , do not care to be thought rich , and although hospitable , are not fond of showing their houses . One night I went out for a walk in the main street after dinner , escorted by our guide . The Imperial Hotel of Tokio , although magnificent , was rather stuffy , and every sort of insect came in at the windows , from mosquitos to green grasshoppers three inches long . In the streets ,  |p601  people and vendors were selling their wares on the pavement . The open screen of the private houses permitted us to look through them ; at one the sound of a sam isen attracted me , and 1 could not resist stopping and looking in . Beyond two rooms , by a not over-bright light , I saw e little Japanese woman sitting on a mat singing softly in a minor key , accompany ing herself on the samisen . I asked Mat suda if the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SIMPLICITY OF THE HOME uF A JAPANESE NOBLE said , " Oh , Japanese no look in ? not good manners . " I felt fearfully crushed . Shopping expeditions were always amusing . A Japanese woman who spoke English , the wife of Mr. Trench 's valet , took me with her , and I invested in some fascinating obis , Mrs. Tetsu helping me with her excellent taste . Next we went to a curio-dealer . There seemed to be no shop , but we walked into a tiny garden , where , seated on the floor of a small house , was a smiling old man , who received us with many bows , placing cushions for us . Tea and shiny , brown cakes were brought in ; he then produced a few little boxes , and , with much undoing of pale blue-and-green tapes and unfolding of silk handkerchiefs , showed us lovely old bits of lacquer , china , and bronze . The more I admired , the more he smiled and brought forth treasures , handling the things tenderly as though he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help comparing this curio-dealer with those of Yokohama , where they try to please foreign taste by forcing themselves to forget all that is best in Japanese art . producing vulgar atrocities to catch the eye , such as gold-lacquered vases overladen with cloisonne placques . There is a form of Japanese art which seems to consist in the beauty of blemish ; a vase to which no historical interest is attached , to our eyes without beauty of form or color , is of the highest value to the Japanese for the sake of certain blotches or imperfections . I believe they will give any price for what they consider such a curiosity , and no one has ever been able to explain to the most inquisitive mind the reason why . Pierre Loti , in one of his charming descriptions of japan , mentions the " Imperatrice Printemps " in such glowing terms that I was very desirous of seeing her . Mr. Trench arranged an audience , but unfortunately it never came off , owing to her Majesty 's illness , and my being obliged to leave Tokio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , as they are amusing : IM , herial Palace , September 21 , 1894 . MY DEAR MINISTER : I am glad your Excellency came back here so soon , I sent telegraph to Myanoshita this morning . I think Lady Randolph Churchill and you will be received by her Majesty the Empress on the 26th , however I shall not fail communicate to you of once when the day and hour of the audience is fixed . 1 think Mr. Ito told you this morning about lady 's dress was mistake , the rule of our Court being that a lady , at such audience time , wears long dress and high neck without a bonnet . If a lady being a traveler , has not got the said costume I remember she appeared in morning dress having permission of the Empress beforehand . I remain , Yours faithfully , S. Sannomiya. hnterial Palace , September 24 , 1894 . MY DEAR MINISTER : I am sorry to inform you that her Majesty the Empress , as I informed you on Saturday by Mr. Ito , will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end  |p602  of this month , for doctor advised to so do this morning . I think Lady Randolph Churchill may make a short trip during the time , it would be better for her . I remain , Yours very truly , S. Sannomiya . October 5 , 1894 . MY DEAR MINISTER : I have at once informed to her Majesty the Empress that Lady Randolph Churchill is going to leave Tokio , she says she feels much sorry for not being able to receive the Lady owing to her indisposition. sition . I enclose you a letter of permission for the old Palace , Nijio castel , and other two small palaces , Yours very truly , S. Sannomiya . Following beaten tracks , we went to Nikko , where the first thing to attract my eyes was the " Sacred Bridge , " which is very beautiful , the big , red-lacquered arch spanning the white , turbulent waters of the rushing Daya-Gawa , standing out in picturesque contrast to the dark-green avenue of magnificent cryptomerias . The public is not allowed to cross it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garish electric light at one end was rather an eyesore , but reminded one of Japan 's " go-aheadness , " which puts pot-hats on its men and telegraph-poles in sight of its gods . It was about eight or ten degrees colder at Nikko than at Tokio , and we shivered in our little summer rooms , notwithstanding attempts at a charcoal fire . We made  |p603  many expeditions , one day to the falls o Kiri-furi-notaki , and on another w walked to see the stone images at Kam man-sa-fuchi , said to be the offerings to the gods of Nikko of Shodo Shonun the " Opener of the Mountains , " who lived somewhere about the seventh cen tury , and was supposed to be a very hol man . We counted the figures , and each made out a different number , which wa quite the correct thing to do ; for , accord ing to the legend , no two people are abl to count them alike . Close by an inac cessible stone in mid-stream , with th Sanskrit word " Hamman , " carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a saint , is supposed to have thrown his pen at the stone , and marked it forever . Armed with a special permit which Mr. Trench had obtained for us , we were able to , visit the inner shrines of the two finest temples , Iye-yasu and Iye-mitsu . Great expectations generally mean disappointments , but the realities and beauties of the former temple far surpassed my imagination . The surroundings of the shrines were most beautiful : the grand , solemn approach of huge cryptomerias ; the imposing flights of stone steps covered with the moss of ages ; the splendid  |p604  granite Toni standing out in solitary grandeur against the sky , making a fine picture ; and half-hidden in the darkgreen foliage a quaint five-storied pagoda , its color giving the touch of warmth needed . The temple has been so often described that I can not venture on it ; indeed , one might visit it every day for a week and not master its beauties . The marvelous carvings , the frescoed ceilings , the gold lacquer , the bronzes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit we were treated with much respect , being received by the chief priest in person , supported by six minor priests . After passing the Yomeimon Gate , which is truly wonderful , with its hundreds of dragons and carved flowers , we passed under another , Karamon by name , and so into the temple where the two priests knelt at the entrance of the inner shrine , one in bright green , with a conical black cap , the other in a transparent white garment . Inside this holy of holies the chief priest also knelt . The light was so dim I could not make out what he had on , and I confess , what with the solemnity of the priests , the gorgeousness of the surroundings , the dim religious light , and the air heavy with incense , I felt my curiosity must be kept under , and did not like to gaze abou too much . Here Matsuda , our guide , prostrated himself , beating his head so many times that I wondered it did not ache . The shrine consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacquered ceiling , containing only a few glass cases on the floor , with the swords and armor of Iye-yasu , the deified shogun . A fourth door of beautiful gold lacquer opened into the last shrine , which is shown only to the Mikado and the chief priest , and which contains the effigy of lye-yasu . Through Matsuda we conveyed our thanks to the chief priest , a vener able old man with a pleasant smile , who was dressed in a pale-blue net garment over white , and a conical black hat with two cords passed under his chin . The inner shrine of the Iye-mitsu , which we also went to see , was much larger , and had gold columns all round the room ; on a low table in the center were some sacred missals , incense-burners , and vases with gold lotus flowers ; a very fine canopy was suspended over it . This , being a Buddhist temple , contained more things than that of Iye-yasu , which was Shinto , and therefore simpler . Near by the sacred white pony " Jimme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in a sumptuous stable in one of the courts . On our way back we met a family party of three struggling up the steps in a torrent of rain , the inconvenience of their costume being thoroughly demonstrated . Monsieur , in a brown kimono with a soupcon of white petticoat showing over his socks and high wooden pattens , a huge square pot-hat , a pair of spectacles , and a voluminous Japanese umbrella completing the costume . Madame , not a hair out of place , a sham camelia sticking up straight in front of the shiny black pouf , and a mauve tassel hanging in the vicinity of her left ear , something in the nature of a green cord , a coral bead or two , alld a couple of combs making up her coiffure . She wore a light-gray kimono , on the sleeves of which her crest was embroidered in coral ; her eri was of pale mauve ; a black satin obi , with some gold characters on it , and an extra high pair of pattens , made up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , which proclaimed her respectability ! Why must virtue be so ugly ? I must not leave out " Bebe , " strapped on its mother 's back , fast asleep ; his head , with its tiny tuft falling backward as though it would drop off , and the bright red crape kimono , with green flowers , made him look exactly like a Japanese doll . Deluges of rain drove us away from weird , mystical Nikko . It was not possible to resist the elements , and after changing our clothes and boots three times in one day , we succumbed . We fitly ended our visit to Japan by staying at the best place last , Kioto , the ancient capital , which is considered the art center of Japan . We were enchanted with its quaintness and local color . The view from our rooms at Yaami 's Hotel was most pleasing , and the first evening of our arrival I gazed for a long time at the thousand twinkling lights of the city lying in the valley at our feet , the mountains forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights of Kioto in ten days , visiting many curiosity-shops , which  |p605  were most enticing , and spending man hours at the cloisonne , satsuma , and sil factories . Here I was shown beautifu modern productions which quite equa any ancient Chinese or Japanese . Al though it is said that all the really fin objects of art have left japan and China and are to be found in America or i London , there were many very attrac tine things . The streets at night were a most at tractive sight , particularly Theater Street in which no jinrikishas were allowed . I was crowded with people and lighted u with Chinese lanterns . Outside eac theater wonderful paintings were exhib ited , representing the different blood curdling dramas going on within . W went into a theater of actresses , and saw two acts of the usual impossible-to-com prehend Japanese play : wonderful clothes daimi'os in full war-costume , females in distress , tears and sobs , which were echoed by the audience , and of course hara-kiri , which was performed in detail and at much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had endless reception-rooms , with the usual screens and fine matting . The Emperor squats when receiving Japanese , but sits in a chair when giving audience to Europeans . Some of the ceilings were highly decorated . His private study was a pleasantly situated room looking south upon a garden and small artificial lake ; its absolute quiet and peacefulness seemed very reposeful . The castle being older , and having belonged to the shoguns , was more decorated , everywhere the golden Tokugawa crest , gorgeous ceilings , and highly lacquered screens . In the two or three audience-chambers the Mikado 's  |p606  chrysanthemum replaced the three lotus leaves . One room was particularly nice , with a small raised platform , where the Emperor , arriving from a side room , would sit when he received . On the left was a recess in which were a few lacquered shelves ornamented with bits of old cloisonne , but of a lovely blue they seem unable to produce nowadays . A few curious screens completed the rooms . After Nikko I was too blase of temples to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with thirteen hundred and thirtythree gold-lacquered life-size images of Kwannon , the Goddess of Mercy ; also the new , unfinished , colossal temple of Shokonsha , where one saw great stacks of rope made of human hair , offerings from the women of Japan . Near by was a hideous great mound , which made us shudder , containing , as , it did , Korean ears and noses , trophies of war ! The Governor of Kioto , Nakai by name , died while we were there . He formed part of the escort to Sir Harry Parkes when the latter , on his way to have an audience with the Mikado , was attacked by some two-sworded men , which made a great stir in Japan at the time . We saw the funeral procession from a curio-dealer 's shop in one of the principal streets , which was lined by a quiet throng , all dressed in blue ( the mourning color ) . Masses of flowers in big baskets were carried before the hearse , which had the appearance of a Noah 's ark borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were open , one caught sight of a cocked hat and feathers . Immediately behind came a jinrikisha , with the daughter of the deceased entirely in white , with her face enameled to match . An enormous crowd followed , dressed in kimonos , and all wearing pot-hats of every conceivable shape , many with white cotton gloves . The effect was ludicrous . If people wonder what becomes of all the old hats , they have but to go to Japan . One of our last expeditions was to the Lake of Biwa . It was a long and dusty road , and I found the jinrikisha very tiring ; the sights on the way , too , were unpleasant . It was pitiful to see a mass of toiling peasants doing the work of beasts , dragging and pushing carts with huge loads up hill and down dale . All looked exhausted , and in most cases a woman was harnessed in front with a rope across her chest . I noticed one poor creature spitting blood when she reached the top of the hill . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a temple . The street where the Cesarewitch ( the present Emperor ) was attacked was pointed out to us . The two jinrikisha-boys who saved his life were pensioned , and , it is said , given so much money that they lead an idle life , and are ruined by drink . The biggest pine-tree in Japan grows at Biwa , which , although curious , with its innumerable gnarled roots and branches growing into the ground , is so propped up with poles that one can hardly tell which is the tree , and in consequence its symmetry is lost . We also saw the rapids of Katsuregawa , being skilfully forced up them in a sampan . The hills on each side looked lovely , with every sort of autumnal tint , the red maple leaves just turning . The monotony of our long drive back was relieved by a most beautiful sunset , the moon rising while the sky was still of the brightest pink with glimpses of turquoise blue , the trees and quaint cottages standing out in deep brown against it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our way to China , more than sorry to leave Japan , restful country of enchantment , land of courteous men and soft-voiced women . For months my ears still listened for the two most characteristic sounds in Japan ? the tap-tap of the little pipe as it is emptied before being refilled , and the mournful notes of the reed lute which the blind masseur plays as he walks through the village street .  |p607
