 | THE commercial invasion of England by America is now a household word from the Atlantic to the Pacific ; the artistic invasion receives very little attention from us . Yet the latter should , perhaps , please our vanity as much as the former , even though it may not do quite so much toward filling our pockets . The invasion of the London stage by American actresses and actors is the part of our attempt at foreign conquest along artistic lines which is most apparent to the British public . Yet London views its visitors so far only with pleasure and with no envy . There has been no serious disturbance of the theatrical labor market . Occasionally one hears an English actress laughingly protest that she can get no engagement because she has n't a New York reputation . But the Americans , although on the whole notably prominent , are still only a small part of the whole body of players , and the annual emigration of English actors and actresses to the United States to join permanently the ranks of American players more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and New York are becoming less and less two separate towns , and more and more places where the lover of the drama , be he English or American , can see all his favorites , whether he happens to lodge near Piccadilly or near Broadway . Yet it will take more than this mere interchange to account for the attitude of Americans toward English theatrical life . There are a certain number of Americans who began their career upon the London stage . and a greater number who , having once tasted the pleasures of English theatrical life , are unwilling to abandon it and return to their native land . An actor 's life in England is less nomadic than that of his American brother . For the man or woman in the higher ranks of the profession London is England . the provinces are comparatively unimportant . They have their theaters , of course , and a great number of provincial actors who are always hoping and longing for a London engagement . But once you have become a London actor , your visits to the provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through its run in the metropolis , then you go to another London theater and appear in a fresh piece . You do not , as in America , go on tour with the piece . That is usually relegated to a secondary company . Engagements in London are for " the run of the piece , " not for a season of forty weeks , as in America . This makes the life , perhaps , more precarious than in America , but it also makes it more varied , and it allows the actor to have a home in London . American players can have summer . holiday homes ; that is all . But the London actor can have a place of his own the year round , his own belongings , a place to bring up his children , and all the comforts that come from having one 's own kitchen and one 's own fireside . Furthermore he gets more practice in his art , because he has more different parts to play . The play is rare that runs a whole 26 THE AMERICAN INI'ASIOI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American would be occupied with one role a London actor plays many parts . Unquestionably this means more work and that great tedium of rehearsals which , although the public does not always realize it , is sometimes the greatest part of an actor 's toil . But as more work means more opportunity , this but adds to the attraction of the London stage for the American . One has only to begin the roll-call of American invaders to know the pleasant side of the London player 's life . If one wishes to see Mrs. Brown-Potter during the summer , one must go up the Thames to the delightful little village of Bray ? the home of the vicar of the celebrated song ? and there one will find the beautiful American in a long , low rambling house lying close by the river 's side , its rosecovered lawn sloping down to the very water 's edge . Nothing more delightfully rural could be imagined , yet it is only half an hour by train from London , and Mrs. Potter when she is playing can come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freshness . In winter she has a charming little house in town . In both she gathers about her the most interesting people of London , for Mrs. Potter has an exceptional position in the London world , both in fashionable and artistic society . No bazaar for a smart charity is organized without her helping hand , and no artistic gathering is complete unless she is present . Mrs. Potter may be said to be settled in England for good now . Indeed , if one stops to remember , she made her theatrical debut there in 1887 , at the Haymarket . Since then she has played all over the world ; everywhere , in fact , that the English language is spoken . Her last great success was as Miladi in Mr. Beerbohm Tree 's splendid production of " The Musketeers . " Mrs. Potter is renowned for her esprit , and the brilliance of her entertainments is not matched by those of any other actress . But her success may , without any disparagement of her talent , be said to be due also to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to her wonderful red hair . Indeed , it is pleasant to think that most of the American actresses in London uphold easily the national reputation for good looks . England has always admired the appearance of American women . This especial advantage may explain why our actresses have gone to London in greater number than our actors . Miss Maud Jeffries certainly has been helped rather than hindered by her beauty . No one who saw her as Mariamne in Mr.  | Stephen Phillips ' poetic tragedy " Herod " can ever forget that tall , slender figure which stood on the flight of golden steps leading to the palace . Had she been the merest amateur she would have been a succes de beaute . But Miss Jeffries is an admirable actress , both by instinct and by training ? one can not play the round of leading roles for Mr. Wilson Barrett for years without gaining an efficient command of the technique of one 's art . Miss Jeffries deserted America nearly eight years ago , when Mr. Barrett , on seeing her play , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has visited America in this capacity , and has even wandered as far afield as Australia . But her work has , on the whole , been in England , and up to a little more than a year ago always with Mr. Barrett . Then she appeared with Mr. Tree at Her Majesty 's Theater , and to him she went again last autumn . Miss Jeffries , the actress , may desert America , but Miss Jeffries , the daughter of Tennessee , does not . She always goes back in the summer , and in her old home near Memphis she may be found every year , delighting in familiar surroundings and gaining strength for the next year 's work . If you were to ask Miss Jeffries what had been the greatest help to her on the English stage , she would tell you it was the fact that she was " born and raised " in Tennessee . This means that she had naturally less of an " American accent , " and perhaps the hardest thing for an American girl who means to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak English English . " Britishers " have come to admire many things American , but we have never brought them to like our way of pronouncing the language . An American star , heading an American company and in London only temporarily , will receive from the public kindly toleration for her " accent . " But the girl who casts her fortunes with the regular London theaters , and who expects to appear constantly with English companies , must learn to assume their manner of speech . Off the stage she may talk as she likes , but on the stage she has no choice . The task is a little irritating to one 's native pride , and more than that , it is difficult . But the American achieves it , and our invaders in London produce , at least when behind the footlights , a perfect imitation of the original article . Miss Fay Davis , for example , would never be known as an American . Her stage career has been entirely in England . She was a public reader and reciter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage in 1895 , during a visit in England . She was a success at once , and received an offer from Mr. George Alexander 's company at the St. James 's Theater . A success in ' 95 , she was an enormous success in ' 97 , as Fay Zuliani in Mr. Pinero 's " The Princess and the Butterfly . " Since that time Miss Davis has been leading lady at the St. . James 's , having left it only last spring . Then Mr. Pinero chose her for his autumn comedy , and so wonderfully does  | he adapt part to actress and train actress for part that such a choice always means that the fortunate woman chosen is advanced several rungs higher on the ladder of fame . Mr. Pinero is in London the greatest maker of reputations . After the Pinero play it is said that Miss Davis is to go to the Lyceum to play with Sir Henry Irving the leading female Niles in plays in which Miss Terry does not appear . The condition of affairs at the St. James 's Theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy of English actresses . For not only was Miss Davis there , but Miss Julie Opp as well . Miss Opp is now on her second professional tour in America , but she comes to all intents and purposes as an English actress , whose career , dating from about the time of Miss Davis 's first appearance , has been wholly at the St. James 's . The story of Miss Opp 's early career , however , makes good " copy , " as she herself would have said at that period , and is proof in itself of her nationality . She was born in New York . and at the proper time , after the fashion of American girls , decided that she wanted to " do something . " This something was at first writing for the newspapers in New York . Then came a wish to go abroad , and to go on one 's own earn- ings . But it is always a problem to get a lump sum ahead . The solution was found by writing , with a friend , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman whose literary tastes are so tar away from blood-and-thunder melodrama would be amused to disinter from the files of The Fireside Companion " the story of " Effie , The Engineer 's Daughter " ? the title was very like that ; it is near enough for a literary investigator with a keen scent . On the proceeds of this " penny dreadful " Miss Opp ventured to London , and again did newspaper " specials . " Then she decided to try her fate on the stage , and presented herself , an utter novice , before Mr. Alexander and asked for an engagement . She got it . And the manager 's judgment was justified . Within two years Miss Opp returned to America to play . under Mr. Daniel Frohman 's direction , leading roles in " The Tree of Knowledge " and The Princess and the Butterfly . " And since then she has been an efficient member of the St. James 's company .  | Miss Suzanne Sheldon is another American actress whose career has been wholly on the London stage . She comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale athletes of the last ten years have known the name well through the successes f her brothers . Miss Sheldon s an eager student of music , when a very young girl went Germany to study . She was wake her debut as Elizabeth in " Tannhauser , " but at the very moment of the performance her voice broke , left her , and sever came back . After a while Miss Sheldon took herself and her belongings to London and secured a position in the Lyceum company . Here she gained her training under Irving , and leaving there two years ago she has since appeared in various London theaters , once supporting another American , Mr. Robert Taber , in Mr. Laurence Irving 's " Bonnie Dundee . " Miss Helen Macbath ? in private life , Mrs. Frank Mills ? has been well known to Londoners for the past few years as one of the most attractive of actresses in light farcical comedy , and her husband has earned for himself a solid position as a serious actor with Mrs. Patrick Campbell . Miss Gertrude Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the ablest and most popular of English  | actors , allied herself permanently with the English stage , and exchanged the simple ingenue roles which she used to play with Mr. Goodwin and her sister Miss Maxine Elliott for more ambitious Shakespearian parts . She first appeared in England in Mr. Clyde Fitch 's " The Cowboy and the Lady , " and English critics saw at once that for fresh and simple girlishness both of appearance and manner there was almost no one in London to be compared with her . So she was induced to stay behind when her sister left for America , and to create the role of the Princess in " A Royal Family . " And that sort of character soon became known in theatrical circles as " a Gertrude Elliott part . " Miss Elliott had , in short , assumed a position of her own . Mr. Nat Goodwin and his wife Miss Maxine Elliott are in London for a year . They may fairly be called " invaders . " Nothing can be told the American public about them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackwood , their English home on Shooters ' Hill in the outskirts of London , do not do justice to the picturesqueness and comfort of the place nor to the amazing way in which , though only a half-hour from Charing Cross , it manages to seem in a remote rural region . Miss Edna May might almost be called an English actress now . No success in America can ever quite equal her triumph in London as " The Belle of New York . " And she finds life in London pleasanter than touring in America was , and a house in St. John 's Woods nicer than even the best of our American hotels . Miss May 's accent has become British and her clothes have a London look . But for all that she would class herself among the invaders . So would her sister , Miss Jane May . Miss Ella Snyder has now returned to America , but from the moment of the success of The Belle of New York " she ryas a London favorite . Miss Madge Lessing , whose " Rosey Posey " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still keeps London whistling , seems in danger of yielding to the fatal fascination of London . Her dainty beauty proved most attractive , and she need never come back to America for lack of offers there . Miss Beverley Sitgreaves will be remembered in America , perhaps , especially in connection with the Yokes Company , but she is now better known in London . Mrs. Langtry induced her to go to England , and there she has stayed , acting successfully in many a London production , making for herself a distinct place in South Africa , where she has made several successful tours , and last of all playing in the English theater which was started in Paris last spring to give English plays to which a jeune fille might be taken with propriety and pleasure and at which she might also learn the language . Miss Sitgreaves is also rather celebrated for imitations of Madame Bernhardt , photographic in accuracy . Mention of the great French actress leads one to speak of her most intimate friend in London , a young American actress , Miss Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | who started under Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum . In London musical pieces there are usually many pretty Americans in the chorus , and often in more important roles . A revival of an old American piece The Whirl of the Town " has stolen from the Gaiety two American girls , Miss Sara Miskel , whose sister was the well-remembered and beautiful Caroline Miskel-Hoyt , and Miss Marion Draughn . But the Gaiety has captured in turn Miss Eva Kelly , who is now playing in " The Toreador . " And as pieces at the Gaiety usually reckon their runs by years , one may accuse her of being an expatriate . Mr. Robert Taber is apparently lost to America . He first came before the London public when he played with Sir Henry Irving as Alexis in Mr. Laurence Irving 's " Peter the Great " and as Macduff in " Macbeth . " Almost at once Mr. Taber established a position for himself in London . He played with Mr. Tree , and won golden opinions from the critics . He played the leading male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a season of his own , when he produced magnificently Mr. Laurence Irving 's " Bonnie Dundee . " Mr. Taber is recognized as one of the most finished and scholarly actors in London . Mr. Paul Arthur is so well-known in London as a jeune premier that most people have forgotten that he is an American . And doubtless few people realize Mr. Holbrook Blinn 's nationality . They are both settled as fixtures in London . The American invasion began long ago . It holds for the London lover of the stage some glorious memories ; the names of Mary Anderson and Ada Rehan alone suffice to recall to him what America has given him . Lotta , though she did not make a popular success , is still a vivid memory to the critical and theatrical world . Barrymore is remembered , and Richard Mansfield . And while the memory of " Secret Service " is still fresh there , Mr. Gillette has brought " Sherlock Holmes " out in London . The American invasion is a good thing . It helps our national reputation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them all back again some time .
