txt The Rev. Dr. W. Merle Smith . President of the Church Extension Committee of the Presbyterian Church of New York , who was Introduced as the man who has collected $360,000 in nine years for the carrying on of the work of the committee , added $115,773 to this amount last night as the result of half an hour 's talk at a mass meeting of the congregations of the New York Presbyterian churches , held in the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church , Fifty-fifth Street and Fifth Avenue . When Dr. Smith began his talk he said it was his fondest hope that $100,000 would be raised . Hardly any one believed this could be accomplished . The night was most unpropitious , and the great edifice was not well filled . During the singing of one of Sankey 's favorite hymns the collection was taken . Then came the announcement of the result . The collection was taken in the form of pledges . The first to be handed in caused the congregation to applaud mildly . It was one of $250 from a worshipper at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledges Dr. Smith halted a moment . " Listen to this , " he exclaimed , " $50,000 from a magnificent woman of the Madison Square Church . " All present showed their appreciation as has scarcely ever been shown in a church before . By this time it was morally certain that the $100,000 mark would be passed , and Dr. Smith went on : " Yes , this magnificent woman promised us $50 , - 000 if we could raise another $50,000 . " In quick succession were read out pledges of $25,000 from the Brick Church , and two of $10,000 ; one from the Madison Avenue Church and the other from the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church . The next in size were $5,000 from the Madison Avenue Church , $2,500 from the Brick ChinJeh , and $1,000 also from the same church . The Brick Church also had the distinction of sending in the smallest pledge , which was for 25 cents . Perhaps of the hundred , or more pledges handed in , the two receiving the most tangible appreciation from the congregation were $5 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stallan  --  Mission . The speakers were the Rev. Dr. William R. Richards , pastor of the Brick Church ; the Rev. Dr. H. Sloane Coffin , pastor of the Madison Avenue Church , and Vice President of the committee ; the Rev. Dr. George Alexander , Moderator of the Presbytery of New York , and the Rev. Dr. Fullerton , Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbytery of the United States . Dr. Richards spoke of the recent celebration of the centennial of independence of the first three Presbyterian churches of this city . In dealing with the work of church extension he urged all to remember that any church needed help to get started , and that was the object of their committee . He.reminded them how over 200 years ago the City Fathers had given them property downtown on which their first church was built at the nominal rent of ? 40 a year . and that a - few years ago the city had let them sell this land for $200,000 , with which they built their first brick church , which accounted for the name " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ! mow that at the time the city gave them the land Trinity Church gave them the money to build a parsonage on it . These gifts , he said . formed the first step in the work of Presbyterian Church7extension . The Rev. Dr. Coffin bewailed the fact that this is not a churchly age . He thought that perhaps they were partly to blame for this in not making the Presbyterian Church in New York the factor it should be . Wealthy people , while subscribing largely to outside institution 's , seemed to overlook the Church . Some gave it as a reason that they thought institutions such as the Salvation Army , the Young Men 's Christian Association , and social settlements did the work better . But while there was a certain element of truth in this , he said , where would these institutions have been but for the fact that the workers in them had been educated in the Church of Jesus Christ ? He urged all to help on the work of church extension , as on this in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then again , said Dr : Coffin , others held back because they thought they were compelled to believe a lot of unbelievable things , the " antiquated cradle prescription , " he called it , but , he said , " we never ask anything more than this , ' Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour ' ? " Seated in the gallery was a delegation about 100 strong from the Northminster Church . 141 West 115th Street , of which the Rev. William P. Shriver is pastor . Dr. Smith referred to Northminster as a five-year-old child . At his call the delegation stood up . Some carried flags and others banners , while about twenty young men were dressed in khaki uniforms . Mr. Shriver , from the gallery , told of the work of his church , and of the help received from the Church Extension Committee at the beginning . When he had finished Dr. Shriver caused a laugh by saying that there had been a spiritual revival held recently on the Northminster Church led by a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary . " She is a crackerjack of a missionary ; one of the finest , ' said Dr. Smith . " so fine that Mr. Shriver went and married her . " Other delegations were made to stand up and tell the progress they were making , and how in many cases , with financial help , their work could be so greatly augmented . At the close of the meeting Dr. Smith was asked to make known the names of the principal givers at the collection , but he said he had given his word that all , from the largest to the smallest , should remain anonymous
