I consider it a happy chance that delayed my visit to the Exhibition of Flemish Primitives at Bruges until it is on the point of closing . Otherwise , I could not have come to it fresh from the Exhibition of Modern Art at Ghent , which did not open until the very end of August . If , as Fromentin says , all Belgium is a magnificent " art-book , " to which the work of the Primitives is the preface , then the work of the men of to-day is the last chapter completed up to the present , and often a preface is best understood after the book has been read to the end The Exhibition at Ghent is the one which is held there by a Society of Artists every three years . This autumn , its opening had the further interest of inaugurating the new Museum built for the town by the Government and the Municipality , whose patronage of art in Belgium is something more than an empty form . Artists can not in reason complain of authorities who appropriate money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exhibitions The new building is admirably adapted to the purpose the rooms well-proportioned , well-lighted , and decorated with a sobriety and restraint I scarcely ventured to look for in a country where the encouragement of the now almost worn-out fashion of " L'Art Nouveau " has been most active . The collection is ordered on broad international lines , but , naturally , Belgian artists are in the majority , and there could be no better opportunity for the study of modern Belgian art . For this reason , and also because I have already written of many of the pictures from foreign artists when these were shown at home , I shall say nothing of the foreign sections , except that they illustrate one of the most promising tendencies of the day ? the tendency , that is , in international exhibitions , to honor , not work that bears the official hallmark , but work that reveals a distinct personality or character At Ghent , the preference has been less for the approved Academician than for the various groups of independents  --  the men who belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the International Society in London The present all but universal revolt against the academical is the more hopeful because it is leading to a general appreciation of individuality rather than to fanatical " movements " and self-conscious " schools " When it comes to Belgian artists as they are seen at Ghent , I should say that the chief characteristic of their work is its realism . There are men , like M. Claus and M. Buysse , who accept this realism frankly , others , like M Khnopff , who struggle against it , plunge into depths of mysticism , and  --  remain realists in spite of themselves . M Claus is a painter of world-wide reputation , and his methods are well known He has been influenced by M Monet and French Impressionism , he seeks instinctively the more brilliant , almost brutal effects in nature , and he evidently thinks that respect for nature demands that the painter should accept her as she is . If the landscape before him compose , well and good ; if not , it is not his business to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Verger en Flandres , " shows at once his strength and his weakness It is designed on a large scale , adapted to exhibition walls . In a pleasant orchard two peasants are gathering apples , the low sun shines full on their faces , and on the pink wall of a house beyond , seen between the trees . Nothing could be more uncompromising than the fierce glow of the sunlight on the autumn afternoon when the painter sat down resolutely to transfer it to his canvas , except perhaps his own attitude towards it He has not attempted to supply the emotion which the special effect before him did not provide , nor the grace of line , the harmony of masses that did not happen to exist in this corner of the orchard . He is the impartial reporter , summing up with vigor and ability , but quite dispassionately , the facts as he sees them ; and the result is a brilliant record which may astound and dazzle you by its brilliancy , but at which you can look no longer than you would at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rule , it is in just such effects , which , if the most daring , are the least emotional , that he is interested But so conscientious is he in his realism that , if he does find himself face to face with nature in her softer moods , he softens in his turn . I have never seen a better picture by him than the much smaller " Canards au Couchant , " also here , in which he is ' all tenderness simply because he chanced upon thet'tender hour when the last pale gold of evening fades from the sky , and , in all its subtle gradation , reflects itself in the quiet stream where the ducks are swimming homeward I had not thought M. Claus could express sentiment so delicately . It is the same with M. Buysse He also aims at an accurate report ; he also seems to prefer instinctively the more brilliant aspects of the country he loves , though his very accuracy at times forces him into an unlooked-for betrayal of emotion . The contrast is as striking between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree-lined canal in a glare of sunlight , a red sail and its reflection filling the centre of the canvas with a sudden violence of color that leaves you cold and indifferent ; the other , of apparently the same canal , but now silent and deserted , its waters vague and mysterious in their dim blueness under the twilight sky . To both these men , as to M Monet , nature is sometimes kind , and lavishes upon them the beauty of composition and tone and feeling they might think it an infidelity to invent . They have many followers , to describe whose work would be but to repeat what I have just said of theirs  --  painters who are realists , if the word means anything at all , or who , probably , in the art slang of a few years ago , would call themselves naturalists M Khnopff 's realism is much less obvious , enveloped as it is in a cloak of symbolism The subjects of his two pictures hero are characteristic . In one , " L'Encens , " a lady with pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysticism , holds in her long gloved hands what seems to be a sacramental vessel . In the other , " L'Isolement " ( a triptych ) , a youth in armor , the flame and lily and bubble ( M. Khnopff 's favorite symbols ) at his feet , stands between two vague , enigmatic figures , which , to so unmystical a person as myself , mean nothing but the more easily understood beauty of drawing and color and detail which M. Khnopff always manages to bring to his most mystical designs . And it is just because M. Khnopff can not quite repress his joy in the actual  --  in the draperies , the Jewels , the flowers  --  that his pictures have such charm . One of the most typical examples of this contradiction in him is a picture he was showing in London last spring There were in it two divisions The upper and larger was so overladen with symbolism that it has completely faded from my memory ; the lower contained an exquisite but literal rendering of architecture and water , a bit of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the little landscape seen through an open window in a picture by Hemline . M. Khnopff , as well as M Claus and M. Buysse , has his followers ; but what I have said of him is true , in a lesser degree , of them , so that there is no need just now to examine their work separately Indeed , the only two other Belgians who seemed to me to have something to express , beside the prevailing formulas of the day , are M. Mersens , who paints peasants and peasant life with an exaggeration of truth that borders on caricature , but with rare keenness of observation , and M. Delaunois , whose landscapes , though he travels to the " Pays Monastique " for a popular peg to hang them on , depend for their beauty on their light and atmosphere . Both of these men will do still better things  --  or , at least , they ought to . It may at first seem paradoxical when I say that M. Khnopff and M Claus , the two most representative modern Belgians conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Memlinc , the two most representative Primitive Flemings conspicuous at Bruges , though , because of technical conditions and passing modes , they differ so entirely in their manner of expression . Most people , struck by the difference , overlook the underlying sympathy . Certainly , the opportunity for study has been as ample at Bruges as at Ghent . A collection could not well be more exhaustive . Innumerable public and private galleries , not only in Belgium , but in England , France , Germany , and even so remote a country as Transylvania , have lent their treasures Bruges itself , for the interval , has stripped the Museum and the old Hospital of St. John of the masterpieces that have made them famous Perhaps the one notable omission is the " Miraculous Lamb " at Ghent , the picture by both the Van Eyeks that Durer described as " a most precious and important painting . " Of it nothing is shown but the Adam and Eve panels that were separated out of prudery from the central design and long since found an asylum at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the walls . I must admit that the first effect of all these " cock-eyed Madonnas " and angular saints hanging together is appalling No pictures gain by being seen in a gallery , but those by the Primitives suffer most acutely . In their days , artists were forced to paint the same subjects , and , what is worse , to paint them in the same way It has been argued lately by an ingenious critic that this was an advantage to them , that their imagination , instead of spending itself in the search for motives , was concentrated on the interpretation in line and color and form of a limited number of glYen themes But at Bruges I was convinced  --  if I needed conviction  --  that they were hampered by the conventions imposed upon them . In every picture of genuine , and not merely historical , merit , I found passages that seemed to me so many protests against the limits set by the exacting patron . The most distinguished masters , no less than the most second-rate craftsmen , were made to paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in glory , saints in the agony of martyrdom  --  in a word , the heaven and hell they had never known  --  when what they wanted was to paint the people about them and the country they did know . For you can not look at their pictures and not see that they themselves were as vowed to realism as M Claus , though they were driven into the struggle against it which M Khnopff has accepted voluntarily . Take one after the other , beginning with the Van Eycks ( though the collection begins with the still more archaic Primitives ) . Turn to Jan Van Eyck 's altar-piece from the Bruges Museum , a Virgin and Child with saints and the donor , Canon van de Fadle , grouped on either side in the approved manner of the day , Virgin and saints are but lay models , posed symmetrically , compared to that old man , kneeling piously , who no doubt had given Van Eyck all the sittings he asked for , and who could be portrayed faithfully , without idealization , and yet the painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What character m the broad , ugly face , clean-shaven , furrowed and lined , intelligent m its heaviness  --  a face you still see often in Belgium , even under the cap and above the blue blouse of the discontent ed Belgian workman ! And again , what character , what beauty in the portrait of the painter 's wife , with her prim head-dress and demurely folded hands ! Van Eyck was most at home , not in the heavenly company to which the Church would have confined him , but with just such men and women as these . Did he ever give to any Madonna the splendor of that little group of man and wife in the London National Gallery ? The Van Eyeks are comparatively few , but it will be long , if ever , before such a series by Memlinc is brought together in one gallery again . It makes you marvel the more that so great a master should have been for years forgotten , even if it explains that his greatness depends less upon the sincerity of faith , the earnestness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberally endowed by their admirers , than upon the honesty of his realism . He never seems happier , never more wholly himself , than when he escapes from the incense-laden church or shrine into the open country , if only for a momentary glimpse , as in the diptych from the Hospital of St. John , where the window beyond the kneeling donor frames a haunting little vision of green fields , winding road , and blue hills , or when he leaves his Virgin and Saints to study a human face like that which looks out of you from the amazingly painted white veil in the " Sibylla Sambetha . " Had Memlinc had his way , the world would not have waited for Claude to create the art of landscape painting , or for Velasquez to make the men and women in a portrait stand upon their legs From Roger van der Weyden I received much the same impression . The very altar-pieces that have been praised for their emotional quality showed , I thought , something very like lassitude when compared to the alert interest manifested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the design , the observation so just and sympathetic ' And so with Gerard David , a painter whose list of pictures , though hardly his reputation , is fast growing with the present trade in " attributions " Two of his most important are the well-known " Baptism of Christ " from the ' Bruges , and the " Blessed Virgin Surrounded by Angels " from the Rouen , Museum It is in the first that he is most satisfactory , with its groups of the donor and the donor 's two wives and children , arranged , it is true , according to the usual formula , but the character of each member of the large family so well realized , and the amusing detail of costume rendered with such obvious pleasure , that it would help you to understand , if you did not already , why these old painters were ready to make a prominent place for the donor , any and everywhere , in the very holy of holies if necessary . In the Rouen picture , the Virgin and her attendants , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife who stand respectfully behind them , but in whose faces is the breath of life . With Mabuse , also , what charm there is must be sought in his portraits , welcome relief as they are after his mannered Virgins and Saints . And I might go on through the catalogue , until the struggle for realism culminates in Peter Breughel and the picture , painted with something of humor , but something of reverence as well , of a Flemish Bethlehem , where little Flemish children are sliding on the ice-bound canals , and hustling Flemish villagers are busy about many things , while Mary and Joseph seek their lodgings for the night . It is this aspect of their work that has most interested me in the exhibition of Primitives . I know there are many other ways of considering the collection . For the historian of Flemish art , it affords a chance that would have gone far to lighten the labors of Crowe and Cavalcaselle . To the scientific critic , it is a challenge which already he has accepted with enthusiasm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results that make you wonder the more at the generosity of- owners in lending them to exhibitions where they are exposed to such risks . But art does not depend for its value on history or science . True , the collection teaches nothing new of individual works from this standpoint . Indeed , many are not seen to such advantage as in the church or on the walls where the artist meant they should be seen  --  the reason why not one tells so well as the St. Ursula series on the shrine for which Hemline designed it . But , on the other hand , certain qualities which all these painters shared , certain points upon which they differed , are emphasized , and early Flemish art , as a whole , is better understood . This is why I , at least , have come away with a heightened sense of their inborn realism , regretting the loss which the restraint put upon them has meant to the world . They would have envied , these old masters , the freedom in the choice of subject allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flemish art has been to maintain its independence in spite of the chains and claims of religion and fashion .
