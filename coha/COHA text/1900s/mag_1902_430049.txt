THE amount estimated as necessary for the payment of our pensions for the coming fiscal year is $138,500,000 . As compared with the appropriation for the present year , this sum shows an estimated decrease of $5,500,000 . Compared with the pension expenditures of other governments , as based on the figures of the last two years , it is more than double the total of all of them put together . The magnitude of our pension scheme is an obvious indication of the liberality of our laws . Their liberality as regards the title of claimants , as well as the conditions under which pensions are paid , can be more fully comprehended by considering the requirements and restrictions which attach to the pensions paid by the United States and those paid by other governments . Practically , there are military pension systems in all countries . Occasionally , they are closely connected with provisions for civil pensions . In Italy the two plans are inseparable . In the first place , there are few countries in which the regulations under which applications may be filed are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain refuses to entertain any application from an officer for a pension for a wound unless he applies within five years after receiving the wound ; in Japan the maximum time is three years and in Switzerland one year from the time the disability was incurred . Switzerland , furthermore , pensions for one year only , the application being " reconsidered " at the end of each year . Very different from these requirements are those of the pension law of the United States , with no limitation as to the time of application , no term pensions , and no annual examinations . A Civil War soldier is fully at liberty to seek a pension to-day for wounds or disability incurred in 1862 ; and if he can trace the origin of a disability to his army service , the pension is granted , although for forty years he has failed to make any claim on the government for assistance . It may be that the applicant is occupying a remunerative federal position ; if so , that fact will not be considered in adjudicating the claim or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension is suspended during the time of  | government employment . In this country the pension roll has included members of the Cabinet and of Congress . In case the pensioner desires to leave his country , either permanently or for a term of years , how is such a departure looked upon by the various governments ? Under the law of Servia such a pensioner ceases to receive aid from the government . The Argentine Republic pays him for two months only . In Peru the right to a pension is forfeited if the beneficiary remain abroad two years . France , Austria , and Greece permit residence abroad by express consent of the government only . England requires pensioners to obtain leave to go outside the country , and provides for a reduction of the pension after three years ' absence , with its entire forfeiture if the pensioner is under fifty years of age : between the ages of fifty and eighty the pension may be commuted . With the exception of a law that was in operation from 1893 to 1895 , the United ' States has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Last year this government paid $641,161.65 to 4,547 pensioners residing in foreign countries . All systems , of course , prescribe certain conditions , a violation of which will bar the right to a pension . Prominent among these conditions in many governments is imprisonment or other punishment for crime . Great Britain , Austria , Servia , Germany , Portugal , Greece , and Japan have provisions to this effect . In Switzerland , imprisonment for a term exceeding one year suspends the pension . In the United States , the only approach to a loss of pension on account of imprisonment is the provision , by the act of August 8 , 1882 , that , during a pensioner 's imprisonment for an offence against the law , his pension may be paid to his needy wife or minor children . In the absence of such dependents he can draw his pension or can let it accumulate during his incarceration . The pensions granted by the United States to widows are contingent upon their good behavior , and this is very generally the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , for instance , in Peru , where the widow loses her pension if she abandons her children during their minority . In the United States she would lose simply the additional amount given for the minors . When we consider the subject of children 's pensions , we approach the one phase of the general pension scheme in which the United States is not remarkable for its generosity . This government pays the pensions of minor children , male and female alike , only until they attain the age of sixteen years . The one exception is the case of permanently disabled and helpless children , whose pensions continue dur- ing disability . Switzerland and Russia have similar provisions as to permanent pensions for helpless children . As regards the age limit for orphans not helpless , the former country pays them until eighteen , while the latter pays boys until they reach their majority and girls until they marry . The laws of several countries seem to be based on the idea that the female children should receive government assistance until they enter the married state . Peru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . Italy goes still further , paying a dowry to daughters of soldiers at the time of marriage if they are minors . The latter is a unique provision , but others equally odd may be found upon examination . For example , Servia , apparently offering a bonus to widows remarrying , has a law commuting the pensions of such widows to an amount equal to two years ' payment , which they receive fifteen days after the second marriage . In Greece an application for pensions must be . made to the Minister of War ; but if that official fails to act in two months , the applicant may appeal , under certain conditions , to the courts . In Roumania , also , pension controversies are settled by the courts . In this country appeals from the action of the Commissioner of Pensions are made to the Assistant Secretary of the Interior , and the courts would not attempt to grant a pension which the Department had refused . Great Britain stipulates that dependent mothers must be widows ; but in the United States , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a woman pensioned as a dependent mother has been at the same time the wife of a man drawing an invalid pension . In Servia the pension of a widow is contingent upon her need and upon the fact that her soldier husband was her only support . Great Britain does not pension widows if they are in receipt of an income or salary constituting " wealthy circumstances . " English pensioners are dropped from the roll for failure to draw their pensions for four successive quarters . In the United States the statute of limitations is three years . Italy , Austria , and Chili pay their pensioners monthly . The latter requires that every four months widows , daughters , and mothers file proof of their non-marriage . Germany pays monthly in advance , Great Britain pays quarterly in advance , while the United States pays quarterly , but never in advance . The purpose of this article has been to show by . comparison the generosity of the United States to its soldiers and sailors and their families . The subject of pension legislation has been touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the acts of Congress would be another matter . - not so much of comparison as of principle .  |
