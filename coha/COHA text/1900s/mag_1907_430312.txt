NOT long ago ? less than two years , in fact ? a woman was mightily bothered over a question of curtains . She had a good eye for line and color , but no more artists training than such as comes incidentally to the wife of an artist who is also his comrade . The bother was not a new one . Indeed , it had begun years before , when the pair were owners of a quaint suburban cottage , into which nothing fitted except things artistically " good " ? and frightfully expensive . There had been changes since , other changes impended . The lady meant them to be changes for the better , but how to compass that was a problem . By way of solving it , she clipped deeply into the art publications , more especially the English ones . In them she was struck by the frequent mention of stencil decorations , and the still more frequent advertisements of stencilers . There were , it appeared , folk ready and waiting to stencil anything for you ? walls , draperies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make special stencils to order . There were also stencil directions , the same as have appeared in American periodicals . They read so delightfully , and sounded so easy that the lady made up her mind forthwith to undertake some of the work .  | She would have curtains of soft cream stuff , warranted to fall in the folds her soul longed for , and , as a border , a bold pattern in deep , rich hues . But the experiment did not turn out as she had hoped . The stencil was merely pretty , not bold , nor dignified , nor striking , and the results of using it were a bit blotchy and smeary . Moreover , in using it , she had become painfully aware of the paper stencil 's limitations . It had to have " bridges , " therefore long sweeping lines were impossible ; further , the colors left something to be desired , in that they ran , in spite of steaming and pressing . She wanted something quite different ? something that would stand sun , rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would do that , if properly prepared , but oil colors demanded another sort of stencil . She took counsel with her husband . The result was encouraging . " No reason in the world why you should not have a metal stencil , except that the making is apt to be troublesome , " said the man of art .. " Then you wo n't need to bother with a single bridge ; besides , one good stencil will make curtains for a whole community . Promise me you wo n't make them for quite all our friends . You know that I like a change now and then . " Smiling , the lady dutifully promised . She had got what she wanted , also an idea of something else . Soon she had secured her metal stencil ? a splendid , dashy pattern , drawn directly upon the metal sheet , then cut out , thus keeping strictly the individual note of the designer . A little later her evolution from the common or garden variety of stencil was showing that it was able to work revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial . She got in touch with the arts and crafts movement , and found a market for more than all the work she could do . With the stenciling she has combined hand work ? sewn hems , and artistic splotches of color matching the stencil , put in with mercerized cottons . At first she used colored wools , but they did not launder well . And it is the crowning glory of this new stenciling that it comes  | out of the wash absolutely unharmed . This , of course , when it is upon washable material . Silk mull , to which it has been successfully applied , would perhaps demand a French cleaner . The lady , Mrs. Lora Elizabeth Hencke , of West Twenty-third street , tells most entertainingly of her beginnings , and her subsequent experiences . Her process she , of course , in a measure , keeps to herself , as she has refused thousands for the special secrets of it . But she does not mind saying that she uses only oil colors , specially prepared . In the preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stenciling takes twenty-four hours to dry . A wonderful thing is that it stays wholly upon the surface ; the wrong side shows perfectly blank . This makes possible the double-faced curtain , which , like much else in the business , came into being to meet a special need . A rich woman , who was fascinated with a certain pair of portieres , laid them down at last with a sigh , saying : " I could not bear to ruin them with colored linings , and two pairs in the door would be quite too heavy . Yet I do n't think perfectly plain Russian crash would look well in the library ? these would hang between the library and the living room . So I shall have to let them alone , much as I want them . " This the dealer astutely reported to the curtain maker . It set her first thinking , then working . Within three days she had sent the dealer a sample curtain , stenciled on both sides with entirely different patterns , each perfect . More than . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stenciling was done upon Russian crash , three of the narrow breadths making up each portiere . The breadths are never seamed together , only caught lightly at intervals , where the blocks of colored embroidery appear on the selvedges . In the double-faced curtain the selvedges were still free , but they lapped one on the other , for an inch , thus showing only the embroidery in harmony with the pattern . It is quite needless to add that the first cause of them , as soon as she saw the sample , ordered several pairs . " But , oh , I was green in the beginning , " the inventor says , smiling . " Astonishingly green , to have lived so long in New York . I was out one day on a hunt for striking curtain stuff . I had just made and sold , I think , a dozen pairs , and felt very important . In one of the big upholstery houses I heard that a new hotel was in the market for summer curtains . There was my chance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressman could take them , I had some of my curtains up there , along with a letter , in my loftiest ,  | most careless style , though I really wanted dreadfully to make the sale . They would want , as I reckoned , at least twenty pairs of curtains , so when they asked me , by telephone , to call and see about the matter , I trod on air . Judge what I felt when the person in authority said , with suave brevity : ' We like your sample fairly well . Can you furnish us twenty thousand feet of the stuff in the next two weeks ? ' If only he had said the next two years ' ! I shall always be proud of myself for not running away right straight off . I managed to look decently meditative , and tell him I 'd let him know next day . Next day ? Well , I had a sudden call to the coun try ? a real life saver . I let the gentleman know it , so he could count me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or nearly all of it . But if I had set all my girls at it , those who do the hemming , and put in the colored blocks , we could n't have got through before Christmas , even supposing we had been lucky enough to find that amount of crash exactly matching . " I 'm certainly not modest about my work , " the lady goes on . " Neither , I hope , over-confident . But it seems to me we are just at the beginning of such things . The English are fifty years ahead of us in applying stenciling , and ' way , ' way behind us in doing the work itself . As I see it , the field for artistic stenciling is limitless . Before long I hope to have the most famous decorative artists drawing directly on the metal for me . They have seen the work and know that the reproductions will do them as much credit as the originals . You can stencil anything , from a floor , or ceiling , to a candle-shade . Frocks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite of hand-woven natural linen , made perfectly plain , with a stenciled border on skirt and coat ? Washing wo n't hurt it . It irons to admiration , ever so much better than braid or lace . Then , at a moderate cost , you can have things individual ? your own copyrighted stencils if you want them . I have stenciled pretty well every sort of stuff between silk or India mull , and the roughest basket weaves of canvas and crash . Burlap stencils beautifully . Look at this screen . It matches the walls of a library . The panels are of the same green burlap , fastened with brass-headed nails . I 'd like it better if the panels were single , stenciled on each side , with eyelets or rings in color at the edges to slip over copper nail-heads in a polished wood frame . But this is stouter , and less expensive ? you see , it is the usual threefold pattern with sixfoot panels . It will be stenciled to match the draperies which are already in place . The sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big library  | table . For the pillows and scarf , I used art sateen and art crash . For table covers , round or square , there is nothing I like so well as the ' heavy hand-made linen in natural tint . I have yet to see the color that does not show up well on it . It is the same with crash , especially Russian crash . Any firm linen makes good table scarfs , or piano scarfs . Couch covers are best made of something wide , firmly woven and of good weight . Denim answers , but there are better things . It is curious , but red comes up badly on stuffs of brownish tones , especially if they are very rough . But the brown things throw up green and blue , and all tones of orange , even burnt orange , and green-and-blue , admirably . The lotus pattern , which I love , though far from being the best seller , done with leaves and stalks in green , flowers in dull blue , is wonderfully striking on anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept the patterns rather bold and striking . Dashy is a better word . Yet I myself like best the delicate designs . The buying public disagrees with me . It will none of my choice delights , so as I am not in the field to reform its artistic taste , I give it what it wants . Festoony things have sold best of all , but nothing ' has fallen flat . The poppy pattern , and the cluster of peonies , both hit folk who dote on mission furniture , and very hard . But it seems to me my curtains and things , are honest and simple and dignified enough to fit in anywhere with other things really good . There is no pretense about them , no imitation . Therefor they are cheap , though not low-priced . " This same sort of stenciling is admirable for walls . Even in a rented house , it could be done on cloth , and applied , and removed the same as costly tapestry . And the great thing about it is , it can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or individual notion . The Flying Dutchman proves that . One clay a yacht ownersaid to my friendly dealer : ' I 'd give a lot to get draperies showing the Flying Dutchman , but that , I suppose , is out of the question . ' ' Oh , I do n't know , ' said the dealer . ' Drop in again early next week . ' ' When the yachtsman did drop in , there was the Flying Dutchman ready for him . I am glad it was ready ? not that I expect ever to have a big sale of Flying Dutchmen , but because in making it we got new ideas of our process 's possibilities See the long sweeping lines of it , and how every detail of mast and spar comes out . It may be a tour de force ; it is certainly a mighty fine sample . We put it on sail canvas simply to show what we could do with that material .  | For a clubhouse ? can you fancy anything better for a yacht clubhouse ? The stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not missionary work , but straight business . Still , it pleases me to think that , in a way , my stenciling will help folks to a taste for the really good things . The cant of certain socalled art circles has made plenty of excellent people believe that a thing to be artistic ' is bound to be ugly ; and conversely , that simple beauty , and the appreciation of it , is altogether Philistine . Now , that is all wrong . The best art is merely an approach to the best nature . But nothing can be readily artistic that is not in keeping with its purpose . Make things as beautiful as possible , leaving them first and foremost the beauty of use . Pleasure , however derived , whether through eyes , or ears , or the other senses , is an excellent tonic . A room can rest and refresh you , as it also can rise up violently and oppress you . I find the restful things are those that melt into the picture , not those that so assert themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I get time , I shall stencil myself a frock and a parasol . The frock has been ready and waiting this ever so long . I have not yet tried a lamp shade . If I did , I think I should do medallions to be inset in a frame of hammered brass . My process , I know , can be used for anything ; but for a while I shall stick to the bigger ones , save in the way of experiment . You ca n't think how fascinating it is , nights when sleep is coy , to lie thinking of new stuffs , new patterns , new color combinations , and to get up in the morning to search for them . I love my work enough not to mind even the rush times when I get up at 5 o'clock in the morning , and am at it until 10 at night . That does not last , of course , else I should break down . I have had all along the biggest possible advantage in the fact that my husband 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and color niceties . Whenever I have been perplexed , he was there to help me . But he will have it that he has clone nothing at all , the work is wholly mine . I say it is n't anybody 's actually , but the result of fortuitous chance . However that may be , I am glad to have it in hand . I would not sell out for less than a great many thousand dollars ; but if anybody else , by reading of this , is moved to do something of almost the same sort , I shall be mighty glad . The world needs all the beautiful things that all of us , working together , can make . " As I go on , I expect to find out other things quite as desirable as the doublefacing . That is really mach bigger than it looks . Plenty of people who would like the looks of the stenciling inside would  | object to having their windows show blank . Of course , if they put the stenciling next the glass , the public would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only show where the light struck through , and then not too clearly . Now , whoever chooses can make windows beautiful within and without . And that is a great point . All of us , whether or no we admit it , do such a lot because of other people 's eyes . I think I shall put out a curtain stenciled boldly on one side , with either a few scattered figures or else a running border on the other , and see how it takes . But for a long , long time , I expect to do mostly ordered things , specially designed . " It is a liberal education in fabrics and fibers to study the store room of the stenciler . She has on the shelves almost every manner of stuff to which a stencil pattern can be hopefully applied . The stencils themselves are something uncanny ? they seem skeletons of color and bloom . For the most part they have a flower motif ? poppy , or lotus , or wistaria , or hollyhock , or peony , or tulip , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnified . Then there are the set of patterns ? festoons , garlands , truelove knots , and all their tribe , not to name Greek ornaments . All are cut from shining sheets of copper or steel . They must needs be kept flat to be kept safe , so the giants among them repose , when out of use , under the rugs of the living room . For the work is all home work . Mrs. Hencke is an admirable housekeeper , and a more than notable cook . It is doubtful if any success would make up to her for going outside her home . It is a home bespeaking its artist makers , full of pictures , casts , bits of pottery , and precious litter , with dull green walls , and big dull green chairs that invite to ease . It has one single anachronism , which the mistress points out with a light-hearted laugh . " Think of preaching the gospel of good curtains , " she says , " with bobbinet insertion disfiguring your own windows . But never mind , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , I ca n't afford to hang up anything but the very best I can do . And I have n't done it ? not yet . " Whether or no that is prophesy , time alone can tell . This much is certain , her present best marks a notable advance in the field of interior decoration .  |
