txt THE HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES . A Young Couple Seek Counsel of Older Heads . I am addressing you with the hope that some of your experienced readers may be prompted to comment on the practicability of matrimony on $35 a week , with fairly reasonable prospects of advancement on the part of the one contemplating the step . As a working basis , the following weekly apportionment was considered : Rent , $10 ; household expenses , $10 ; wife 's allowance , $5 ; husband 's allowance , $5 ; contingencies or rainy day fund , $5 . The household expenses are not supposed to cover the cost of fitting up a home , but are intended to provide for living and incidental charges . The writer is reasonably sure that $5 will cover carfare , lunch money and clothing requirements for himself , but he is in doubt as to whether a woman can provide for her personal wants at the same figure .
