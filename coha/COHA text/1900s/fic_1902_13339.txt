Time .  --  The present  --  a winter morning . Place .  --  The study in a country parsonage . There is a bay window in flat at R. , showing the yard with fence and trees covered with snow . The door at L. , in flat , opens into a narrow hall  --  off of which the street door opens . A door up left opens into the dining room , and one at R. into the rector 's sleeping room . A large shabby desk is placed sidewise in the window with a rickety revolving chair before it . The sofa and chairs , awkward and uncomfortable , are covered with horse-hair . There is an oval shaped marble topped table at L. C. , with three chairs about it . The table and several chairs are heaped with newspapers and books . The desk is strewn with writing materials , letters , books , etc . There is a half dead fire in the small fireplace down L.  --  and the general effect is shabby , neglected and desolate . It is snowing without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clothing . Janie is the rector 's housemaid . Her little sunny face smiles upon him and the friends of whom she approves , but frowns with open displeasure upon those she suspects of designs upon the rector and his household . She wears a neat red calico dress , an apron much patched , and her hair brushed as tightly back as possible is braided and twisted into a large knot from the middle of which dangles a shoestring . On her forehead one small curl paper shows a small desire for beauty and improvement . As the curtain rises she comes in from the hall , sniffing and shivering with the cold , with a bunch of letters in her hands which she examines curiously  --  then turning suddenly she rushes back into the hall , calling loudly from the street door . JANIE Here ! here ! this is n't for us . What ? No  --  Hilborn  --  Mrs. Hilborn . Oh ! I know  --  she 's visitin ' the Smiths . Just come yesterday . She 's not so much either if she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes  --  make good sleighin ' . Bur  --  r  --  ( slamming the door and coming back into the room . She goes to the rector 's desk and examines the letters in a way which is curious but not sly . Her walk , her manner , her speech , are uncouth but lovable  --  utterly without training , and yet with an air of self-confidence that makes her always mistress of the situation . ) Stupid thing ! Everything that begins with a " H " he brings here . ( looking at letters again ) Um  --  um  --  I know that handwriting all right , all right . Miss Trimball again . ' Two n't do you any good , missy , writin ' letters . If you think our dominie ' ud ever even look at you . Hum ! I know a thing ' er two . ( dusting the desk ) There ! he did n't mail these letters . Oh , such a man ! ( bell rings without ) Now , who 's that ? What 's going on to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads ) Wednesday , ten a.m. , committee for new carpet , Miss Norton , Miss Knox , " Miss Trimball , " Hump ! much she knows about carpets . ( reads ) " Mrs. Munsey , " and " Mrs. Lemmingworth . " Lord save us ! ( bell rings again ) Now , you can just wait , whoever you are  --  it wo n't hurt you . ( she gives a final rub to a chair , hides the dust cloth behind her back , and goes into the hall . Sound of outer door ) p. 3 LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( without ) Good morning , good morning , Janie . I 'll just leave my rubbers and umbrella right here in the hall . Mind they do n't get mixed with anybody else's. ( coming in ) Mr. Herresford not in ? ( Mrs. Lemmingworth speaks in a loud voice ; her manner is dictorial ; her dress a little severe and old fashioned ) JANIE No'p . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . I came a little early : I wish to speak to him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will he  --  has he  --  been out long ? JANIE ( going on with her dusting ) Oh ! he 'll be back in time . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( aside ) Impudent thing ! I would n't have her in my house a minute . ( to Janie ) You 're a little late with your dusting , are n't you ? JANIE Oh , I do n't know ! ( shaking the dust cloth ) LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Good gracious , child ! what do you mean ? Do n't you know better than to shake a rag in the house ? That comes of not having a woman in the house . Poor man ! p. 4 JANIE " Poor man ! " You need n't worry about him . He 's all right ! He wo n't have a woman here till he gets good an ' ready , an ' then it ' ll be the right one . I can tell you those . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( aside ) Now what does she mean by that ? ( to Janie ) By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he  --  ( seeing the rector as he passes the window ) Here he is now . ( rising ) I just wanted to ask has the mail come yet this morning ? JANIE ( at hall door ) Of course . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Well , has he had time to read it ? JANIE No , he has n't ! ( bell rings ) LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Wait a minute , just let me step into the parlor while he reads it , and then you can call me when he has finished . ( she hurries into the hall ) JANIE Now what does she mean by that ? ( she goes into hall to open outer door . ) ( Mr. Herresford whistles as he passes the bay window , and continues to do so softly as he enters . Taking off his gloves , coat and hat , he gives them to Janie , who stands waiting for them . Mr. Herresford wears the clerical dress . He is thirty-two years old . Boyish and keenly alive to the happy side of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient kindliness and tolerance ) p. 5 HERRESFORD Thank you , Janie . Is anyone here ? I have an uncomfortable feeling that I have forgotten something . ( going to desk and taking up tablet ) Why , of course , the carpet committee at ten . JANIE ( aside ) No wonder he felt uncomfortable . ( to Mr. Herresford ) Mrs. Lemmingworth is here , sir . HERRESFORD Is she ? JANIE In the parlor . She 's waitin ' for you to read your mail . HERRESFORD What ? JANIE That 's all I know . She said she did n't want to disturb you , and I was to call her when you are through . HERRESFORD ( laughing ) Well , that 's very kind of Mrs. Lemmingworth , I 'm sure . ( He sits at desk and takes mail . Exit Janie L. ) So little Hilda Martin ( smiling as he reads ) is going to have a wedding . ( another letter ) Oh ! and a funeral for someone else . " So runs the world away . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write when she 's coming anyway . Is n't she ? ( taking up tablet ) Yes , here she is. ( reads ) " Just a line to tell you that you may depend upon my help and sympathy in the trying decision about the carpet . I shall be there at ten . Your ever ready and willing friend , Aurelia Trimball. ( with a sigh and a smile he tears the letter and drops it into the basket ) What atrocious writing ! ( taking up another letter ) What ? Oh , it ca n't be ! It must be a joke . No , it 's too insulting for that . Oh , I  --  p. 6 JANIE ( re-entering ) Shall I bring her in now ? HERRESFORD No ! What ? Oh , I suppose so . ( he crushes letter , then smooths it out and puts it in drawer , which he locks ) Wait a minute . Bring her in and say that I 'll come in a minute . ( Exit Mr. Herresford at R. ) JANIE Now , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad in my life . Wonder why he locked it up . ( going to hall door and calling ) You can come in now . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( entering ) Good morn  --  JANIE He 'll be here in a minute . ( aside as she goes out ) She 's too nosey . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( sitting R. of table L. C. I wonder  --  I hope I  --  Oh ! I shall be so glad when everything is settled and running smoothly . The man does n't know what 's best for him , of course , and it 's my duty to  --  Oh , good morning , Mr. Herresford . HERRESFORD ( entering ) Good morning , Mrs. Lemmingworth . How are you this morning ? ( shaking hands with her ) Ready for work ? p. 7 LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Oh dear , yes ! Dear , dear , yes ! I 've made some notes on the question , and I 've brought some samples . I went in town yesterday , and I just made it a point to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and design and durability ; so that I could report and help things along . Here they are . ( taking squares of carpet out of the black silk bag which she carries ) Now , you know  --  but of course you do n't know , how could you , being a man , and alone at that  --  but it is a fact that red , in the long run , is more lasting and satisfactory on the whole than any other thing in the carpet line . Now , a good housekeeper knows the important thing  --  there it is again , a good housekeeper ! What do you know about good housekeepers ? And by the way , my dear boy , that reminds me . You know I look upon you very much as a mother would ; for I know how lonely and helpless you are , and I 'm going to speak from my heart . I know it is n't always possible for you to know just what is best for you , and how you stand in the community . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  I have heard of late many complaints , because you are so young and unmarried . ( Mr. Herresford walks away quickly , trying to conceal his irritation . HERRESFORD My dear Madam  --  p. 8 LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Now , you know , my boy , there is nothing so helpful to a church and its pastor as a good helpful wife . Ahem ! Now , there is one young woman in your congregation who will make you a good wife . HERRESFORD I ca n't listen to this . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( drawing her chair forward and hurrying on breathlessly ) A noble wife , pious , discreet , and economical . HERRESFORD Mrs. Lemmingworth , I beg  --  LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . We all think so , It 's the only thing necessary to make your success here complete . You must know who I mean of course . HERRESFORD Mrs. Lemmingworth , you do n't realize what you are saying . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Miss Trimball , of course . HERRESFORD Mrs. Lemmingworth , think of the lady ! LEMMINGWORTH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  JANIE ( Throwing open the hall door ) Miss Trimball ! Miss Trimball enters . She is tall and thin and has a cold . Her dress suggests a little attempt at being in the fashion . She speaks in a high voice and titters constantly . One toe is turned in slightly . She carries a small basket covered with a napkin ) p. 9 TRIMBALL , MISS ( coughing and wiping her nose ) Oh , good morning , Mrs. Lemmingworth , and I late ? Good morning , Mr. Herresford. ( offering her hand awkwardly ) I 've brought you some fresh doughnuts . I thought they 'd be nice to munch on while you 're writing your sermons . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( with emphasis ) A good idea ! TRIMBALL , MISS ( giving the basket to Janie ) Keep them in a crock . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . And put a damp cloth over them . JANIE ( as she marches out ) Oh ! we 've had doughnuts before . TRIMBALL , MISS ( seeing the samples of carpet ) Oh , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that just like Mrs. Lemmingworth , Mr. Herresford ? So thoughtful ( she crosses complacently to the sofa and sits with one foot persistently turned in ) LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . I was just telling Mr. Herresford that all good housekeepers consider red the best investment in a carpet . ( the door bell rings ) Now , you know what good housekeeping is , do n't you , Miss Trimball ? p. 10 TRIMBALL , MISS ( tittering and looking at the ends of her shabby gloves ) Oh , Mrs. Lemmingworth , how can you ! Poor little me . Do you really think I do ? JANIE ( who has opened the street door , now appears with a broad smile of approval as she announces ) Miss Margaret . HERRESFORD ( going forward eagerly to greet Margaret ) Good morning , Miss Margaret . It 's awfully good of you to come out in this storm , and really it is n't necessary . It 's snowing quite heavily , is n't it ? ( Margaret has the glow of health in her cheeks and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown is simple and becoming , and she brings with her fresh air and confidence ) NORTON ( brushing the snow off her coat ) Oh , the snow is glorious ! and do n't tell me I 'm not necessary , that is n't nice . Good morning , Mrs. Lemmingworth . Good morning , Miss Trimball . No , thank you , Mr. Herresford , I wo n't take off my coat , I will just throw it back . Um , perhaps I had better , It does seem a little warm here after my walk . ( Mrs. Lemmingworth sniffs significantly and exchanges glances with Miss Trimball , as Mr. Herresford takes off Margaret 's coat and places it carefully over the back of her chair ) p. 11 NORTON ( as she takes off her gloves ) I pulled little Willie Green most of the way on his sled . You never saw such a happy child . He scarcely ever gets out you know . He can hardly walk at all now . I saw him in the yard trying to make snowballs and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I got the grocery boy to take him back again . He actually had a little color in his face . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Humph ! I should think so  --  probably half frozen . That trifling careless mother of his never keeps him half dressed . NORTON Oh ! do n't say that , Mrs. Lemmingworth . Poor woman , she 's so busy sewing for other people she never has time to do anything for him . A shoemaker 's children , you know  --  TRIMBALL , MISS ( a little vaguely ) Charity begins at home . HERRESFORD Could n't something be done for the little fellow ? Could n't his lameness be cured , or helped at least ? NORTON ( quickly ) Why , I think so . I was just going to ask at the aid society to-morrow if we could n't possibly raise money enough to  --  LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Pshaw ! that 's out of the question . The aid society has more than it can stand up under , now . p. 12 TRIMBALL , MISS ( trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Besides I do n't think she 's a member of our church . NORTON Oh , yes , she is . TRIMBALL , MISS But she never comes . NORTON I suppose she 's too worn out to go when Sunday comes . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . That 's no excuse . NORTON Well , what if she is n't a member of our church . Are n't we supposed to help everybody we can ? LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . We 've got to draw the line some place  --  and our church must help its own members . HERRESFORD ( quietly ) " Our church , " Mrs. Lemmingworth ? What is " our " church ? LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Why , the church  --  our church . What do you think the church is ? HERRESFORD ( with a far-away look in his face ) I think it 's the hand of God reaching to earth . We ought to be the fingers , touching and blessing all we can . What are we without love , Mrs. Lemmingworth , universal love ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ) It all seems so simple if we look at it that way . HERRESFORD ( going on  --  half to himself ) Kindness , to help  --  help . Kindness  --  Love . TRIMBALL , MISS ( speaking quickly in a high voice ) Yes , I think love is the greatest thing in the world . Have you ever read the essay , Mr. Herresford , " Love is the greatest thing in the world " ? I 'll lend it to you , if you have n't . But I think charity begins at home . NORTON ( laughing ) If you keep on saying that , Miss Trimball , you may find a place that it fits . Oh , what beautiful samples ! HERRESFORD ( who has taken out his note-book ) Did you say  --  Oh ! I beg your pardon  --  ( realizing he has interrupted ) Did you say  --  is it the third house from the corner , Miss Margaret ? NORTON What ? Oh , no , the second  --  the little brown one with the picket fence around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . p. 14 NORTON Now , what beautiful samples of carpet . Now , is n't this nice . How 's the cold , Miss Trimball ? We missed your solo , Sunday , awfully . ( Margaret smiles brightly at Miss Trimball who titters in spite of Mrs. Lemmingworth 's frown ) TRIMBALL , MISS Oh , thank you . I really ought not to have come out to-day but I never fail in my duty . NORTON You set us all a beautiful example , I 'm sure . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Mrs. Munsey is late , of course . I think we need not wait any longer for her . HERRESFORD Oh , better give her a few minutes ' grace , had n't we ? The snow , you know , makes it hard walking . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Very small things are hard for some people . Here 's Miss Trimball ought n't to be out of bed , yet she did n't find it hard to come . TRIMBALL , MISS ( coughing violently ) Oh , Mrs. Lemmingworth , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to do my duty . ( Janie crosses from the dining-room into the hall with a broom , and is seen sweeping the snow tracks in the hall ) NORTON ( laughing ) There 's someone else too , is n't there , Mr. Herresford ? Victoria , is n't she on the committee ? ( Margaret watches the instant disapproval which comes into Mrs. Lemmingworth 's face ) p. 15 HERRESFORD Oh yes , to be sure . I believe she is. ( referring to his tablet on his desk ) Yes , yes , here she is . NORTON We must wait for Victoria . We ca n't get on without her , can we ? ( still laughing ) LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( bristling ) Oh , nonsense ! That is a farce  --  waiting for Victoria Knox . I have everything all settled , and it will only take a few minutes . ( the bell rings , Margaret and Mr. Herresford both start toward the door ) MARGARET AND HERR There , there , she is now . MUNSEY , MRS. ( without  --  stamping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do hope I have n't got my feet wet . ( she appears at the hall door . Janie brushes the snow from her feet as Mrs. Munsey shakes her skirts ) Oh dear ! do you think my feet are wet , Janie ? HERRESFORD Come right in , Mrs. Munsey . Come over to the fire and warm those feet . We were waiting for you and talking about you . ( Mrs. Munsey is a pretty widow in black with coquettish tonches of whitc . She rolls her big baby blue eyes and smiles constantly , as she speaks in a gushing manner  --  with over emphasized words ) p. 16 MUNSEY , MRS. ( establishing herself in the armchair by the fire , as Mr. Herresford kneels to take off her rubbers ) Oh , you dear Mr. Herresford ! Did you hear that , ladies ? Good morning , everybody . Do n't let me interrupt you . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . Just let me sit over here , and do n't mind me  --  go right on . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Do you know  --  LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( knocking on the table ) Then , ladies , if you will kindly come to order . MUNSEY , MRS. ( still smiling at Mr. Herresford ) Do you know the snow is n't shoveled at all on our street ? LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( knocking again ) If you will kindly come to order . HERRESFORD I beg your pardon , Mrs. Lemmingworth . MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , go right on , of course . Do n't mind me . I 'm late because I had to stop at the dressmaker 's , and she took so long to fit the waist . Mrs. Green is always so particular about my dresses . She says I  --  Oh , what do you think , she 's making Hilda Martin 's wedding dress , and it 's  --  p. 17 TRIMBALL , MISS ( starting up and crossing to Mrs. Munsey ) Oh ! is Mrs. Green making Hilda Martin 's wedding dress ? What is it ? Why I never knew Hilda had a dressmaker make anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven knows where she 'll get the money to pay for this . NORTON Oh , but this is her wedding dress . Of course she 'd have to have that made . TRIMBALL , MISS What is it ? What is it made out of , Mrs. Munsey ? MUNSEY , MRS . Why , it 's blue cashmere . Now , of course , some people might like it , but it would n't be my taste . Now , when I was married . TRIMBALL , MISS Is it light blue or dark blue ? How is it made ! NORTON I 'm sure Hilda would look very pretty in light blue  --  she 's so fair . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . I do n't approve of her having any such nonsense about a wedding when she  --  ( the ladies discuss the possibilities of Hilda 's wedding dress in a most animated way  --  all speaking at once , and no one listening to anyone else  --  much to Mr. Herresford 's amusement who picks up a book from his desk and waits for peace ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ) Ladies , ladies  --  if you will kindly come to order . NORTON ( laughing ) Yes , we must get to work . MUNSEY , MRS . Yes , of course . Do n't mind me . TRIMBALL , MISS ( as she goes back to the sofa ) I think blue is funny though . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( seating herself at the head of the table ) As the chairman of the committee , I have deemed it wise to obtain these samples of the material which may be procured for the price within our limit . Now , the short aisle , leading across the front of the church at the left , is never seen , and almost never used ; and in considering the matter I have decided that it would be a useless and wasteful expenditure to put carpet on that . NORTON Oh ! but let 's do it well  --  now , that we really can have a new carpet at last . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Ahem ! we take it for granted , of course , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage , and not uselessly or recklessly . NORTON Yes , but just that little strip wo n't be much more , and it will spoil it all if we do n't have it . p. 19 TRIMBALL , MISS I agree with Mrs. Lemmingworth  --  we must n't waste the money . HERRESFORD What do you think of this , Mrs. Munsey ? MUNSEY , MRS. ( who has risen to look at herself in the mirror over the mantel ) What ? Oh ! I  --  why , do n't ask me . I do n't know anything about business , you know . Whatever you say , of course , Mr. Herresford , will be all right . ( Margaret and Mr. Herresford laugh  --  the others frown ) LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . This is not a matter to be lightly considered  --  on the contrary it is a matter of very grave importance . MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , I know it is . Do forgive me , my dear Mrs. Lemmingworth . But , you know , I really  --  you will excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I to consider Mrs. Munsey 's out of the matter , then ? HERRESFORD Oh , no , no ! You must help us out , you know , Mrs. Munsey . NORTON Oh , she will , of course . HERRESFORD If we 're going to vote about it , we 'll have to wait for Miss  --   --  p. 20 NORTON For Victoria , yes , to be sure . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . That is unnecessary , we have a majority here . We will now put the question to vote . Those in favor will signify by saying " aye . " MUNSEY , MRS . Aye , for what ? Which is which ? TRIMBALL , MISS Oh dear ! LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Ahem ! I will state the question once more , those in favor of carpeting the side aisle  --  JANIE ( entering from the dining-room ) Excuse me , Mr. Herresford , Maria wants to know if you forgot to get the butter . HERRESFORD Why , Janie , I  --  NORTON ( smiling ) Oh , you know you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back in a jiffy . MUNSEY , MRS. ( rising ) Why , you poor dear man ! Have n't you any butter ? We have lovely butter , and I 'll send you some as soon as I go home . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . You do n't mean to tell me you do n't have butter from one place regular . Why , old John Watts has been bringing me butter and fresh eggs for the last ten years every Saturday morning . But what can you expect ? p. 21 TRIMBALL , MISS ( rising excitedly and going to Mr. Herresford ) I 've churned myself this morning and I 'll go right home and fetch you some . HERRESFORD Ladies , I beg . Sit down , Miss Trimball , I could n't think of letting you . Janie , get some  --  get anything . JANIE Will I go to Hipsley 's or Crocker 's ? NORTON ( still laughing ) Mr. Hipsley has some nice fresh butter just in . I stopped there as I came along . JANIE ( from the dining-room ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the front door bell rings while I 'm gone you 'll have to go . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . I will state the question once more  --  those in favor of carpeting the side aisle at a needless expense , will signify it by saying " Aye . " HERRESFORD Just a moment , please . I believe I 'd better not vote . It really is n't a matter which concerns me at all . you know . MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , Mr. Herresford ! No fair ! How will we know how to vote ? NORTON Yes , of course , you must n't desert us. p. 22 LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . I must ask for seriousness and respect . HERRESFORD I beg your pardon , Mrs. Lemmingworth , I 'm sure . I 'm in favor of carpeting then . MUNSEY , MRS . So am I ! So am I ! NORTON Here too ! LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . This is non-parliamentary , and I consider the decisions are given without due consideration . TRIMBALL , MISS I vote against it . LEMMINGWORTH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweighed , of course . However , now , if I may be allowed a word of suggestion on the matter , I present this as being the best thing in the market for the price . NORTON ( leaning forward to take the sample ) Oh , that 's lovely , Mrs. Lemmingworth ! Is n't it , Mrs. Munsey ? ( aside to Mrs. Munsey ) Do say yes , and let it go without a fuss . This will do as well as anything . MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , beautiful ! Mrs. Lemmingworth has such good taste , has n't she ? NORTON Why not leave the entire thing in Mrs. Lemmingworth 's hands , now ? We know it will be well done , and ask Miss Trimball to be a committee of for advice and consultation . p. 23 HERRESFORD By all means . Do n't refuse us , Mrs. Lemmingworth . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . Well , I  --  NORTON No , we wo n't take " no " for an answer . Make her say " yes , " Miss Trimball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Mrs. Lemmingworth . MUNSEY , MRS . Yes , Mrs. Lemmingworth , remember your duty . ( turning away her head to hide her smiles ) LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . My duty ! Yes , it is my duty alone which makes me consent  --  not that I like the position of  --  NORTON Oh , no , we understand . It 's very unselfish and kind of you to do it for us , I 'm sure . Now , that 's all , is n't it , this morning ? ( rising ) MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , is that all ? TRIMBALL , MISS ( as the others rise ) May I speak to you a moment , Mr. Herresford ? MRS . HERR Certainly . LEMMINGWORTH , MRS. ( drawing the others aside ) Look at this closely and you 'll see what a really superior thing it is. p. 24 TRIMBALL , MISS I want to ask you about my solo next Sunday . I want to sing something fitting and sympathetic with your sermon . I can sing so much better when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERRESFORD I see . Well , anything simple and sweet will do . Your songs are always pleasing , Miss Trimball . We all appreciate them very much . TRIMBALL , MISS Oh , do you ? You are so good ! I try so hard to please you . NORTON Well , I must hurry . Good-bye , good-bye , everybody . HERRESFORD ( quickly ) Oh ! are you going ? NORTON Yes , good morning . HERRESFORD Good morning . ( he indicates by pantomime that Margaret is to wait in the parlor until the others are gone ) TRIMBALL , MISS ( calling Mr. Herresford back as Margaret goes into the hall ) Then you ca n't suggest any special thing ? HERRESFORD No , I believe not . TRIMBALL , MISS You could n't let me read the sermon , so I could be sure of selecting the right thing ? p. 25 HERRESFORD ( embarrassed and annoyed , trying to be kind ) Oh  --  I  --  I 'm afraid not  --  I really have n't it in shape , you know . MUNSEY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror ) Why , has Margaret gone ? I must go too then . Good-bye . Good-bye , my dear Mr. Herresford , you 've been so kind . HERRESFORD ( taking her hand ) You 're sure you 're quite warm now , Mrs. Munsey ? MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , quite . Dear me ! Now , is n't that just like me ? I 've forgotten my rubbers . HERRESFORD Let me get them for you . Allow me , if you 'll sit down . MUNSEY , MRS . Oh ! thank you , thank you . You 're so good . It does seem nice to have a man do things for you . Mother says I 'm spoiled . Dickie spoiled me . Poor dear Dick ! ( putting her handkerchief to her eyes ) HERRESFORD ( rising ) There . MUNSEY , MRS . Oh , thank you ! This heel does n't seem quite on . ( Mr. Herresford kneels again ) The snow makes them stick so . Oh ! ( losing her balance and putting her hand on Mr. Herresford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ca n't bear them . They make your feet look so big , do n't they , Miss Trimball ? ( to Mr. Herr . ) Do n't forget you 're coming to have a cup of tea with mother and me Tuesday at five , you know . We shall be so heartbroken if you do . Mother is so fond of you , you know . And dear me , der me , how dreadful ! I 've forgotten , why , I never could have gone home without it  --  I 've forgotten to give you mother 's love , and she sent it so carefully . Do forgive me . I 'm so sorry . I meant to of course . But I have n't much of a mind , you know , Mr. Herresford . Good morning , good morning . p. 26 HERRESFORD ( following Mrs. Munsey to the door ) Good morning . TRIMBALL , MISS ( calling him back again ) You will know whatever I sing , my heart is in it , wo n't you , Mr. Herresford ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , Miss Trimball . ( Miss Trimball sighs conspicuously and goes up to Mrs. Lemmingworth , who can be seen struggling with her rubbers in the hall ) TRIMBALL , MISS Come , Mrs. Lemmingworth , are you ready ? LEMMINGWORTH , MRS . I 'm just putting on my rubbers . There now ! Come on . Good-bye . I 'll do the best I can in the matter . HERRESFORD I 'm sure you will . TRIMBALL , MISS There is n't anything I can do for you ? Anyone sick I can visit ? HERRESFORD Oh , nothing , nothing , thank you . Go home and take care of yourself . Good morning , ladies . Thank you very much for coming . ( as the outer door closes with a bang , Mr. Herresford comes back into room and listens . Margaret comes cautiously across the hall ) p. 27 NORTON ( at door ) Are they all gone ? HERRESFORD All gone . I always feel like a conspirator when I 'm with you . NORTON ( laughing ) That 's rather a doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole place who understands at all . NORTON ( still laughing and turning away nervously ) Poor Mrs. Lemmingworth . That was rather a master stroke of yours . HERRESFORD Of yours , you mean , I 'm always a coward where Mrs. Lemmingworth is concerned . I 've given up long ago . NORTON But we got the side aisle , did n't we ? HERRESFORD Yes , we got the side aisle  --  rather you did . NORTON I notice you never give up anything but  --  something you do n't want , anyway . HERRESFORD ( walking away , with a quick sigh ) I do n't know about that . ( turning back to her ) Margaret , Miss Margaret , you 're very wise  --  if you 're not gray-headed . Sit down . I so often wonder where it all came from  --  your strength and judgment . Every one turns to you intuitively for guidance , and I also wonder what you are going to do with it all ; if you do n't sometimes rebel at this little narrow life and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful mind of yours . ( Margaret looks at him quickly then away ) And I want to ask you something which I want you to answer very honestly . Do you think I had better go away ? p. 28 NORTON ( after a pause ) What do you mean ? HERRESFORD Have n't I made a mistake by coming at all ? Have n't I failed dismally ? There 's something wrong  --  somewhere . NORTON ( recovering her composure ) Yes , there is something wrong . HERRESFORD ( eagerly ) You feel it ? NORTON But not with you . If you think the life seems little to me  --  what must it be for you ? I 've seen it all from the first  --  the prejudice because you did come from another world  --  the petty annoyances that have come to you in a thousand ways . I know there have been times when you have wanted to scream out from the house tops , " Let me alone ! let me alone ! " But you have gone on , bravely and patiently until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't that : they do love you and believe in you . HERRESFORD It puts new life into me to hear you say so . Are you sure  --  are you sure ? ( going to her ) NORTON ( raising her eyes to him ) I am sure . p. 29 HERRESFORD Thank you . And now  --  I  --  I 'm going to show you something . ( he takes the letter from the desk and gives it to Margaret who reads it slowly aloud ) NORTON ( reading ) " A silent friend warns you  --  you must marry Aurelia Trimball. " ( after a pause ) I ca n't believe it ! I ca n't believe it ! Oh ! I 'm so sorry for you , and so ashamed  --  for us . HERRESFORD ( taking the letter and tearing it up ) Never mind . Do n't let it trouble you . Funny , is n't it ? NORTON Funny ? It 's disgraceful ! What are you going to do ? HERRESFORD That 's just it . That 's what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall I stay  --  and ask  --  someone else to be my wife ? ( Margaret moves away ) Do n't think me a coward . It is n't myself  --  I 'm thinking of her ; and whether they 'd make her miserable ; and whether she 'd be brave enough to face it  --  even if she  --  cared for me . NORTON ( slowly ) Why , of course , she would  --  if she cared . p. 30 HERRESFORD Even if she were  --  Victoria ? ( Margaret puts out her hand for a chair and sits quickly ) Ah ! you see , even you hesitate at Victoria . NORTON ( with her face turned away ) It is Victoria then ? HERRESFORD Yes , Victoria . Is it very strange ? I suppose it does seem so  --  and yet to me it seems the most natural thing in the world . She  --  she  --  needs to be loved , you know . She is not like you  --  so strong and well poised . ( Mr. Herr , goes to Margaret and stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to him , her head resting on her hand , her elbow on the back of the chair ) Do you know , Margaret , you do n't mind my calling you Margaret , do you ? I 've wondered so many times what sort of a man you will marry . I 've thought of all the men I 've known  --  and know , and among them all I ca n't find one worthy of you . I ca n't imagine a man daring to woo you  --  or thinking for a moment he could satisfy you or make you happy . But I want you to be happy . I hope I may see the completion of your glorious womanhood . NORTON ( with an effort ) Thank you , Mr. Herresford. p. 31 HERRESFORD Do you mind telling me what you really think about Victoria  --  and me ? Do n't hesitate . If you think I 'm a fool  --  say so . I want to know . It will help me . NORTON ( slowly , without moving ) I think Victoria  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known . With a mind far beyond what she is supposed to have , and a heart which , if touched in the right way  --  and by the right one , could lift her into great spiritual strength and sweetness . HERRESFORD Do you ? Do you ? How good it is to hear you say it . NORTON ( without moving  --  going on in the same monotonous tone ) I think a strong good man can make a woman what he wants her to be , if she loves him ; and why should n't Victoria  --  love you ? I do n't know  --  it all seemed a little strange just now . I had n't thought , of course . But do n't be afraid , if you are sure that that is what your life and heart need . Do n't fear that she ca n't realize your ideal of what your wife ought to be  --  to help  --  and you know . Love always touches the highest key in a woman 's nature , and through it , and because of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her tightly closed hands ) even the most commonplace of us may sometimes do things which at least we will not be ashamed to look back at , through the years that are to come . ( she fights back the tears ) p. 32 HERRESFORD Then you do n't hesitate , even at Victoria ? NORTON ( after a moment 's pause  --  rising , smiling bravely and giving him her hand ) Not even at Victoria . HERRESFORD ( taking her hand in both his ) God bless you , Margaret ! I hope love  --  a great love , will come to you . NORTON Do n't you think there are sometimes things greater than love ? HERRESFORD Only one thing . ( the bell rings ) NORTON And that is ? HERRESFORD Renunciation . NORTON ( slowly  --  drawing her hand away ) Yes  --  renunciation . JANIE ( throwing open the hall door ) Here 's Miss Victoria . ( Enter Victoria  --  bright , gay , frivolous . ) KNOX Oh , here , you are ! Your mother said I 'd probably find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Margaret all the committee ? I was quite sure you would n't need me. p. 33 NORTON Oh ! but we did need you . Indeed it all depends upon you , Victoria . Does n't it , Mr. Herresford ? The question remains for you to settle . I 'm off  --  no , you ca n't come with me ; I have a thousand things to do . Make her tell you , Mr. Herresford . Good-bye  --  good-bye , dear . ( pushing Victoria back from the door , she rushes out laughing and waving her hand as she passes the window . There is a long pause after Margaret goes out  --  then Victoria , smiling over her muff says ) KNOX I wonder if I could have a glass of water . I 'm so thirsty . HERRESFORD Why , of course . ( going quickly to the door ) Janie , Janie ! a glass of water , please . ( another pause , Victoria goes to the window , looking out interestedly ) KNOX Is n't the snow pretty ? ( another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herresford ? ( stretching her head to see up the street ) HERRESFORD ( significantly ) Yes . ( Janie enters with the glass of water ) Thank you , Janie . Thank you , Janie. ( as Janie peers around him at Victoria ! Exit Janie . Mr. Herresford crosses to Victoria with the water , but stands staring at her and forgetting to give it to her ) Oh ! ( starting , as Victoria smiles at the glass which he holds ) p. 34 KNOX ( just touching her lips to the glass ) Thank you . That was so good . I was so thirsty . Well , I must go now . ( she drops her glove and they both stoop to pick it up ) HERRESFORD ( holding on to the glove ) Oh , do n't ! KNOX ( drawing it slowly away ) Oh , but I must ! HERRESFORD Why did you desert us ? KNOX Why did you put me on the stupid thing ? Do n't you know by this time that I utterly abhor all that sort of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet committee ! ( laughing ) Why did n't you give Margaret Norton the money and send her to town to buy the carpet and be done with it ? You know perfectly well she knows more about carpets than all the rest of the congregation put together . She 's much more capable of running a church than you are . Now , is n't she ? HERRESFORD Yes , I believe she is . I do n't know what I should do without her . KNOX Oh ! ( looking at him quickly and then crossing to fire ) p. 35 HERRESFORD Are you cold ? KNOX Oh , dear no , not at all . HERRESFORD Let me put some more wood on the fire . KNOX No  --  no  --  no ! not for me . I 'm going this minute . HERRESFORD Oh , do n't  --  do n't ! not just yet . KNOX But I must . This is highly improper . What would Mrs. Lemmingworth say if she knew I was calling on the rector ? HERRESFORD Oh , bother ! Mrs. Lem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrilege ! What has come to you ? ( laughing she goes to the door . Mr. Herresford following takes her hand and draws her back ) HERRESFORD Please , just a moment . I  --  I want to ask you something . KNOX Ask me ? Why did n't you ask Margaret ? I do n't care whether you have a carpet at all or not . HERRESFORD ( turning away ) No , I know you do n't . That 's just it . I know my life  --  I mean the church life  --  but I  --  I  --  I  --  p. 36 KNOX Do you ? What is it you want me to say  --  whether it shall be red  --  green  --  or blue ? HERRESFORD Oh ! it is n't the carpet at all . It 's you . KNOX Me ? ( laughing ) I do n't understand . HERRESFORD And I ca n't tell you . It seems harder  --  more impossible than I thought . KNOX I am more impossible than you thought ? Thank you . Oh ! you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! I  --  I love you . It 's absurd I know  --  and you 're laughing at me . I 'm poor  --  a country minister , and you  --  you 're a butterfly  --  utterly free , apart from duties and troubles of any kind . That 's all . I 'll go  --  and you 'll forget . But I 'm glad I said it . I love you . That 's all . KNOX ( after a pause ) That 's all ? HERRESFORD ( holding the door open for her ) That 's all . Good-bye . KNOX ( with her head bowed  --  going slowly to the door ) I 'm sorry I wo n't do . I should have tried so hard . I  --  I think I could make even Mrs. Lemmingworth love me  --  if I tried  --  for you . p. 37 HERRESFORD Victoria ! ( springing toward her ) KNOX ( stepping back from him ) No  --  no ! you did n't ask me . HERRESFORD ( catching her in his arms ) Will you ? KNOX ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to prayer meeting ? ( he smiles at her ) No , I 'm not laughing now . I shall always have a prayer in my heart that I may be worthy of you . But it frightens me a little . HERRESFORD Margaret says love teaches us  --  and I believe it does . CURTAIN .
