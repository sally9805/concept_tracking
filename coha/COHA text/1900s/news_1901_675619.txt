txt The Get-Together Club , at its monthly dinner held at the Hotel St. George , Brooklyn , last night , discussed " The Anti-Vice Crusade : After Suppression  --  What ? " The Rt . Rev. Henry C. Potter presided at the dinner , which was attended by about 200 men from all walks of life . Prior to the Bishop 's introduction of the speakers a vote was taken on the question of admitting women to one or more of the dinners during the year . and the ballots as announced by the Secretary showed an adverse opinion as to such a proceeding . The Bishop as he arose said : " 1 had hoped that in Brooklyn a vote on the question of the presence of ladies would have been unanimous in favor of admitting them . I think the time will come , and more speedily than you believe , when the counsel of both sexes will be essential in all forward movements . " The subject for the evening is , ' After Suppression  --  What ? ' and 1 suppose I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had the authority of prescribing tile subject I should change it to read , ' The Anti-Vice Crusade ; Before Suppression  --  What ? ' for I have grave doubts as to the immediate suppression of vice , and I have met many who are equally doubtful . " We May undoubtedly do a great deal in ; civic matters and make vice less indecent , less insolent . The mere suppression is not essential . Nothing has impressed me more during the last three months than the efforts of the metropolis to make itself a more decent city . " Thu Bishop then read an extract from a newspaper describing the settlement of the cast side bakers ' strike , and how men stood outside of the strikers ' headquarters and shouted to the passers-by that the strike had been settled , and that hereafter the People would get good , pure , and clean bread on which union labels had been placed . " What we want , " continued the Bishop . " is good , pure tenement houses on which the union labels of morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave to these whc came to me when the Commit , tee of Fifteen was appointed was that at least two representatives of labor should be placed on the committee , and that the committee should recognize all classes . We have initiated this crusade not for the . crushing cut of vice , but for the triumph of virtue. - Bishop Potter then introduced William II . Baldwin . Jr. , Chairman of the Committee of Fifteen , who spoke on the subject " The Committee of Fifteen  --  its Origin , Scope , and Purpose . " Mr Baldwin said : " I speak for myself alone , and not for the committee . The committee is composed of hard-headed men , and they understand their business , and at the right time will speak for themselves . " Mr. Baldwin talked at some length on the congested conditions existing on the east side , and the prevalence of vice there . As to the remedies , he said : " Partisanship would ruin the attempt we are .. making to reform conditions : any suspicion of partisanship would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make would be to produce anything sensational . My purpose is to pursue a careful and businesslike policy in handling existing conditions . We should have no false notions that any one can stop what is called vier ' . Our duty is to stop the public trade in vice . " We must clean the streets . Think of the thousands of children here in New York tonight who are nut safe . Think of the wives that are in danger . Your own wives and children are at home safe and secure from harm , but the wives and children on the east side are not . I would kill the man who touched one of my children . " The great difficulty we will have in handling the present conditions is that the people soon get tired of these questions and drop them after the first agitation . This Rine we have : - Tot to stay with the problem ? this year , next year . and the year after . Now that we have started the movement , we must keel ' it up . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue and morality , and that we will not make the mistakes that have been made in reform movements of the past . " After Mr. Baldwin had finished , Bishop Potter departed , and Robert C. Ogden presided . ' Henry tleerge spoke on " Who Are the Criminals ? " hr . Josiah Strong on " Visual Education in ( ' ivies , ' ' Milo B. Maltbie 1 on " Munieipal Ideals Realized , " and J. N. Bogert , State Organizer , American Federation of Labor , nu ? ?
