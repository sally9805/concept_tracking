 |p1225  I SHALL never forget the unalloyed pleasures of my first balloon ascension . Tho scarcely more than a youth , I had long dreamed of the adventure , because in those days , before the founding of the Aero Club , it was an adventure , even in Paris . Everything was still in the hands of the professional aeronauts ; and its was with one of the kindest and best of these , the late M. Machuron , that I was to make my initiation . Today even ladies of Paris society , like the young Duchesse d'Uzes , think nothing of starting off from the Parc de SaintCloud for an afternoon floating over the map of It was a beautiful morning in late spring . The basket rocked coquettishIv beneath the immense sphere . I stood in my corner and heard the last word given : " Let go all ! " France . The wind ceased . All seemed instantly motionless around us . We were off , without feeling it , at the speed of the air current in which we must live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sensation of its existence ! Infinitely gentle is the unfelt movement upward and onward ; the illusion is complete ; it seems to be not we who move , but the earth itself that is sinking down and away from us ! In the emptiness that had already opened 1,500 yards below us , almost before I could realize it , the earth looked no longer the same . No , it did not look like an orange flattened at the Poles ? we were not far enough away for that ; but , by a phenomenon of refraction it showed concave like a bowl , the effect being to lift up constantly to the aeronaut 's eye the circle of the horizon . Villages and woods , chateaux and gardens slip and glide far , far below . Faint piercing sounds ,  |p1226  like locomotive whistles and the yelping of stray dogs , are the only ones which penetrate to us . The human voice can not mount up to these solitudes . Human beings look like ants along white lines that are highways . While my gaze was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooled the gas of our balloon , which obviously wrinkled and began descending , gently at first and then with accelerated speed , against which we struggled by throwing out ballast . Yes , I was frightened . I did not feel myself falling , but I could see the earth coming swiftly up to us ; and I knew what that meant ! It was an idle emotion . A few pounds of ballast overboard not only stopped the mad career of the earth in our direction , but sent it down , down , down again away from us , and we found our equilibrium , this time above a plateau of clouds at about 3,000 yards . It was a wonderful sight . On the dazzling white cloud screen below us the sun cast shadows of the balloon and ourselves , magnified to giant size ; and this in the exact center of a magnificent rainbow . As we could no longer see the earth by reason of this cloud screen , all sight sensation , even of movement , ceased . Were we standing still ? Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To learn the direction we were taking we had to drop below the clouds . At the moment we began to see the earth again a gay peal of bells mounted up to us . It was the noon Angelus from some village belfry . I had brought up a little panier of hard boiled eggs , cold meats , cheese , ice cream , fruits , cakes , champagne , coffee and liquors , and I now experienced how delightful it is to lunch above the clouds in the nacelle of a spherical balloon . No earthly dining room could possibly have such a decoration . The sun 's heat sets the clouds in ebullition , making them throw up rainbow jets of frozen vapor like fireworks all around the table . Lacelike spangles of the most delicate ice formation scatter themselves here and there , appearing out of nothing , and filmlike flakes pop into existence under our very eyes , in our very drinking glasses . Then , suddenly , all changed like the trick in the pantomime ; and a somber drop scene fell on the fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barometer rose rapidly 5 millimeters , showing a sudden rupture of equilibrium and a swift descent . Doubtless the balloon had become overweighed with some pounds of snow , and it was certainly falling into a cloud . We passed into the dim darkness of the fog . We still saw our basket , instruments and the parts of the rigging nearest us ; but the balloon had completely disappeared . So we had the strange and delightful sensation of hanging in the void without support , either above or below ; of having lost our weight ; of being nowhere ! Really , it was strange beyond description . We slackened the fall , as usual , by throwing out ballast , and came to equilibrium far , far below the clouds at scarcely more than 300 yards altitude . A village fled beneath us . We were scudding fast . We compared our route map with the immense natural map unfolding below us , and soon we could identify roads , railways , villages and forests ? all hurrying toward us from the horizon with the swiftness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked a change in the weather . Little gusts pushed the balloon from one side to the other and up and down . Again , and again the guide rope , dangling too yards below our basket , touched earth ; and soon even the basket began to graze the tops of trees . What is called " guide roping " thus began for me . M. Machuron and I each held a sack of ballast , and when some special obstacle rose in our path ? a tree or house ? one of us would throw out a few handfuls of sand , to make the balloon leap up and pass over it . More than half the guide rope dragged behind us , and so we scudded comparatively close to earth at a wonderfully even altitude . But shortly , as we passed over a little group of trees , a shock threw us backward into the basket . The balloon had stopped short and was swaying in the gusts at the end of its guide rope , which had curled itself around the head of an oak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was only by throwing out a quantity of ballast that we were able to get ourselves loose . The tightened balloon immediately made a terrifying leap upward , piercing some low clouds like a cannon ball . That was a sensation . We were still shooting up , up ; and it was time to have recourse to effective means , to open the maneuver valve and let out a portion of our gas . It was clone in a moment . The balloon began descending again , until its guide rope again dragged on the ground . There was nothing but to bring the trip to an end , because only a little sand remained in the ballast bags . I watched my captain 's maneuvers . He who would navigate an airship should first practice landing in a spherical balloon , take my word for it . The wind being strong enough , it was necessary to seek shelter for this last crowning act of air-captainship . A corner of the forest of Fontainebleau was coming toward us . We turned the extremity of the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees protected us from the violence of the wind , and we cast anchor , at the same time opening wide the emergency valve for the wholesale escape of the gas . And so we landed ? plump ! ? without dragging , and stood watching the balloon die . It was almost a pitiful sight . Sprawling in the field , it was losing the remains of its gas in convulsive movements , like a great bird that dies beating its wings . Then we packed the silk envelope , anchor , rope and utensils in the basket and hired a man to haul it to the nearest railway station . After two more such personally conducted trips , in which I sought to do all the maneuvering with my own hands under M. Machuron 's kind instruction , I ventured in a spherical balloon , and during this early period I made very many trips , landing in all parts of France . Often they were prolonged into the night ; and no sporting sensations are more diversified and agreeable than those of night ballooning . One is alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbo ; but one seems to float there without weight , without dimensions , without a surround-  |p1228  ing world ? a soul freed from the trammels of matter ! Now and again there come the lights of earth to cheer you . You see a point far below ahead . It slowly expands , until where there came to be a blaze there are countless bright spots . They run in lines , with here and there a cluster . It is a city . Then it is out again over the lone land . When the moon rises you see , perhaps , a faint curling line of gray . It is a river , with moonlight or starlight falling on its waters . There comes a flash and a faint roar ; it is a railway train , the locomotive 's fires illuminating for a moment its smoke as it rises . Then you throw out ballast and rise through the dank black clouds to a soul-lifting burst of starlight . And there , alone with the constellations , you await the dawn . When the dawn comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loath to seek the cheery , busy earth again , altho the novelty of landing in who knows what part of Europe affords still another unique pleasure . For many the greatest charm of spherical ballooning lies here . The spherical balloonist becomes an explorer . Are you young ? Would you roam and tempt adventures ? And are you tied down ? You may still penetrate the unknown and deal with the unexpected . Take to spherical ballooning , as do the youth and beauty of the Paris Aero Club . At noon you lunch peaceably with your family . At 2 p.m. you dart into the air ; ten minutes later you are no longer a commonplace , law-abiding citizen . You are an explorer in unknown seas of light ! You know but vaguely where you are , and you do not know where you are going to bring up . Something depends on your skill and experience . The choice of altitude and air currents is yours , but when the moment conies to land you have the true explorer 's zest of coming on unknown peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine ! " What country is this ? " Will the answer come in French , German , Italian , Norwegian , or even Russian ? Paris Aero Club members have actually been shot at crossing European frontiers . Yes , the air is still for most people an unknown element ; and I who know it remain astonished at the world of different sensations one experiences in it as one goes as a spherical or dirigible balloonist . The realization of this wonderful difference flashed on me , at a moment I recall well , as I was steering a straight , swift course along the Mediterranean coast in my No. 6 during the memorable winter of 1902 . I was by this time an experienced dirigible balloon captain ? it was the winter following my winning of the Deutsch Prize in Paris ; I had no task to perform , nothing to prove , and I could give myself up to the pleasures of aerial navigation in by far the swiftest airship I had yet constructed . As I steered my course I remember saying to myself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spherical balloonist ! It is true that he has the earth flying backward beneath him at a great speed . but he knows that he is powerless . The sphere of gas above him is the plaything of the air current in which it finds itself : and he can not change its direction . " In my dirigible balloon I could see myself flying over the sea , and I had my hand on a helm that made me master of my direction in the splendid course I was making . Once or twice , to test the power , without other motive , I shoved the helm around , while going at full speed . Delightfully obedient , the airship 's helm swung to the other side . and I was speeding in a new diagonal course that would have brought me to shore in a few minutes had I continued it . But these maneuvers only occupied a few instants each , and each time I swung myself back on a straight line to the entrance of the Bay of Monaco , from which I had come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me by the Prince of that bay and the land around it , for I was flying homeward like an eagle . To those watching my return , from the terraces of Monte Carlo and Monaco town ( as they told me afterward ) , the airship increased in size at each moment , like a veritable eagle bearing down on them . As the wind was coming toward them they could hear the low crackling buzz of my motor a long distance away . Faintly now their own shouts of encouragement came to me . They grew  |p1229  louder . Around the bay a thousand handkerchiefs were fluttering . I gave a sharp turn to the helm , and the airship leapt into the bay , to slow down and be caught and conducted to its " stable . " Here in these azure solitudes there were no chimney pots of Paris , no cruelly threatening roof corners . I had plenty of leisure to look about me and enjoy my position . One of my impressions was that I was still isolated in spite of my ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two beautiful sailing yachts scudding toward nie down the coast . Their sails were full bellied . As I darted over them and they beneath me , I heard a faint cheer , and a graceful feminine figure on the foremost yacht waved a red foulard . As I turned to answer the politeness I perceived that we were already far , far apart . I was now well up the coast , about half way between Monaco and Cape SaintMartin . Above was the limitless blue void ; below was the solitude of the white-capped waves , and a sudden squall was coming up . Well , I had the fierce pleasure of depending on myself , with every sense alert , and a growing curiosity to learn the power of my motor and propeller to get me out of the scrape . I had never turned in a storm . Porting my helm , I held the rudder tight . The dirigible swung around like a boat , and as the wind now aided to send me flying down the coast my only work was to maintain my steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasures like these ? the triumphs of personal effort from minute to minute ? the spherical balloonist may not know . I recall a similar moment of fierce enjoyment on my return from the Eiffel Tower , when I won the Deutsch Prize for aerial navigation in October , 1901 . On my way to the Tower the motor had worked fairly well . Now , after I had left it some 500 yards behind me , it was actually on the point of stopping . I had an instant of great uncertainty . I must make a quick decision . It was to abandon the steering wheel for a moment , at the risk of being torn from my course , in order to give my attention to the carburating lever and the lever controlling the electric spark . The motor began to work again . I had almost reached the Bois de Boulogne , where , by a phenomenon known to all aeronauts , the cool air from the trees began making the balloon heavier and heavier ? i.e. , smaller by condensation ? when , by . an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airship was descending while its motive force was decreasing . I had instantly to throw back both guide rope and shifting weights , changing my center of gravity considerably . This caused the balloon to point diagonally upward , so that the remaining propeller force caused me to remount continually into the air by jerks , so to speak . I was directly over the crowd of the Auteuil Racetrack . I heard the applause of the mighty throng , when suddenly my capricious motor started working like a beau diable . The suddenly accelerated propeller being almost under the uppointing airship caused an exaggeration of the inclination , so that the applause of the crowd changed to cries of alarm as I darted for a moment almost vertically upward . As for myself I had no fear , knowing the circumstances and feeling doubly safe over the trees of the Bois de Boulogne , whose soft greenery always reassured me , in spite of its having played me many a trick in my earlier experiments . I might have checked the sensational upward shoot by simply slowing the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race that I actually did win , so I went on , soon righting myself by shifting guide rope and weights forward again . All the same , this is why I passed so high over the judges ' heads that my guide rope could not be caught ? a detail that caused some hair-splitting at the time , as may be remembered . If I were asked what were my very first sensations of aerial navigation , I would have to confess surprise to feel the airship going straight ahead . It was astonishing to feel the wind in my face . As a spherical balloonist I had always gone in the wind , becoming part of it and not feeling it . As my airship plowed ahead the wind fluttered my coat violently , as on the deck of an Atlantic liner , tho in all other respects it is more like river navigation with a steamboat . It is not at all like sail navigation @#  |p1230  and all talk about " tacking " is meaningless . Imagine the air current to be a river running to miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making 20 miles per hour , your net progress will be but to miles per hour . If your propeller makes you 20 miles per hour with the current , your net speed becomes 30 miles per hour . Well , it is just so in an airship . In a calm it makes its own speed , unaffected by wind current . The navigator of the air , however , has one great pleasure unknown to the navigator of a river . He can seek to change one air current for another . The air is full of varying currents . Mounting , I have often sought and found either a calm or an advantageous breeze , even in a spherical balloon ; and this is one of the ever-changing delights of the aerial realm . Before going on my first airship experiment I really wondered if I should be seasick . I imagined that the sensation of mounting and descending obliquely ( with my shifting weights ) might prove queerish , and I looked forward to a deal of pitching ? not rolling ? another novelty in ballooning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of movement at all . In my first airship , however , the suspension was so long that it approximated that of a spherical balloon . For this reason there was very little pitching . And speaking generally , since that time . tho I have been told that on this or that trip I pitched considerably , I have never been seasick in the air . You see in the airship there is no smell . All is pure and clean , and the pitching itself has none of those shocks and hesitations of the boat at sea . The movement is suave and flowing , owing to the immensely lesser resistance of the air . The pitches are less rapid than at sea ; the ( lip is not brusquely arrested ? so the mind can anticipate the curve to its very end and be prepared . There is no shock to give that " empty " feeling as the giant transatlantic construction rises out of the water , first its fore part , then its aft , with its propeller churning the air so viciously , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this brings me to the most remarkable of all the sensations of aerial navigation . This is the wonderful diagonal flight . On my first trip it actually shocked me . Man has never known anything like free vertical existence . Held to the plane of the earth , his movement " down " has scarcely been more than a return after a short excursion " up , " our minds always remaining on the plane surface , even while our bodies may be  |p1231  mounting , and this is so much true that the spherical balloonist as he rises has no sense of movement , but gains the impression on which I have insisted , that the earth is descending below him . With respect to combinations of vertical and horizontal movement man is quite without experience . Indeed , I can not describe the delight , the wonder and intoxication of that free diagonal movement onward and upward , or onward and downward , combined at will with changes of direction horizontally when the airship answers to the touch of the rudder ! The birds have this sensation when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirals through the sky . Of course , when I look back , it is not always easy for me to separate the pleasures of successful effort , the satisfactions of amour pro pre , and the anticipations of triumphs to come from the natural and innate pleasures of dirigible ballooning . The time , nevertheless , came when I tired of the former and leaned toward the latter , and I made this comparison : Once I was enamoured of high power petroleum automobiles ? they can go at wonderful speed to any part of Europe , finding their fuel in any village . But when I discovered that I did not want to go to Moskow or to Lisbon , the small and handy electric runabout in which I do my errands about Paris proved more satisfactory . From the standpoint of my pleasure and convenience as a Parisian , my experience has been similar . Because , you understand , I do this for my pleasure ; I have no mission to labor and risk my life merely to demonstrate things to the public . So I built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smallest of possible dirigibles , which I am , in one sense , copying again on a larger scale this summer . Indeed , it was so small that its original motor was a 3 horse-power Clement , weighing 26 pounds , while its ballast capacity was only 66 pounds . Yet with it I went careering over the Bois at as much as 15 miles per hour , notwithstanding its egg-shaped form , which was seemingly little calculated for cutting the air . The balloon of my airship for this summer will be much more cigar-shaped , slender and pointed , because I have hit on a new stiffening device and no longer fear doubling up like a jack-knife . How practical this little " runabout " proved itself was shown when I landed with it the first time in the grounds of the Aero Club at Saint-Cloud , in the midst of nine fully inflated spherical balloons , there held ready to be let off on a ladies ' race . After a short call , I prepared to start away again to my own balloon house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas ? " politely asked my fellow clubmen . " You saw me coming all the way from Neuilly , " I replied ; " did I appear to be throwing any ballast ? " " You threw no ballast , " they admitted , and it was obvious I could only have started with some 66 pounds of it . " Then why should I be in need of gas ? " I asked . As a matter of curiosity I may relate that I did not lose or sacrifice a cubic foot of gas or a single kilogramme of ballast that whole afternoon . After leaving my friends at SaintCloud I made a typically peaceful " Parisian " air trip ? because you must not imagine that the pleasures of dirigible ballooning have all to do with fierce and palpitating effort in blue solitudes . No , there is also the aerial park saunter , absolutely devoid of risk and danger . To go from Neuilly , Saint-James , to the Aero Club 's park I had already passed the Seine . Now , crossing- it again I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I descended for refreshment and a chat . It was 5 p.m . Not vet wishing to quit the amusing little voyage , I left the sylvan cafe , crossed the river for a third time , and went straight as close to Mont Valerien as delicacy permitted . ( It is an important fort , defending Paris and guarding its own secrets jealously . ) Then returning I crossed the river for a last time and came to earth in my own grounds at Neuilly . During my whole trip my highest altitude was 346 feet . Taking into consideration that my guide rope hangs 130 feet below me and that the tops of the Bois trees extend up some 7o feet from the ground , I had enjoyed but 140 feet of clear space for vertical maneuvering . It was enough , and the proof is that I have amused myself guide roping  |p1232  round the Arc de Triomphe and down the Avenue des Champs Elysees at as low an altitude as the housetops on either side , fearing no ill and finding no difficulty . Knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure promenade of all Paris would be the least encumbered , I had instructed my men to sleep through the early part of the night at the Neuilly station . Arriving at 3 a.m . I climbed the wall , soothed the dog , waked the men , brought out the airship and crossed the Seine as I rose diagonally a little after dawn . Turning to the left I made my way over the Bois , picking out the open spaces . When I came to trees I jumped over them . So , navigating through the cool air of dawn I reached the Porte Dauphine and the beginning of the Avenue of the Bois , which leads to the Arc de Triomphe . The carriage promenade of Tout Paris was empty , and I might actually have threaded the Arc de Triomphe had I deemed myself worthy . Instead , I rounded the national monument to the right , as the law directs . Like the Avenue of the Bois , the Avenue of the Champs Elysees , was deserted . Far down its length I saw a solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of the rue Washington , I thought of the time , sure to come , when the navigators of handy little airships will not be obliged to land in the street , but will have their guide ropes caught by their domestics on their own roof-gardens . So I reached my street corner , to which I pointed downward my stem and descended very gently . Two servants caught , steadied and held the airship while I mounted to my apartment for a cup of coffee . That is another kind of dirigible ballooning !
