 |p1231  THE idea of painting the portrait of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager of China originated with Mrs. Conger , the American Minister 's wife , who was anxious that some likeness of the Empress Dowager should be sent out to the exposition to correct false impressions that had gone abroad regarding her Majesty 's personality . I had gone out to China to visit my brother , Francis A. Carl , who is a Mandarin of the second degree , in the employ of the Chinese Government . Mrs. Conger made the preliminary arrangements , and presented me to the Dowager Empress . The day that I was presented was the day on which I was to begin the portrait . In this article I wish to correct statements that have been made concerning Her Majesty , some of which were wrongly credited to me , that Her Majesty was " shrewd and tempestuous " and had " the soul of a tiger in the body of awoman . " Her Majesty was always very considerate , and tried to help me in every way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my work . The Empress had a charming expression , and had wonderful dignity and grace . The real charm of her face depended upon her expression . Her smile was brilliant and absolutely fascinating . I have never seen a face more changed than hers when illumined by this wonderful smile . In China for every undertaking the calendars and almanacs are studied as to what time is propitious . After careful consideration of this sort , it was decided that August 5th , 1903 , was the most auspicious day for beginning the portrait . The auspicious hour was also chosen eleven o'clock in the morning . And so I began my work . This was the first of four pictures . The one which was finally chosen , the third in the order in which it was executed , was commenced in January , 1904 . Those who have seen the portrait will remember that it shows no lines in the face . This is absolutely true to life , altho her Majesty was seventy years old at that time . Her Majesty had a particularly clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face nor used cosmetics , observing this rule because she was a widow . The beautiful skin of the Chinese women generally is the more remarkable when one remembers that they never wear any hats when they go out nor any gloves . Their faces  |p1231  and hands are always exposed to the weather ; yet I really think they have the finest texture of skin of any women in the world . Never does one see pimples on a Chinese woman 's face ; her complexion is always exquisitely satiny . Her Majesty had very piercing eyes , and they were not slanting . Her eye was full , with a tight lid , as it might be called , but set perfectly straight . Not a gray hair appeared in the full suit , all her own , which was drawn out in a wing-like construction over a support . The dress that she wore was her imperial " Winter Gown , " of very heavy satin , stiffly embroidered and lined with fur . The round character " sho , " which means longevity , appeared everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this character , and had it over the palace everywhere . Her Majesty was particular also to have a pyramid of apples appear in the picture , for the apple means " peace and prosperity . " For the perfume as well she loved the apples , some of the apples of the Chinese being much more highly odorous than any that America possesses . Pearls were a favorite jewel of the Empress . She had her pearl mantle , in which each gem is worth almost a fortune , remodeled for the portrait . About the foot of the dress which she wore was a real pearl fringe , intermingled with amethysts and rubies . I was sorry in the picture that I had so little liberty in the way of shadows and of posing the figure . The face had to be painted as a single mass of color . If I had not been compelled to observe Chinese conventions so closely , the picture would . have shown a finer-looking woman , and- it would have been more like her . Yet it is a good likeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much smaller , for the copyright . Among the multitude of details were the long finger nails of her Majesty , which I tried faithfully to portray . The long finger nail , of course , is a mark of rank in China . No one else except ladies of high rank can let the nails grow in this way . They cultivate the third and fourth fingers particularly , and wear jeweled shields of jade or gold over them . Before the Boxer troubles , Her Majesty 's nails were much longer than they ever became afterward . In her hasty departure from Pekin after the allies came in her nails were so injured that they had to be cut . Their length at the time of the picture was only about three inches . The picture was considered sacred from the time it was begun . Whenever I was not at work on it , it was covered with a yellow screen and put reverently away .. If any of the eunuchs past thru the room while I was painting , they never failed to make obeisance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empress herself . They told me , too , that they felt the same awe when they stood before the picture that they would have felt in her presence . The portrait was interrupted by many festivals and ceremonies , so that the work was greatly lengthened . For the Chinese New Year I had to stop for two weeks . But I never had more consideration shown to me by any one whose portrait I have painted , and my recollections of the hours spent with this wise and great ruler will be among the happiest memories of my life .
