MUSCULAR movement is almost synonymous with life . The essence of life is movement . Paralyze our muscles and we are dead . More than that , paralyze our voluntary muscles only and we might as well be , for we can neither move , speak , nor think . Thought is a function of muscle . It could neither originate nor continue without words , and words are made by muscle . Homo alains is separated from home sapiens solely by a little special manual training . For the real origin of speech is not sound , but gesture . And it was the changing of the paw into a hand capable of wielding a club that made oratory possible . There is , then , little danger of any physiologist underrating exercise . Tie knows too well that it has not only built the body , including the brain , in the past , but is its chief supporter in the present . Muscle makes up nearly half ( forty-three per cent. ) of our bulk , almost three times es much as any other tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk . The brain is simply a telephone exchange to carry out the business of muscle . The bulk of our food is consumed in the muscle-cells , and two-thirds of our vital heat is produced by them . The only way to nourish the brain is through the muscles . Destroy a group of them and the area of the brain cortex , which attends to its business , wastes and atrophies at once . It is therefore not on account of any lack of respect for the importance of muscle or any tendency to classify it as a relatively low-grade tissue as compared with brain that I wish to say a few words in regard to the dangers from its overuse . On the contrary , it is its high rank in the organism that makes its abuse so dangerous ; and there is an even more vital reason for a note of warning . This is that muscular tissue is the only tissue in the body which is under the direct VOL. cxIV. ? No. 5S5 .. - 76control of our will , as is implied in its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach to serve a certain quality and flavor of gastric juice , or your liver to secrete a certain color of bile , and keep on ordering , with about as much result as whistling down the wind . You have absolutely no control over your heart-beat . You can not stop breathing beyond the point of a very moderate degree of suffocation . You can not even stop your . brain from thinking ; all you can do is change the subject some-times . But you can order practically any voluntary muscle in your body to contract , and it springs to your service at once , and will keep on obeying you until it fails from sheer exhaustion . It is on this account that the muscular system is so peculiarly defenceless and liable to abuse ? because it is under the will , or reason , instead of instinct . A man can not add a cubit , or even en inch , to his height by taking thought , but he can increase the girth of his biceps or the expansion of his chest , the lifting-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid between voluntary and involuntary muscle , the heart , from twenty to fifty per cent . Muscle is the one tissue through which a man can directly modify and change his body . Naturally , therefore , in all our unscientific methods of bodily culture , and they are innumerable , increasing the vigor and size of the muscles is made the chief end and criterion of progress . While this increase may he attended by general bodily improvement in seventy per cent . of all cases , in the other thirty per cent . the real vigor and resisting power of the body may have been moving in the opposite direction , and this is where physiology must . lift its note of warning . Probably the greatest danger of exercise for most of my readers lies in the direction of their not getting enough of it . But this is by no means true of the community as a whole . Two-thirds of the total community get a great deal too much muscular exercise and suffer for it . Honest toil is not the unmitigated blessing that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By the sweat of thy brow , " as a curse , has some truth in it . The very voluntariness of muscular effort has permitted its abuse . There is a certain and fairly definite limit to the amount of food which even the wealthiest individual can consume . We are utterly unable to force more air into our system than the tissues demand and can utilize . But the work that we can impose on the muscles has absolutely no limit except that of utter exhaustion . There is , of course , an instinct called fatigue , which tells us when we have labored enough , but our whole training from the cradle up has been to make us not only disregard this indication , but esteem its ignoring a virtue . The man who stops work just because he is tired is generally deemed a lazy , shiftless good-for-nothing ; the man who stops eating because he feels satisfied is a rational , praiseworthy being . As a result , muscular effort has been pushed to extremes , both in amateur athletics and in daily toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness in considerable amounts , it has been made physically injurious and mentally degrading . Trades-unions were overwhelmingly right when they demanded as the first prerequisite for the mental , moral , or physical improvement of the laboring-man a shortening of the hours of toil . Nothing more degrading or benumbing to all that is best in human nature has ever been devised than the grinding . treadmill routine of muscular labor which was exacted of the laboring world fifty years ago , and is yet exacted to day in regions where laborers are unable to protect themselves . Particularly is this true in the rural districts . Aly attention was first called to this some twenty years ago , on beginning the practice of medicine in a well-to-do country district . I was simply astonished at the number of intelligent and independent farmers , owning their own land but driven by the lash of the mortgage , who were little better than physical wrecks at the age offorty-five . I had known , of course , as a mere matter of text-book knowledge , that the average longevity of farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both lower than that of business and professional men ; but this was an unexpectedly vivid illustration . From that time I have watched carefully the limits of physical vigor in farmers , ranchers , lumbermen , miners , section-hands , and others engaged in prolonged and excessive muscular exertion , and have been surprised to find how rarely individuals over forty years of age are still able to do a full day 's work . Between forty-five and fifty our farmer is pretty certain to be a broken man , though still retaining good color , good appetite , and fairly vigorous appearance . I have also compared notes with my brother practitioners , and find them almost invariably agreed that there are as many broken - down nervous systems , dilated hearts , fibrotic kidneys , and the supposed results of our high-tension civilization generally , to be found in quiet rural districts as in the city . The death-rate in the country is now only a fraction of a per cent . lower than that in our greatest cities , slums and all . Farmers ' wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , chiefly from overwork , overworry , and lack of proper amusements and recreation . Any one who has lived on a farm does not need to be told the reason , for he knows of the strain under which the American farmer lives during the five months of spring and summer . His workday is from four or five in the morning until eight or nine at night , including chores ? fifteen to seventeen hours of the hardest kind of physical labor , and every minute of it at high tension , especially during harvest . Then comes a period of relaxation in the fall , the one time in the year when he has just enough muscular exercise to keep ldin in health . Later , the winter season , approaching stagnation , in which he takes on flesh , gets " logy , " and then a furious debauch of hard labor through the spring and summer again . No wonder that by forty-five he has had a sunstroke and " ca n't stand the heat , " or has " a weak back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a chill " makes him rheumatic " ; and when you add to this EXERCISE AND Anions muscular strain the fact that the farmer sees his income put in peril every season , and Lis very home every bad year , so that each unfavorable change in the weather sets his nerves on . edge , it can be . readily imagined that the real " quiet , peaceful country life " is something sadly different from the ideal . The same conditions prevail among the working classes in our great cities , except where the eight-hour law has been put in force . It has long been known that the laboring classes have a low average longevity and a high disease and death rate , and they are subject to an enormous number of diseases from which , according to popular impression , their " active , natural life " ought to have protected them . The percentage of cases of Bright 's disease , of heart - disease , of nervous breakdown , of insanity , is higher among them than in any of the so-called leisure classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overwork is a far more potent factor in their production than drunkenness . The injurious effect of city life consists not merely in overcrowding or the increased development of infectious diseases , but especially in the outrageous and abominable overworking of the laboring classes . Overwork and underfeeding have been recognized for half a century as the chief causes of the large death-rate of the laboring classes as compared with the well-to-do . Even with all the improvements that have been effected in the condition of the laboring classes , the last United States census ( 1900 ) still shows the highest death-rate among them of any " earning " class-20.2 per thousand . Farmers came next with 17.6 , as compared with mercantile and trading classes at 12.1 per thousand , and clerical and official at 13.5 . Thus laborers have a death-rate sixty-six per cent . higher than that of business men , and farmers forty-five per cent . higher . Overwork and overcrowding are alike responsible for the frightful tribute paid by these same classes to the Great White Plague . The improvement that occurs in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not suffering from some injury or acute disease , simply from being put at rest in a well-ventilated room and given a moderate amount of nourishing food , is really astonishing . It is an open secret that in most of the chronic diseases brought to our hospitals in the large cities it makes little or no difference what medicine is given during the first week or ten days ; the patients will improve . on any medicine or on none at all . Of course a proper amount of work is not only necessary to existence , but highly beneficial both physically , mentally , and morally , yet this should never exceed certain well-defined limits . The communal conscience has now agreed to the eight-hour day , and I venture to prophesy that within twenty years ' time it will be reduced to six , and that this will be found to be the limit of bodily labor consistent both with health and profit . It might simply be mentioned in passing that it has been abundantly proven that this change is not merely healthful for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more work done in the month , but a far better quality . There are less waste , less sickness , less drinking , fewer absences from work . The United States , which pays the highest wages and has the shortest average hours , has the lowest labor cost per article produced of any country in the world . At the other end of the scale , Italy , with the longest day and the lowest wages , has the highest per cent . of labor cost . I merely wish to raise a note of warning against the impression which seems to prevail in sociologic circles that work at reasonable wages is the complete solution of the labor problem , and that there is little danger of any one getting too much of it , unless he be actually diseased , or defective . From the voluntary nature of his toil the civilized laboring min works harder and longer than any known beast of burden or any serf can be made to do . An intelligent conservation of his energies will abundantly repay both the laborer and employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest average longevity is not among farmers , but among professional and business men . The finest physical specimens of humanity that are to be found in America are not among farmers or day-laborers of any description , but among the children or grandchildren of these classes , who have been brought up in smaller towns or in the suburbs of larger cities . While it is true that the strain and pressure and crowding of city life have been an injurious factor in our racial development , this is only , so to speak , at the lower end of the scale , among the slum and day-laboring classes . The classes of higher intelligence and reasonably comfortable circumstances , including skilled artisans , municipal business employees , and those engaged in " personal services , " have been improved instead of injured by it . This can be seen at a glance when the records of our champion athletic performances are examined . The majority of our football and baseball teams and two-thirds of the winners in athletic contests will be found to conic from this relatively small class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency in recent years for city people to make their homes in the country , rendered possible by electric cars , automobiles , and other forms of rapid transit , is both a sign of increasing hygienic intelligence and an admirable factor in the betterment of the racial health . The country is the best place for children , but the finest adult development , physical as well as intellectual , will be secured in the city . In fact , we have been , both popularly and professionally , under the same delusion with regard to the contrast between country and city dwellers as to that between the savage and civilized man . The general impression is that the savage is a perfect animal , almost free from diseases , and living to a great age . As a matter of fact , civilized man is a far superior animal to any known tribe of savages ; he lives longer , is healthier and happier . He has , it is true , more diseases , but lie resists them infinitely better . The reason in both cases is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night-prowlers and night-demons that he makes his but about as near like a prison or an iron safe as he can . Civilized man sleeps in comfortable , well ventilated bedrooms . The savage never knows what his supply of food is going to be . It is always either a feast or a famine with him ? more commonly the latter . The exercise of the savage consists in violent and furious bouts of either fighting , or escaping from orchasing his prey or his enemy , followed by long periods of idleness and torpor . His water-supply is ofen bad . He is unable to protect himself from the weather . He has infinitely less control over his environment than has civilized man . The same comparison may be made step by step between the farmer and the average city dweller . Farmers ' bedrooms are usually built chiefly for warmth and are close and stuffy . As some one has said , " The air in the country is always good , for the farmers keep all the bad air shut up in their bedrooms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sell . It takes them all winter to recover from the work-debauch of each summer . The city man , with his well-ventilated house , good supply of water , good drainage , regular hours , moderate muscular exercise and good food-supply , is under more favorable conditions physically . And his lessened amount of enforced exercise is not the least beneficial of his changes . Those city dwellers who work hardest and longest with their muscles have invariably the highest death-rate . To sum up very briefly , about one-half of the enforced muscular exercise imposed upon civilized man is beneficial ; the other half is either neutral or injurious . Now as to the voluntary muscular exercise which is indulged in under the name of physical culture , athletics , or some similar title . The chief dangers in this are a lack of proper appreciation of what tissues should be developed by exercise , and failure to recognize the great fact that the value of exercise depends not so much upon its quantity as upon its quality . The general impression of the majority of athletic trainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of most gymnasium teachers ( until within the past ten years ) , is that the chief thing is to develop huge and misshapen masses of muscle . The ideal man in their scheme is he who can stand in front of a camera and contort the muscles of his hack until they writhe out like a basket of snakes , or can split his coat-sleeve by contracting the overgrown biceps , or lift six hundred pounds clear of the floor . Such an individual may have a vigorous constitution , but he is as abnormal and as unsymmetrically developed as the string-muscled , fiatchested bookkeeper , and may be a much poorer life risk . As a matter of fact , that type of human ox , the " strong man , " is not only not a better animal than the average man , but a poorer . The fact of his being able to get such a muscular development is proof of abnormality . Now that athletic records have been carefully investigated by the medical profession , we find that the champion athlete is extremely short-lived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also of the lungs . If he marries , he has few children , and they are seldom above the average physically . In fact , he compares with the average man about as a Clydesdale draught-horse compares with a Morgan or an English thoroughbred . Nor is this state of affairs confined to the professional athlete . Every physician who has practised in or near a university town can point to a dozen athletic young men who have been seriously injured by muscular exercise . Particularly is this true of overstraining and hypertrophic disease of the heart muscle . A recent study of the boys " in. training " at a Western academy , by the school physician , showed that over sixty per cent . had cardiac murmurs . Prolonged and fatiguing exercises , taken not for any enjoyment in them , but as a matter of conscience , " to build muscle , " are distinctly dangerous . In fact , the medical profession is coming generally to regard college and high-school athletics , as now practised , as a menace to the health of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college men took their sport like gentlemen , and the later life-records made by the Oxford and Cambridge ' varsity crews are still quoted by health journals . Nowadays , however , the results are widely different ; and suifieient data have accumulated in proof thereof . Take , for instance , the data collected by Dr. Robert Coughlin* upon the causes of the deaths among athletes for the year 1905 . First , of all of the 128 athletes who died during the year , 78 died from injuries received , and only 50 from disease -- -a huge inherent mortality to begin with . But the nature of the diseases which caused the fifty natural deaths is even * The Medical Record ( New York ) ; June 2 , 1906-more significant ; for , contrary to popular impression , the death-rate from infectious diseases among these picked specimens , these prides of their clubs and colleges , was nearly double that of the other adult males of the community . For comparison Dr. Coughlin selected the deaths that year among the policyholders in one of our large insurance companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition as the athletes . The contrast is so striking that I shall put the figures in parallel columns . In non-infectious diseases likely to be due to strain the contrast is even more striking , especially when we recall the probable higher average age of the policyholders , in connection with the fact that these diseases are far more frequent in later life . In short , athletes are , according to these figures , two and one-half times as liable to cardiac diseases , sixty per cent . more liable to diseases of the kidney , and twenty-five per cent . more liable to die of the three main infectious diseases of adult life ? pneumonia , consumption , and typhoid ? than the average of their fellows . Instead of increasing their power of resistance to disease , their boasted training has apparently reduced it . It may be justly objected that this conclusion does not necessarily follow , because this list includes a considerable percentage of professional athletes , who are often of low physical type , and bad life-risks to begin with . But a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in number , prepared in defence of athletics , shows that tuberculosis was the highest cause of death , with pneumonia second . While only seven per cent . of the deaths among the policy-holders were from accidents and injuries , sixty-one per cent . of the athletes died from these causes ? an enormous preponderance , even after allowing liberally for the greater probability of public report of deaths due to accidental causes over those due , to natural causes . Furthermore , Dr. Coughlin finds , what my own investigations had also led me to believe , that " the average age at death of athletes is far below that of the average person in the ordinary walks of life . " The actual average age at death of this series was only 2G.2 years , as against an average of 57.2 years in all persons dying after fifteen years of age , according to the last United States census . These figures will be supported by the experience of a majority of intelligent college physicians . I might , perhaps , be permitted to say , to forestall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these matters , that for two years during my medical-atudent days I was one of the executive committee of the University Athletic Association and a member of the football team ; for three years medical director of a g.yinnasium , and for eighteen years connected with the faculties of colleges and universities in the Middle West , the East , in England , and on the Pacific Coast , with students under my professional care almost constantly . In my judgment , the champion athlete , so far from . being an ideal type , a standard to aim at , is rather a necessary evil , apparently inseparable from the competitive system of athletics now in vogue . This is not to condemn athletics by any means ; only their abuse . The whole trouble lies in false ideals and ignorance of the real aim of bodily training . The real tissues to he developed in athletic training are not the muscles , but the heart and the nervous system . This is clearly recognized and eagerly urged by intelligent , scientific gymnasium trainers , like Sargent of Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but their leaven has reached but little of the mass of undergraduates end members of athletic clubs as yet . The heaviest strain of exercise is thrown not on the muscles , but on the heart and blood-vessels . This has always been recognized by the profession and admitted by the more intelligent trainers . In en athlete under training , the heart . is markedly increased not merely in vigor , but even in size ? hypertrophied , as we call it . A certain amount of this hypertrophy is healthful and normal ; a deer , for instance , has more than twice as large a heart in proportion to its body weight as a cow , and a race-horse nearly twenty-five per cent . larger than a drayhorse , proportionally . But we are finding out , first , that this hypertrophy may be easily driven beyond normal limits , and that the large heart of the athlete often contains inflammatory exudate ? is swollen from congestion , to put it roughly . Second , that this large heart , whether normal or diseased , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink again . This shrinking is brought about by a fatty degeneration and absorption of both the inflammatory exudate and the surplus muscle-fibres , and if it goes a stop too far , may become one of our most insidious and dangerous cardiac diseases ? fatty degeneration of the heart . Whatever the mechanism of its production , all authorities are agreed that heart-disease is peculiarly common among athletes , soldiers , lumber-jacks , miners , and men whose occupations involve severe muscular effort . The entire system of blood-vessels shares in this liability , and arteriosclerosis is unusually prevalent among these classes . Let the heart , then . be carefully watched in training , and at the least permanent quickening of the pulse , the slightest cardiac nervousness , the first appreciable outward swing of the apex beat , showing hypertrophy , let the amount of exercise be cut down . The next organ to be trained is the stomach . Naturally the more work our body-engine does , the more fuel must be shovelled under its boilers . Many athletes in training " go stale , " lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nervous , hysterical . These again are danger-signals , and call for cutting down the exercise ration . You ca n't get ten horse-power work out of a five horsepower furnace and boiler . A man 's capacity for development is limited by his stomach . Last but not least , training should be aimed at the nervous system . It is astonishing how long we have ignored this . when , as a matter of fact , fully onethird if not one-half even of pure athletic training is training of the nervous system . The mere increase in strength of a particular muscle is the smallest part . It is the rapid , accurate , purposeful combination of a dozen muscles with the eye , the ear , the sense of touch and resistance , that forms two-thirds of training . And this is done solely through the nervous system . The man who trains his muscles , trains and builds his brain . Indeed , this is the only physical method of brain-building that we know of . Of course he ca n't build up what is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the highest possibilities such potentialities of cerebral power as we were born with . Even the champion athlete has probably a better brain for his training than he would have had without it . Most of us , however , have sufficient possibilities to profitably occupy all our preadult life in developing them . This brings us to the final consideration , that it is quality of muscular effort ibat counts rather than quantity . So Thug as muscular effort , is strengthening the heart and developing the nervous system and increasing the appetite , it is doing good ; beyond this it is physiologically valueless , often harmful . however great economic or sporting value it may have . It is not difficult to determine where the dividing line falls . In fact , we have an instinct for the purpose . So long as exercise gives us pleasure , exhilaration , it is doing us good . When we cease to enjoy it , it is either neutral or harmful physically . The athlete will , and the day-laborer must , persist far beyond this line ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise is , of course , perfectly consistent with health , but of no advantage to it . All men in vigorous health enjoy exercise in some form ; and most laborers , within certain limits , enjoy their work , taking a pleasure and a pride in it . Whether it be the exhilaration of thefour-mile-an-hour swing , up hill and down dale ; the dash and smash of the tennis-court ; the clatter and whistle of the broadswords ; the swing and bite of the axe ; the swish of the scythe , the crunch of the spade under the foot , the heave and swing of the pitchfork ? there is a positive pleasure in vigorous exertion . In fact , in the last analysis , pleasure consists in responding to stimuli , doing things , easily , with a sense of reserve force , of power to spare . In other words , physically profitable exercise must partake of the nature of play . Nature nowhere shows a subtler wisdom than in the play instinct . The baby , like the fabled bear-cub , is born a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conflict whatever between bodily training and mental . They are part of one single scheme of development . Keep children growing physically , and answer their questions , and their minds will take care of themselves . The chief duty of the school-room is to keep out of the way of Nature 's University , the open air . In fine , development to be healthful must he symmetrical . You can not profitably develop the body apart from the mind , or the mind apart from the body , or either apart from " the sense in us for conduct , the sense in us for beauty . " The training which will develop the most vigorous , the most highly resisting physique , will also develop the clearest mind and the most beautiful body . Yes , and the highest sense of courtesy and chivalry . Bring to mind the Greeks and the Knights of the Round Table . One of the ebief requisites for the ideal athlete is to be a gentleman . By training like a gentleman , and treating his opponent as a gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the possible benefits of athletics . Practised properly , athletics is one of the finest schools of courage , of clean living , of high courtesy and chivalry ; of clear thinking , of beauty and symmetry of both mind and body .
