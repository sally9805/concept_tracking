txt A fire starting early last night , probably from defective insulation , between the floors of the handsome five-story mansion of Dr. Walter B. , James , at 17 West Fifty-fourth Street , sent fireman after fireman to the number of twenty altogether staggering out into the street overcome by the thick , acrid smoke It gave forth . Most of them went again and again into the building , but four had to be taken to Flower Hospital . They were : Capt . GEORGE BAUER , Engine 28 . Fireman DENNIS CARTIN , Engine 28 . Fireman EDWARD GEIGER , Truck 4 . Fireman CORNELIUS ROCK , Engine 65 . Fireman Nicholas of Truck 4 was carried half unconscious to his engine house and Capt . John Gore of Engine 54 was temporarily overcome . The four men were carried to the stoops of houses on the other side of the street and there restoratives and oxygen had to be applied by surgons from the hospital and Dr. Archer of the Fire Department before they could be brought to consciousness . Cartin was twice overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unoccupied except for Mrs. C. Tobisen , a caretaker , and her daughter , for Dr. James , with his wife and son , sailed on Wednesday on the Lusitania for Europe . Chief Lantry , who finally took charge of the fight , fixed the damage at $50,000 , but neighbors on the scene who knew Dr. ** s collection of paintings and books , and valuable medical supplies he kept there , and ins taste for fine woodwork and hangings , said the loss would be much larger . It was the caretaker who , when in a hall of the third floor , discovered the fire and telephoned to central to send in an alarm . At the same time a passerby saw , smoke pouring from the windows of a third-floor room , ran to the corner , and turned the fire box . When Battalion Chief Kane got there smoke made the whole end of the stret so dark that at first it was hard to tell where the fire was . Hardly any flame showed from the outside . Kane sent some men through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third floor  --  evidently the seat of the fire . The men were forced to halt on threshold and window sill ; there was a curious sharp odor in the smoke , as of a peculiar gas . Then , dragging the hose , they pushed in . It was but a moment before Fireman Nicholas , at the head of the hose on the third floor , dropped to the floor with the hose nozzle . Those behind , groping on the floor through black smoke , found him and passed him out , writhing and choking , to the street . Cartin went next , as he tried to push with his little group of men up the stairs from the front door . He , too , was dragged back , carried to the stoop of F. W. White 's house opposite , where Nicholas already lay . By this time firemen were being pulled ur dragged out every minute from the building , and others , a little recovered , were staggering back dizzy and sick . Ambulances were sent for . Chief Langford , with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . He sent men in with axes to tear up floors and walls so the flames could be reached . The men went readily . The crashing of their axes and the falling of glass showed their work , but one after another , Capt . John Gore , Engine 54 ; Arthur Philbin , Edward Burns , John Gardiner , and , finally , quite unconscious , Capt . George Bauer of Truck 23. and others were carried , overcome by smoke and gas , to the opposite stoops . From the University Club on the uptown corner of Fifth Avenue , and from some of the houses on the street , notably that of Col. John J. McCook , stimulants were brought and administered by the light of firemen 's lanterns . The three doctors worked hard , using oxygen and artificial respiration on the men . Fireman Curtin was taken into the basement of Dr. C , M. Cauldwell 's house at 16 West Fifty-fourth Street , and there treated . Like sixteen others , among them Edward Burns and John KInseller , he pushed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After two hours of hard fighting the floors , many of them made from inlaid wood , were sufficiently ripped up to give the hose play , and the work rapidly went forward . Chief Langford was driven back half overcome and Fireman Nicholas . disabled for the second time , dropped with leis line on the stairway from the smoke . He was dragged across the street and then taken to his station . in Fortyseveinth Street , near Eighth Avenue , by order of the Chief . The fire had run through the walls in such a way as practically to wreck the inside of the house on the upper three floors , and the lower floors , with their valuable paintings and statuary , were drenched with water . Dr. Frederick J. Barrett , who works with Dr. James . would give no. guess at the damages . He helped in reviving the stifled men . and Father hearing that Bauer might die , came up from the Cathedral . After about three hours and a half the fire was extinguished . Chief Langford spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never before met , and could not explain ; nor did he feel sure of the cause of the fire , though it had evidently started within the floors . The house stands among some of the most valuable in the city . No. 4 Is-John D. Rockefeller 's ; his son 's is at No. 13 . Chauncey M. Depew 's house is at No. 27 and J. B. Dixon 's at No. 15.
