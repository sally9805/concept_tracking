THE study of the effects which occur when a current of electricity passes through gas at a very low pressure has recently led to results having a very direct hearing on our ideas of matter and electricity . The phenomena known to physicists as the " cathode rays " have , played such an important part in these developments that a short account of them may not be without general interest , especially as the phenomena are of singular beauty , and many of them can readily be observed by any one with access to the usual appliances for producing R ? ntgen rays . When a current of electricity is sent between two wires fused in a glass tube from which the air has been exhausted until the air pressure is only an exceedingly small fraction , say one - ten - thousandth , of the atmospheric pressure , the tube presents a very striking and varied appearance , of which the general nature may be gathered from Figs. 1 and 2 . Confining our attention to the neighborhood of the wire by which the current leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the one marked ? in the figure ) , we find ( see Fig. 2 ) a velvety glow spreading over the surface of the wire ; next to this conies a space called the dark space , which is almost dark , and whose boundaries run parallel to the surface of the wire forming the cathode ; outside the dark space the gas is luminous for some distance , this luminous portion forming what is known as the negative glow . So far we have been describing the appearance of the gas left in the tube , but the gas is not the only source of light , for the glass in the part of the tube near the cathode glows with a vivid phosphorescence , the color of which depends upon the kind of glass of which the tube is made . If the glass is soda glass , the light given out is a bright yellowish-green , while with lead glass the light is blue . It is to the cause of this phosphorescence that we wish to call attention in this article . This phosphorescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics which often immediately follow improvements in the apparatus ; for it was Geissler 's improvements in air-pumps , by which air could be much more efficiently extracted from the tubes , which led to the discovery of the glow on the glass , and rendered its investigation possible . The study of the cause of the phosphorescence on the glass was commenced by Pliieker in 1859 , and carried on with great vigor by Hittorf ( 1869 ) and Goldstein ( 1876 ) in Germany , by Crookes ( 1879 ) in England , and by Puluj in Austria . It was soon found that the phosphorescence was produced by something coming from the neighborhood of the cathode , for a solid placed between the cathode and the walls of the tube cast a shadow on the tube ; an example of this effect is shown in Fig. 3 , where the shadow is caused by a Maltese cross made of mica ( Fig. 3 ) , placed between the cathode and the tube : the shape of the shadow shows that the cause of the phosphorescence travels in straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , at right angles to the surface of the cathode , so that if the cathode is shaped like a bowl , there is a great concentration of the effect at the centre ( Fig. 4 ) . The name " cathode rays " for the agent producing the phosphorescence is due to Goldstein ; and although now , in consequence of the universal acceptance of the undulatory theory of light , a ray is generally associated in the minds of physicists with an undulatory motion in the ether , this association is only accidental , and there is no necessary eonnection between a ray and undulatory motion ; indeed , Nelson uses the term in connection with his corpuscular theory of light , and the cathode rays , as we shall see , have an extraordinary resemblance to the conditions postulated in that theory for a ray . The cathode rays have many very interesting properties . They heat up a body on which they fall , and by concentrating them by using a bowl-shaped cathode like that shown in Fig. 4 , a piece of platinum foil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even a diamond charred . Again , the rays , when they strike against an object , tend to push it away , the object behaving just as if it were struck by a stream of particles coming from the cathode . This is prettily shown in the experiment due to Sir William Crookes , represented in Fig. 5 , when the impact of the rays makes the little carriage move from one end to the other of the rails . The phosphorescence of the glass of the tube is an example of a very general phenomenon , for very many substances when struck by the rays phosphoresce brightly , giving out a light peculiar to the substance : for example ( Fig. 0 ) , the rare earth yttria emits when exposed to these rays light having a peculiar citron band on its spectrum , and it was by the characteristic light given out under these rays that Sir William Crookes was able to study and isolate some of the rarer dements . Again , some substances , such as common salt , experience a peculiar change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a pretty violet-blue , looking almost like gems ? the color is unfortunately somewhat fugitive if the crystals arc exposed to a moist atmosphere . Some , however , in my possession , which have been kept dry , are still blue , although they are now nearly four years old . An even more subtle change is pro-duced by the rays in some mixtures of salts , such as a mixture of sulphate of valciutu with a little sulphate of man-ganese . This mixture is not altered in appearance by the rays , but for some time after its exposure it bursts into a vivid greenish glow when slightly heated ; this effect , which was discovered by Professor E. Wiedemaii , is called thereto-lumines-cence . Glass , too , is changed by a long exposure to the rays ; it gets as it were tired , and loses to a considerable extent its powers of phosphorescing . A piece of tarnished copper is rapidly cleaned by the rays . They produce , too , a very remark-able change in the rare-fied gas in the tube as they pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rays are not passing through it , is an insulator , becomes a conductor of electricity as soon as it is trav-ersed by them ; the path of the rays is marked by luminosity in the gas , and can thus be followed by the eye . By means of this luminosity , or by the phosphorescence on the glass , it can easily be proved that although under ordinary circumstances the path of the cathode rays is a straight line , it is not so when the rays are exposed to the action of a magnet ; this makes the path curved , and bends it up or down , to one side or the other , according to the direction of the magnetic force . This effect is illustrated in Fig. 7 , where the straight horizontal beam shows the path when there is no magnet near the rays , the curved beam the path when the rays travel between the poles of a horseshoe magnet , producing a magnetic force at right angles to the path of the ray : the bending of the rays is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application , due to Braun , of the bending of the rays under magnetic force is coming into extensive use in electrical engineering , where it is sometimes necessary to study magnetic forces which are rapidly changing . Ordinary magnets are useless for this purpose , as they are much too heavy to follow the vagaries of the magnetic force , but the cathode rays , having practically no mass , are able to follow the changes in the force no matter how rapid they may be , and by watching the movements of the rays we can deduce the behavior of this force . The most widely known property of the cathode rays is that of producing R ? ntgen rays ; the cathode rays are the parents of the R ? ntgen rays , for the latter are produced whenever the cathode rays strike against a solid obstacle . The cathode and R ? ntgen rays have many points of resemblance ; they both affect a photographic plate , they both cause substances against which they strike to phosphoresce , and they both make gas through which they pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we shall see , have some power of penetrating opaque solids , though this is small compared with that possessed by the R ? ntgen rays ; the essential differences between the two rays are that the Ili:intgen rays are not deflected by a magnet , nor by an electric force , nor do they carry with them a charge of electricity . Physicists until three or four years ago were very much divided in opinion as to the nature of the cathode rays ; the German physicists , with very few exceptions , held that these were something of the nature of waves in the ether , with which matter had nothing to do . The English physicists were , I think , unanimous in regarding the cathode rays as due to particles of gas charged with negative electricity , and projected with great velocity from the cathode : they pointed out how readily this view explained the mechanical and thermal effects produced by the rays , and their deflection by a magnet . Varley in 1870 seems to have been the first to suggest the occurrence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps doubtful whether he was referring specifically to the cathode rays . The charged particles were used by Crookes to explain and co-ordinate the very striking results obtained by him in his experiments on this sub ject . Interest in this controversy was much stimulated by a discovery made by Hertz in ise . Hertz showed that solids were not , as had been supposed , absolutely impenetrable by these rays ; for he proved that the rays could pass through gold - leaf and produce phosphorescence on glass behind it . This seemed a formidable objection to the view that the cathode rays were charged particles , for though examples of the penetration of solids by gases are nut wanting ? for instance , hydrogen can readily pass through red-hot platinum , and even a liquid like water can be forced by great pressure through gold ? yet Hertz 's discovery was undoubtedly much more favorable to the ether view than to the particle one , as no person had suggested that these particles were other than the molecules or atoms of the gas in the tube . Hertz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a tube which had in it a small window of very thin aluminium foil . Shooting the cathode rays against this window , he found that they penetrated it and got outside the tube , where they could be much more easily investigated . Lenard was thus the first physicist to cross the Rubicon between the inside and the outside of the tube , and for this reason the cathode rays outside the tube are generally called Lenard rays . From this time , however , all the evidence began to go in favor of the particle theory . In 1806 a young French physicist , M. Perrin , showed that the cathode rays carried a charge of negative electricity with them , and in 1897 the writer showed that they were deflected by an electric force just as if they were negatively electrified . After these results it could hardly be doubted that the cathode rays were really negatively electrified particles , and the difficulty in the way of this view , due to the penetration of solids by the rays , was explained by some experiments made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charged particles , the charge carried by them , and their velocity were measured . These measurements showed that the particles in the cathode rays are not ordinary atoms or molecules at all , but something very much smaller , for the mass of each of these particles is only about one- thousandth part of that of the atom of hydrogen , the smallest mass hitherto recognized . Investigations made by Wiechert , Kaufmann , and Lenard have led to the same conclusion . Nor is this extreme smallness the only remarkable feature about these particles ; for it was found that whatever might be the nature of the gas in the tube , or whatever metal was used for the cathode , the mass of the particles remained the same . Thus in these particles we have something possessing the properties of ordinary matter , having a definite mass , which is yet exceedingly small compared with the mass of any known element ; the particles of this new kind of matter thus correspond to a very much finer state of subdivision than that of ordinary matter into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a feature of great interest . These speeds have been measured , and are found to be so enormous that the velocity of the swiftest bullet is quite insignificant in comparison : the speed of the particles depends upon the electric force which can be applied to the tube , and this changes with the amount of gas left in it ; but a particle which did not move with a velocity more than a thousand times that of the swiftest cannon ball , which is about two thousand miles per hour , would be one of the slowest of its species . The only velocity with which we can compare that of these particles is the velocity of light , which is about 186,000 miles per second ? and cathode particles have been observed in the tube having a velocity as much as onethird of this . Thus in the tube near the cathode we have bodies smaller than atoms moving with prodigious velocities , a state of things which recalls Newton 's corpuscular theory of light , according to which light consists of very small particles ( corpuscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although this theory of light has long since been abandoned , Newton 's conception is realized in the cathode rays ; and 1 have ventured to call the small particles which constitute these rays corpuscles . Matter in the corpuscular state is not confined to the cathode rays in an exhausted tube , for when a metal wire is made white hot in a good vacuum , matter in this state is given off . It is also given off when the metal , instead of being made red hot , is exposed to a bright light . In both these cases we get negative electricity in the gas round the wire ; in fact , whenever we have negative electricity in a gas at a very low pressure , where there is very little matter in the ordinary state for it to stick to , we find the electricity is carried by the corpuscles . When the pressure of the gas is not low , the corpuscles get entangled with and ultimately adhere to the molecules of the gas , so that if we wish to get mutter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas as we can ; then we find that the negative electricity is always carried by these corpuscles , which are of the same kind however the electricity may have been produced . The case is very different with positive electricity , for when the mass of the carriers of the positive electricity in a gas at a low pressure is measured , it is found to be the same as that of an ordinary molecule , and to depend upon the kind of gas in the tube ; thus positive
