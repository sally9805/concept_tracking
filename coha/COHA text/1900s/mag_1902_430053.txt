The notable volume on Philip Freneau , his life and times , by Miss Mary S. Austin , illustrates one gratifying result of the activity of such organizations as the Daughters of the American Revolution , viz. , an increased interest in the study of our early national life and letters . These societies , themselves resulting from an impulse to study the early years of our  | country , have in their turn done much to arouse interest in the study and preservation of family records , antiquities , and all other memorials of our ancestors . Such interest must be the inevitable result of volumes like the one before us . The life of Philip Freneau , as told by Miss Austin , is an interesting story . The outlines of his life have been set forth several times already ; fifteen authors , it is stated in the preface , have written upon the subject . Miss Austin has had the advantage over all of them , however , in having the use of some unexpected data in the form of notebooks and marginal notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccounted-for years in the poet 's life , and have served to link together the portions already given to the public , as well as to correct many misstatements . " In the first fifty pages of the book ? a large part , some will say ? are set forth the effect of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the consequent Huguenot emigration ; followed by a description of New Amsterdam and early New York , and an account of the early Huguenot settlement there . Fortunate indeed for the city was the coming of these thrifty and pious settlers . In the little Eglise du St. Esprit , at the corner of King and Nassau Streets , worshipped the ancestors of some of our foremost citizens . To quote the words of Dr. Vermilye ( Huguenot Soc . Proc. , i. 26 ) : " They were the yeast in the Dutch cake . They were inventive ; skilled in various workmanship ; persistent in overcoming difficulties ; of a sprightly cheerfulness and an instinctive gentility . They were educated , ? had even founded a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic fierce winds of persecution had torn from the native tree , only to sprout again , the same religious people , wherever they touched ground . It was a good and hardy stock . " These words suffice to indicate the general character of Philip Freneau 's ancestors . His grandfather , Andre Fresneau , who settled in New York in 1707 , was engaged in the shipping and foreign trade , and was a prominent resident of lower Broadway , in his day an aristocratic part of the city : Miss Austin 's account of his children , by the way , is anything but clear . Who are Thomas , Louis , and Francois ( p. 63 ) ? We can only infer that they were brothers of Pierre and Andre junior , and uncles of Philip , the poet . If this is true , the customary statement that Pierre had but one brother , Andre , is of course inaccurate . Of the business and character of Pierre ( who , say Duyckinck and others , was a wine-merchant like his brother Andre ) , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five chil- dren , first saw the light in Frankfort Street , New York , on January 2 ( O. S. ) , 1752 ; but before the year was over his father had removed to the estate in Monmouth County , New Jersey , where the boy 's early years were passed . Philip was doubtless precocious ; and we may well believe that , possessing the advantages of refined surroundings and a careful training , he began to write when very young . But we can not suppose , as Miss Austin apparently does ( p. 70 ) , that " The Wild Honeysuckle " ( which Professor Bronson rightly pronounces " the high-water mark of American poetry of the eighteenth century " ) was the work of a mere boy . No tyro , we think , could write , " They died ? nor were those flowers more gay , The flowers that did in Eden bloom . " We have only to compare this piece with the poems which are known to have been Freneau 's early work ? " Discovery , " " Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dying Elm , " and others ? to see the advance he had made in freeing himself from conventional and artificial forms of expression . It is to be remembered , too , that these verses are not to be found in the first collection of his poems , published in 1786 . The college life at Nassau Hall , Princeton , in the days when Freneau was a student there , ? rooming with James Madison , destined to be the fourth President , ? is described as fully , probably , as the materials will permit . The rising bell rang at five o'clock and a half-hour was allowed for dressing , after which came prayers ; but from these the small boys were excused in winter . Breakfast came at eight ; recitations , from nine till one ; then all dined together , at three tables . From three to five , more study ; then evening prayers , and supper at seven . At nine the bell rang for study . " After nine any might go to bed , but to go before was reproachful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required to attend public worship , both morning and afternoon . In spite of this rigorous training , however , there were occasional delinquencies . Philip Fithian writes to his father ( January 13 , 1772 ) : " I am sorry that I may inform you , that two of our Members were expelled from the College yesterday ; not for Drunkenness , nor Fighting , nor for Swearing , nor Sabbath-Breaking ; But they were sent from this Seminary , where the greatest Pains and Care are taken to cultivate and encourage Decency , &; Honesty , &; Honour , for stealing Hens ! Shameful , mean , unmanly Conduct ! "  | Liberal doses of Latin , Greek , Hebrew , logic , and moral philosophy were administered ; yet along with these Freneau found time for reading and for much writing of verse , some of which certainly possesses great merit . At his graduation in 1771 , be presented by proxy an argument showing " that ancient poetry excels the modern . " President Witherspoon was a loyal patriot , and his students were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonists . In these college years , Freneau received the vocation which was to earn for him the well-deserved title of " the Patriot Poet of the Revolution . " His pen became " his bayonet , and its wounds were mortal . " The Revolutionary years are well set forth . At times , possibly , the author draws too largely upon her imagination ; and she sometimes ( as on page 123 ) turns almost abruptly from the most stirring scenes to narrate some bit of family history , relatively unimportant ; indeed her excursions into the genealogy of the Provost , Ledyard , Scott , and other families , while entertaining , do not add to our knowledge of the poet Freneau or of the events which inspired his poems , and therefore really mar the unity of the book . But she has made skilful use of the scanty materials at her disposal , and has woven a lively and , in the main , doubtless , a reliable narrative of Freneau 's operations during the struggle with England . And a busy , stirring life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , privateer , playing " sad havoc with the English merchantmen " ; captive on board " The Scorpion " and " The Hunter " ; his pen ever busy with those terrible satires which revealed such intense hatred of foreign misrule of a proud-spirited people . King " Log , " " the Nero of our times " ; " the ruffian Gage " ; Cornwallis , " hatch 'd by some demon on a stormy day " ; Bute and North , " twin sons of hell , " ? all came in for a share of his lively and withering ridicule . Perhaps there is no more remarkable collection of its kind in existence than Freneau 's " Poems Relating to the , American Revolution , " which Duyckinek edited in 1865 . The influence his verses must have exerted on the disheartened patriots is incalculable . , , From Concord to Yorktown , during the bleak winter at Valley Forge , and round the camp-fires on Temple Hill , his verses encouraged the desponding soldiers . The newspapers widely published them , and they were written on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted in some conspicuous place to be memorized . And not alone by the camp-fire did they accomplish their work , but even on the field ; his earnestness and zeal encouraged the patriots to greater efforts , or urged them on at the point of his bayonet ( the pen ) when he saw any signs of their lagging behind ; and afterwards he immortalized the victories they won . Not a memorable incident either by land or by water escaped his ever watchful and unwearied pen . " The war over , Freneau 's muse continued to be active , but brooded often on more peaceful themes . In 1787 , for example , he contributed no fewer than twelve poems to " The American Museum , " among them " The Death Song of a Cherokee Indian , " " To the Memory of Col. John Laurens , " and " Lines Occasioned by a Visit to an Old Indian Burying Ground . " Notwithstanding frequent mercantile voyages to the West Indies , " Captain " Freneau found time to prepare and publish ( 1786 ? 88 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , giving up the sea , he turned to journalism . The true position of " The National Gazette " was first clearly explained in 1895 by the late Paul Leicester Ford ( " The Nation , " lx. 143 ) . Doubtless Jefferson told the truth when in his letter to Washington he protested that he never influenced Freneau nor wrote for " The Gazette , " and it is hard not to accept Freneau 's affidavit of August 8 , 1792 ; but , as Mr. Ford conclusively shows , they could not have told the whole truth . Not merely was " The Gazette " to furnish " a juster view of the affairs of Europe than could be obtained from any other public source " ; it was , in reality , also to serve as a partisan organ for the Republicans . It amply fulfilled its mission ; its bitter animosity to the administration caused Washington great annoyance , while in the view of Jefferson and his followers it " saved the Constitution , which was fast galloping into monarchy . " It is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to comprehend the extremes to which men were then carried by partisan feeling ; yet , after all , milder editorials from the author of " MacSwiggen " and " The British Prison Ship " would have surprised us . At the early age of forty-one , Freneau retired to his estate at Mount Pleasant , where be was to spend the second half of his life in seclusion . Of this period of his life we have few records , much having perished in the disastrous fire of October 18 , 1818 . We know that he wrote much poetry , and put out three more editions of it ( 1797 , 1809 , 1815 ) ; that he dabbled in journalism and made almanacs ; that he again turned to the sea and made many voyages to the West Indies ; that  | he entertained many old friends , visited much in New York and Philadelphia , and conducted a large correspondence . In the main , he lived the peaceful life of a country gentleman , bearing malice toward none , beloved by many and respected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Freneau 's poetry , quoting freely instead from Dr. Francis and Mr. Delancey ; and we shall not prolong this notice with critical remarks , since to what these writers and Professor Tyler have said little can be added . Freneau 's fame is secure . The greatest and most versatile of the Revolutionary group , the greatest American poet before Bryant , he has written some lines that have never been surpassed . His best verses are still read , and will long continue to give delight . A new edition of his poetry , edited by Professor Pattee , has been announced for publication this year , to which Miss Austin 's sumptuous volume will form a worthy companion . She has made the poet and his times live again for us ; and this is the test of a successful biography .  |
