txt Night closed yesterday on another roe- , ord-breaker  --  the coldest June 2 in the history of the New York Weather Bureau . All day long a cold , drizzling rain fell , accompanied by a wind that was so cold that it must have been In contact with the great field of icebergs reported about 1,000 miles east of Sandy Hook by the incoming Anchor liner Astoria . The temperature got down to 45 degrees at 10 o'clock yesterday morning . The maximum was only 51 , about noon . The lowest previous Tune record was on June ' 18 , 1881 , when the temperature was , 53 . Rain is predicted for to-day , while It may be a little warmer to-morrow . The end of the cold wave is not yet in sight . The cold wind that came with the rain at times assumed the velocity of a gale , chilling the unfortunate ones who had to be out of doors and making life in unheated houses decidedly unpleasant . Up in the Bronx the wind , during the early morning hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one instance blew down a two-story frame structure . The streets of Manhattan from the Battery to Harlem never looked more deserted than yesterday , while never in the memory of the oldest of the employes have so few persons visited the city parks on a June Sunday . At Coney Island and other seaside and river resorts the proprietors of the amusement enterprises groaned at the black eye given their business . In the Bronx , where the wind reached Its greatestvelocity about 7 A. M. , a twostory frame dwelling , in course of constructien at 170th and Bristow Streets , was lifted from the foundation and the wreckage carried to the other side of the lot , a distance of nearly fifty feet . This house , termed by some of the neighbors a " spite house , " was being erected by Joseph Roberts of 70 Lenox Avenue , to perfect his title to the property on which it was located . Heller Rubinstein , a watchman , was asleep in the house when . the wind lifted it . He got out just in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . near the Conservatory , the Lorillard Mansion trees were uproot= ' ed and a great deal of damage done to fences and shrubbery . On - Iblemport Road , in front of the Catholic Protectory , sevetal of the large trees , among the finest in the Bronx , were torn out by their roots , while fences were blown away as if they were so much pasteboard . Near Borough Hall , at 177th Street and Third Avenue , a whole section of the fence Was carried away , ? while several shanties on Third Avenue , near 182d Street , were so badly damaged by the shaking they got that every one ? f them will probably have to be torn down . Along the water front , particularly at the piers where the excursion boats stop , the scene was dreary . Only three excursion boats , it was stated , left lower Manhattan during the day , and all of these went to the Fishing Banks . It was the first June Sunday in the recollections of the oldest of the Coney Island skippers " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . It is not infrequent for the fleet of six steamboats to transport 25 , - 000 people to Coney Island on Sundays in June . Those who ? had the ** to essay a trip by water yesterday found when they arrived at the North River piers of the company big signs that read : " No boats running . Bad weather . " That told the story of the whole New York excursion fleet . Capt . Peace of the Sirius was seated on a box at Pier 1 yesterday afternoon lamenting with several of his brother , skippers the conditions that kept them idle . " It beats anything I have ever experienced , " said he , " for during all the years I have been navigating craft in this harbor I have never seen the like of this weather in June . ' We started the boats running on May 28 , and so far our business has been the worst in history . Why , on Decoration Day we did n't carry much more than 12,000 people , whereas we had expected to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in passenger service . but there are some 150 men , who make up , the crews of our boats , who must be fed and paid . I do n't believe that more than fifty people showed up here to-day for the purpose of taking the all-water trip to Coney Island , and they looked a bit ashamed when they asked us if we were selling tickets . " One boat that made trips was the little craft that plies between the Battery and the Statue of Libery . Niel Lafferty he 's been selling tickets for that trip for almost a score of years . Yesterday he deolared was the worst June Sunday he had ever experienced . The steamboat Grand Republic had been advertised to run to Newburg yesterday . and got up steam to make the trip . When the time b start came the skipper looked out of the window of the pilot house , shook his head , and murmured , " Some other Sunday maybe , but not this one . " The Grand Republio did not go . Sailor Dan , for fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hugged the little stove that bravely tried to heat the shack in which the Liberty Island tickets are sold . In all his years of service , Sailor Dan declared . there had never been a June Sunday half so bad from a weather standpoint as was yesterday . In other parts of the country the Weather Bureau reported the conditions were far below the seasonal average . The temperature at New York , Boston . Philadelphia , and Buffalo was the same at 8 A. M .. which was 48 degrees . At Chicago it wets 50 degrees , and the same in Washington . It was 114 degrees in St. Louis , 64 degrees in New Orleans , and 72 degrees In Jacksonville . The highest record was 80 degrees , at Key West , and the lowest 44 degrees , at Yellowstone . ALAS ! NO FLIES ON CONEY . A Year Ago There Were Fifty Million and Everybody Was Happy . Coney Island was a sorry-looking sight Wyegteidiy. lierceSt bad never-made it more - dreary. ? There was a howling northeaster blowing along the coast from daybreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the amusement resorts closed their doors early , as there were fewer people at the island than on some days in January . At noon the management of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company issued orders to but down the number of cars running to the island , and before nightfall the few cars that did run carried less than half a dozen passengers each . - The serious side of the situation was Shown l ) y the walling.of the small amusement resort ' and Stand owners . These men as a rule start the season on borrowed money , paying a third of the season 's rent in advance upon taking possession , a second payment after Decoration Day from the profits thus far earned , and the third payment on July 5 . This year , on account of the cold and rainy weather , there have been no profits , and as a result the small fry could not make good the second-rent payment Notheing financially able to wait for good weather conditions , many had to go out of business . Others who later will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - may be able to hold off landlords until after July 4 may be able to pull through the- season With a little money in pocket , but Coney Island landlords as a rule do n't postpone rent collections . The big business man , like the owners of the amusement parks , expect to make up for their early losses later in the season . Many of then closed down yesterday to save expenses . intending to reopen to-day if the weather , permits . The lights in Luna Park and Dreamland - were extinguished early last evening , and the few hundred people who had got in to them to keep ont of the rain , returned to their homes before 8 o'clock . Carl Kesselbach , who-Is one of the oldest Frankfurter vendors on the Island . had his own ideas about the causes that led to such inclement weather . Surrounded by a group of Greek - candy peddlers , Italian popcorn men , and German waiters Carl talked for more than an hour on the situation , declaring that " der man by Washington what makes der weather for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coney Island . " " By der first Sunday in Yune last year . " explained Carl , " ye had fifty million flies on der frankfurter stands down here . " " Der ai n't no flies ter-day , " said McCafferty , the Surf Avenue hackman . " It 's the worst day Coney ever had . There 's nothin ' but stray dogs running up and down the beach howling wid cold and taking a chance of gittin ' murdered by hiding under the ovens In the frankfurter stands . " " Ve got here no peoples even to buy a dog . " continued Carl . " It 's so cold I Unit mebbe ye git Christmas by Fourth of Yuly .

" " Well , " remarked the hackman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd want a steam-heated bathing suit trimmed with sleigh bells . " Just then-the police patrol wagon hove in sight and almost every person at Coney Island : chased through the rain to see what the - trotxbIe was : Ordinarily a dozen police : ' patrol . - wagons would n't attrg.ct Coney Island crowds . The crowd . saw two boys ' into the wagon and taken - to - the police station . What 's the charge against them ? " inquired . McCafferty . " Suspicious persons , " replied Detective Bahrman , who - had made the arrests . " I caught them spending money . " .
