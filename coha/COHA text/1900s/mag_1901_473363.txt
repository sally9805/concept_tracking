THE friend of books , in the present cataclysm of publications , is by no means without points of refuge where he may rest the sole of his foot when he ventures out of some such ark As this Magazine . Yet the surrounding welter is not so deep as it is wide , and it may be that not all these points arc the mountain-tops we might suppose from their apparent elevation . What is certain is that amidst the profusion of the bad and indifferent , we have lately had rather an abundance of the best ; so that perhaps the actual twelvemonth , when the rubbish it has produced is forgotten , may be remembered as one of the richest in our fiction . But no sooner have we said this than it seems an offence against the modesty of the authors we wish to praise , and we would like to beg the reader not to let it disadvantage them . We should be particularly sorry to ovcrsay our sense of the very uncommon quality of Miss Edith Wyatt 's book of little stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for it is literature which ought to come to the reader 's hand as nearly as possible with the bloom unbroken ( as they say of grapes ) on its beauty . The talent shown in it is of as fine promise as any which has yet originated with us , and the performance rightly ranks the author with the group of exquisite New England artists best known to us from the names of Miss Jewett , Miss Wilkins , and Miss Alice Brown ; but any who have felt the excellence of the Chicago work in fiction will not feel that the collection detaches this newest Chicago writer from a local group . Her generous kindness for the commoner facts which vulgarity ignores , her courageous novelty of observation , and her delicate security of touch , do not distinguish her work , where these gifts abound , from the work of Mr. Fuller , Mr. Payne , Mr. Ade , and Mr. Herrick , where they also abound . The peculiar note which Miss Wyatt contributes to their agreeable concert is a demure satire so controlled that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is more like Mr. Ade than the others in being a satirist , but her satire is of a different sort from his , and if it could be said that she suggests no one else without quite saying that she suggests him , that is what we should like to say , for her way of seeing the types she deals with is altogether her own . Her types are those Germans of the primary and secondary Americanization whose intrinsic goodness and sweetness she has so delightfully divined ; the smooth , rich , kind , fat Jews and Jewesses , whose aggressive cordiality she likes to contrast with the trembling and diffidence of minor American gentilities ; the poverty-stricken little intellectualities which in the wide , unheeding Western metropolis nourish themselves with the East wind in. thrice-diluted draughts of Eastern culture , and pride themselves upon their difference from their friendly , unconscious betters ; the unwitting heroes and heroines ; the frank , silly , pleasing flirts ; the simple egotists ; and the manifold shapes of commonplace with inner meanings of poetry and romance . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sheds its penetrating light upon their conditions , and they arrive in her page clad in the glad novelty which " the familiar and the low " always wears when the poet sees it for us , as well as with a dramatic vitality of which this poor critical version gives no notion . To have this notion one must read " Limitations , " or " Still Waters , " or , above all , " Trade Winds , " which is a tender and beautiful tragedy couched in terms of audacious commonplace . " A Compulsory Hero " is a bit of the author 's peculiar humor , and " The Joy of Life " is a miniature masterpiece , overrunning with demure laughter , of what may be called conservative satire . " The Fox and the Stork " is ? what shall we call it ? a camera in which a phase of contrasting ideals of life is caught with fascinating fidelity . It is especially notable that Miss Wyatt has not gone back of her own day or out of her own city to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it all beautiful because she has seen it all truly , at a time when there have been people ransacking the remotest ages and regions , and coming back with spoil which is neither true nor beautiful as they show it in their books . They have their reward , for the most of mankind do not like what is true and beautiful , and a noisy success crowns the labor of those who bring them the ugly and the false . She will have her reward too , for whoever is worthy to read her book will love it , and will wish to read it again and again . Then this reader will not be at ease till he has sent his friend to it ; but we hope he will be scrupulous in choosing his friend . There is something so precious in the Real Thing , in a sense of the value of all life and the art to express that sense beautifully , that we should not like it wasted on the aesthetically or spiritually vulgar . The elect will know at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little book is something which time will be rather careful of , and which is of such evident value that whatever the author may give us hereafter , she will not be able to double the assurance of her fresh and lovely gift . Possibly when she shall have repeated her little miracle ( it lacks magnitude , certainly , and sometimes it lacks miracle ) we shall begin , in our confusion with her self-rivalry , to question the entirety of her self-derivation which we have now so nearly affirmed . No one would now be writing well if some one else had not been writing well before ; and if Mrs. Edith Wharton writes so well as she does almost too much in the manner of Mr. Henry James , those who know her writing need not be assured that its likeness to that master 's work is not a condition of its excellence . At her best , in those moments when the poetic impulse which is the heart of her endeavor fulfils itself in some lyrical picture singing to the eye , she writes as wholly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years of writing . The reader can make our dim meaning clearer to himself by turning to the opening passage of that study of mediaeval Italy vol .. mit . ? to . 617. -7 7 called The Duchess at Prayer , which opens Mrs. Wharton 's latest book , " Crucial Instances . " " From the loggia , with its vanishing frescoes , I looked down an avenue barred by a ladder of cypress shadows to the ducal escutcheon and mutilated vases of the gate . Flat noon lay on the gardens , on fountains , porticoes , and grottoes . Below the terrace , where a chrome-colored lichen . had sheeted the balustrade as with fine laminar of gold , vineyards stooped to the rich valley clasped in hills . The lower slopes were strewn with white villages like stars spangling a summer dusk ; and beyond these , fold on fold of blue mountain , clear as gauze against the sky . " This is such very Italy that one who has truly known Italy could name the very moment and place of it all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should miss any implication of them are those effects of emotion by which the poet shares with the reader what she felt as well as what she thought in beholding the things . A poet Mrs. Wharton is always , and not least a poet in her defeats . She fails as the poet often fails with such material as that of The Duchess at Prayer , with the brute facts of the sin and the crime . The time and the place are wonderfully painted , but the action is so weak that one finds one 's self not much caring whether the statue of the praying duchess is placed over her hidden lover in the crypt or not . The action is compensatingly strong in the other Italian piece , The Confessional , which closes the volume . This again is very Italy , not medieval Italy , but revolutionary Italy , the Italy of day before yesterday , whose generous hopes have been blighted in the Italy of to-day . The translation of the drama to our own land and hour , and to such a sordid scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gives proof of the author 's power upon reality which makes one doubt whether she was not baffled by the essential unreality of The Duchess at Prayer . Hut , after all , she seems at her best in The Recovery . The study of the painter overrated by home criticism and liberated to self - knowledge by a visit to Paris , where his intrinsic honesty gets the better of all the mistaken admiration of his worshippers and he begins anew , is of many precious psychological imports suggested with a constant and delicately sarcastic humor . Something of the same humor qualifies that charming sketch The Rembrandt , but there it is a little sharper ; in The Anpel at the Grave it is felt rather as a pensive light on the pathetic event . It is this humor , in whatever force or phase it shows itself , which should enable the author to be solely herself . A poet may be unconsciously like some one else , even such a genuine poet . as Mrs. Wharton , but a humorist can not well reflect another method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt because he has written of Italy too in his latest book that one turns to Mr. Henry Fuller 's fantasia , " The Last Refuge , " with the sense of Mrs. Wharton 's two Italian stories vividly in mind . In every generation of us hyperboreans there must apparently be certain Italia/late spirits who visit their ancestral sky as soon as they feel their wings , and as often afterwards as they can get away from duty in the countries where they seem to be citizens and are certainly tax-payers . Mr. Fuller is one of these . He won his first fame with a fantasia on an Italian theme , and now , after two tremendous exercises in realism , he returns to his early love in the pensive capriccio which we have named . In the sadly smiling afternoon light on prospects that once were gayer , it gently mocks the wish of middle age to mirror its former self in actual youth , and its fate of not finding the reflex like , or not to like it if it is like . It asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one is rich enough to give , but whoever has them at his disposal can profitably yield them for the delicate pleasure which shall be his in turn . All the scene passes in Italy , and the players are not alien in that dreamland through being nominally German . Italian , Swiss , and only once American . It is charming , it is appealingly refined in motive ; an Old World world - ache haunts it with tender pathos ; and if it is not as real as more substantial facts , still it has a reality of its own which is appreciable to the subtler sense . If Mr. Fuller 's next book , however , were to be about Chicago instead of Sicily , we should not be sorry ; for , after all , the ltalianates owe at least the truth to the exile in which they were born , and Mr. Fuller has told such truth of Chicago as binds him to greater and greater veracity . Iv But the poet may not be bidden , and wherever one is a poet that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact . Mr. Frank Norris is a poet among the California wheat - fields , where he has woven a prodigious epic of how they lie bound by the irons of a hated railroad . His novel " The Octopus " is an epic of Zolaesque largeness ; but Mr. Norris is a poet of native note , and he owes to the great romantic realist nothing but the conception of treating a modern theme epically . That was what he did , as to the place , in his " MeTeague , " and that is what he has done , as to the action , in " The Octopus . " All that happens , happens around the oppression , ruthless , mechanical , increasing , of the land by the road , and the characters are the means direct and indirect of the infliction and affliction . They are not the less personalities because of their typical function ; they are each most intimately and personally real , physically real , but also psychically real . Their material presence is enforced by the recognition of some distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very same terms till it is wrought into the reader 's consciousness inseparably from the idea of this and that personality . It is a method that does its work , but we think it would be well for Mr. Norris to ask himself if it is not a trick . Apart from this he has the power of compelling our assistance at the actions and emotions of his characters ; and they are very vital emotions , very vital actions . He gets back to something primitive , something primeval in his people ; they love and hate with a sort of cave-dweller longing and loathing , yet with a modern environment of conscience that tells on them at last in fine despairs and remorses . The book has moments of drama which in the retrospect expand immensely , so that the afternoon of the rabbit-hunt and the evictions and the fight of the embattled farmers with the legal agents of the road seem a vast , wretched epoch of one 's own . The stir of dumb cosmic forces is felt through all , but these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presence is of great imaginational consequence . Certain episodes , loosely or not , at all related to the main purpose , we would prefer to have another time rather than lose altogether . For the most part the story is compactly and strongly built ; it stands firmly , and it marches to the end with an awful , automatic , inesorahle trend , like a piece of relentless mechanism endowed with organic activity . But the end is the fall of the great leader of the farmers , who perishes morally and spiritually because he has consented to employ the bad means of the road for the good aims of the land ; it is not the death of the road 's local manager , choked , drowned , buried in the avalanche of wheat which he has robbed from the farmers . That is a bit of the melodrama towards which Mr. Norris dangerously tends in his hours of triumphs . Other defects his book has , but with them all it is a great book , simple , sombre , large , and of a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of human events , which , if we did not stand in their every-day presence , we should shudder at as the presage of unexampled tyrannies . V In a narrower , a less epical but equally dramatic sort , Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier has evinced a like strength of grip in his hold upon certain personages in his excellent novel " The Sentimentalists . " We do not say all , for his hold upon some is perceptibly weaker than upon others . But he has his story less in the open than Mr. Norris , and this may count for much , for your hand may close vigorously upon an elemental nature in the emptier air of California , and yet slip upon a more conventionalized figure amidst the social clutter of Boston , Massachusetts , where a great part of Mr. Pier 's scene passes . Possibly if he could get all his people away into the sparser region of the Western capital where his heroine develops into the dimensions of a fresh and signal creation , he could convince of his equal power with all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last to his tardily , if ever , deserving hero , but is this dubious young man 's mother , who to win her children the means of being the social figures he has imagined them all being in Boston , goes back to her native city in the West and plays the game of practical politics as she has known it and abhorred it . It is to retrieve her children 's financial as well as social fortunes that the mother sacrifices her life and risks her soul ; and the story culminates in her character and action . The rest is good , but less good , with instances of being not very good ; and it is in his conception of what she is and does that Mr. Pier shows his mastery . VI To go from such books as these two last mentioned to such a story as the " Eastover Courthouse " of Mr. Kenneth Brown and Mr. Henry Burnham Booth is to pass into conditions apparently so little affected by the rush of events in the West and North as to seem those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for money as a means of social splendor or political power . Even in the newer Virginia which the book studies with admirable detachment it seems to be settled once for all that family and character shall count in society , and a genius for public affairs shall count in politics , and money shall not buy eminence in either . If this is only partially true it is consoling and encouraging : the South may prove to be the refuge of the eider American ideals , from which they may issue again to prevail in the national life . For the present they seem to be mixed there , as they always were , with realities that are not so cheering , if we may accept the witness of the authors of " Eastover Courthouse . " A life of patrician paramountcy and exclusion , based upon the subjection of a servile race , is still the aim of the Virginia gentleman , who marks his superiority to the low-born white by open snubs and slights , and his supremacy over the black by the whippings which have continued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of it all , you are permitted to see that this apparently irreclaimable aristocrat has the virtues of his class . Permitted , for his portrait is not flattered in a picture which embodies , we were going to say , for the first time , a wholly unsentimentalized study of the South from eyes as friendly to it as if they were native . They see the wellborn Virginian brave , courteous , veracious , dignified , no more afraid to work than to fight , but loving the sports and the splendors of an aristocratic life , and seeking them amidst the self-denials of grinding poverty and an ironical environment . In the case of the hero of this book , they find him in love with his neighbor 's wife , and saved from his passion by chance rather than will they do not shrink from seeing him sometimes sloven and drinking , if not drunken , and a little rapacious , with a mind to let his creditors do the worrying where it is a question of his debts . But these also are patrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final conscience which seizes the choice given him at last . " Eastover Courthouse " is in nothing more modern than in the presence of an English younger son among these Virginian aristocrats so differenced from him in character , while remaining of much the same tastes , by the environment of their successive generations in the New World . The women of the book are as well done as the men ; that wife of the hero 's neighbor , with her impassioned coldness and her sort of reckless passivity , is excellent . The girl whom he begins to love before his love for the other is over , and whom he marries at last , is with far fewer touches most attractively set before us . Girls do not often get from life into fiction with the grace of their youth , the witchery of their sex , the command of their character , so sensibly about them . VII There appears , only to die , in the first chapters of Mr. W. Harben 's novel " Westerfelt , " a girl who remains with the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the absolute simplicity with which her simple personality is presented works this effect ; but at any rate simplicity of a high and fine sort is the dominant of the book , which testifies , as " Eastover Courthouse " does , of the rich possibilities of the nearly untouched life of the South . " Westerfelt " treats of a phase of this life which is quite new to literature , except as Mr. Harken has shown it in his delightful " North Georgia Sketches , " for his people are cliffereneed as distinctly from the mountain folks of Charles Egbert Craddock and of Mr. Sohn . Fox as they are from the Virginia patricians of " Eastover Courthouse . " It is in a social quality varied only by character that Mr. Harben finds his patterns , and the stuff and colors of the web he weaves ; and if the book were nothing but a study of actual conditions it would have great interest and value . But it is a work of potent imagination , with the play of human passions in an original rearrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pursues Westerfelt , guiltless of all but thoughtlessness , for the death of her daughter , is possibly the strongest motive , and the solution in her conversion at the camp - meeting is the probable means to the happy ending of the story ; but it is the minor implications which will chiefly interest the student of human nature . The most novel of these are such as touch the strong religiosity of the primitive people of the country which Mr. Harben has discovered to us ; and secure of the essential solemnity of the fact , be shrinks from nothing grotesque in its manifestations . When we say that his hero is a livery-stable keeper , we indicate the social predicament which nothing less genuine than the courage of his reasoned sincerity could present to a time whose fiction is filled with hardly anything lower than lords , and hardly anything newer than Imights . VIII A field as little exploited as Mr. Harben 's is that chosen by Mr. Vaughan Rester for the scene of the very vigorous , straightaway piece of story-telling which he calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harben 's country there is apparently no railroad , but the railroad is all through and all over Mr. Nester 's . It is the story of a railroad transfused with human feeling as thoroughly as Mr. Norris 's story . But here is no octopus ; only a meek little faltering tentacle , a perishing branch road , whose manager keeps it and its dependent town alive by force of character , and restores by an act of all but too splendid prowess . The episode of his run through the burning woods is what will burn deepest into the reader 's sense and chiefly make him gasp , but in his after-thought we hope he will perceive how fine is the man 's love between the manager and his old convict father . There is little but man 's love in the hook , which is mostly a man 's story , though we should like to say a friendly word for the rather negative , anxiously conventional , but , after all , good and true girl who does duty as heroine . She is , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thoroughly im aginable that the hero , making her representative of a life impossible to him , must love her as he does with his hopeless passion . The worst , or the best , of it is that she has nothing to do with the drama , which is masculine and business . That it is so strictly business constitutes its originality , as well as its singularity in a group of books of such marked and varied merit as those which have revived our fainting hope of American fiction . It is by no means of the least merit among them ; if being most a story is a supreme merit , it comes nearer being the first of them than the order of its mention would imply .
