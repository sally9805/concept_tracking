txt Every seat was filled and every inch of standing room crowded with the audience that gathered in the Madison Square Concert Hall last night to hear ex-President Grover Cleveland and the other speakers who discussed the industrial education of the Southern negro at a mass meeting organized by the Armstrong Association . Tuskegee Institute was the special subject of all the speeches , and its head , Booker T. Washington , closed the meeting with a long appeal for his race . Ile was preceded ' lay Mr. Cleveland . Edgar Gardner Murphy of Alabama , the Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott , and President William H. Baldwin , Jr. , of the Long Island Railroad . Mayor Low introduced Mr. Cleveland , who acted as Chairman during the rest of the evening . The Mayor said : " Whenever Mr. Cleveland speaks in this city he is sure of a sympathetic audience , and the subject upon which he is to talk to-night is one that ought to win sympa-. thetic listeners anywhere . The Tuskegee Institute is the complete demonstration that the negro is worth helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any man is helping him to help MR . CLEVELAND 'S SPEECH . Mr. Cleveland . who had been greeted by several outbursts of applause when he ascended the platform with the Mayor , received another ovation as he unfolded his manuscript , adjusted his eyeglasses , and started to read his speech , as follows : " I have come here to-night as a sincere friend of the negro ; and I should be very sorry to suppose that my good and regular standing in such company needed support at this late day either from certificate or confession of faith . Inasmuch , however , as there may be some differences of thought and sentiment among those who profess to be friends of the negro , I desire to declare myself as belonging to the Booker Washington-Tuskegee section of the organization . ? ' I believe that the days of ' Uncle Tom 's Cabin ' are past . I believe that neither the decree that made the slaves free nor the enactment that suddenly invested them with the rights of citizenship ? any more purged them of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of their skin . I believe that among the nearly nine millions of Te-. groes who have been intermixed with our ? citizenship there is still a grievous amount of ignorance , a sad amount of viciousness. and a tremendous amount of laziness and thriftlessness . " I believe that these conditions inexorably present to the white people of the l'nited States  --  to each in his environment and under the mandate of good citizenship ? a problem which neither enlightened selfinterest nor the higher motive of human . sympathy will permit them to put aside . ' ? I believe our fellow-countrymen in the Southern and late slave-holding States , surrounded by about nine-tenths , or nearly 8.000,000. of this entire negro population . and who regard tiwir material prosperity . their peace , and en the safety of their civilization interwoven with the negro problem , are entitled to out utmost consideration and sympathetic fellowship . I am thoroughly convinced that the efforts of Booker Washington and the methods of Tuskegee Institute point the way to a safe and beneficent solution of the vexatious negro problem at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North . who have aided these efforts and methods . have illustrated the highest and best citizenship and the most Christian and enlightened philanthropy . " I can not , however . keep out of my mind to-night the thought that , with all we ' of the North may do , the realization of our hopes for the negro must , after all , mainly depend . except so far as it rests with the negroes themselves , upon the sentiment . and conduct of the leading and responsible white men of the South . and upon the maintenance of a kindly and helpful feeling on their part toward those in their midst who so much need their aid and encouragement . " I need waste no time in detailing the evidence that this aid and encouragement has thus far been generously forthcoming . Schools for the education of negro children and institutions for their industrial training are scattered all over the South and are liberally assisted by Southern public and private funds . So far as I am informed , the sentiment in favor of the largest extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal ; and I believe that without exception the negroes who fit themselves for ugeful occupations and service find willing and cheerful patronage and employment among their white neighbors . The ' man who is beyond doubt the best authority in the world on the prospects of the negro race , he who founded and is now at the head of Tuskegee Institute , and is the most notable representative of negro advancement , said at the Atlanta Exposition in 1895 : And in this connection it is well to bear in mind that whatever other sins the South may be called to bear , when it comes to . business pure and simple , It is in the South that the negro is given a man 's chance In. the commercial world , and in nothing is this exposition more eloquent than in em  - -  phasizing this chance . Our greatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the production of our hands , and fail to keep in mind that we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common labor. - and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life  --  shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between the superficial and the substantial ? the ornamental gewgaw 's of life and the useful . ' I do not know how it may be with other Northern friends of the negro , but I have faith in the honor and sincerity of the respectable white people of the South in their relations with the negro and his improvement and well-being . They do not believe in the social equality of the race , and they make no false pretense in regard to it . That this does not grow out of hatred of the negro is very plain . It seems to roe that there is abundant sentiment and abundant behavior among the Southern whites toward tha negro to make us doubt the justice of charging this denial of social equality-. to prejudice , as we usually understand the word . Perhaps it is , born of something so . much deeper and more imperious than prejudice as to amount to a racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is let us remember that it has condoned the negro 's share in the humiliation and spoliation of the . white men of the South during the saturnalia . of reconstruction days , and has allowed a kindly feeling for the negro to survive . ' the time when the South was deluged by the perilous flood of indiscriminate , unintelligent , and blighting negro suffrage . Whatever it is , let , us try to be tolerant and considerate of the feelings and even ' the Prejudice or racial instinct of our White-fellow-countrymen of the South . who ; in the solution of the negro problem . must , , amid their own surroundings , bear the heat of the day and stagger under the weight of the white man 's burden . " There are , however , other considerations related to this feature of the negro question . which may be regarded as more in keeping with the objects and purposes of the occasion . As friendebf the negro . fully believing in the possibility of his improvement and advancement , sincerely , and confidently laboring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are so immediately pressing have to do with the practical education of the negro , and especially with fitting him to compete with his white neighbors in gaining a decent , respectable . and remunerative livelihood . Booker Washington , in speaking of the conditions and needs of his race , has wisely said : " ' It is at the bottom of life we must begin and not at the top . Nor should we permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities . ' In summing up the whole matter , there is one thing of which we can be absolutely and unreservedly certain . When we aid Tuskegee Institute and agencies like it striving for the mental and manual education of the negro in the South we are in every point of view rendering him the best possible service . Whatever may e his ultimate destiny we are thus help-ing to fit him for filling his place and bearing its responsibilities . ' We are sowing Well in the soil at ' the bottom of life ' the Seeds of the black man 's development and usefulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , and if it be within the wise purpose of God , the hardened surface of no untoward sentiment or prejudice can prevent the bursting forth of the blade and plant of the negero 's appointed opportunity into the bright sunlight of a cloudless day . " The next speaker , Mr. Murphy . after being introduced as a Southern white man familiar with the true aspect of the negro problem , said in part : " The South has not applauded Booker T. Washington with undiscriminating agreement , or with monotonous , thoughtless , profitless acclaim . The South has sometimes blamed him . But the South is too fair to him and to race to allow these occasions of disagr , ement to distort the broad perspective in which she has viewed and appreciated that arduous public service through which for twenty years . in cheerful patience and unaffected modesty . he has labored for the upbuilding of his humble and untutored fellows . He has greatly done a great work in response to a great need . " Friends of the North and of the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all justice , for civilization to lay a little less stress upon the catalogue of things prohibited to the negro and to open sympathetically and constructively , and a little More clearly at least a very short list of the things permitted to him ? Having dwelt so long and so vigorously upon the things he can not do and must not do , should we not once for all agree upon just a few things that he may do ? Among these things will not civilization keep for him , clear and inviolate forever , the opportunity of honest labor , the possibility of bread ?

Reported Sate of Santa Fe Holdings . - The much-talked-of Rock Island-'Frisco deal has at last been declared off . There have been frequent rumors that this deal , which had never been officially admitted , woul'l not be consummated , but nothing definite was obtainable until yesterday , when a leading interest in the Rock Island system declared that the proposed purchase of the St. Louis and San Francisco by the Rock Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be resumed later . This same authority declares that the failure of the plan has nothing to do with the recent decision in the Northern Securities case . It was simply a question of price , and the parties concerned failed to come to terms . Gossip in Wall Street has it that those in c-ontrol of the ' Frisco Road asked more cash than the ether side saw fit to give . Officials of the ' Frisco Road now in this city decline to discuss the matter at all . DR . ABBOTT 'S ' VIEW . The Rev. Dr. Abbott began his speech by saying he represented the Northern view of the negro problem . " It is a National problem , " he said , " not a sectional one . The North and the South combined to bring the negro here . and because we in the North could n't use hint in our industrial development , we let him go to the South . Later the conscience of the North , reinforced by commercial interests it must be admitted , abolished slavery . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a National question . " It is clear that we of the North ca n't compel by force the elevation of the black man . With the sword you can sever manacles , but eou can not lift up a man by the same medium . We must not go into the South with advice in a holier-than-thou spirit nor acting as though we belonged to the wiser-than-thou class . Neither force nor Phariseeism ever converted a race . " Suffrage must wOit for education . Education is primary : political rights are secondary . We have tried the experiment of giving to the negro suffrage first and education afterward , and bit terly ha s the country suffered from our blunder . No man ever should receive the power to control other men until he is able to exercise such control . " President Baldwin . Treasurer of the endowment fund of Tuskegee Institute , and a member of the Educational Boards now working in the South , followed Dr. Abbott . He said that he had received telegraphic messages donating respectively e10,000 and $1,000 to the needed fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ohio . Both the givers asked that their names be not made public . The amount necessary to clear the institute 's books this year , explained Mr. Baldwin . was originally 556.000 , and still $45.000 must be obtained . He appealed to the New York friends of the institute to raise that sum , saying checks should be sent to himself or some other Trustee . BOOKER WASHINGTON SPEAKS . Mr. Washington , who spoke after a negro quartet from Hampton ( Va . ) Institute had sung a typical old-time plantation melody , said in part : " The Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute at Tuskegee , Ala. , is the outgrowth of the efforts of Gen. S. C. Armstrong of the Hampton Institute , in Virginia . Gen. Armstrong realized that nine millions of human beings steeped in ignorance , minus experience , could be but half free . " I am glad to say that we have another great American and Christian statesman in the person of ex-President Grover Cleveland , who is manifesting by his presence and words here this evening that he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of the negro is not alone Tuskegee 's problem , not alone the negro 's concern , not alone the South 's duty , but is the problem of the Nation , because the whole people were responsible for the introduction and perpetuation of American slavery . In behalf of our struggling race I want to thank you , Mr. Clet eland. for your deep interest , and to say to you that because of your interest and faith is us we shall see to it that the Nation is not disappointed in our progress nor in our usefulness . Applause . " In addition to the 1,418 students now enrolled at Tuskegee , we have sent out into the world over 6,000 men and women who have been more or less helped and who are devoting their lives as industrial workers and teachers . The students at Tuskegee receive training in twenty-eight industrial departments , each of which is an industry at which they can find immeaiate employment in the South . " Largely by the labor of the students the institution has been built up to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of $450,000 . The pressing and important needs of the Tuskegee Institute at the present time are in the directions of money with which to meet current expenses arid the increasing of the endowment fund from $410,000 by at least $600,000. le you want proof of the need of such institutions as Tuskegee , it is in the bare statement of the fact that there are more ignorant black children , not a larger proportion , but a larger number of ignorant black children in the South to-day than in 1870 . The real and vital problem before this 0untry in reference to my race is not in he failure of the fundamental laws , but in our failure to prepare all the people to fulfill the duties of citizenship presupposed - by the fundamental laws . The solution of this question is not in the abuse of the South by the North , not in the abuse of the North by the South . not in condemning the negro , nor in the negro cursing the white man , not in colonization , not in expatriation , not in amalgamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation between the races and between the North and the South . ee In this ' connection may I add that there have been few greater opportunities in the history , of the world for great statesmen and philanthropists to do something that should redeem nearly a third of our coun  --  try , and lift up the ignorant of both races than is presented by conditions now existing at the South ? deleted paragraph
