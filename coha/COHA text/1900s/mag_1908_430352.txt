The handsome volumes of Moryson 's valuable " Itinerary , " now coming from the press of Messrs . James MacLehose &; Sons , Glasgow , are doubly welcome ; for they not only make easily accessible a book of travel well worth knowing , but also show that the bold venture of Mr. Charles Hughes in issuing ( in 1903 ) his " Shakespeare 's Europe : Unpublished Chapters of Fynes Moryson 's Itinerary " has awakened enough of interest in the traveller to cause the reprinting of the older work . The original " Itinerary " appeared in 1617 , in a stately folio of nearly 900 pages , under the aegis of John Beale , dwelling at London in Aldersgate street . The new edition is to be completed in four volumes , with a brief " publishers ' note " about the life of Moryson , and with a full index , a feature sadly missed by all who knew the old edition . Otherwise we are promised a faithful reprint of the original work " except that the letters i , j , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern usage , and obvious printers ' errors , both of spelling and punctuation , have been corrected . " Mr. Hughes gave us what he regarded as the most valuable portions of the manuscript which Moryson left unprinted . The pious wish of the worthy traveller was thus in part fulfilled some three hundred years after he had , as we may well believe , abandoned the vain search for a publisher . " Shakespeare 's Europe " follows the manuscript faithfully , except for obvious slips of the pen , even to the letters i , j , u , and v , thus reproducing the sincere and catholic spelling of the old " Itinerary . " The editor has made us his debtors by giving us a valuable Introduction , but failed , alas ! to add the full index . Passages quoted below from the " Itinerary " follow the original edition , as the reprint has , at this writing , not progressed far enough to supply all of them ; but the paging of the old has fortunately been indicated in the new edition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was my good fortune to take up both of Moryson 's works at the close of a fresh perusal of the genuine unabridged Pepys 's " Diary " of Wheatley 's ample pages . Surely it was not the mere chance of proximity that made the men appear as much alike as a staid older and a frolicsome younger brother . To be sure , the Clerk of the Acts of the days of Charles II . may not seem at first glance to have much in common with the smug and pedantic tourist of the days of good Queen Bess . The diarist bares his soul as no man before or after him ; and therefore the trim , precise , and rigid figure of the traveller , as he reveals himself in his own pages , may fail at first to suggest kinship with dear , honest , " grafting , " patriotic , truthful , lying , loving , licentious Sam Pepys . The external resemblance is , of course , closer to the Samuel Pepys of Braybooke 's supplement , where solemn papers , letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clerk of the Acts . Moryson is , nevertheless , an older Pepys , who reveals the similarity , if in nothing else , in his wide-ranging curiosity , and in his sane and lucid , though unornamented , English . The personal equation , as necessary to know in the case of the traveller as of the diarist , is for the most part easily ascertainable for Moryson . Even the industry of his editor has discovered little more about him than he has himself told . When the Fellow of Peterhouse College , Cambridge , set sail for Stade , in 1591 , to begin his first journey on the continent , he was already old enough ( he was born in 1566 ) to have most of his convictions firmly settled . As the third son of a numerous family , his financial prospects by way of inheritance were small . Of sufficiently bold and active spirit , we may believe that , despite the labored reasons which he gives for his undertaking , the real motive was the desire of change and adventure ; for travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its risk of death or captivity , and in its dangers by land and sea , it was more comparable ( though the mere comparison is , of course , an exaggeration ) with a journey into the heart of Africa to-day . The gambling spirit of the time regarded the odds against safe return as at least three to one , as may be evidenced by Moryson 's brother Henry , who , when about to accompany him on his second voyage , put out ? 400 , after a common form of speculation in those days , to receive ? 1200 on his return , or to lose all , ? and lost . Fynes staked a smaller sum in a similar way ; but though he walked London 's streets again , the treachery of supposed friends cut him short of his expected gains . A firm will and an enterprising spirit were not Moryson 's sole equipment for his journey . The Fellow of Peterhouse was manifestly abreast of the learning of his times , priding himself as being more skilful in Latin than even the Teu- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , German , and Italian fluently . A staunch Protestant hatred of Turks , Jews , Romish priests , Jesuits , and " mere " Irish , is never hidden ; while the " English " Irish come in for dislike only less violent . Everywhere through his writings is revealed that spirit of condescension which even to-day so endears some travellers to the rest of the world . And yet at times he could see clearly and judge rightly of matters wherein the English came off only second-best . As in the case of Pepys , appreciation of literary values was one of his weak points ; and if he had as frankly recorded his opinions now and then , they would doubtless have been as silly . Not least of his whole equipment was blindness to the beauties of art and nature . One delightful sentence ( " Itinerary , " III. , p. 54 ) , " Sweitzerland consists of hills and Mountaines , so as they do likewise trauell on horseback , " reveals the man like a lightning flash . That he had his sentimental side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lingers , for example , over the Morosini family , famous in Venetian annals , " for the Consonancy of that name " with his own ; but the careless reader may be pardoned for seeing in him a typical stage Englishman solemnly recording his ? expences for horses and mans meat " for the benefit of myriads of other Englishmen who should follow after him . Yet the very absence of most of what we look for in a modern book of travel is what makes Moryson 's work most valuable to the modern reader . Opinions about art , descriptions of scenery , attempts to give local color , we have galore , and will read none that smack of ancient days ; but the price of a sixteenth-century hen in Poland , the stockingless condition of the ladies of Germany , the laws of inheritance in Venice , ? these are topics that charm perennially . The events of Moryson 's life which interest us are few . Two journeys ( separated only by some six months in England in 1595 ) filled up the six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1597 . On the first he saw much of the Netherlands , Germany , and Italy ( as far south as Naples ) , with glimpses of Poland , Bohemia , Austria , Switzerland , and France ; on the second and briefer , he went to Jerusalem and European Turkey by way of Germany and Venice . We learn also of a trip to the North of England , and a flying excursion into Scotland . In 1600 he accompanied Charles Blount , Lord Mountjoy , as a sort of secretary to the Irish wars . From the death of that nobleman , in 1606 , we lose about all trace of him , except for the publication of his " Itinerary " in 1617 . The industry of Mr. Hughes has unearthed his will , and settled the date of his death as February 12 , 1629-30 . Moryson 's worldly gear is a not uninteresting topic . When he set out on his first journey , his pocket was doubtless none too abundantly filled by the gifts of his father and by the annual stipend of ? 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years as a travelling Fellow . But travelling was cheap in those days . A quotation on this point will also serve to illustrate the clearness of Moryson 's style , as well as his tinge of pedantry and insular conceit ( " Itinerary , " III. , p. 13 ) : " Fifty or sixty pounds sterling yeerely , were sufficient at the time when I was beyond sea , to beare the charge of a Trauellers diet , necessary apparrell , and two iournies yeerely , in the Spring and Autumne , and also to serue him for moderate expences of pleasure , so that hee imitated not the Germans , who drinke and banquet as much abroad , as at home , nor the Italians , who liue they among Christians or Pagans , yet can not restraine their incontinency ; nor the Polonians , who being perhaps the sonnes of Castellani , ( I meane such as haue the keeping of Castles , or like entertainments from the King onely for their life ) , commonly spend more prodigally in Italy , and like places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whole patrimony abroad . In which kind I can not but commend our Countrimen , who howsoeuer at home they may haue spent prodigally , yet going beyond seas , rather dispose their expences to repaire this former prodigalitie then otherwise and practise the rule of the Poet , Intra fortunam quamque manere suam : Each man his cote to fit , As his cloth will permit . " His father died while he was on his first journey , leaving him bequests which amounted to about ? 500 , according to Mr. Hughes . After the Irish war we hear of a pension of six shillings a day . Though his will reveals neither money nor lands , he seems to have lived in his latter years the peaceful and easy life of the unmarried scholar , doubtless pottering over his books and manuscripts to the very end . An amusing passage in his account of his visit to Loreto throws unexpected light on his reasonable content with his fortunes . Loreto brought all his Protestant zeal to a white glow , and it is a pity that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his narrative ( " Itinerary , " I. , p. 100 ) : " When we came forth ( as the Italians prouerbially speake of the Priests auarice , Euery Psalme ends in Glory be , 4. c. as if they should say , All religion to end in profit ) it was necessarie for vs to cast almes into an iron chest behind the Altar , couered with an iron grate . Therefore , my consorts , of purpose to delight the Priests eares with the sound of money , as with musicke , did cast into that chest many brasse quatrines , but of small value , and my selfe being last , when my turne was  | to giue almes , did in stead thereof , gather some tenne quatirnes sic of theirs , which lay scattered upon the grate , and got that cleare gain by that Idoll . God forbid I should bragge of any contempt to Religion ; but since it appears , that such worship is vnpleasing to God : and because Papists will haue all their miracles beleeued , I will freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such sort as I said , yet after that , God of his mercy preserued me in my long and dangerous trauell , and from that time to this day , by his grace , I haue enioyed , though no abundant , yet a competent estate , and more plentifull then in my former dayes . " Moryson 's published " Itinerary " is divided into three parts of about equal length . The first is the Itinerary proper , ? a narrative of his daily route , the cost of food and horse hire , the enumeration of the things seen at each place , at first sight as unpromising as Pepys 's record , but not unlike it in the interest which suddenly appears in the midst of the dullest narrative . The second part is an account of the Irish war , in which Moryson had a modest share . The third deals voluminously with such topics as the geography , traffic , diet , apparel , military forces , laws , and rulers of the states through which he passed . The manuscript which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as published , essentially a continuation of the third part , dwelling at greater length on social institutions and usages . Different portions of the two books have different values . Moryson was both an observer and a compiler . Where he observes most , ? as in Germany , Venice , Florence , and Turkey , ? he is most valuable and interesting . Where he compiles most , ? as in his long description di Rome , where , for fear of the priests , he dared stay only four days , ? he is most a bore . In several respects , too , he travelled at an auspicious time , knowing intimately the Germany of the good old days before the Thirty Years ' War , visiting Turkey when it was still a menace to Europe , and justly conscious , so soon after the defeat of the Spanish Armada , of the proud position of his own country . An Englishman of Pepys 's days would have seen a vastly different Europe and a humbled England . To the sober-minded reader , portions of Mr. Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer much valuable information not obtainable elsewhere . But far be it from us to commend Moryson merely on such utilitarian grounds . The lowest and basest of the reasons for accepting gratefully such a book is surely its usefulness . If there be those who , taking up the journal of the Clerk of the Acts , would rather read sometimes of the rising price of tickets to the pit , or of how Mrs. Pepys made ready to apply the red-hot tongs to the nose of her erring though repentant husband , than of the voyage of Charles II . back to the England which he disgraced , they may find material to their liking in Moryson 's pages , though doubtless less delightsome . It will depend wholly on the taste of the reader whether he regards the " Itinerary " or its continuation as the more enjoyable . More useful the latter certainly is for everyone in search of solid information . In this necessary division of opinion , and in view of the fact that " Shakespeare 's Europe " has been accessible for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its friends in its new form , we may find our excuse for confining ourselves hereafter exclusively to the latter . Unfortunately , there is not space to quote Moryson 's ambitious scheme of what the traveller should observe . He bids him note ( III. , p. 10 ) the fertility of the soil and its products , the mines of metals and precious stones , the abundance and kinds of food with the cost thereof , " the rare and proper Beasts , " costumes , habits , laws , " the magnificence of Citizens , their household stuffe , and in generall all speciall things , as Statuaes , Colosses , Sepulchers with the inscriptions , Lybraries with the most rare Bookes , Theaters , Arches , Bridges , Forts , Armories , Treasuries , Monasteries , Churches , publicke houses , Vniuersities , with their Founders , reuenewes , and disputations , " rulers , religion , commerce , and lastly coins ( for him a fascinating topic ) . Such a scheme is as generous as it is impossible , particularly for him who was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color-blind would be in a modern picture-gallery . After all , his was no purpose to entertain merely , for , to let him speak in his own words : " I professe to write especially in this place to the Humanist , I meane him that affects the knowledge of State affaires , Histories , Cosmography , and the like , and out of that I write , let other men apply to their vse , what they fudge fit for them . " At the beginning of Part III . he . has a discussion of the proper persons to travel , which is especially valuable in these restless days when we all rush over-seas . Unlike Plato , he decides against old men from fifty to threescore , on account of their liability to fatal illness and their proneness to run into vice . Nor may women and children go , and married men only for a brief season . " But as in all actions they are happy that hold the meane , so middle age is most fit to visit forraigne parts , and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arts and Sciences in generall , and specially those which they meane to professe , and being of so ripe discretion , as they can distinguish betweene good and euill . " This passage , which might easily be paralleled by others from older English literature , helps to show how curiously we have now removed the boundary between middle and old age . Has the span of human life really grown greater ? Moryson , writing in all soberness long after the event evidently meant himself when he spoke of the middleaged scholar as best fitted for travel , though he was only about twenty-five at the beginning of his journey abroad and not much over thirty on his return . Like many before him , he considered fifty as the border of old age . Moryson esteemed the Germans greatly , and gave much space to them . He admired their learning , industry , frugality , and honesty , but thought them quarrelsome , prone to scold their wives , and little given to politeness . Their drinking habits left him in endless amazement . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge by the amount of space he gave that country , praising the Italians for their politeness and amiability , but condemning them for dishonesty , cowardice , and incontinency . The Turk , then at the height of his insolence , if not of his power , called forth some of the most instructive passages of both books . Of one theme , ? his own land , its inns and its men , even when they travel , ? he never tired , though his comments are never long and almost never odious . " I haue obserued the Germans and French in Italy , I to liue and couuerse most with their owne Countrimen , disdaining to apply themselves to the Italians language , apparrell , and diet , and the English aboue all others , to subiect themselves to the Lawes , customes , language , and apparrell of other Nations . And hence it is that the conuersation of the English abroad is wonderfullie pleasing veto strangers . Onely because they are forced to dissemble their Countrie among Papists , I haue found by experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haue reaped the commendation of this their vertue ; and it is certaine , that the Germanes , whom the English do often personate , haue thereupon beene often praysed in forraigne parts for their temperance , and other vertues lesse proper to them . " ( III. , p. 23 . ) In this necessity under which the English labored , of having to take the habit and name of other nations , we have an allusion to the religious differences which color every page of the book . When Moryson returned to England in Italian costume , constables waited outside the inn to arrest him , taking him for a Jesuit or a priest . In Italy , travel was possible for him only in the disguise of a Roman Catholic German ; and he fled from Rome after a stay of only four days , for fear that the special intolerance of Easter might bring him to a prison cell . Yet we find unexpected toleration in parts of Southern Germany and Bohemia , for the Thirty Years ' War was as yet only a distant menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of Moryson 's narrative , as illustrating some idiosyncrasy of the man , or as wonderfully pertinent glosses on the history of the life and customs of the times . We have already seen him pleasantly employed with the Morosinis of Venice . It is less pleasant to learn of his acquiring the unbreakable habit of going about with downcast eyes , because " a Turke will not abide any Christian to looke him full in the face without striking him . " Sometimes we run across an unexpected bit of sentiment , as in the story of the Florentine Juliet who kept her Romeo ( I. , p. 148 ) : " Neere that place lies a lane vnpaued , in memory of a Virgin that dwelt there , whom a yong man loued , who was borne of a Family of a contrarie faction to hers , between whom many cruelties had been exercised , and they mutually louing each other , &; despairing to get their friends consent for marriage , and at last being impatient of delay , resolued with what danger soeuer to meet together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascend into the Virgins Chamber by a ladder , was surprised , who to sane the reputation of the Virgin , confessed that he came to rob the house , whereupon he was condemned to die , and being led to execution by the house where the Virgin dwelt , she laying aside all shame , came running out , with her loose haire about her Bares , and embracing him , confessed the truth publikly , with which accident both their parents were so moued , as laying aside all former malice they contracted affinity , and the yoing man delivered from the bonds of the hangman , was tied to her in the sweet bond of marriage . And of this wonderful euent , the Florentines thought good to keepe this memorie for posteritie . " So , too , these comments illuminate the manner of life of the day , ? the unglazed windows of Italy ; the bench or floor that offered the only chance for sleep in rural Polish inns ; the awful upper and nether feather beds of Germany , where the traveller suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common dining-rooms of German inns , where men actually sat bareheaded ; the skates of Holland , for which he had no name ; customs proper to the English , as the muffling a mans face with his cloke " ; the " Vmbrels , or things like a little Canopy ouer their heads , " which men carry in Italy against the heat , though their use is dangerous , " because they gather the heate into a pyramidall point , and thence cast it downe perpendicularly vpon the head , except they know how to carry them for auoyding that danger . " What visions of  | things unutterable lie in the simple statement : At the table , they i. e. , the Italians , but something similar is said of the French elsewhere touch no meate with the hand , but with a forke of siluer or other metall , each man being serued with his forke and spoone , and glasse to drinke . " His was in many ways another England ; but who does not recall Pepys , muffling his face in his mantel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat ceremoniously indoors ?  |
