txt . According to The Typographical Journal the International Union has paid out of its " defense fund " on account of the fight for an eight-hour day $612,277 . This considerable sum is small beside the loss of a month 's wages by the anthracite miners , which may be figured at from $8,000,000 to $10,000,000 , according to estimates of the average wage and the number of miners idle . As neither " fight " was won , it might seem as though there was proof of waste and room for discouragement . And it might also seem as though employers had ground for grievance in being subjected to the alv noyance implied in these pugnacious expenditures . But this only partially states the case . From the unionists ' point of view struggles for higher pay or shorter hours may at least maintain enjoyed advantages , which otherwise perhaps might be reduced if that course seemed safe . And even if some struggles are lost others are gained without which the unions would occupy less advantageous positions . It is not upon the record that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to profits . Mr. MITCHELL said there is no case of concession of benefits without demand in the anthracite trade . Noi ? are the unions an unmixed Ill to the employers . They may be and sometimes actually are managed in a manner beneficial to both employers and employed . In the coal industry there have been cases in which the central body suspended anthracite unions for unnecessary strikes , and in the bituminous branch order and stability have been promoted by reasonable procedure by the union managers . If only all unions at all times would demean themselves according to the professions of their saner moments their benefits would be more appreciated . They are almost indispensable to industrial conciliation upon the scale necessitated by the factory system , which brings thousands of men under a single management . In such cases there can ? be nothing personal in the relation of employer and employe , and no benevolence of intention will suffice to Inform well-meaning captains of industry of what is passing in the minds of the rank and file . There are enough bad things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional reference to the good deeds attributable to some of them .
