txt The nomination of CHARLES S. DENEEN by the Republicans for Governor of Illinois shows a distinct advance in the politics of the State . It is , for one thing , and no small thing , a total defeat for what is looked upon as the " Federal machine , " co reprising both the United States* Senators and a majority of the Representatives in Congress . In the next Place it is a set-back to the aspirations of Mr. Low-uEN , who is regarded in Illinois as distinguished rather by his wealth and his particular associations than by public service , of which he is innocent , or capacity for such service , of which he has given no proof . Finally Mr. is a man in the prime of life , made an excellent record in the of State 's Attorney , to which he has been twice elected , the last time running some ten thousand ahead of Mr. MCKINLEY in Cook County , and the men who have done hard and successful work in Chicago for the purification of its municipal affairs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of . his character . As he is the first Chicago candidate the Republicans have put up in the history of the State the feeling toward him in that city is important . The report that the support of Mr. YATES was obtained for Mr. DENEEN by promise of support for the Governor in his campaign to secure the seat of Senator Cta.Loa probably has this basis of fact , that as between the Governor aid the Senator two years from now the friends of Mr. DENEEN in Chicago would naturally prefer Mr. YATES and may have assured him of that feeling , should the contest be between Mr. YATES and Mr. CuLt.om . Gov . YATES has not in the past been popular in Chicago with the better class of citizens , and has not deserved to be , but Senator CULLOAI has been even less so , and for equally good reason . Mr. YATES 'S strength lies in the interior of the State . If he can add to it some degree of support from Chicago he will stand a fair chance for the Senate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he could hardly lower very much the standard with which the State has seemed satisfied in recent years . If a better man should present himself , we do not imagine that the forces behind Mr. DENEEN would be committed to Mr. YATES . The significance of the result in the Illinois Convention , according to our best advices , lies in the fact that Mr. DENEEN 'S chief strength was'in the support of the reform element in the City of Chicago . He is not either an independent or a professed reformer in politics , . but both his sympathies and his judgment incline him to seek political advancement through the attachment and confidence of the better element , and lie studies rather the tendency of popular sentiment than the schemes of the professional politicians . He showed himself courageous and firm in the discharge of his duties as State 's Attorney , and it is to be inferred that he v ? ill take the same qualities into the office of Governor . There is practically no doubt of his election .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
