txt THE NEW HOLIDAY . Business Man Says Gov . Hughes Ignored His Protest . In THE TIMES of to-day " A Business Woman " asks why Gov . Hughes should have signed the bill for Columbus Day - without obtaining the views of the business people of the State . I can tell her that before he signed it I for one sent him a protest against It on behalf of all whom I represented . In which I presented to the best of my ability most of the arguments against the proposed holiday which I have seen , and an acknowledgment of my communication was cent on behalf of the Governor . who then proceeded to approve the bill . There are always enough politicians and public employes In favor of such schemer , and they have more influence with legislators and Governors than the business men unless the latter get up a corresponding clamor or threaten to make themselves felt politically . Perhaps the business community can now take step ; to get the law repealed .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
