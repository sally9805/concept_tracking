txt The offices of the Independent Brewing Company of New York City , in the big new building at Park Avenue and Forty-first Street , have been closed now tor two or three months , and Interested persons have found it impossible to locate any one who will admit responsibility for the company . The holders of bonds , on which a 3 per cent . dividend fell due on Nov. 1 . but was unpaid , are trying to find out just where they st. ; . nd . J. D. W. King of 1 Madison Avenue is forming a protective association of the bondholders . They will hold a meeting there to-day . It appears that the brewing company was organized this year with a capital stock of $1,100,003 . The President was J. H. Redmond and the Secretary H. J. Carfitzson . Three Directors were named  --  the two officers and a W. H. Jones . On May 1 a deed of trust was filed with the Lawyers Title Insurance Company making it the trustee of the company , and naming what appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , along with such equipment as the company then had , or " might hereafter secure , " as security for the $500,000 bonds that were issued at that time . The bonds were for $L000 each . But the instrument said that the Lawyers Title and Trust Company was not to be responsible ; that it was to serve simply as the distributer of the bonds and the payer of the semi-annual coupons . The document also noted that the officers of the ' brewing company were not to be held responsible : Did n't Pay Office Rent . , The company took three large rooms in the new office building at Park Avenue and Forty-first Street on May 1 . it had only two or three employes , and the building management said yesterday that they had seen few people go into the offices . Less than a month 's rent in all was paid for the offices . " Col. " J. P. Perch made arrangements at first for the offices in the building , ' according to the agents , but he could never be engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months suit was brought for back rent against the company , and the oTflaes  --  were closed . Mail has been coming right along to the offices , however , no new address being given . The lawyer for the building searched around to find something belonging to the breWing company to seize upon for rents . Though he did n't know about it , perhaps , the deed of trust filed in May had talked largely about " kegs , barrels , wagons and teams , vats and buildings now owned or hereafter to be acquired by the company . " He reported to the building agents that he could not find anything ; there was a dispute even , about the ownership of the office furniture . J. H. Redmond was brought into court on the rental suit . It appeared that ? he was a detective doing business at 32 Broadway , but he said he had no longer any connection with the company . The building agents got judgment for their claim , and , they now want to find something with which to satisfy the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also Secretary Carfitzson soon dropped out of the company , for a letter dated Oct. 31 , to the Lawyers Title and Insurance Company , was signed by one L. E. Smith as Secretary . " Col. " Perch also was not to be found at his ; usual haunts yesterday . It was said that ' he had n't been about for two months or more . For the last month or so , particularly since Nov. 1 , many persons have asked the rental agents at 103 Park Avenue , what they knew ' about the brewing company . These . inquiries , the agents said yesterday , left the impression that the bonds had been taken in exchange for real estate , rents for apartments , grocery Pills , and what not . Anxiety about the company grew acute when Nov. 1 came . It was time to draw the stated semi-annual three per cent . on I the bonds . Messengers to the Lawyers Title and Insurance Company were told that no money had come to pay the interest . All the title company could say was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ostensibly from 103 Park Avenue , saying that the Independent Brewing Company of New York City could not pay the interest on Nov. 1 , but that it would send 1in money for that purpose by Nov. 13 . The lawyer for the building at 103 Park Avenue , who searched in vain for breweries , vats , wagons , teams , kegs , and barrels , upon which to seize , will be glad , perhaps , to know about all the real estate mentioned in the deed of trust . That MI strument lists over 100 lots at West Hampton , Suffolk County , L. I. ; some dozen or more at Eastport , Suffolk County ; over 100 at Riverhead , Suffolk County ; a few at Plainfield , N. J. , and about 75 at lEast Asbury Heights , wherever that is . The Company Had Town Lots . It is argued by those who are now investigating the affairs of the company that if all those lots that look so large on paper were really worth anything the company , need n't have closed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay rent . It is not yet known how many of the 500 $1,000 bonds were sold or how much was Paid for them . It was said that promoters have rarely been bold enough to use the name of a reliable title company to give a first-blush tone of responsibility to a concern unless it was of good quality . Prospective buyers of bonds , unless guided by a lawyer , would have found the deed of trust so recondite that they could ' have gained little satisfaction from it if they had gone into it . The name of the lawyer who drew up this document does not appear on it .
