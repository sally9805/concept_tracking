SOMEWHERE in Lothair , I think , Lord Beaconsfield declared that for the proper lighting of any room the lights should be placed on its side walls . Others have held the same opinion , but it is a difficult rule to establish on a sensible basis . In the first place the character and the size of a room must be taken into account before one can determine the details of its lighting . The next question is the one of the sort of light , electricity , gas or oil , which is to be used . The vestibule should always be lighted from above , for obvious reasons , and the hall of a house , unless it is of princely dimensions , should also be lighted by pendants from the ceiling . One of the most disagreeable mistakes of the inexperienced house planner is that of permitting the lights to be placed on the side walls of the hall or other rooms at a level with the line of vision of the average person . Nothing is more disagreeable than to stand with lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing the softest effects do not modify the matter sufficiently to compensate for such misarrangements . The lighting fixtures at best must be intruders in any architectural plan , no matter how skillfully arranged . For this reason , simplicity and elegance are things to be sought in these designs , and any excess of metal ornamentation is a thing to be deplored in a well ordered house . Unshaded gas light is a softer light to face , of course , than that produced by electricity , nevertheless electricity solves the problem of an illuminant which shall not vitiate nor overwarm the air , and by its use ventilation is simplified , while it lends itself as does no other light to aesthetic harmony . In many houses both gas and electricity are in use , but it is difficult to see what is gained by such an arrangement except in cases of emergency . It is far better to plan for a uniform source of light . The " press the button " system has come to be regarded as a necessity , and not as an innovation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surprising to find in what inconvenient places the switch keys are put by those who are fitting a house with a lighting system . This is one of the points which should not be overlooked . The room in which one receives should  | always be fitted so that it may be brilliantly lighted on the instant . If such a room is of great proportions it may be lighted by chandeliers and by lights which are side bracketed at a hight of seven and one-half feet . Mr Preece , an English authority on artificial lighting , devised a means of determining the amount of light required by a large room when electricity was the chosen light . His method was to take the number of square feet contained in the area of the room , which divided by sixty-four gave him the number of sixteen-candle power lights required . These he declared should be placed eight feet above the floor and eight feet apart to produce the best result . As a general thing suspended lights unassisted by side lights produce rather ghastly effects , at times making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is admirably adapted to the lighting requirements of the dining room when the light is above the table . Here the white cloth reflects the rays in a most pleasing manner and there are no disagreeable side lights flickering at one over the shoulder of his vis-a-vis . Without question the most aesthetic table lighting is candle light , but everyone has not silver candelabra , and the hanging lamp still jangles up and down on its creaky chain over many a dining table . However , one may obtain beautiful glass candlesticks of colonial patterns for much less than a dollar apiece , and nothing is more beautiful than a tastefully decorated table lighted with candles in glass candlesticks . Apropos of candles , it may not be out of place here to poke a little helpful ridicule at the custom of littering one 's mantelshelf with candlesticks holding pink , blue or green candles which are never lighted , and pine away from sheer inaction or get tilted in pinko fashion . Candles have their little uses nowadays , but he who is wise will plan lights for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be constrained to grope through Egyptian darkness with a candle stub , which only makes darkness sufficiently visible to be discovered only after one has nearly cracked his shins . Of all rooms in the house , none require more careful planning for their lighting than cellar rooms . Dark cellars are quite the thing for vegetables , but when it comes to an exploration , let there be light . And just here let me protest against dark stairways . For centuries we have groped up and fallen down dark stairways . This is all very well in the romantic novel where the villain brushes past the breathless hero , who should then and there have brought the book to an end in the first chapter , but who does n't ; but in real life it is annoying . In the sleeping chambers there should always be a light very near the bed so that one getting up in the night need not whack the varnish off all the furniture before reaching the uncertain locality of the light fixture . I only mention this point since I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary to turn out for a patent rocker , hurdle over a center table , tack past two chairs and a waste paper basket , and encounter the sharp corners of a chiffonier before the light switch could be turned . The lighting of the child 's room is a very important matter from a sanitary standpoint and also from one of convenience . If gas is the illuminant it should never be left lighted longer than is absolutely necessary . If a night light is required , then a little night lamp should be procured , but even then it is a pity that more mothers do not train their children to be accustomed to sleeping in a room without a light . It is so much more healthful . Where lamps are in use we far too often see children squinting because the strong lamplight is directly on line with their faces . Their elders seldom stop to think of this from their superior bights . A light should never be placed so that its rays flare into a child 's eyes . I think one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this very negligence on the part  | of their elders to provide shaded lights in rooms where children are sitting or playing . Without question every sort of a light should be shaded , either by a globe or some other shade . There is nothing more trying to the eyes than unshaded incandescent lights . These should be shaded with ground glass globes . Perhaps the time will even come when these lights will be hidden behind heavy moldings , the illumination being accomplished by means of reflection . A certain theater in the city of Duluth is lighted in this manner and it is wonderfully restful to sit in such light . This arrangement may have been suggested by the lighting plan of the British house of commons , where all the lights were placed above a false ceiling of ground glass and the even glow which was thus diffused was most satisfactory . This same principle I have seen put into practice in a small way where incandescent lamps were ingeniously dropped into vases of translucent glass which scintillated exquisitely from the glow within and diffused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented the use of shades and globes for lights . As an instance it is estimated that an incandescent light loses from forty-five to sixty per cent of its power when shaded by a ground glass globe . Nevertheless , it is a poor economy which saves a man a few cents , or even dollars , on his lighting bill , and leads him to wear goggles at thirty ! In choosing shades for the fixtures of any light care should be taken that their colors be in harmony with the colors in the room 's scheme of decoration . This too often is not taken into account , and some gas fitters incline toward the installation of pink shades in rooms whose walls are tinted in terra cotta ! The dark green shades so restful to the eyes are really hideous in themselves . However , of late various tints of green may be had in shades for lamps , gas fixtures or electroliers , tints both beautiful and restful to the eyes . Those green metal and glass table lamps which are to be found in our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will harmonize with everything and their soft green tints are always agreeable to the eye . A good table light is one of the most important necessities in the furnishing of a house . It almost seems that some manufacturers have risked the wrath of the gods in turning out carloads of ugly lamps . Of all things a lamp should be one of beauty . In the first place , a table lamp should be sensible ; then it should be beautiful . Very expensive lamps and burners may be purchased by themselves . These are so constructed that they may be fitted to various bases , such , for example , as those furnished by tall Japanese jars . These jars may be found in almost any Japanese shop , are inexpensive , and are usually unique . A jar lamp of this sort is handsome and solid . I have a jar lamp which I made in this manner by slipping the plain metal lamp and burner into the mouth of a terra cotta jar of the sort in which florists display carnations . The jar itself did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar and a half , and the only additional expense was for the green silk shade and the raffia which was knotted around the jar to give it a more finished appearance . Lamps for libraries should have double burners or powerful circular wicks . Daintier lamps may find their places elsewhere in the house , and a soft , strong light is indispensable in the music room . As to the lighting of the kitchen , I can never quite understand why it is that houses so well lighted " fore , " should be so abominably lighted " aft . " Even in a supposedly modern kitchen a shelf of antiquated glass lamps is not an uncommon sight . It seems to me that they must have been banished from Noah 's ark and after all these years dug up from the diluvial drifts of that day . The servant is too often " accommodated " with a dingy , single burnered , squatty  | lamp , such a lamp as bears on the stamp of its make-up the evidence of its being ashamed of itself . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps . A final word about lamp shades : nothing is more beautiful than a tastefully fashioned tissue paper lamp shade , but no amount of tissue paper can apologize for an ugly lamp , and the apologies are as often quite as hideous as the lamps ! One can put up with a homely horse , an ugly diamond , or an inartistic gold mine , but when it comes to an unbeautiful lamp there is , in these times when excellent lamps are so inexpensive and within everyone 's reach , but little excuse for its retention . Another protest may be entered at this time , and that is one against using the light fixtures as a gibbet on which to hang all the lesser family treasures of the sort which will not stand up on shelves nor content themselves with the respectable retirement of a cabinet . I have seen a single gas fixture strewn with thistledown balls , german favors , paper pumpkin vines , suspended photographs , balloon match boxes and Esquimau dolls . That even gas had the courage to compete with such attractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with lighting a room , yet it is sufficiently connected with it to lead one 's interest in this direction . What I have written here does not pretend to take up the subject either in its entirety or technically ; it is merely hoped that these remarks will lead those who have not considered the problem seriously to interest themselves in the matter to the extent , at least , of having corrected such defects in the lighting of the room in which they and their children pass much of their time ; that they may be brought to a realization of the fact that the lighting of a room is a sanitary consideration of the greatest importance and one which deserves to be lifted from its common neglect .  |
