txt The gallery numbered IV according to I the new arrangement of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , has been set aside for the collection of jadeites , nephrites , and other hard semi-precious stones bequeathed by the late Heber R. Bishop . It is at the north end of the Fifth Avenue wing on the upper floor , where one of the two galleries has been decorated in Louis XV . fashion and provided with openwork , wrought-iron gates for its two portals . Here , in handsome showcases , are gathered the extraordinary pieces of Chinese jade , rock crystal , rose quartz , lapis lazuli , &c.,; for which Mr. Bishop ransacked Europe , China , and Japan , not forgetting New York . This collector spared neither , energy nor money to obtain the finest bits of jade to be had in London or Paris . His buyers in China were always on the watch ; personally he often visited the Orient to pick up special pieces , old Chinese and Japanese cloissonds and other things that interested him particularly . When he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried out by his heirs . The objects in this particular collection number more than 1,000 . It is doubtful if the Emperor of China himself has so complete a. gathering , notwithstanding the fact that many costly objects in jade are , prepared for the exclusive use of the imperial palaces and are not supposed to reach the market . At one time , if not at present , the palace grounds at Peking included a section where the Ju-Tsiang , or jade workers , labored under the supervision of officials . Their slowly elaborated pieces might serve as presents to favored grandees , but might not be sold to the outside world . Still , it was never beyond the limits of possibility that a foreigner who bound himself to carry the piece of jade Out of the country might secure it " under the rose " through such intermediaries as exist in Oriental cities . Of these men and their wiles the members of the Diplomatic Corps might tell certain tales if they cared to blab  --  or dared . Jade ( they have now decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Orient for a variety of reasons . The Mexican variety reached Europe in the sixteenth century with a prodigal fame for usefulness as medicine . It cured snake bite , epilepsy , kidney trouble , and all diseases of the stomach ; so it befell that " nephritic stone " took a place in the stores of apothecaries , though the actual thing they sold was anything but the Mexican green stone . In America generally the redskins wore it in their lower lip as labrets , or in the lobe of the ear , or around ? the neck to Prevent disease . In the Orient a bowl of jade was a sure preventive of Poisoning , for the atone would make a poisoned liquid boil . Many poetical ideas as to the green of Spring landscapes , the colors of distant hills , of clouds and seas were woven about jade by the Chinese and Japanese poets . Its sonorous qualities made it a singing stone . Specimens of pendent musical stones marvelously wrought are seen under Nos. 644 and 646 . These belong to the Kien-Lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with pierced and relief designs , but with fish , bats , &c.,; at their edges ; one is light sage , green , the other olive brown nephrite . Much earlier is the date assigned to a hanging bell of nephrite under No. 348 , which is assigned to the Han dynasty , ( 206 B. C.-220 A. D. ) As we know that sonorous stones were used for bells in countries where iron and bronze were very rare , we may suppose that in these highly decorated triumphs of the stoneworker we have a survival of a very ancient stage in the evolution of the bell . The collection has its scientific side in specimens of the rough material in many shades from milky white to blackish green , with pieces more or less polished , and these are divided into sections according to the countries where they are mined or found on the surface , in rivers , &c.; There are even pieces from Europe , though the archaeologists once thought that all the celts and other things of jadeite found in European prehistoric graves must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found by George F. Kunz at Jordansmtihl in Silesia . Placed in cases they do not show to the same advantage as when in Use . Thus the flower vases are calculated by their color to place the flowers in perfect relief . The vases foe ' a temple which were meant for wine need the pale-colored liquid to show them off . No. 468  --  a large lotus-leaf dish carved from a dark sage-green nephrite , has on its floor a toad which is part of the dish . To show it off to advantage there should be water covering the toad up to its eyes ; goldfish should be floating through the water , and real waterlines riding on the surface . Jade is opaque , yet somewhat translucent , and some of the delicate , thin-walled cups only reveal the decorations carved on their bowls in very low relief when they are filled . It would take too long to mention a tithe of the sceptres , trays , flower-holders , head and hand rests , perforated screens , bird , beast , and human figures , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many-colored stone , nor can the bejeweled jades of India , the trees and shrubs full of fruit , the objects in coral , crystal , and lapis lazuli find mention . A morning would not be misspent given up to this gallery alone . No such exhibit can be found in Europe in public or private ownership .
