 |p593  WHEN zero has prevailed for days ; when the wind has been shifting , now blowing the spray-cloud this way , now that way , touching everything all about as though by liquid marble which hardened as it fell , then is the time to visit Niagara if you wish to dwell in a fairyland where the Ice-King reigns in all his glory . The familiar rocks , the familiar shrubs . the familiar trees , all have disappeared . and in their place there is a forest and setting of purest marble . The proper conditions for Niagara icebridge formations are then at hand also . Weeks of severe cold weather result in the formation of large bodies of ice in Lake Erie . Then comes a thaw to rot the ice , followed by a high wind from the west to break it and sweep it down the lake to the entrance to the Niagara . Once it is in the grasp of the river , the current hurries it on toward the falls with rapid pace . On the occasions of large floes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the falls , in many cases diverting the direction of the current , and making it possible to cross on the ice to points seldom reached . The most wonderful incident of this kind on record occurred on March 29 , 1848 . The winter had been very cold , and the ice in Lake Erie was exceedingly thick .  |p594  The warm days of approaching spring weakened it , and during the day a heavy wind started the ice-field in motion . It was swept into the river entrance in such immense quantities that it filled the outlet of the lake to such an extent that the flow of the water was impeded . In the morning the people at Niagara Falls found their river was half gone . Only a creeklike stream flowed through the American channel , and the water in the Canadian , or deeper , channel had also dwindled away . so far as water was concerned . The rocky bell of the river was bare . Niagara 's roar was gone . During the day the ice-dam at the river 's entrance near Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara The ice as it leases Lake Erie sweeps down the river in a mass that whitens the river from shore to shore , making a spectacle well worth watching from the trains of the several railways running between Buffalo and the falls along the river-bank . The trip of the ice through the upper rapids and over the falls breaks the mass into small , uneven pieces , few of which , strange as it may seem , are as large as a peck measure . And stranger still it is that this way , the ice in the eddies still , and gradually being added to from the moving mass in the center . The size of the floe increases : the channel in midstream is not large enough to carry the ice downstream . There conies a jam , the ice stops in its headway . A grinding . pushing , crowding noise comes up front the gorge . An icebridge is forming . It is fast . There it is breaking away at the lower end , while some of the ice at the upper end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam on such a current as that of the Niagara River below the falls and form all icebridge of such remarkable strength as some of these structures prove to possess . No feature is so interesting as the formation of a Niagara ice-bridge . Ifour after hour the ice tumbles over the American and the Horseshoe Falls . Gradually the eddies in the lower river become filled , and the ice in them extends out to the main current . When this stage of formation has been reached , the ice coming downstream is passing through a channel in the center of the stream . It may flow on for hours in swept beneath the quiet portion . It is moving . The ice in the center is again going downstream . This may continue for  |p595  hours longer until another great mass of ice comes over the falls . It fills the channel and piles up so that it is evident that it is firmly wedged . The ice already in the upper river and that at the lower section of the lake continue to pour down over the falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been quite high . lowers ; the icy mass in the gorge settles and wedges itself more firmly between the shores . Great cracks open here and there on the surface of the jam . The experienced eye says , " It is safe . " and out from either shore plunge venturesome people anxious to he the first to cross . This first crossing of a Niagara ice-bridge  |p596  is desperately dangerous business . The ground , if so it may be termed , is uncertain . Before starting out from the shore the adventurers take a survey of the surface of the bridge , deciding to avoid this or that fissure or crevasse , to accomplish which they frequently have to take a roundabout course . The longer they are on the ice . the longer they are in danger . They all aim to be fleet of foot , but the surface is most uneven . Smoothness is unknown in a Niagara ice-bridge . The trip across is simply uphill and downhill . The icy hillocks form an uncertain footing . There is many a tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such times he wonders where he is going , At times the route selected leads high up on an icy mound , and then down between the walls of a crevasse from which even the high banks are not to be seen . It is every man for himself during the first trip , for it could n't well be otherwise . It is a wild scramble . and there are always many spectators on the cliffs to watch the success of the several aspirants for fame . Women , as well as men . endanger their lives at this stage of the ice-bridge , and the names of the leaders in crossing are usually heralded through the press . while they also make an interestingrecord in the ice-bridge history . Nothing ill the world makes such a wonderful demonstration of the power of small things when united , as do these Niagara icebridges . At the point where the jams occur , the river is about one thousand two hundred to one thousand five hundred feet across , and the water in the channel has a depth of about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever the force of the falling water of the cataract , over which it is estimated that fifteen million cubic feet of water pass every minute . It is this stream , this current , this force of water , that these small particles of ice-bridge span so firmly that thousands of people cross from shore to shore on the mass , and even horses have been known to cross and climb the ice-mound . Horses that have made this trip have been brought clown the path on the Canadian side of the river and led across the ice-  |p597  bridge and up the mound , owing to the fact that there is no path to descend the cliff on the American side of the river . During the period of their existence the ice-bridges undergo wonderful changes . In the early stages the changes are frequent . Very often the first bridge lasts but a few days , but if the ice-bridge season is on , another bridge quickly takes its place . After a substantial bridge has formed and there comes a heavy floe of ice . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the upper line of the bridge , frequently building it away up to the foot of the Horseshoe or Canadian Fall . The water in the lower river rises , and the loose ice is swept over and on top of the bridge , changing its formation entirely , and building a structure that will last for weeks despite weather-changes . When this condition is reached , the hearts of the Niagara hotel proprietor , the bazaar man and the guide thump with joy . The season is then at its height . Excursionists number thousands upon thousands , all crowding to Niagara , by steam-roads and  |p598  by trolley-lines , all eager to see the vs inter spectacle . By this time the residents on both sides of the river have worn a good pathway across the bridge from shore to shore . Men of the hour . or men of opportunity , erect " shanties. " sometimes dignified by the name of " hotels , " on the bridge along the path . These buildings are a wonder . They spring up in a day , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . and each one has nearly two hundred feet of water in the " cellar . " Variety is the spice of ice-bridge life , and here and there is to be seen an Indian tepee . Squatter sovereignty prevails . In the matter of location it is first come , first served , and to get there means ownership of the site . Right in midstream , as near as the eye can judge . shanties crowd each other , and in these places liquors are frequently served . A few days of this seldom excites comment , but after the bridge has been in existence many days and has become well advertised , there is a change in the composition of the class of visitors . People who might have overlooked the sale of liquors at the start now criticise it . This develops a public sentiment , and the officials on each side act . Arrests are made . but the boundary line is always disputed , no matter on which side the culprits are held , and as the ice-bridge has passed away by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , with the possibility of repeating the offense removed . public sentiment has always , at this stage , been lenient . With the bridge firmly established , the shanties in place and the people pouring into Niagara , a glorious winter festival is opened . From shore to shore across the icy mass the people wend their way by thousands , a black , serpentlike moving mass of humanity , bending in and out , up and down the grandly uneven mass . They go and they come- a jolly , boisterous , laughing lot of people . the circulation of their blood stirred by their activity and outing , and the circulation of their finances increased by the smooth words of the tintype man . the bazaar man and the coffee and sandwich , or the wiener vender . Ladies rich in furs eat sausage with a relish on the ice-bridge. for tramping about the formation creates a startling appetite . During the ice-bridge season , Sunday is the heaviest day at Niagara , and on such occasions the cliffs echo and reecho with the hilarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river are black with  |p599  humanity , and the wonder is that some lives are not crushed out in the throng . Here and there about the ice-bridge little knots of people may be seen . They represent that class of individual who is determined to do something different from the multitude . They are explorers bent on planting a tree or bush on some hitherto unreached point . A flag will float from the top , and cheer on cheer will denote the success of the venture . Others will explore the deep crevasses. taking soundings to determine , if they can . how- thick the ice is at this or that spot . This matter of thickness is an interesting study , and men of considerable ability like to know the result of these investigations . It is usually estimated that about one-third of a body of ice remains above the surface of the water . In many instances the crevasses of the Niagara ice-bridges are all of thirty or forty feet deep . and on the basis referred  |p600  to the thickness of the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not given as an accurate statement of the thickness of the ice , for this question of thickness is a hard matter to ascertain with any degree of accuracy . However , if the ice has a thickness of thirty feet above the river 's surface , it is a safe conclusion that there is a considerable depth below the water . The winter of 1899 brought a most wonderful ice-bridge to Niagara . The formation was massive . Its power was threatening . The abutments of the upper steel-arch bridge . the greatest all-metal arch in the world . are located close to the water 's edge . right where the ice-bridges form . The ice gathered about these abutments to a height of eighty feet , extending away up into the steel work of the arch , pieces of which were bent . So immense was the jam of ice that gangs of men were set to work on both sides of the river blasting the ice front about the abutments in order that those structures might not suffer . The men who did this work found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also found that . owing to the strange formation of the ice-bridge , the operation of blasting had to be repeated several times . During the last summer the abutments of the arch have had protective walls built about them to assure their safety in times of similar ice-jams . There is no little gratification in the thought that the forming of an ice-jam at Niagara does not necessarily mean the loss of life and the destruction of homes and other property . On the Niagara River from the point of formation to Lake Ontario , the banks are sufficiently high to prevent a flood and to conduct the ice and water safely to the lake . But some of the ice-bridges at the falls have wrought damage . It was on January 15th that the first bridge of 188:3 formed , and on January 22d the second bridge came . With the coming of this second bridge in 1333 there was a great rush of ice . The water in the lower river was very high and about one hundred feet of the inclined railway building was carried away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the icebridge it was found necessary to excavate a tunnel eight feet high , fifteen feet wide and twenty-five feet long through the ice . Naturally , this tunnel added to the interest of a visit , and the wrecking of the incline building excited the curiosity of thousands . The bridge lasted thirteen weeks , and the crowds were tremendous . The night the bridge formed , a house on the Canadian side of the river , near the water 's edge , and occupied by John MCcloy and family . was carried from its foundations and tipped over . No matter how far up toward the horseshoe Fall a bridge may form in its early stages . it usually breaks away until its upper line is straight with the lower edge of the American Fall , but great masses of ice hold fast to either shore above that point .  |p602  The formations frequently extend down the river close to the whirlpool rapids , and many crossings have been made below the old " Maid of the Mist " landing . On the Niagara River between Lewiston and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and old residents recall that they have seen the river from the whirlpool to the mouth jammed with ice of wonderful shapes . Frequently when an ice-bridge is forming and the water is high , huge timbers are swept from points on the upper river and carried over the falls . Occasionally these timbers lodge in the ice-bridge. and when viewed from certain points appear to stand high above the cliffs . In some places on the icebridge , the mass forms like a congealed tidal wave , appearing like a great roll . To get down into a crevasse and peek through the ice at the falls is a novel experience and well worth the trouble . When the bridge first forms , all the little pieces of ice are plainly to be seen , however , after a snowfall an indescribable softness is given to the scene . The snow fills in about . the icy hillocks . It clings to the sides of the mountainous formations , the solid ice of the clunks peeking through lie re and there , now one color , now another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none equals that of the people who were on the ice on the afternoon of Sunday , January 22 , 1899 . That afternoon soon after four o'clock , the people who had gathered in the free parks and on the upper steel arch to view the winter spectacle were startled to notice that the icy mass had broken loose and was being carried downstream toward the whirlpool rapids by the current . On the icebridge at the time were from fifty to one hundred persons , some of them having ventured out only a short distance from shore , while others were well out in the center . There was prospect of a terrible river catastrophe , and the thousands of spectators stood aghast . At the first trembling of the ice , the people on the ice-bridge increased their efforts to reach the shore . The journey of pleasure had now turned into a race for life . Across the upheaving , moving mass of ice they ran , their feet hardly touching the surface in their progress . Down the river the ice continued to move . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but three persons had reached places of safety . These three were a man and a woman out toward the center , who were making for Canada . and a young man who attempted to reach the American shore . This young man displayed wonderful coolness . He had approached as close to the shore as the moving ice would allow and then he turned his face downstream . It was evident that he must change his route . Some began to think he was lost . He faced the upper steel-arch bridge . The crowd on the banks immediately got his idea of safety and  |p604  cheered him for his nerve . Up against the abutments of the bridge , the ice was crowding mountains high . There was an element of great danger in this turmoil of ice , but the young man kept his head . Straight up he stood . The ice moved along . If he passed under the bridge , he would certainly lose his life in the wash of the stream that poured out from the potter tunnel . It was a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up from the abutments. in most graceful form , the main span of the arch rises . It seemed almost impossible for him to grasp the bridge from where he stood , but fortune favored him . At the critical moment there was a mighty upheaval of ice . IIe was fairly lifted from the ice-bridge and thrown upon the arch , to which he clung with desperate tenacity until sufficiently composed . after which he made his way along the girders to the shore . cheered by all who were about . In the mean time the man and woman farther out on the ice had been making terrific efforts to reach the shire . The course they took was full of peril . It led them nearly the entire length across the ice-bridge . When they starters they were nearer the Amerman shore , but it was evident that they were frightened by the iee piling up there . They had selected the route they took because of its apparent smoothness , but it was terribly rough at its best , as they found in their Hight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe footholds . Repeatedly the woman was seen to fall . Her companion hurried on at times in his efforts to set a pace to encourage her and hurry her on . Once the crowds felt that he was deserting her . Time and again . however . he turned and helped her to her feet and prayed her to keep up courage . He did all that man could do for a fair companion , and when the people recognized his devotion to her , and that both would be saved or both die , they breathed silent prayers that their lives might lie spared . Finally , they were seen to reach the still ice in an eddy on the Canadian side and from this point men who had hurried down the bank aided them to shore . They had been carried over two thousand feet downstream on the moving ice . which seemed every moment as about to open out in a great crevasse beneath them .
