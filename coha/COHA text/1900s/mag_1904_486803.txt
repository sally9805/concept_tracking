People who commented upon President Roosevelt 's failure in Gen. Miles 's case to take the usual official notice of the retirement of the General of the Army , said it betrayed a small-minded and unforgiving temper which they would not have suspected in him . But that inference did the President injustice . No one can question his native magnanimity after reading his telegram of condolence on occasion of Senator Hoar 's death . It required a really lofty soul to overlook the fact that the Senator , in almost his last speech of any significance , thus characterized Theodore Roosevelt 's dealings with Colombia : " Now , Mr. President , I want to know ? I think the American people want to know and have a right to know  --  whether this mighty policeman , instructed to keep the peace on that isthmus , seeing a man about to attack another , before he had struck his blow manacled the arms of the attacked sp that he could not defend himself , leaving the assailant free , and then instantly proceeded to secure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was do facto the owner ? " AWL e home to the White House to roost . Another emergency calling for quick thinking and prompt action is before the President . His own bantling Republic of Panama has filed a protest with the State Department , on account of the high-handed action of this Government in the canal zone . It alleges oppression and violation of the treaty , and asks that the matters in dispute be referred to the Hague Tribunal . It might seem difficult for Mr. Roosevelt , in his new role as vacbAcator mnnda , to refuse so reasonable a request , , especially as he is just about to summon the Hague Conference afresh ; but it is already evident what sort of reply will be given to the pained Panamanians . The State Department has just explained pityingly to the Minister of Panama that arbitration is not for the likes of him . But , asks Minister Obaldia plaintively , is the Washington Administration to be both judge and jury , just because it is strong and Panama is weak ? Si , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this nation is going to let you have anything to say about our disposition of the booty ? The Republicans assure us that there is but one Roosevelt and that " two " is a slander . The approved maxims which he lays down as a candidate for the Presidency , are those which have always filled his thoughts and animated his whole life . Secretary Hay on Monday , addressing the International Peace Conference in Boston , added a few touches to the Presidential portrait now enjoying the greatest popularity . " President Roosevelt , " he said , " has the same tireless energy in the work of concord that he displayed when he sought peace and ensured it on the field of battle . No Presidents in our history , " he added , coupling McKinley with Roosevelt , " have been so faithful and so efficient as the last two in the cause of arbitration and of every peaceful settlement of difficulties . " " We shall continue to advocate and to carry into effect , as far as practicable , the principle of the arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations . " Now every good citizen must rejoice to hear such principles as these enunciated by a national administration , whatever its party complexion . What puzzles us is why , in nominating so conspicuous a man of peace , ex-Gov . Black should have gone out of his way to talk about war , a thing the mere thought of which is evidently abhorrent . Why , in celebrating the virtues of a life-long apostle of peace , should the epigrammatic orator have used the phrases he did ? " You may talk of orderly tribunals , " said he , " and learned referees ; you may sing in your schools the gentle praises of the quiet lire ; you may strike from your book the last note of every martial anthem , and yet out in the smoke and thunder will always be the tramp of horses and the silent , rigid , upturned faces . " If we are to accept Mr. Hay 's estimate of the President , all this was not only a disagreeable picture , but absolutely irrelevant . People who take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest that they can not read all of the letter by Carl Schurz , as printed in the Evening Post of Monday ; and it is perhaps over long . It contains , however , matter of the highest importance , set forth with singular fair-mindedness and literary skill . The weight of his long experience and honorable reputation goes with all that Mr. Schurz writes ; and this statement of his , though it may be attacked by many , will be asserted by no one to be the work of a partisan or dishonest mind . Republicans who have hailed Mr. Schurz'a adhesion to their cause , in those political contests when he has sided with them , can not with any grace sneer at him now , or discount his influence with men who choose their political company by conviction more than by prejudice . The ' analysis of President Roosevelt 's character is made by Mr. Schurz with an impartiality and keenness of discrimination which call for especial admiration . The tobacco-stamp decision , though it concedes a little to the Trust , is on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large red stamp " is to be red , but not large , and is to be put on the bottom of the box . The arguments in support of the decision are , be it noted , those advanced by the " independents . " They protested that in practice the stamp was used as a trade-mark to advertise the imported goods . President Roosevelt , as his view is expounded by the Secretary of the Treasury , holds : " The Government 's business is to collect the revenue and to provide as far as possible against fraud , but it is not the Government 's business to furnish a guaranty in the form of a trade-mark for the benefit of the goods This should be left in the tobacco business exactly as it is in all other businesses " Back of this conclusion stands a glittering aggregation of talent , as the late Mr. Barnum would have said : the Secretary of the Treasury and two of his assistants , the Solicitor of the Treasury , Attorney-General Moody , and the Pres- ? ident of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the Tobacco Trust is likely fn " inrinnn-nanni-s " and their 250,000 votes and eight Congressional districts  --  or was it twenty-eight in their last outgiving ? ? are presumably happy . In view of the awkward position of Republican orators and organs , called on to explain the $23,000,000 deficiency in the Government 's revenues for the first two months of the fiscal year , it is natural that they should greet with jubilation the news of a $5,800,000 surplus for September . It is true that the same month in 1903 yielded a surplus revenue of $6,300,000 , and in 1902 one of $11,000,000 . But there is , at all events , a surplus , and it may be that the turn of the tide is close at hand . Receipts by the Government , last month , ran beyond those of 1903 ? which has not happened since February . Expenditure increased , to be sure , more rapidly than income ; but expenditure can sometimes be temporarily held in check . Even so , the Government 's accounts will not provide very great comfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like $4,000,000 , can not be deferred ; it is not easy to keep down the drafts of the Navy Department , with the year 's much larger appropriations on the books , and even last October there was a deficit of nearly $5,000,000 . If last year 's results were to be duplicated , election day would be approached with a deficit , for the four completed months of the Rs. cal year , amounting to something like $23,000,000 . The Secretary of the Treasury , last December , estimated that the deficit for the full fiscal year 1905 would be just this sum . To escape exceeding even that far from optimistic estimate , it would be necessary to have no more excess of expenditure between election day and July first . Despit6 confident announcements , the Fall River mills did not open on Monday . That city  --  formerly so bustling  --  is to be given still further opportunity to reflect on President Roosevelt 's dictum that wages were never higher . Its mills are shut up , its merchants are losing money , and the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because the cotton-mill operatives are a little slower in recognizing that times have changed than other classes of labor have been . A good many mills of all kinds have been starting up lately because the employees have concluded to accept lower wages and talk less about the rights of unions . A heavy demand for cotton goods might bring victory to the Fall River operatives , but this is not yet in sight . Despite Republican prosperity , consumers think twice before paying high prices for cottons . If the mills are going to do any business , they must economize , just as those in a great many other industries have had to do . Cotton manufacturing is at present waiting , like every other business , for the country to catch up with its extraordinary expansion of the last six years . If the cut in wages is accepted in Fall River , it will undoubtedly be applied throughout New England . Perhaps that will be the result of the conference which , it is said , will shortly be held to settle the strike . Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shows what the fate of a boss would be who should dare ask the Voters to say what they think of him . Bosses know better than to submit themselves to a popular election . At any time when Platt was acclaimed as the undisputed leader of his party in this State , notoriously he could not have been elected to the humblest public office . This he well knew , and wisely stuck to his machine and his bend-slaves in the Legislature . But Odell has done his best to make himself the chief issue in this State campaign . Poor Mr. Higgins has thus far been so pushed into the background that , if he does not emerge soon , people will think that it is Odell who is the Republican candidate for Governor . Odell is making his wonderful card indexes of voters and appointing deputy leaders and exercising every art of the political manager in order  --  to elect Mr. Higgins ? No , to vindicate . himself . But the gathering clouds show what sort of storm is goingto burst upon the ! Doss who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bosses would " try it on " in the Odell fashion , so that they , too , might get the popular verdict upon their manners and morals . If we may judge by the space devoted to it in Western newspapers , the Mormon question will play a very important part in the politics of the Rocky Mountain States this year . The new third party in . Utah , calling itself the " American party , " has decided to nominate ' candidates of its own for all offices except Presidential electors and members of the judiciary . Meanwhile , Senator Kearns , one of the most prominent men in the new movement , in order to show that his attack on " Smoot-ism " is disinterested , has announced that he will not be a candidate for reelection . Nothing shows better the curious position of the two parties towards the Mormon Church than the fact that at the initial mass meeting of Gentiles at Salt Lake City , where Republicans were the moving spirits , the most vigorous and effective speaker was the Democratic Senator from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a strenuous fight against Church domination , while-the other ignores it as an issue . In Utah , since the Mormon Senator ' demonstrated his ' control over the Republican organization , a professedly non-partiSan anti-Mormon movement has begun , while the Democrats keep quiet and hope at heart ' that the solid Church vote will not be cast against them In Wyoming , a polygamous Mormon has just resigned as a Republican Presidential elector . But for the Smoot ' hearing 's before the Senate committee last winter , it is hardly probable that agitation would have taken this form . Unquestionably the most effective anti-Mormon ' document put forth in years is President Smith 's admission that if Apostle Smoot had run for the Senate without the Church 's permission , he would have been considered " out of harrnony with his quorum " Reports from Vermont tell of an organized and powerful movement for the repeal of the license law passed two Years ago , and this will be one of the important questions before the Legislature which assembled on Tuesday , though the party in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law It is evident that there has been a decided reaction from the temporary enthusiasm in which the State overthrew the long-standing prohibitory law . Forty-four towns which voted " yes " two years ago , voted " no " this year , while only one changed from no license to license . Most of the towns still for license declared for it by reduced majorities At the same time , it must not be forgotten'that to say that license has failed in any number of localities is a very different thing from saying that the local-option law is a failure as compared with statutory prohibition . It is a good thing that these forty-four towns have seen their way to get rid of the saloon through the movement of their own public sentiment  --  much better for the cause of morality and sound government than if the same places were compelled to reform because other towns outvoted them . The Southern States presentcto-day the largest stretches of " dry " territory in the country , though not one of them has State prohibition . Local sentiment has brought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State as Tennessee the sale of liquor is confined to less than a dozen of the larger cities . If every town and city of Vermont-should vote " dry " at the next election , it would not necessarily be an argument for going back to statutory prohibition . Secretary Taft 's order that the Chicago River tunnels must be lowered before April , 1906 , so as not to interfere with navigation , is a step in one of the most extraordinary campaigns ever taken against a municipal nuisance . The tunnels effectually blocked the river to vessels of any great draught , and agitation to have them lowered has been intermittent for many years . One local authority after another was appealed to , without result . As a last resort the city applied to the Federal Government , not for ' the usual financial aid in improving a river for navigation , but for drastic action . Representatives from the city of Chicago introduced at the last session of Congress and pushed through a bill authorizing the Secretary of War to declare the tunnels an obstruction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their maintenance . " I find that I have not the moral resolution to do right of my own accord and remelt ? those tunnels , " the city said , in effect ; " I therefore beg that you threaten me and if necessary punish me until I do . " The rod is to he applied by request of the naughty boy It was a novel enough way of going about a reform and may Drove to be effective ; yet we fancy that the city would have been up in arms had the initiative come from without . The Evening Post 's Washington correspondent pertinently suggests that there should be some organization akin to the Indian Rights Association with the object of supplying accurate news from the Philippines . As it is now , the people of this country must depend for their information largely on the reports of officials , most of whom are directly interested in representing the situation as paradisaical . President Roosevelt declares the insular government a model , and Secretary Taft does not dissent when his enthusiastic superior - compares him to Cromer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright 's only trouble is the pesky Americans ( Mr. Roosevelt included ) who will upset the Filipinos by talking of their independence . But outside of official circles there is a very great difference of opinion . The military men in the islands can see nothing in the future save bloodshed and unceasing strife . The American newspapers and business men in Manila can not sufficiently express their contempt for the commission and all its works , while intelligent foreigners , like John Foreman , consider our experiment a practical failure thus far . Surely , there ought to be some means of getting news of the islands which is absolutely non-partisan and accurate , leaning neither towards the Civil Commission , the army , nor the merchants whose cry is the Philippines for the Americans . If something of this kind is not done , the public must continue to be misled or deceived . American consuls in Europe are now busy participating in a symposium on " dumping . " The views of our representatives at London , Glasgow , and Edinburgh were published on Thursday . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' inadequacy " of the Democratic argument that the tariff should be lowered to keep American manufacturers from selling cheaper abroad than at home . The British , it seems , keap up the home market and cut prices Lo foreigners , just like our own Trutts . Such is the conclusion drawn from the following statement of our consul at Glasgow : " Surplus stocks are avoided , even to the extent of closing the works . However , if there is a surplus , ' odds and ends , ' it is exported at reduced prices . " The consul-general at London is " quite convinced " that concessions are made to foreign buyers , but he slips up when it comes to furnishing proof . The best he can do is to cite the " dumping " of several ' hundred copies of a book which " did not sell as well as expected " at home . No doubt the British manufacturer cuts prices abroad when he finds he has miscalculated the market , but nothing is said by our consuls to contradict the plain inference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  namely , that the " dumping " mcthods of Germany and the United States are something English and Scotch manufacturers have yet to be educated up to . That is why the Hon. Joseph wants a protective tariff . It does n't make a particle of difference how big your loss is abroad , if you can only make your friends and neighbors at home foot the bill . That is one difference between the British and the American " dumper " ; the latter can hide behind a protective tariff . Our consul at Pretoria recently lodged a protest with the British Foreign Office against the treatment of thirteen American negroeS in the Transvaal . They have not been allowed to travel in second-class railway carriages , or to walk on the side-paths ( which seem to be reserved exclusively for the whites ) , or to start in business . It will , unfortunately , not be difficult for the Foreign Office , if it sees fit , to send our consul some countervailing facts about the treatment of negroes south of Mason and Dixon 's line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Sensitive Southerners will , of course , see in all this merely another Repiiblican bid for the negro vote The English Liberals are citing it as proof of their contention that Mr. Chamberlain 's moving indignation on account of the outrageous treatment of the Kaffirs by the Boers was pumped up . Lord Lansdowne , in the days before the war , declared that , " among the many misdeeds of the South African Republic , he did not know of any that filled him with more indignation than its treatment of the Queen 's Indian subjects . " Lord Salisbury 's war cry was : " Equal rights for men of all races . " The wrongs of the poor Kaffirs were dwelt upon by any number of humbugging Imperialistic orators , who now pay no attention to the appeals of British Indians , American negroes , and Zulus for the restoration of the good old times of President Kruger . Sir William Harcourt enjoyed in England , and particularly in the House of Commons , a repute not unlike that of Senator Hoar in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years , but in his entire conception of public life .

In all that related to finance and fiscal policy he was a master , and nobody would have been better able to pulverize Mr. Chamberlain 's contentions . Hence Sir William 's disappearance from the scene at this juncture will make his loss doubly felt Uncompromising in public life , and above the art of being all things to all men , he was not a popular leader of his party ; but in private his charm was great . His learning and wit and knowledge of the world made him much in demand socially .

A front sixty miles long has hitherto been unheard of in military annals , and raises at once some very interesting questions Can an army extended over such a distance be successfully commanded by one human being ? The size of a regiment has been limited by what is considered the capacity of a colonel , : lust as the size of a squadron of cavalry has practically been fixed by the physical inability of a captain to control more than a given number of horsemen . If Oyama can really manouvre four armies as one , keep them in touch on plain and mountain , and prevent the line from developing a fatal weakness at any critical point , the art of warfare must certainly have advanced The Japanese are said to be very strong in their field telegraph and in their planning in advance for every detail of a battle ; but the failure of the smaller - enveloping movement at Liaoyang makes it probable that Oyama will again have to content himself with a strategic success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
