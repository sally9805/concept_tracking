txt In the same bite ' in which he made his famous appeals to the people on the Race-track Gambling and Public Service Commission bills , Gov . Hughes to-night added a third appeal direct to the citizens for the policies-he represents . It was aimed specifically at the arguments raised by Lieut . Gov . Chanter On the issues of " Government by commission " and " Personal liberty . " While an audience of 2,500 people that packed the Majestic Theatre to the roof , shouted and cheered its approval , the Governor repeated the - questions he asked his opponent in a recent speech , and added that he should continue to ask them until Mr. Chanter replied or his silence became more eloquent than words . These are the questions : Are you in favor of the repeal of the Public Commission laws ? Would you transfer the powers of the commission to any State officer , and , if we , to what officer ? Would you deprive the commission of any Of its powers , and , if so , of what power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnew-Hart bill ? - Are you in favor of the restoration of race track gambling ? Do yen desire the amendment of the Constitution of the State so as to strike out the prohibition against nubile narubling ? " Let my opponent cease to hide behind phrases , " declared the Governor . " This is serious business . It is an important political campaign , not a masked ball . An effort has been made to capitalize the points of resentment against me . Opposition , honest opposition , is a good thing . But we want this opposition to come to the stage where we can know what it really Is . " Talks on Direct Primaries . The Utica speech came at the end of a busy day . Gov . Hughes got in here early this morning , and soon after breakfast was under way on a trolley trip , in the course of which he spoke at Ilion , Herkimer , and Little Falls . To-night he devoted his speech almost entirely to State issues , taking up first the matter of direct primaries . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be strong , virile , and efficient , " must be democratic ; it must provide the largest means for the participation of the voters of the party in the party action , and for feeling of responsibility on their part for the , action taken . It is not well that the voters of a party should feel that they do not count , that the men whom they may select to represent them in conventions will , by virtue of the method of their selection , in effect , act under dictation . I speak in the interest of party government , and I speak- in the interest of party leadership . " Party leadership is essential . Leadership in all undertakings is not only necessary but inevitable . We are all looking for , leadership , and we instinctively bow with respect to any one who points the way in the path we know we should tread .

Indifference of Voters . ** course , you ca n't change human nature by any legislation , and such are our activities , such are the manifold demands upon us , that too many of us fail to take advantage of the opportunity offered and probably many will for the most of the time fail to take advantage of any opportunities that can be offered . " There are a great many critics that have not any real basis for criticism , because they do n't do what they can do to prevent that which they criticise . Applause .

And the fact that there was such provision and such opportunity for forcing their sentiments , would be at all times a powerful incentive to the best - work in the party and the choice of the best man . Therefore , I desire to see adopted in this State a system of direct nomiantions by political bodies . " Great applause . In speaking of the Public Service Commission Gov . Hughes called attention to the incongruity between the declaration of the Democratic platform favoring an extension of the powers of the Inter-State Commerce Commisuton and the declaration of the Rochester platform against " government by commission . " He n ed the fact that Grover Cleveland signed creating half a dozen comtnidsions , and that David B. Hill strongly advocated the creation of a gas commission . Then he continued : " The government by commission in.dorsed by the Democratic candidate for the Presidency , indorsed by the National platform , indorsed by Grover Cleveland and David B. Hill , is now denounced by the State platform . and the candidate , the Democratic candidate for Governor says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do away with it . New York Traction Situation . " Why ? I think I can give you an idea why . ELaughter . What were the forces behind the Rochester Convention ? Who was it that dictated the denunciation of government by commission ? What inspired that attack ? Look at the City of New York . There is cne of the finest opportunities for public service that the ' world knows . There is an opportunity for work in the interest of the public in the carriage-of passengers , richer in opportunity , richer in variety , and more profitable than any like opportunity in . any city " But . by heaping issues of securities on each other : by improvident agreements ; by financial manipulation ; by pyramiding these obligations , only with the pyramid on its apex , and broadening ' as it goes up , these constituent companies organized to give traction facilities in New York City have been broken down and lie prostrate in the courts in the hand of court receivers . " Now is the time for rebuilding and reorganization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new system developed . What stands between the City of New York and the issue of watered stocks and other obligations ? What is it that stands to-day in the way of the repetition of these manipulations giving profit to the Insider and impoverishing the service to the --  people ? -.  --  What is there that stands Coiitlauetr on , . - Page HUGHES STICKS TOQUERIES TO CHANLER // between : , e people and ' repetition of the scandals or : he past ? It is the public service commission law . Applause . And there are those who want to get rid of it . " That is the milk in the cocoanut . " They do . not like to have a Public Service Commission pass upon their new agreements . their new schemes . They do not want to be compelled to submit 1.3 public authority and to comply with the provisions of the law requiring the proper issue of securities under conditions that would safeguard the public interet . They want a freer hand ; therefore they say , ' We denounce government by commission . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . There Is one provision of the plaJiic service commissions law giving commission supervision over the methods of keeping accounts and the bookkeeping of the corporations subject to their jurisdiction . We know the practha.s that have been indulged in in charging various items to ' construction account , ' and thus having them go into ' capital account ' and burden earnings pith the return to be earned by them . We want faithful . intelligent , businesslike bookkeeping , and now it has got to be had . " Is it desired that that power should be taken away ? Formerly a franchise could be sold by one company to another , or leased on such terms and for such periods as were desired without supervision . The Twenty-third Street Railroad Company was leased to the Metropolitan Street Railway Company at a rental requiring the payment of 18 per cent . dividends a year , and receivers are still paying that rental . The Broadway and Seventh Avenue line was leased on a 10 per cent . dividend rental . Commission 31ast Approve . " Under the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned without the approval of the Public Service Commission ; nor is any contract made with regard thereto without the approval of the commission . In other words , the policy is , ' Show your hand . Let the representatives of the people find out whether it is all fair and right . ' We want to have honest building up . We want to have a just reorganization , we want everything that can be done to have our traction system in good condition , but we want it on a basis which will stand . so that enterprise and investment may have due recognition and those conducting the service may have a fair return . " On the other hand the public interest may be safeguarded , and earnings may be properly disposed . and rates may be charged which are ; air to the investor and at the same time reasonable and fair to the public . " Do they desire to take that power away and allow them to transfer franchises and make leases and all kinds of interlocking arrangements without any supervision and control ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply to capitalize what the constituent companies had , but to capitalize the merger itself ; to issue . securities not against property alone . but . against the very fact of consolidation . " Under the public ' service commission law these matters are put under restriction , and the action of the ' public body is required before they can become effective . " Speaks to Operatives . The day 's trip was by trolley to Ilion and Little Falls , with a brief stop at Herkimer iri the afternoon . First came Ilion , Senator Seth Heacock 's home town , where an outdoor meeting was arranged during the - noon hour for the especial benefit of the operatives of the Remington Arms and Remington Typewriter Works . A crowd of some 1.200 people was the result . It was a very friendly crowd and listened with attention and frequent applause to a half-hour speech . The Governor caught *his listeners well by his treatment of Mr. Bryan 's scheme of limiting any enterprise to 50 per cent . of the total output If ' Is particular product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . perhaps . " said the Governor . He is aiming right at the workingman , for you can not impair the efficiency of plants and reduce or curtail output in an arbitrary mann .. r without its resulting in the di.a " charge of . ' nipioyes because of the reduction of work . We want to go for ' cc-I ? mg whether it is committed by a man making S per cent . or 50 per cent . or 100 per cent . Go for all of them . We have had en nigh of this ratio business . We do not want 10 to 1 , we do not want 30 to 50 , we do not want 7o to 23 . We want to deal with things that are bad and protect business interests of the country that are legitimate and give preper employment to ' abate an1 at this time we want sane , sagacious leadership by a wise man . " ' Hearty Reception in Little Falls . From Ilion , Gov . Hughes went to Little Falls by way of Herkimer . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and spoke from an outdoor platform for ten minutes . The Hughes supporters in Little Falls had prepared to do things up brown . In the square when the special trolley stopped were hundreds of men , women , and children , and when a parade of automobiles was formed to go to the Opera House , a mile away , the crowd followed along , again packing the street when the theatre was reached . Inside the auditorium was jammed . and a hearty cheer was given when the Governor stepped out on the stage . He devoted a good part of his speech to the bosses . and his audience particularly appreciated what he said on this subject . " Of course I have had opposition , " said Gov . Hughes . " I do n't mind it ; on the other hand . I enjoy it thoroughly . It acts as a tonic , and makes a fellow feel real good because he is fighting for something . I have been abused , and those who have abused me have known that'I would not retaliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I warmly . appreciate it . but I have not given them what they were not entitled to on account of their support . Why He Is Running Again . " ' When I spoke here two years ago I did not suppose I 'd ever run for Governor . again . But I 'm here just because of the I opposition that we have had . I want to ! see it demonstrated that you can apply the correct principles of government and have the support of the people . It is important to have that ' demonstration . Now . I do n't like to talk about myself , but I have got to do it , and I am going to see this thing out . " Now , the plain fact is this : If I am reelected . every public officer that is trying to do his duty , every legislator that is trying to hew to the straight line , every man in a. position of public obligation that is trying to be square With the people , will feel that he can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically alive . Applause ) " If I 'm not elected , everybody- who is against an effort to give an impartial and clean Government to the State will rejoice that this Administration has been rebuked . If I am defeated every man that is wavering just a little as to what ' he should do  --  and every man knows ninety-nine times out of a.hundred what he ought to do ? if I am defeated every man that is wavering in that way and , wondering which is the better course , will ' say , ' Well , that may be . all very fine . but in politics it does n't 13a.y ; we have got ter do something else . ' " And I do n't want to see the young ' man coming Into public life , an honorable man  --  andwe.havg:got lots of them , ' men square and honorable and wanting to do their best ? I don'aawant to see them discouraged and frightened and disheartened .
