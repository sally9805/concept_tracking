 | IN the suburbs of the city of Cincinnati 's a miniature farm . This farm is owned by a woman who depends in it for a livelihood , for altho she has a so-called pension from the Government , it is a mere pittance , on which she could not possibly exist if it were not for the patch of land she calls her own . This lady ? for a lady she is ? is obliged to raise mushrooms for a living- , yet only a few years ago she was one of the most prominent women in American official life ? the wife of our former Minister to France . When General Noyes was appointed to this office in 1877 he had a fortune of $150,000 . When he ' died his widow was left practically penniless . Every dollar of his fortune , in addition his salary , had en required during his residence abroad to meet the expense necessary to live in a manner befitting the dignity of his position . Such is but one of many illustrations that might be cited of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in foreign countries . In the capitals of Europe the cost of maintaining a suitable establishment is so great that the majority of our Ambassadors and Ministers today disburse most , if not all , of the money they receive for their service in house rent alone . Take , for example , our Ambassador to Great Britain . We pay him $17,500 a year . It costs him actually $45,000 for a home . The Ambassador to Vienna has been fortunate in renting a house at an annual payment which is just equal to his yearly stipend $12,000 . These as well as the other officials in the foreign service must make up all additional expense out of their private incomes . Few , if any , secure revenue from fees or other perquisites in connection with their official duties . Any one familiar with the duties which the members of our diplomatic corps are called upon to perform is well aware that their success depends very largely upon their position or standing- with the people among whom they are sent . To illustrate this point more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations at Washington . II the Minister from even one of the smaller countries resided in a suite of rooms or a less pretentious house than the one he occupies , his influence would be lessened , and the nation he represents would be affected accordingly . The homes which Great Britain and Russia furnish their embassies at the capital are most important  | factors in contributing to the prestige of these Powers among Americans . So it is that our own diplomats find it essential to reside in neighborhoods and in houses in keeping with the rank of the nation they represent ; but to do this necessitates an expense which , as I have intimated , is usually far in excess of their salaries , and even where they practice rigid economy , they are compelled to make tip the difference out of their own pockets . Such are some of the reasons for the bill which 1 had the honor to introduce at the present session of Congress , appropriating funds to purchase suitable homes at least in the European capitals for our embassies and legations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from a study of our diplomatic and consular service , are all in favor of such a measure , for there are many advantages , not only to our representatives . but to the American people , which would result if the United States owned every piece of property on which our shield has been raised , to show that , temporarily , at least , it is American soil . What would it mean to the families of our Ambassadors , our Ministers and our Consuls ? It would mean a home which only a woman removed from her relatives , her friends and familiar associations , to a strange country among strange people , can thoroly appreciate . Perhaps we have thought far less of the women and children in our foreign service than we should . Some of the places where they have been housed have been apologies for dwellings , but there was no other choice . American ladies have endured and suffered not a little in manyparts of the world , because , as wives of our Consuls , they were obliged to accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instance where the man who represented the United States at Canton was obliged to rent half of a Chinese hut when he assumed the duties of his position . All of the Consuls live on a little island containing but two acres ; because they would not be safe in the city . So crowded was it that only this miserable place could be secured for the time being . An American Consul to Persia was compelled to put up with a tent on arriving at his field of labor . He could not get anything else in the way of a shelter . But when they are so fortunate as to secure a " consular residence , " it is often unfit to live in . Suppose a woman accompanies her husband to some post in Asia or Africa , how can she expect to have even the semblance of a home in a building constructed and arranged according to the customs of the native people , of which she propably knows nothing ? She may bring some household necessities , but even with these it is usually impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she has been accustomed , and if there are children they must suffer with their parents . The same argument applies to many portions of Europe where the United States is represented by Americans . The mode of life of the people is as strange as may be their language , and the housewife who tries to convert one of their dwellings into a home often finds it a hopeless task , and the life becomes mere1v an existence , from which all are only too glad to be released . Unless a law is enacted which will prevent a married man from taking a consular position which is not very probable ? we must remember that there is often a woman in the case who deserves consideration as well as her husband . We will assume what is generally true , that she is accustomed to associations of refinement , to surroundings of comfort . perhaps luxury . At many of the stations she finds conditions exactly the reverse . She may be unable to have any intimacy with the people such as she enjoyed in America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an uninhabited country . Her home and family become everything to her . She appreciates husband and children as never before . Wr will infer that the Government I bought a site for a consulate . This means that a house can be built , which . tho suited to the climate and character of the country , can be planned with the appointments of an American dwelling , and furnished with articles to which Americans are accustomed . Such provision made for our representatives in the more remote countries is a necessity if we expect to keep men at these posts who are qualified to perform their duties in a satisfactory manner . It will go a long way  | to make them contented if their families are at least sheltered comfortably . I need not say that the wives of our Ambassadors , our Ministers and other officials in the more important countries of the Old World , occupy very important positions from the standpoint of diplomacy . We are so democratic in the United States that most of us do not realize the conspicuous part which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is absolutely necessary for the success of his mission that the diplomat enter into the social life of the capital to which he is assigned if his mission is to be successful . 11any are the affairs of state conceived and planned at the dinner or the reception . Here the necessity of a suitable establishment is apparent . It is an unwritten law that the representative of a nation must entertain on a scale befitting the standing of the nation if its importance is to be fully impressed upon the people of other countries . The wife can give much valuable assistance in this respect by displaying her tact and ability as hostess , but to do so she must have appropriate surroundings . To give a dinner , for instance , in a hotel or pension would belittle the United States in the eyes of the European , just as he considers it beneath the dignity of any nation to establish its legation or consulate anywhere except in a residence which , for the time at least , is its individual property . These are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often entail an expense which the average American may deem unnecessary , but which is absolutely required , as the one familiar with European ways well knows . The policy was adopted at the very foundation of this Government of paying to our public officials a salary founded on the principle of simplicity and lack of ostentation in living , and thus the salaries of many of the great public officials are less in this country than in other countries approaching anywhere near us in wealth and power . No matter how strong may be the sentiment among the people of this country for Jeffersonian simplicity , surely no one can argue that a salary should be paid a public official which should not enable him to live at least in a manner commensurate with the dignity of his position , It is a grevious mistake to fix the salary of any office in the gift of the American people so low that only a rich man can accept it . Yet this lamentable condition is trite of manv , of the positions in our diplomatic service . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States with the salaries paid our representatives abroad we will find that there is not a single European country having an Ambassador in the United States which does not give him a compensation larger ? perhaps three times larger than what we offer to our officials of the same rank . More than this , there is hardly a country represented at Washington by an Ambassador that does not actually own its embassy , in every capital of Europe . In the few instances where such countries do not own or lease an official residence for a long term of years they invariably allow their Ambassadors a substantial sum of money for house rent . Nor is there a single one that does not make a further allowance , in addition to salary , for maintaining- the embassy and for incidental expenses . Take Great Britain for example . The salary of the Ambassador at Paris is $45,000 : Berlin , $40,000 ; Vienna , $4o ,  - -  000 ; Rome , $35,000 . In each city the embassy is owned by the British Government . Germany owns its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome and ienna , which are at the disposal of its Ambassadors , who receive from $25,000 to $37,500 in addition . Russia not only owns her embassies in Europe and this country , but allows from $5,000 to $6,000 to each for expenses besides the regular salaries . Even Italy makes an allowance of $18,000 annually for house rent and entertainment , besides the salaries of its principal diplomats . It may be argued that other nations are extravagant in their appropriations for foreign service , but there are abundant instances to show that such is not the case . There is the illustration of Lord Dufferin , who was compelled to resign his position at the French Embassy on account of the legitimate expense incurred above his salary and allowance . When the position was tendered to other English statesmen no less than three de clined it , giving as the reason that they  | could not afford to accept because of the tax which would be made on their private income . It is idle nowadays to talk about the sentiment for the simple life in diplomacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , for that matter , the great majority of our diplomatic representatives , can conform with the diplomatic customs of the countries where they are stationed and keep within the limits of their salaries . It is not a question of theory as to what it should cost . It is a question of what it must cost to live in keeping with the rank of the nation for which one stands . He can not receive official visits in a threeroom flat , nor can the hostess entertain her guests in the diplomatic circle on bread and milk , without bringing the American people into contempt and ridicule . A story has been told in this connection of one of our former Ministers in a European capital , who established the legation in a suite of rooms so small that visitors were unpleasantly greeted with the odor of cooking . To complete the impression they may have gained from the meanness of the surroundings , the " host " had a habit of receiving every one , from ambassador to envoy , in his shirt sleeves . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his card , with this remark : " Consider your call returned . " It can be readily imagined how our foreign friends who have not visited America would regard this country after such an experience . I have already referred to the necessity of the official residences of our diplomats being located in suitable neighborhoods of cities to which they are assigned ; but where they must rent a place , its locality may depend too much on their generosity toward the American people . If a millionaire , the official may decide to go into the ultra - fashionable quarter . If he is merely " well off , " as we call it , his home may be on one of the back streets , perhaps ; but we can only surmise where the ambassador who has a moderate or meager income might dwell , for if we had no rich men available , the office of ambassador would probably be vacant , especially if the wives are to be consulted , for few would care for official life , brilliant and enjoyable as it might be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case too often . Could any condition be more deplorable than that wealth alone should be a necessary qualification to fill such a high office ? Yet year by year the truth of this proposition becomes more firmly established . I venture to say that only a few men in public life today , qualified to represent us abroad by reason of their mental attainments , are financially eligible . It is merely our singular good fortune that we have been able to fill the most important posts in European capitals with men of ability who also have incomes to allow them to hold such positions . But there are several other important phases of this subject which should also be referred to . In China it is actually dangerous for one of our consuls to live out of a compound . Unless so protected , he and his household are liable to be attacked by the disorderly native element . Here we should own land on which houses can be erected strong enough to give protection to the occupants , while they can be modeled to form suitable living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This argument can be applied in general . The consulate is usually the place where official business is transacted , as well as affording a residence . It is frequently very difficult to rent a building at any price suitable for both purposes . In connection with the office , especially where the station is of importance , facilities for safeguarding the many valuable documents on file should be provided . There is continual danger of fire , often of robbery , and a fire-proof compartment or vault is very necessarv . The diplomat from the United States who endeavors to secure a building for his headquarters usually has to pay a much greater rent than any one else . The average foreign landlord thinks we are green , and if he finds that his property is wanted for the consulate or embassy , is apt to put a much greater valuation on it than to his own countryman . This partly accounts for some of the high rents in the larger European cities ? sums so large that if the property were bought the amount would represent  | but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business economy , in my opinion , for the United States to buy sites in such cities as London and Paris for its official residences , for not only the rent would be saved , but in these , as well as other large communities of Europe , property is steadily appreciating in value . I believe this subject should appeal to every American woman when we remember how many of the sex are associated with our consular service , and the important part they assume in connection with it . Have they not the right to the conveniences and comforts which a permanent home might afford ? It is not unreasonable to provide suitable buildings and appointments for the women as well as men who represent us among other peoples , remembering how essential is their effort in maintaining our prestige with other countries . I feel that the women of the country can be of much assistance in the adoption of the bill pending in Congress , if individually or as organizations they will urge its necessity upon their representatives .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
