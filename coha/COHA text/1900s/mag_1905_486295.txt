SIR In your issue of December 7 there is found a criticism of the ' Life of Omar Al-Khayyami , ' by J. K. M. Shirazi . In your criticism of Mr Shirazi 's work you say " Mr. Shirazi well says , however , that , - agnosticism , not faith , is the keynote of his works . But it is agnosticism modified by Mohammedanism and a very human liking for the joys of life ' " Mr. Shirazi has wrongly followed , though , no doubt willingly , the commentaries of the French admirers of the great " astronomer-poet " of Persia ; and the French commentators and Mr. Shiraz ' , with respect be it spoken , have willingly or wofully misconceived the spirit of the chord of Omar Khayydm . So have you , with profound respect be it spoken The keynote of the works of Omar was faith , and with that profound faith there was contempt for the gross sensualness of Mohammedanism , coupled , nevertheless , as you rightly observe , " with " a very human liking " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with contempt for it , are not unlike poor Omar , who despised Mohammedanism , but availed himself of its licenses . But you have forgotten , what an American critic ought not to have forgotten , this exquisite rubaiy , lt " The worldly hope men set theit hearts upon Turns ashes  --  or it piospers and anon Like snow upon the desert 's dusty face Lighting a little hour or two  --  is gone " Omar Khayyam was a great mathematician , a logician knowing the value of words and the weight to be . given to a formulated proposition He appreciated what he felt and what he had committed to writing , and he was content to be judged thereby When he declared that it was the earthly hope that turned to ashes after a little hour or two , he must be taken as distinctly implying his belief in an eternal hope that would neither turn to ashes nor , " Like snow upon the desert 's dusty face , lighting a little hour or two " and then - vanish , and no poet , preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisitely have proclaimed his Leith in a future life of pain or of happiness At least neither poet nor believer ever did The rubaiyat I have quoted is but one of many that could be quoted in defence of the faith of the great astronomer-poet , but all that could be quoted are but complemental to his confession 01 faith , while running through his works is a vein of contempt  --  not often concealed  --  tor Mohammedanism ? Very respectfully , LAURIE J. BLAKEDY . COVING-TON , KY , December 19 , 1905 Our judgment on the agnosticism of Omar Khayyam was based neither on the book of Mr. Shiraz ' nor on the adaptation of FitzGerald , but on a certain amount of study of the original Persian and some reading of translations of which Mr. Blakely seems unaware . This is neither the time nor the place to enter into a discussion of the relation of FitzGerald to the Persian text , but we suggest that our correspondent read the real versions of a poet whom we both admire , Whinfield 's ' Quatrains of Omar Khayyam ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still better , Payne 's ' Quatrains of Omar Kheyyam of Nishapour ' ( London , 1898 ) . Omar is not an easy poet , and his quatrains represent , as do the thoughts of all men who endeavor to unravel the tangle of life , diverse and conflicting views according to mood and experience . Our faith in Fitz-Gerald as an interpreter is as scanty ' as in the French commentators whom Mr. Blakely rightly condemns Poet and man must be judged by the sum total of their words , not by isolated expressions , beautiful though they may be . Uninfluenced , then , by Shirazi , Nicholas , or- FitzGerald , we still feel that , all things considered , the keynote of Omar is agnosticism ; that it is summed up in the eleventh ode of the first book of Horace with its refrain of Carpe diem . ?

It has been undertaken by Prof. Burt G Wilder of Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beiblt published in London on behalf of the Queen 's Fund for the Unemployed It consists of ' poems , stories , sketches , drawings , and pieces of music by leading British authors , artists , and composers , who have united to make in this way their response to the appeal . Among the nearly fifty contributors are the Poet Laureate , Sir L Alma-Tadema , Holman Hunt , Sir F Burnand , Austin Dobson , Mrs W K. Clifford , Marie Corelli , and Sarah Grand . The publication has been undertaken by Sir Alfred Harms-worth , and the cost ( half a crown ) places it within the reach of nearly all classes The fund now amounts to mere than half a million dollars . The Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress has just put forth a ' List of the Benjamin Franklin Papers ' in that storehouse , prepared by John C Fitzpatrick What is here made available is the " second series , " so called , of the Stevens collection acquired by the Government , or , the non-diplomatic MSS. yielded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent it is doing well what had been done badly in the list of the entire collection printed by the Senate of the 47th Congress .

On the other hand it embodies papers found in the Library outside the collection , and indicates previous use of any in print , particularly by Mr. John Bigelow . There is an index of persons and topics , and this serves well enough through its chronological arrangement answering to that of the calendar , but when dates are doubtful and so bracketed 7 , we think the page of the List should have been affixed for reference , It is true that these are bunched together at the end , like Lord Timothy Dexter 's punctuation marks , and fill less than ten pages ; still , some time must- needs be lost  --  e. g let one try - to run down the rubric " English honesly " We are glad to record the appearance of another volume , ' King Lear , ' in the pock-et-edition of the First Folio , so scrupulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The first contains ' The Art of War , ' translated by Peter Whitehorne and first published in 1560 , and ' The Prince , ' ' in-the version of Edward Dacres , which dates from 1640 The second volume is filled with ' The Florentine History , ' Englished. by Thomas Bedingfield in 1595 We do not need to call attention to these seasoned works , which may be read with pleasure by any one who has a taste far " the rich , sententious English - prose of three centuries ago .

He gives a true glimpse of Machiavelli 's greatness , as historian , as political philosopher , as prophet of reforms which came to pass many generations later , as dramatist and as writer . He says with exact truth , " The slender volume of ' The Prince ' has probably produced wider discussion , more bitter controversy , more varied interpretation , and a deeper influence than any book save Holy Writ " He might have added that Machiavelli is the only modern whose style can stand beside that of Tacitus , firm as adamant in texture , yet swift and varied in flow .

It will please a class of readers unacquainted with Bourrienne and Madame Lenormand , indifferent as to criticism and judgment , unskilled in matters of grammar and rhetoric , intent merely on promiscuous anecdote and cheap sentiment . The critic is left disarmed by the obvious candor of Miss Bearne 's mind and her complete , if unrealized , helplessness before the problem she has attempted However , she is sure to reach a wide public , and may find consolation in that fact T Henry Dewey 's ' Legislation against Speculation and Gambling in the Forms of Trade ' ( ' Baker , Voorhis &; Co ) is a small volume of seventy pages collecting the English and American statutes dealing with this subject  --  not only those Prohibiting , but those permitting , speculative transactions .

The author thinks that the compilation demonstrates " the confusion , inconsistency , and absurdity of the attitude of the public manifested in them , " but is also of opinion that there is now ! is , decided tendency toward non-interference with the natural courses of trade " The true test would seem to be " whether the right of the buyer to require , and of the seller to make , actual delivery existed . " On one side of this is legitimate speculation ; on the other , " bucket-shopping . " The usual mistake of statute-makers is to adopt the false test of the intention to make actual delivery The true test is difficult enough to apply ; the false one makes confusion of the whole subject The principal article in the National Geographic Magazine for December is by United States Consul-General Fee of Bombay , on the Parsees of India . He gives a brief account of their religious belief and history , and then describes their manner of life , especially the ceremonies attending marriages ' and funerals Contrasting their condition as a peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberal of ' all the Indian peoples , with the low estate of their brethren in Persia , he regards them as a remarkable instance of the beneficence of British rule . There are a number of interesting illustrations , including a portrait of the cotton manufacturer ; Mr. Tata , who has just given a million dollars for the founding of an Indian University of Research Among the other contents is the wise and ' temperate Chicago address on China and the United States by the Chinese minister , Sir Chentung LiangCheng , in which the exclusion question is discussed , and Chairman Shonts 's account of what has been accomplished towards building the Panama Canal . Referring to the workmen employed , he says : " It is estimated we do not get more ' than 25 per cent . of the efficiency of labor in the United States . " To this inefficient labor it is compulsory to apply the eight-hour law , thereby adding many millions unnecessarily to the total expenditure .

One of these difficulties was to find proper hotel quarters As the hotels in ' Lisbon are Inferior to those in Madrid , arrangements have been made for a first-class ocean steamer to bring most of the participants to Lisbon and ' to furnish quarters and meals to its passengers during the period of the convention . ? Mr. A. F. Bandelier has turned aside from his Peruvian studies to look over the ground covered during his early labors for the Archmological Institute of America , in preparing the notes for a new translation of the ' Naufragios ' of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca , issued in the " TrailelVlakers " series ( A. S. Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been made with much care , and will replace that of Buckingham Smith , published half a century ago , as the authoritative English version of the earliest detailed account of the Gulf States . Mr. Bandelier contributes an introduction and various notes which should be useful to readers unfamiliar with the subject , by giving them a general idea of the course followed by the Spanish wanderers . It is unfortunate that they were not at the same time made of use to students , by including in them some of the results of the earnest study to which the Gaboza. de Vaca narrative has been subjected during the last decade . Every student of Southwestern history recognizes Mr Bandelier as the Master whose remarkable ' Historical Introduction , ' published in 1881 , made possible all that has since been ' done in this field That book , dealing with subjects upon which no satisfactory studies had previously been made , , was a most unusual achievement , based upon thOrough research and marked by sound scholarship . No work of this sort can ever say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandelier 's knowledge , insight , and judgment , the larger part of his conclusions in matters of detail have been affected by more intimate acquaintance with localities and more thoughtful comparisons of sources of information . It is unlikely that any one will ever know just how Cabeza de Vaca got from the fresh waters of the Mississippi to the Gulf of California , because his own notions as to the route he had travelled must have been confused and indefinite . Those who know the regions through which he may have passed , have nevertheless been able to limit his possible course in some respects , and to raise strong presumptions in others ; and it would have been desirable to have had these ' considerable modifications in the route - as previously laid down taken account of in the notes to so excellent a translation . - ? It was a happy thought on the part of Friedrich Kerst to bring together , in little volumes of 100 or more pages each , the gist of what eminent composers have said about themselves and others , and upon diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin have already brought out four volumes in this " Brevier-Bibliotheir , " dealing with Beethoven , Mozart , Schumann , and Schubert , and these are having a large sale . Excellent English versions of the - first two have just been printed by B. W. Huebsch . The translator is H. E. Krehbiel , who has added a number of explanatory notes . The plan of these books is to print , . so far as possible , the composer 's exact words , followed , in each case , by a note in smaller type explaining the circumstances under which they were spoken or written . Moreover , the aphorisms and other sayings are classified . In the case of Beethoven we have sections Concerning Art , Love of Nature , Concerning Texts , On Composing , On Performing Music , On his own works , On Art and Artists , Beethoven as Critic , On Education , On his own Disposition and Character . The Sufferer , Worldly Wisdom . Mozart 's utterances are similarly grouped . Comparing the contents of the two books , one gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mozart 's mind is much the more keen and stimulating Beethoven 's letters are concerned chiefly with business and other prosaic details , while Mozart 's have a distinct literary value . Nevertheless , ' the ' Beethoven ' is well worth perusing . Champions of the latest aberrations in programme music , for example , might read with profit the Bonn master 's maxim ? " Carried too far , all delineation in instrumental music loses in efficiency . " And how prophetically this sums up the tendencies of the Richard Strauss ' school : " When the gentlemen can think of nothing new , and can go no further , they quickly call in a diminished seventh chord to help them out of the predicament . " From the Mozart volume one is tempted to quote freely , it is so full ? of good things ; but a few samples must suffice . " Sewing-machine " pianists of the time , listen ! Mozart saw through you long ago : " It is much easier to play rapidly than slowly , you can drop a few notes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful ? " " Our taste in Germany is for long things ; as a matter of fact , short and good is better . " Had that utterance of Mozart 's been heeded by the German masters from Beethoven to Wagner , what a blessing it would have been ! It is worthy of note that while Mozart seems opposed to the modern idea that " in opera , willy-nilly , poetry must be the obedient daughter of music , " he nevertheless anticipates Wagner in saying that " Verses are the most indispensable things in music , but rhymes , for the sake of rhymes , the most injurious . . . . It were best if a good composer , who understands the stage , and is himself able to suggest something , and a clever peel could-be united in one , like a phtenix . " . ? A recent addition to the Pilgrimage Series published by A. &; O. Black , isMr . H. Snowden Ward 's ' The Canterbury Pilgrimages ' ( Philadelphia : Lippincott ) . From the point of view of the historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' description of the life and death of Thomas a Becket and of the cult of St. Thomas . This cult , which spread throughout England and the Continent , was at first opposed by the churchmen of Canterbury , who were jealous of Thomas , and had viewed complacently enough the fall of the unruly archbishop But the remains of the martyr displayed , from the first , wonderful healing powers , and the monks were compelled to recognize their virtue and welcome the countless pilgrims who thronged to Canterbury . The cult persisted from the middle of the twelfth century till the reforming zeal of Henry VIII in the sixteenth swept away all the material traces of the saint and his worship in England . Mr. Ward 's chapters on the pilgrimages , with their r ? - sum ? of Chaucer 's ' Paled , ' are an excellent introduction to Chaucer . He follows the route ? of those famous , pilgrims from the Tabard Inn in Southwark , down the Old Kent Road-to Dartford , Rochester , Sitting-bourne , Ospringe , till from Harbledown Hill they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days , stood on the central spire of Canterbury Cathedral . The ' Tales ' were Jold , as every reader knows , partly during the halts in that leisurely ride of fifty-six miles from London to Canterbury , partly on the ride itself . The Pilgrims ' way was then unfenced , often only a path , and the modern road by no means represents , except at intervals , the rough track that Chaucer travelled . Mr. Ward 's book has an interest quite apart from the pilgrims , the antiquities of the whole route he describes at length and . illustrates with charming photographs , the work of Mrs. Ward , who started from either London ' or Winchester . There are good maps of the localities . Kent has other pilgrims , nowadays , not less numerous but more-destructive than those of old . These are the " hoppers , " who annually descend ' on the cOunty to pick hops and spread in every hop-growing district the manners of the London slums . Mr. Ward gives an interesting list of words and phrases derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way " is still used to denote a path little used and hard to travel . A " canterbury " is , according to him , still used in America , if no- longer in England , in the sense of a ' traveller 's tale " ; the pace known to all as a canter is a contraction of the ' Canterbury gallop ; and " cant " is whimsically said to have been originally aPplibd to " the hypocritical dissertations of those who had been to the martyr 's shrine . " Yankee in Pigmy Land , ' by William Edgar Geil ( Dodd , Mead &; Co. ) , is the bright narrative-of a journey across equatorial Africa , by rail to Uganda , caravan thrOugh the great forest , and steamboat to the mouth of the Congo . The transit seems to have been singularly free from exciting episodes with either men or animals , as there were no recorded encounters with wild beasts , and the natives were everywhere friendly . The principal point of interest in Uganda : was the missionary work , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being devoted to a biographical sketch of Bishop Tucker . The pigmies naturally receive the most attention , and a pleasant picture is drawn of them and their simple life . A characteristic , distinguishing them from the other natives , is their love of fun , which is so marked that Mr. Geil styles the forest in which they live the Land of Laughter . They show no signs of degeneracy , but are finely formed , possess great bodily strength , and are capable of great development . Mr. Geil is very guarded in his references to ' the government of the Congo State , but it is evident that he saw much that sustained the accusations of inefficiency and misgovernment . He ' says that , as a rule , the officials are underpaid , and their use of intoxicants is almost universal . Considering the climate and their surroundings , the statement is not surprising that insanity prevails among them , and " that ninety per cent of the officers of this government and officials whom I met were sick Extend military power to an irritable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strong humane sentiments as observers , and the kind of treatment which will be meted out to the black can easily be prophesied " ( p 326 ) . It should be added that our author records no flagrant cases of cruelty of which he was eye-witness , but that he tells of much that has been done to civilize and develop the people in the neighborhood of some of the stations The humor in which he indulges in his narrative is carried too far and becomes wearisome At times - it seriously obscures his meaning , and suggests an occasional doubt as to whether the whole book is not a joke . The illustrations consist of a hundred reproductions of photographs , mostly of the author and the natives and their surroundings ? The last two volumes ( 18 and 19 ) issued by the Selden Society are a collection of Borough Customs , edited by Miss Mary Bateson , and a second volume of the Year-Books of Edward II , edited by Professor Maitland . Miss Bateson 's material has been laboriously gathered from the printed and raaniuscrrpt costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boroughs ; but no effort has been made to exhaust this field of research . Still less has she attempted the gigantic task of hunting for customs through the manuscript court-rolls of the English boroughs , a vast territory which still awaits the historical explorer . The arrangement of the extracts according to subject-matter and not according to proyenance is the best for purposes of comparative study . The editing , as we might expect , is admirable , and ' the value of the collection to the student of English legal origins , is manifest . Professor Maitland 's present volume lacks the extraordinary charm which his historical and critical introduction imparted to the first Instalment of these Year-Books ; but its contents ' are in interest fully equal to those of Its predecessors . Here , again , we find astonishing touches of real life handed down by the unknown reporter . Thus , the great Hereford , O. J .. , in answer to counsel pointing out the hardship which his client will suffer , retorts ( p. 140 ) : accepted a recognizance in a silly form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in another case , which will surely be important to . future historians of English equity , the same judge asks . " With what equity , look you ! can you demand this penalty ? " ( p. 59 ) As before , each unofficial report is , whenever possible , elucidated by the addition of the dry official record from the original court-roll , in this respect , the Selden Society 's volumes are superior to those of the Rolls series edited by Mr. Pike . It is to be hoped that the gap in that series between the last year of Edward I. and the eleventh of Edward III . will continue to be filled in this masterly manner .  - -  The Proceedings of the Association of German Librarians at its meeting in the city of Posen last June are printed in the - September-Dcto'ber number of the Zentralbluff fur BibliatItekszaesen .

The question of a general classified catalogue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also discussed and its importance strongly brought out , especially by Dr. Paalzow . Dr. Erman 's paper was in part areply to critics , pointing out that the care of the classed catalogue is by no means the only scientific work of the librarian , that the assistance given to seekers for informat'ou and the systematic inquiry into and filling of the gaps in a library 's collections really are of as much importance- scientifically .

The Macmillan Co 1505 The fourth volume of Fanny Burney 's Diary ' covers the last three years of hei life at Court , years of ill health and fatigue , in which her chief consolation seems to have been the composition of her first tragedy , ' which was no sooner completed than she began another , finding that these pictures of fictitious woe " soothed the melancholy of imagination " It is curious that , in her list of grievances against her profession as maid of honor , her bitterest complaint is not that her duties left her no time to . write .

Mr Poison , " who had been suddenly left , as she says , " at large without a guinea " ( p. 108 ) . The application for SUbscriptions was made " only to the rich and learned , " and Porson received from this source about ten thousand dollars .

While in England , he shared the purse of De Narbonne His financial prospects were not therefore encouraging , and when , in the spring of 1793 , Fanny Burney announced to her father her projected marriage to the penniless exile , she met with the strongest opposition .
