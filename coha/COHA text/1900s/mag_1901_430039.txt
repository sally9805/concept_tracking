 | THE intimate relations which existed between Aaron Burr and Harman Blennerhassett , and the mystery surrounding the latter , have given rise to many public misstatements . It is the opinion of surviving relatives , who have carefully guarded the private papers of Harman Blennerhassett , that the time has come , all of his children and grandchildren being dead , when these misstatements may properly be refuted by a frank presentation of the facts . The purpose of this paper is to give , for the first time , the true story of Blennerhassett , his origin and antecedents , his social standing , and his financial responsibility , and to set forth why , more than a hundred years ago , he sold his birthright , a magnificent patrimony , and crossed the Atlantic for the pur- pose of establishing a new home in another country . From time to time articles concerning him and his wife , Margaret Agnew , have appeared in print , but they have always been singularly inaccurate in detail . Harman Blennerhassett , born in Hampshire , England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III of England through Constance of Langley , wife of the Earl of Gloucester and daughter of Edward , Duke of York and Isabel of Castile . The Blennerhassetts are English in origin , none of @# them having been known in Ireland before the reign of Elizabeth ; but previous to that time , as far back as 1357 , the family ? originally of Blennerhassett , a small town in Cumberland , afterward of Carlisle , subsequently of Flimby Hall , Cumberland ? many times represented Carlisle in Parliament . They have been continuously in Parliament for more than five hundred years ; on one occasion a father and two sons represented their county and county town at the same time . The old manor-house of Flimby Hall is now owned by the Earl of Lonsdale , whose ancestors bought the Blennerhassett estates . Over three of the doorways of Flimby Hall the Blennerhassett crest is cut in stone ; the walls are ten feet thick , and the great oak beams look as if they would last forever . The first of the Blennerhassetts to settle in Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from Flimby Hall to Kerry during the reign of Elizabeth . Harman Blennerhassett 's father was Conway Blennerhasett of Castle Conway , Killorglin ; his mother . Eliza , was a daughter of Major Thomas Lacey . As the youngest of three sons , Harman . Blennerhassett , in selecting a profession . chose the law , but soon after finishing histudies , the death of his brothers , John an , i Thomas , made him head of his branch of the family . Of his sisters , one was married t Lord Kingsale , Premier Baron of Ireland : another to the brother of Lord Kingsale , the Hon. Michael de Courcy , Admiral of the Blue ; one other to Daniel McGillycuddy , high sheriff of Kerry ; one to an Agnew ; one to Captain Coxon ; and the last , Avice , never married . The children of these sisters in turn married men of high position : a daughter of Admiral de Courcy being the wife of Sir J. Gordon Sinclair ; a daughter of Lord Kingsale , the Hon. Martha de Courcy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stair Agnew of Lochnaw . Added to these strong family connections , the power and standing of the family to which he belonged brought Harman Blennerhassett in contact with the best people of the day . Conway Blennerhassett died a very rich man , leaving his daughters handsomely portioned , and bequeathing a large fortune to his son . When Harman Blennerhassett broke the entail and sold the estate to Thomas Mullin , afterward Lord Ventry , he received $160,000 in money . Outside of this was an  | income not vested in the $160,000 , and besides a small income of $6600 , which belonged to the entailed property as a separate portion , and could not be transferred , the use of which he had until he died . His wife also came of a family with money ; but , as will be seen , she was disinherited when she married Harman Blennerhassett . Her sisters , however , laid aside money for her benefit , and sent it to her regularly . Early in 1796 Harman Blennerhassett , then thirty-one years old , married in England Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , County Durham , a young lady of eighteen . Her father was lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Man , and a son of General James Agnew of Revolutionary fame . Soon after their marriage , the young couple embarked for America , landing August 1 , 1796 . After extensive travels through the eastern part of the country , a portion of the island in the Ohio which bears their name was purchased , and preparations for building were begun . The house and grounds when completed represented an investment of sixty thousand dollars . After the island house was no longer an abode , Blennerhassett and his famiiy removed to a plantation of one thousand acres on the Mississippi River , six miles above Port Gibson . This home they called " La Cache , " and here they lived for twelve years , when they sold the property for twenty-eight thousand dollars , and , after stopping in New York to pay a visit to the family of Mr. Emmet , proceeded to Montreal . In 1821 , Blennerhassett , after a residence in America of twenty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be benefited through an influence he no longer possessed . Ten years of heartache and buffeting passed , and then tame failing health , which ended in his death at Port Pierre , on the island of Guernsey. , February 2 , 1831 , in the sixty-sixth year of his age . We now come to the secret of the Blennerhassetts , which was carefully kept from their children . Catharine , one of the sisters of Harman Blennerhassett , married an Agnew . It was her daughter Margaret who married Harman Blennerhassett , her mother 's brother , ' and it was for this cause that she was disinherited . The young lady was absent at school ; her uncle was sent to take her home ; instead of doing so , he married her . But he reckoned without his host , or perhaps he did not reckon at all . When he returned with his bride , the family affection that he thought would greet them , the family influence that he thought would protect them , were wanting . The couple were met only with reproaches : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of her eighteen years she was pitied , but not the less blamed . Since remaining in his own country meant social ostracism , ' Blennerhassett sold his property , and brought his young wife to America . No political entanglements were about him to cause him to come to this country , for though a close observer of current events , he took little interest in politics ; his tastes were quiet ? literary and musical . Nothing brought him to America but the fact that his family would not countenance his marriage . ' When news of the strange marriage became noised about in their own country , those relatives not closely enough allied to feel injured began to nod their wise heads in time to prophesy of dire disaster for the future of the young couple . But when it was decided to sell the estate and leave the country , then indeed all the kith and kin , to the most remote degree , were up in arms against the breaking of the entail . A few of the younger kinsfolk sympathized with the young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how the prophecies referred to were verified . During their residence on the island three children were born to Blennerhassett and his wife . Of these the eldest , Dominick , was , be it said with keen pity , a moral degenerate . No one can read the references made to him in the letters of his heartbroken mother and not feel sympathy for her . The second child , Margaret , died in infancy . The third , Harman Blennerhassett , Jr. , was little better than his eldest brother , and was restrained from excesses as great only by the watchfulness of the youngest brother , Joseph Lewis , during a portion of his life . The fourth child , an-  | other Margaret , died in infancy . The fifth and last child , Joseph Lewis , was a man of classical education . He was graduated in law with high honors , and was a fine linguist . With all this he had distinguished manners . Yet , though having the means upon which to live comfortably , he passed the last twenty years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , practised a little law , and spent much time in dissipation . It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss the connection of Blennerhassett with the so-called expedition of Burr beyond two points : first , the moneyed losses of Blennerhassett through Burr , second , his object in joining Burr at all . According to the brief of Harman Blennerhassett , prepared by his own hand for his expected trial at Richmond , Virginia , Burr , while on a Southern tour in the spring of 1805 , visited Blennerhassett at his island home . On that occasion it appears that the conversation was general . The following December , on the return of Colonel Burr from his Southern journey , he again called on Blennerhassett , who , with his wife , was on a visit to New York and Baltimore . After his second visit , Colonel Burr addressed a letter to Blennerhassett , in which he gave expression to regret at not having found Blennerhassett at home . The latter answered Burr 's letter in like manner . Also he expressed a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have engaged the attention of Colonel Burr during his late journey through the Western country . So the acquaintance between the two men began ? an acquaintance that meant moneyed losses for Blennerhassett , but which did not destroy his home , as has been said . Despite the eloquence of William Wirt , who depicted " the serpent entering the bowers of Eden , " there is no evidence to support the figure of speech . There is much and oft-repeated evidence of the trust in , and the devotion to , his wife on the part of Blennerhassett , which is a tribute that would not have been paid to a wife who was a party to despoiling her home . There is no record of the direct plans or intentions of Blennerhassett and Burr . Probably those were largely dependent on the shaping of events , foremost among which would have been the United States becoming involved in a war with Spain , in which case the perfidy of General Wilkinson , commander-in-chief of the United States army , would have aided the scheme that has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasonable " feature charged to them , ? severing the Southern and Western States from the Union , ? that could not have been through their thinking the then territory of the United States too large to hold together , if they did think so . That opinion was held by a large number of influential people , so difficult were all means of travel and communication over the vast country separated by the Alleghanies before the days of steam . Burr met Blennerhassett at a period of his life when Burr had little tol lose and much to gain . That Blennerhassett sustained losses through indorsing for Burr is shown by his papers . In a letter of Colonel Alston , the son-in-law of Burr , to Blennerhassett , dated June 22 , 1807 , the writer states that he has that day written Colonel Burr making certain offers which he hopes will facilitate a settlement ; " but , " lie adds , " should they unfortunately fail , I shall certainly consider myself bound both in honor and justice to fulfil my engagement to you . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " On my arrival here Lexington I was taken into custody for my indorsement of some of Colonel Burr 's bills , of which I am now getting clear by an arrangement Mr. Clay is drawing up between Mr. Sanders and me , affected by my transferring Colonel Alston 's obligation . " And , " In the midst of my occupation by the cares of my concerns with the government , I have made arrangements for removing the greater part of the indebtedness affecting our property on the island . Miller , who , you know . attached the chief part of our effects , is not here , but will probably accept the same accommodations by Mr. Sanders , namely , a transfer of Alston 's obligation , with a deed of trust on the island as a further security . " Later Blennerhassett writes to his wife : " Alston is endeavoring to raise money here Richmond to meet all demands . On failing of this , he , Alston , will assume the whole , payable one half a year from next January . the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes his wife : " Shall go to Philadelphia with him Burr to try his success there in raising some money for me . " August 5 , 1807 , Blennerhassett says : " This evening I have inclosed various papers to Mr. Alston , showing him how my property has been sacrificed on the Ohio , and praying his aid to recover it for my children , by virtue of his responsibility for my indorsement of Colonel Burr 's protested bills . " When Alston , by his unwillingness to make any terms looking to a settlement with Blen- nerhassett , showed he was not acting in good faith , and " Burr declared he did not believe Mr. Alston had executed any writing by which he , Alston , could be bound " to Blennerhassett , the latter exclaims : " What ! did his Burr 's memory , perhaps the most energetic of all his talents , here lose its polish by the abrasion of his own calamities ? Did he forget that he himself drafted that very paper , after having considered another , which Alston had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be given to prove the assertion of Blennerhassett 's moneyed losses at the hands of Burr ; but these may be passed until the letter of March 2 , 1811 , is reached . That letter from Blennerhassett to Colonel Alston states Blennerhassett 's losses through Burr at $50,000 , $12,500 of which had been paid . A request is made for the payment of $15,000 six months hence , the balance to be adjusted by agreement , the alternative of acquiescence to this proposition being the publication of a book containing much inner history , which Blennerhassett believes will yield $10,000 . On Burr 's return from England , a similar communication was addressed to him . But that was not demanding $10,000 " hushmoney . " It was simply calling on Burr and Alston to fulfil an obligation of long standing , a just and honest debt which they were seeking to evade . Blennerhassett 's reason for joining Burr was not love of adventure , but to remove himself farther from those who knew him . He had family friends who respected him through the position he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sad story of his life , there were not many on this side of the water ; but the dread was with him always that the truth would become known to his children . In 1824 Blennerhassett returned to Canada for his family . The intercession of his wife 's sisters , who were devoted to her , secured for Mrs.Blennerhassett in England and Scotland respectful treatment . Avice Blennerhassett , the maiden sister of Harman , who had willed him her property , and who survived him , died in February , 1838 . As soon as business matters connected with the settlement of the estate permitted , Mrs. Blennerhassett returned to this country , to join her son Harman in New York , arriving in the summer of 1840 . Joseph Lewis , the youngest son , with his wife , was then living in Swansea , South Wales . At the time of Blennerhassett 's death this youngest son was nineteen years old . It is , then , a mistake that at her husband 's death Mrs. Blennerhassett was left with a family of dependent children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a claim to Congress for indemnity for losses on the island through the Wood County militia , sent to take possession of the property on account of the alleged treasonable character of the expedition . Besides this , she wished , if possible , to regain possession of the island , on the ground that no record existed of its transfer , and that the connection of her husband with Burr was not sufficient cause to make null the right of his wife and children to ownership of the island property . For the purpose of assisting his mother and brother , Joseph Lewis decided on joining them in June , 1841 . A bill was introduced in Congress , and received some support , which might have led to its passage but for the death of Mrs. Blennerhassett , which occurred in New York on June 16 , 1842 . She died in her sixty-fourth year in the house she herself rented and paid for at 75 Greenwich street . Many misstatements have been made as to the circumstances of her death . She died in the arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a mistake that " no soothing hand of a relative fanned her fevered temples , " and that but for the " kindly ministrations of a society of Irish females " she was deserted . Her sons ( her only living children ) , who idolized her , were both present at her death-bed . They , with the family of Mr. T. A. Emmet , followed her to her grave in the plot of Mr. Emmet in St. Paul 's churchyard , Broadway . It was not necessity that caused her burial there , but the fulfilment of a promise between Mrs. Emmet and Mrs. Blennerhassett that in death they would rest side by side . If sisters of charity were present , it was not known to her sons ; it is not customary for them to attend the last rites for the dead if there is any one to take their place . ' But why not , in the interest of fiction , let this same " society of Irish females " follow her ? The abject-poverty tales of Blennerhassett and his family serve well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are untrue . While the family of Blennerhassett  | condemned his marriage , they would never have allowed him to be in need . The same is true of the sisters of Mrs. Blennerhassett . True , Blennerhassett lost heavily , and they had serious moneyed trials , often traceable to their own foolish expenditures . It has been said that the elder Harman Blennerhassett filled a drunkard 's grave . As a matter of fact , he was a man abstemious in the use of intoxicants . It has been said that he was a shiftless Irishman with a few thousand pounds . The incorrectness of this has been shown in this article . Also it has been stated that he lived " without doing even the smallest thing to aid in the welfare of mankind " ; that " his own lack of purpose , and easygoing disposition , and a wife with an overweening ambition , " were accountable for the reverses of his latter days . These reverses have been magnified to match other points already named . The " overweening ambition " of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her biographers . There was too much sorrow in her life to make her " ambition " more than ordinary . What field had her aching heart for ambition ? None except that grown in the fertile brain of her biographers . She and her husband were kind , generous people in time of sickness and trouble , and did many things " to aid in the welfare of mankind . " Many a struggling musician was aided substantial : in his work by Blennerhassett , himself a fine musician . Joseph Lewis Blennerhassett died in Missouri on December 8 , 1862 . His two little boys , Robert Emmet and Harman , died some time before their father . With him the last direct descendant of Harman Blennerhassett passed away ; but even so the family is far from " extinct . " There are a number of people related by blood to Harman Blennerhassett on this side of the Atlantic , ? among others Dr. Francis C. Martin of Boston , who is a greatgrandnephew of Mrs. Harman Blennerhassett , - and on the other side there are Rowland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1855 ; Sir Rowland Blennerhassett , president of Queen 's College , city of Cork , Ireland ; Arthur Blennerhassett of Ballyseedy , representing the oldest branch ; Mr. Blennerhassett-Chute of Chute Hall , Blennerville- . County Kerry . These gentlemen , who do not comprise all of the family across the water , have given more than one proof that the family is not extinct . @#
