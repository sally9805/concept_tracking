PASADENA is the city where all of the many advantages of southern California seem to be united and emphasized . The climate ? California 's greatest asset ? here reaches a perfection of which it seems ( to Pasadena people at least ) to fall just short elsewhere . Such things as the wonderful climate and fine houses and beautiful gardens should be enough to make this a city among cities , and they do well enough to attract people to Pasadena in the first place ; but they alone are not what is making a model city ; there are other qualities which are less superficial and wear better . The first of them is cleanliness . Pasadena is a clean city , not only physically , but mentally and morally . There has not been a saloon in Pasadena in twenty years . There are no " blind pigs . " An intoxicated man on the street is so unusual a spectacle that people speak of it . Women are not afraid to be on the streets alone night or day . No one ever sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no mother ever needs worry for fear her son will join such a gang . There is no questionable resort of any kind in the city today . According to Robert J. Burdette , who  | lives in Pasadena and ought to know , the citizens are " people who use the day for labor and the night for rest ; people who love , not necessarily the simple life , but the normal life . " There are plenty of healthy , human , red-blooded individuals in the community who would fight with pleasure at the suggestion that the town is overly virtuous . For instance , saloons are not barred out on the temperance basis at all ; the people got rid of them because they found they did n't pay . They failed to bring in enough revenue to pay for the additional police protection that is required on their account . They are kept out now because everyone is so well satisfied with the plan . In the administration of public affairs , there is reason to believe that every dollar of public money has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The Reverend Robert J Burdette , to whom reference was just made ? they call him " Bob " Burdette in Pasadena ? is one man who accepted public office and transacts public affairs . The people would like to get all such officials as he , and they do come as close to it as possible . During the Reverend Burdette 's term as city commissioner the most serious charge that was ever brought against him was that he had repeated , absent-mindedly , a story he related at the session a week before . The mental cleanliness of the city is  | manifested chiefly in the sort of amusements the people indulge in , the books they read , the plays they attend , and the subjects they talk about when they meet on street cars and in other public places . The newspapers reflect it . There are two of them , good dailies both , and neither of them belongs to the yellow school . News is handled conservatively . The reports of the public librarian , Miss Nellie M. Russ , show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a high musical appreciation in the community , and consequently a great many excellent musicians of more than local fame . Chamber concerts of real merit are given during the winter at the Shakespeare club house , the home of the leading women 's club . In the matter of music the culture of Pasadena is invariably emphasized whenever there is a severely classical concert given in Los Angeles . Often these affairs turn out to be excursions from Pasadena . Besides the musicians and the literary people there is a considerable colony of artists who have their studios grouped in one section of the city . Like the climate , architecture is to be found at its best in Pasadena . It is the art that is spelled without a capital A , the genuine kind , that produces pleasing structures , whether they cost fifty dollars or one million dollars ? the minimum and maximum prices that have been paid for homes in Pasadena , by the way . Because of this pleasing architecture , in its setting of satisfying gardens , created by people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so naturally , Pasadena , in late years , has become and will continue to be a prolific field for material for magazines that aim to help people to improve their homes and their home surroundings . There is a certain freshness about Pasadena 's streets that appeals strongly to newcomers . It gives one the impression of having arrived in town just after a vigorous housecleaning or after a cleansing shower . Pasadena is made up of people who keep alive the civic pride in a beautiful city by encouraging one another to do things that improve the appearance of the homes and their surroundings . The streets are wide , with broad sidewalks . All of the business streets and most of the residence streets are paved . Those streets that are not paved have been treated with oil , which , when rolled into the natural soil , produces a tough covering , elastic as rubber , soft and smooth as velvet and shedding water perfectly . Because of the pavements and these oiled ' streets there is little dust to annoy good housekeepers.  | Everywhere the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a native of China , with its bright green sprays of delicate leaves and its hanging clusters of scarlet berries , seems to have been used more than any other . Many of these trees were planted a quarter of a century ago , and they now have . massive trunks and widespreading branches . The pepper , in shape and general appearance , resembles the weeping willow , but it is more rugged in its outline and more picturesque . Marengo avenue has what is said to be the most beautiful pepper drive in California . The camphor tree , which does not produce the commercial gum in this climate , is a prime favorite , because of its fresh , green leaves and its well-kept appearance . It is a good sidewalk tree and always has the look of having just been rained on . Life is more simple here by far than in the East . The struggle for existence is not so much of a struggle . The necessities of " life are fewer , and consequently the cost is less . It is the proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person " in the city limits . It is as much due to the fact that life is easy as it is to t h e benevolence of the people , although they are charitable when they get a chance to be . First , the home : All other things being equal , a vacant lot in Pasadena costs more than in Eastern cities of the same size , but the explanation is that the city is young , it is spreading out ; real estate can always be sold without an effort . T h e difference that one pays for a lot is more than covered by what may be saved on the construction of the house . In a country where the thermometer very rarely ventures near the freezing point , where the sun shines nearly every day in the year and where it is sometimes uncomfortably hot at midday in the heart of winter , there is little necessity for lining houses to keep out the cold . It is possible to build a four-room " California house " for as little as $225 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , creditable-looking house of four or five rooms , fit for any family it is large enough to accommodate , can be built inside of $1,200 . Easterners would be surprised to know the type of people who are living in tent houses in Pasadena today and find them plenty good enough . A tent house is made of canvas stretched over a wood frame . The canvas is varnished and painted . The cost of such a structure ranges from $50 up , depending on the size and how elaborate it is . It is cheaper , not only in the end , but in the beginning , to buy or to build a home , than to rent . A widow with three children came from the East and paid $25 the first month for a five-room bungalow . A real-estate agent persuaded her to  | ' ! lake a cash payment of $250 on a $1,500 house of five rooms . She was then to pay $15 a month , covering interest and principal , which was not a rare sort of a contract in Pasadena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person on a basis of $1,800 for the house . She received her $300 profit in cash and also the original $250 and all her other payments , with only the interest deducted . Taxes are low , and so is insurance , because of an efficient and adequate fire department . Another considerable saving is for fuel . There should be no coal bills in Pasadena . Sometimes it is possible to get through an entire winter without fuel , but there are a few crisp mornings and chilly evenings daring the season when a few sticks of wood in the grate are worth more than they cost . On the whole , fuel bills , outside of gas for cooking , at 80 cents a thousand feet , are so small that they are not worth taking into consideration . The possibility of getting fresh fruits and vegetables all the year around , and always at slimmer prices , makes an appreciable difference in the cost of living . Furthermore , by offering a greater variety for the table , it almost eliminates the problem of what to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . About one week usually intervenes each year , for instance , between the end of one strawberry season and the beginning of the next . Pasadena lies on the edge of an orange belt that extends one hundred miles up the San Gabriel valley . About all oranges are worth during the season is the cost of handling them . During the winter hucksters go about selling them from wagons by the bucketful . A bucket should hold from ten to twenty-five , depending on the size of the oranges , that is . If the man charges more than ten cents for a bucketful he 's a bandit . As a rule vegetables are in the market the year around . Fruits come earlier and stay later here than in the East-loquats , apricots and nectarines , cherries , plums and fresh prunes , all the berries ( including the hybrid Loganberry ) , fresh figs , and then the grapes and the melons . It might surprise Eastern housekeepers to learn that the price of watermelons and canteloupes had not advanced for the Thanksgiving market this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 1 . Staple groceries sell for the same price in Pasadena as in Pueblo , Colorado , Peoria , Illinois , or Pottstown , Pennsylvania . Meat is a little higher and not quite so good , except mutton ? the cheapest and the best of the meats . Southern California mutton should be famous the world over , and will be some day . No other section of the United States can produce  | a better quality . Butter and eggs soar in price in the winter just as they do in the East , but they come down earlier in the spring . The climate , everyone agrees , is the best in the world for raising babies , because they can not fail to be strong and healthy . Dr William A. Edwards , who has written several standard works on the diseases of infants , says there is no better climate anywhere for babies , and that , if the supply of milk were what it should be , he can hardly imagine what babies here could be ill or die of . In Pasadena there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first certified dairy to be established on the Pacific coast is to open near Pasadena the first of the year . Backed by ample capital , and in the hands of a wealthy , retired business man of extensive experience in big affairs , who is determined to make it the model dairy of the world , it promises to supply the babies of Pasadena with absolutely pure and wholesome milk . Pasadena was the pioneer city in the West to require the tuberculin test to be made on all cows contributing to the city 's milk supply . So far as available records show , it is the only city in California that requires this test . The tuberculin test is the only accurate method of determining whether cows are absolutely free from tuberculosis . The ordinance making the administration of this test compulsory was passed at the instance of Dr Stanley Black , who is now health officer . It requires the city veterinarian to make the test without charge and report results . The city charges a license fee of $1.50 a year for each cow from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six hundred and to the single cow which supplies two or three families in the neighborhood . The revenue from the licenses just about pays for , the annual tuberculin test and for the inspection . When a cow is found to be infected , the city veterinarian at once orders it isolated from the rest of the herd , and it is branded in immense letters on the jaw , " TBC . " The city does not have the power arbitrarily to force dairymen to kill diseased cattle , but the brand answers the purpose just as well . Almost invariably the dairymen prefer killing the infected cows to having them on exhibition with the significant " TBC . " When a , diseased cow has not been killed , and the inspectors are not satisfied that it is being kept properly isolated , the permit to sell milk in the city is promptly canceled , and the dairyman is shut off from his market until he comes to time . Other portions of the ordinance relate to conditions about the dairies and to the handling of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rules are based on Dr Black 's long experience as a public sans  | itarian and on the results of the experiences of larger cities in the East and abroad . Under the direction of Dr Black the milk inspectors make frequent inspections of all dairies within a radius of fifty miles supplying milk to customers in Pasadena . Immediately back of Pasadena are the Sierra Madre mountains , rising sharply to a hight of more than 6,000 feet . The elevation of Pasadena is about 1,000 feet . An inclined railroad ascends Mount Lowe from Rubio canyon , a beautiful gorge filled with the music of waterfalls , which is reached by a fifteen-minute car ride from Pasadena . Half way up the Mount Lowe trail , at Echo Mountain , is a stellar observatory and the famous Mount Lowe searchlight , which is one of the largest ever built . On a clear , dark night its beam can be seen one hundred miles out at sea . In the same range , some ten or twelve miles from Pasadena , is Mount Wilson , higher and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the famous Mount Wilson solar observatory . It is a street-ear ride of only little more than an hour to any of the dozen beaches . It is a peculiar fact that a large proportion of the tourists are not tourists at all , but " six-months ' residents , " for they have been coming here regularly for many years . In many cases they have their own winter homes , some of them small modest cottages , others magnificent palaces in South Orange Grove boulevard , which is known locally as " the mile of millionaires . " For the tourists proper there are all sorts of hotels . The four big ones are the Green , which covers two entire city blocks and cost $1,500,000 ; the Raymond and the Wentworth , on the bluffs overlooking the San Gabriel valley , where it costs a king 's ransom to be a guest ; and the Maryland , with its striking entrance , its unusual courtyard , its ivy-covered white walls and its picturesque pergolas . During the winter months especially the streets of Pasadena present a gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armies of servants , their big automobiles , their blooded horses and their fancy turnouts and take the town by storm . On the first day of each year the winter season reaches its hight . This is the day for holding the annual carnival , the tournament of roses . This year 's will be the seventeenth annual tournament . For weeks before the last day of the year , rose bushes are carefully nursed and coaxed so that they will burst forth in the best blooms of the year the day before the tournament . On New Year 's day the business streets are a mass of flowers . There is a long pageant , consisting of flower-covered floats , which passes through the streets at noon , headed  | by the queen of the tournament , with her ladies-in-waiting , her heralds , her pages and her outriders . The procession ends at Tournament park , where the queen and the populace witness the annual chariot race . These are not the kind that come last on the program at the circus . They are the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . The city owns the chariots , and horses , are bred , raised and trained for the chariot races and nothing else . There is no " grand standing . " The honor of winning the annual race is too great not to be tried for . The prize is a laurel wreath , with which the queen crowns the victor . Being nine miles distant from Los Angeles , Pasadena is far enough away to escape the disadvantages of a big town ; being only nine miles away , it is close enough so that its citizens may have all the advantages of a big city . The two places are- connected by a suburban streetcar service , which is said to be unexcelled anywhere in the world . Many of the inhabitants of Pasadena have their offices and all their business interests in the larger city ; but , although a considerable proportion of the population of Pasadena is made up of the better class of Los Angeles business and professional men and their families , it must not be supposed that Pasadena is nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-awake , bustling , active little city all by itself , and if it were situated a little further away from Los Angeles , where it would not suffer so much by comparison commercially , it would be more widely known as an important city of the Pacific coast in a business way . The death rate of Pasadena is the lowest in the United States in proportion to size . Epidemics are unknown . There is practically no scarlet fever , smallpox or diphtheria . There have been a few deaths from typhoid , but in every case investigation showed that the disease was contracted in some other community . Practically the only persons who die of tuberculosis are those who come from the East too late . With reasonable care no one will acquire the disease here . Pasadena has a high school that cost $100,000 , twelve grammar schools , and seven kindergartens . The schools are overcrowded just now , but only because the city is growing too rapidly for the school authorities to keep up . New schools are to be erected in 1908 . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a model of its kind , the Classical School for Boys and the Classical School for Girls , and many other private schools . There is a $50,000 public library , with 30,000 volumes , supported entirely by the city . A site has been donated and a $1,000 , - 000 endowment will soon be forthcoming for a women 's college , which it is planned to make the Vassar of the West . There are seventeen clubs , including the Shakespeare club , one of the largest and most influential women 's clubs in the West . This organization has just erected and paid for a $15,000 club house , with its own private theater . The city owns a sewer farm of 470 acres , which furnishes a satisfactory solution of the drainage problem , and brought in , besides , a profit of $12,000 last year . The average winter temperature , based on observations covering a long term of years , is 56 degrees ; the spring temperature is 61.07 ; the summer temperature is 67.61 ; and the autumn temperature 62.31 . A model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , has just been built between Pasadena and Los Angeles . The funds were raised by public subscription . Pasadena has the best supply of the purest mountain water of any city in southern California . It is now controlled by private companies , but final arrangements have recently been made , approved by a vote of the people , whereby the city is to take over the companies and supply water to the citizens at cost . At a preliminary cost of $125,000 the city has established a municipal electric lighting plant and has been furnishing current for street lights for two months at a saving to the taxpayers . The plant has been so successful that it will now be enlarged , and power will be sold to the citizens for a trifle more than actual cost . The plant was paid for out of the tax levy . Funds were recently raised by subscription , and a whole square block of vacant property was purchased five blocks from the center of the city . On this a $50,000 convention hall and casino is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the citizens and their guests . Entertainments of all kinds will be given under the auspices of the city . Later a municipal band is to be formed to give daily concerts .  |
