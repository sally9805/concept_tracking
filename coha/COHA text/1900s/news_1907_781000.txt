Parsons is one of a series of disclosures of grafte ing discovered by Controller Glynn in his examination of the accounts ' of Broome County , under the authority of the " TJnie form Accounts Act . " As a result of Controller Glynn 's inVeSd tigation , Arthur W. T. Back , Chairman of the Broome County Republican Cora+ tnittee , has not only been compelled to re+ sign as Clerk of the Board of Super+ visors and as custodian of public build. , ings , but has been imprisoned under Ina dictments for grand larceny and forger preferred by the Broome County Grand Jury , while David B. King , the Counts Treasurer : , and Jasper Smith , Superine tendent of the Poor in Broome County , have been forced out of office unden charges of malfeasance and misapproprieei non of funds .

Legislators owing alley glance to the Republican machine , which had a majority representation at the Cap-. itol then as now , either utterly failed to appreciate the inquisitorial powers vested in the Controller by the bill or else roiled on the fact that the Republican Controllers of these days for a number a years had permitted their department to be run by the manifesto of political bossesrather than by law . At any rate , they helped to pass the bill , which they might have regarded as a convenient weapon against the Demo+ cratic administrations of certain counties , or else taken it at its mere surface value The act has been dormant from the day ' it was passed , but now that Controlled Glynn , who is a Democrat , has begun to put it into practice , those that were in-strumental in its passage are bitterly re-gretting their action . deleted 1 paragraph Irregularities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fruit of Controller Glynn 's endeavors. - ready one of his expert accountants who has been at work on the books of Westchester County , where William L. Ward , the member for New Yook State of the Republican National Committee and good friend of President Roosevelt , is the political lord , has discovered irregularities which may be brought to the attention of Gov . Hughes . It is now almost certain that Controller Glynn 's Investization will be extended to other counties which promise revelations as startling as those made in Broome . It is rumored that Orange County , the home of ex-Gov . Odell , and the nearby . Rockland County , where reports have it that the county authorities have maintained a " tramps ' paradise " for the enrichment of certain public officials and political favorites , may come under the official searchlight next .

The Republican : leaders are well aware that in a large number of counties corruption on al smaller or larger scale has gone on un-discovered for many years and that when the Controller starts out in earnest hisinvestigations will tend to discredit the Republican party in the entire State ands provide political capital for the Demo crats in proportion . The situation is rendered more grave from their point of view by the aloofnesd from practical politics and the independ ence of Gov . Hughes . who may be relleg upon to aid the Controller In his effort to bring about reforms and safeguard the finances of the various divisions of the State . deleted paragraph Under the indictment brought against the methods in vogue among the Broome County Republicans James T.

Next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Judge Parsons , who is one of the most prominent men in Broome County . has aroused the most attention . Senator Hinman came to Albany yesterday to ask Gov . Hughes that the Senate be called in extraordinary session to impeach Judge Parsons . Gov . Hughes has not yet announced whether he will heed the request or not . Judge Parsons first became involved through a confession made by Jasper Smith , Superintendent of the Poor for Broome County , to Lewis K. Rockefeller , H. Le Roy Austin , and William Deterling , expert accountants , representing Controller Glynn . In their investigation they stumbled across a check for $300 given by Mr. Smith on his official check blank to the Judge and cashed by the latter . When they called upon the Superintendent of the Poor JGr an explanation he broke down and confessed . Here ' is part of the confession which has been signed by Smith in the presence of all three accountants : deleted paragraph All the , persons to whom I have loaned ' money of the county except Arthur W. T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money which I have loaned has been replaced by me personally at the end of each year if not returned by the ones to whom I loaned the same . I am no bookkeeper. and was unable to tell just howl I stood from time to time ; at the end of each year , when my books were written up , I have always deposited in the bank sufficient money to make my accounts with the county good , the amount necessary being determined by Mr. Caffarty . " Judge Parsons says in his own defense that  --  he had no idea the sum he borrowed was not from the private funds of Mr. Smith . This statement is deprecated by Controller Glynn , who points to the fact that the check dug up by the accountants was on the official blanks of the Superintendent of the Poor and drawn on the City National Bank of Binghamton , which was used by him as depository of the county funds intrusted to him . Supt. Smith , in his confession , makes the blunt statement that he not only signed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut that the latter was well aware the money came out of the county funds . Bookkeeping on Loose Slips . From the confession it appears that Supt. Smith did all his bookkeeping on loose slips , and that Caffarty , who is a prominent Democrat would be called in about two weeks before the close of the official year to write up the books . Mr. Smith was absolutely dependent on Caftarty for what knowledge he , had of his accounts . He admits that he does not know how his books stand at present , and that there probably is a deficiency , the amount of which he promises to replace . Caffarty. who advised , him that he had a perfect right to make loans out of public funds , was one of the sureties on his bond . From the books or Supt. Smith , as written up by Cafferty. it appears that Back and others who had received loans from the county funds . had been credited in various amounts for services rendered to the department or for supplies sold to the Superintendent of the Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of the beneficiaries under the loan system . " For the prices charged for the cows , " Paid Controller Glynn to THE NEW YORE Times correspondent . " we might have purchased animals from the almost priceless herds ex-Gov . Levi P. Morton keeps on his stock farm . Controller Glynn 's experts spent more than a month over the examination of the accounts of Treasurer King of Broome County . At the conclusion of their investigation they brought charges of malfeasance in office against King before Gov . Hughes . The Governor fixed last Monday for a hearing on the charges , but King forestalled the order by resigning . At the present stage of the proceedings . he is amenable for his conduct in office only to the criminal authorities of his own county , and they have as yet taken no action . In the meantime Superintendent of the Poor Smith has also been compelled to tender his resignation . There are five counts in the charges against Treasurer King . Back Refused to Show Vouchers . Controller Glynn 's experts in their report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their work continually by the fact that Treasurer King had been in the habit of turning over to County Chairman Back at the end of each official year all orders and vouchers for payments recorded in his cash book . and . that Mr. Back had absolutely refused to produce these vouchers for their inspection . Mr. Back . copy ing the methods of the late Boss Tweed in New York . of arrogating to himself the sole power of auditing all accounts and issuing the orders for all disbursements out of the County Treasury , has been the sole arbiter of the county finances for years , - and in the opinion of the experts had adopted this means to conceal the methods in vogue under his administration , As a result of this system , the experts have been unable to trace at least e7.000 in addition to the sums mentioned in the formal charges , which have been disbursed by Treasurer King out of public funds , under orders issued by County Chairman Back . " Mr. Back is the one person besides the Treasurer , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might be interested in the alteration or destruction of such orders , so it may be doubted whether the Treasurer 's action in turning over such paper to Mr. Back showed a proper appreciation of his duties and responsibilities as guardian of the county funds , especially in view of the facts that Mr. Back has recently been indicted by the Grand Jury for allowing certain of such vouchers . " The examiners found that during August . 1904. three checks had been drawn by Treasurer King to the order of Supt. of Poor Smith . two for S3,000 each and one for $5.300 , while the books of both these officials showed only one payment of $3,000 . The cancelled checks are in the possession of the Controller . They show that the check was taken to the National City Bank of Binghamton. where two New York City drafts. one for $3,000 , the other for S2,3 ( % , were obtained by the Treasurer . Drafts Cashed in San Francisco . The two drafts bear the indorsement of County Chairman King and were cashed in San Francisco on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Back had taken the entire membership of a fraternal organization in Binghamton. of which he was a member , to the Pacific Slope . and he had not only paid the railroad fare and expenses during the trip , but had given each of the TrIPMhers 52110 " expense money " while in San Francisco . " Without giving in detail the accounting process involved , " the report goes on . " we would report that the investigation disclosed that the 53.000 defalcation had been made good by the placing of that amount in the cash drawer on Nov. 26 , 1904. and that the $5.300 defalcation was covered or washed by entries of purported payments on the Treasurer 's cash hook under date of Dec. 14 , 1904 . King told the examiners that Back had given him the cash to cover the drafts prior to his obtaining them . The examiners insist that if this statement is any-thing but an effort to shield Back , King must have kept the money himself .

" Ask Glynn to 4 , Let lreeh Controller Glynn said that persistent efforts had been made by politicians of Broome County to have the investigation stopped , and that prominent Democrats whose aid had been enlisted to this end had come to his office and implored him to let up .
