I As ! growing old and gray . My friend from Massachusetts , to whom I take off my hat as I think of her , is neither the one nor the other . Or , to lie exact , she is not at all old , and only ornamentally gray . I am a Southerner of the Southerners . My friend from Massachusetts is a Northerner of the Northerners . Nevertheless , she is a very delightful person . We have friendly tilts . She is generally the aggressor , and , as I am an old soldier , and stiff from much campaigning , she is quicker than I , and as a rule gets the best of me in the mere matter at argument , though I know all the while that I am right . Slue asks me many questions about life in the South " before the war . " Some of them I can answer . Some of them I am surprised to find that I can not . The light of memory is a little hazy after forty years .

It occurred to me , therefore , that a narrative based upon my OW , / life , surroundings , and doings , if I could accurately recall them , might be something to the purpose . " II might write " ? I began unguardedly . " Oh , yes . Do , please , " ? broke in my Massachusetts friend in her strenuous fashion , ? " do , please , write it for me , and if it is good enough , you might sell it and make some money . " I replied that it would be work , and that I did not like to work .

We should submit to it with patience and resignation to the Divine will ; but to say that we love it is extremely irreligious . It is a flying in the face of Providence . II is as though we told our Heavenly Father that we did not mind his curse ; that it was a good thing ; that we rather enjoyed it than otherwise . " But women , such women , at least , as men like to obey , are apt to have their way . Hence this little history . The home in which I was born , anti in which the happy years of my earlier boyhood were passed , was in an old Carolina town . Old , that is , as American towns go . There were old houses , With reminiscences of the Revolution ; tales of Cornwallis and Lafayette , and other worthies of that day . It was rather a pretty town , with wide , well-shaded streets . A river ran near it , and a pretty creek wound its devious way through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a cemetery , with mossy marbles , and epitaphs of a hundred years ago , in - which Gray 's Elegy might have been written , ? at least , the poetic inspiration would not have been wanting . There were walks in its environs , dark with the shade of magnolias and cedars , sweet with the perfume of Ole and jessamine , and musical with the song of the mocking bird , and the ripple of running water just below . Nor was there lacking in these bowers of Eden the loveliness of the daughters of Eve , who were wont to wander here with the sons of Adam , as the day went down . I had some experiences of my own , when , visiting the dear old town sonic years later , I found the walks by the water side as lovely as ever , and the daughters of Eve , whom I remembered as children , grown nit , and capable of as much mischief as their primeval mother , more by token that one of them made me a promise under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the proverb . Poor thing ! she married a better man , but the gallant fellow sleeps under the sod of Gettysburg , I wonder if it ever occurs to her in her widowhood that a living captain might be better than Thackeray 's lines seemed to come handy , and I used them ; but it is due to the truth of history to say that I have n't any Gascon Wine . Instead thereof , a punch simmers in front of use hickory fire , concocted out of some very bad whiskey , of Which the lemon and spices serve to disguise the taste ; for all of which uncivilized condition of things I have to thank the prohibitionist , Who is just now vexing the earth , and compelling every man of correct habits to obtain this necessary of life be means more or less lawful . I constantly thank Mr. Justice Blackstone for his comforting distinction between main peak ihita and male in se . Aly friend from Massachusetts , Who does me the honor to read these pages as I write them , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am getting into a vein not in keeping with my gray beard , nor with my character as a vestryman of the Church . I say to her that she is right , and that I had best t11111 my mind from these vanities , and , like the dea r old reprobate Falstaff , " begin to patch up mine old body for Heaven . " She replies , but with a look that conveys more humor than reproof , that I ant only adding irreverence to folly , and that I had better proceed with my Work . The old town never grew any bigger , and I believe it was never any smaller . It seemed to have been created just so ; even as you have seen some men and women whom you can not imagine ever to have been babies . It was not a dead town , ? very much the contrary . There was plenty of business and trade to support its population . Nobody was very rich , and I remember but few very poor people , and these were systematically looked after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove finer carriages than others , but the others did not call them " swells . " One man of good blood , respectable education , and the instincts of a companionable gentleman , was as welcome everywhere as another the same qualifications . Nobody scented very busy , and nobody seemed in a 1111111 to get rich . They allowed themselves a leisure fiat seems not to be known in illeS0 der : . They took time to hunt deer , and sd ; , i ducks and partridges . They loved music , and serenades under xv indott and little impromptu dances . They ex-changed little slippers and whist parties , whereat , it must be confessed , they times drank a little more punch trap fir Blessed Apostle St. Paul would have lowed to Timothy . But there was ' la malice in it , and the liquor was good and pure , and very little harm resulted . It seems to me , in the retrospect , a very lightful society , and I have no doubt that it was so . But I must . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep to the as nearly as I can , without rose color . It must be remembered , therefore , that de people of whom I have written Were ! lore with whom my own household mingled : physicians , lawyers , merchants , business men , who , of course , worked for a living , but did not fail to remember that work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. - There MIS , of necessity , a substratum of less lovable folk , of the kind who make the wretched maxims of AIr . Benjamin Franklin their gospel , and the adding of one dollar to another their chief aim , My memory especially recalls one or two such men , ? one , in particular , whose face , little as I was when I saw it , is unpleasant now to think of . They told me he was a " note shaver , " in a tone which conveyed , even to my childish intelligence , the idea that the calling was held in small esteem . It goes without saying , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles : children who died or wentastray. fortunes wrecked , sorrows of one sort or another . It is well for us that , in looking back over the land through which we have traveled , inc see most plainly the pretty , green , wooded hills and sunlit slopes . " The valleys that lie between are too , but they are in shadow . lassachusetts friend will not think 11041 these men . She will object to Item . in her energetic sway , that they were not " strestuous . " I grant it . The abomitailsisi wor , l was not even known , I think , iu thesselays . But I believe that they were istii ter . They were , for the most part , kindly , charitable , honest , honorable , and lire , . they reverenced women and chittic ? it . They feared God , and were not much given to fearing anybody else ; and Eder on they showed the world that an easv-going gentleman can be strenuous tit itsugb when he sees his duty before hint and knows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture , sir do more than justice to a race of men wheat 1 remember with so much love . I can say this for them , and perhaps this alone will account for the attractiveness of that society : that there was nothing like the intense hunt after money that exists new . and that there was absolutely no aristocracy of wealtls . Doubtless the love of money was there , as in the days of Solo-I11011 , but the sordid thing did not lift its Lead above the surface . Doubtless there were match-making mothers then , as now , but the worship of the Golden Calf was not flagrant in the sight of all Israel . At this point , my friend reminds me /hat I have not said a word about the negro , whereas the colored brother , as she understood , was to be a leading character in this story . I was thinking of that myself , and seas surprised to find that I /1:1 ( 1 gotten so far in a sketch of Southern life , without Cuffee putting in his woolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been writing so far of life in my town home , in which the darky cuts less figure . Only wait , ma'am , till my story carries me among them , and you shall have negroes enough , I promise you . There were , of course , plenty of them about the town , but they were mostly domestic servants , not much more necessary to an outline of the manner of life than the white servants of the North . The main difference was that there were more of them . We had , indeed , too many servants . They were in each other 's way . A man would own perhaps one , or two , or three families of negroes ; anti a farm or plantation . The negroes increased . the land did not . The result was that ties man would find himself with more " ItantIS " than he could work . What was he to do with them ? Grown hands could lie " hired out , " but good homes could not be easily found for the youngsters . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another about the premises . They could easily have been sold to the negro traders who were continually going through the country buying them up to carry to the cotton and sugar plantations of the Southwest , ? the difference in price in the two markets yielding the ( testier a fine profit . But the negroes stood in terror of these slave merchants , and in good truth they were a hard-hearted lot , as any matt must have been who followed such a calling . A humane master was exceedingly reluctant to sell his petiple to these Wren ; so he kept them , a source of embarrassment to him , eating their heads off , representing a good deal of money , but expensive to keep and unprofitable . So it frequently happened that every young lady of a large family would have a separate maid , every child or grand-child a separate nurse . A man would lie nominally rich , in negroes , but continually having to go to the bank for money . As for the town negro himself , he led for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimera of freedom , and eared nothing for it . Indeed , the slave , especially if he belonged to a family of standing , was disposed to look clown upon those of his race who had been freed , and to speak of them disparagingly as " free niggers . " There were , nevertheless some highly respectable families of free negroes . I remember one especially , ? the father and mother of which had been set free in early life , and given a start in the world by their master , ? who were people of substance and standing , and all , by the way , devout 111C111berS of the . ? I , ' , ' keteh Inn Blark and While Episcopal Church . It was curious , too , that these people themselves were OWIR ? S if slaves , ? negroes owning negroes . The older negroes were generally a staid and contented sort of people , frequently much given , like some white folks , to a kind of emotional , shouting religion ,  --  albeit consummate liars , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth commandment as to that which immediately precedes it . I have in mind a man belonging to Illy father , one of the hands upon his plantation near the town , who was not a had type of many of the characteristics of this class . HIS name was Alexander , commonly called " Ellick . " Ile was an intelligent fellow , perfectly black , of powerful build , excellent temper , and a first-rate hand in the field , but an incorrigible thief and liar . My old mammy , who , by the way , was his aunt , spoke of him with strong disapproval as a " gay Intherian . " Where the dear old thing haul ever heard of ' , Ala/do , I do n't know . He was understood to have at least two Wives among the neighboring plantations . Although my father seldom allowed the lash to be used among the grown hands , Ellick 's continual thefts brought him a send-occasional thrashing , from which he always emerged with unimpaired cheerfulness after the first smarting was over . lie would long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of his mother , an old family servant who had been my mother 's nurse . One spring day , my father had information that Ellick had stolen a pig . The evidence not being quite complete , he did not immediately move in the matter . It is necessary here to say that each negro head of a family was allowed a little bit of land around his cabin , where he might raise vegetables , chickens , etc. , having Saturday afternoon given bins for his own work ; and my father was accustomed to tell them that if they should have poultry , eggs , or other such stuff to sell , he expected them to " give him the preference " at the market price . This was so well understood among them that it came to be a saying that " marster had de prerrenee . " The tar following the discovery of I he tht ? ft. lick presented himself at the back veranda , bright and smiling , with a dress , , d pie to sell . My father was a quick-tempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ire boiled over . " You scoudrel ! " said he , forgetting his usual ulecoruin speech . " What do you //lean , brII611 ? use my own pig to sell ! " And he reachizt for his " rawhide " hanging on the wall . " No , marster , " Ellick began . " I traded wid Cato , over to Colonel for dis pig " " You are lying , as usual , " said my father ; " I have the proof on an - Your stealing is a common matter , and whipping seems to do you no good . I might not even have you whipped for flint : but that you should have the effronno to come here with my own pig " - - Ellick saw his chance , and put in at once . " Well , marster , " he said , with a deprecating look , and with all the seriousness of a legitimate defense , " you know you tole us for to always gill you de prermnce . " The fellow 's retort was too 111101 for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with changing face , and the muscles of his mouth began to twitch . " Get out , you dog , " lie said ; " I caul whip you //ow , but the overseer shall dress you off properly to-morrow . " Ellick knew he was safe , and slipped off . The rascal could scarcely keep his own face straight . I had witnessed the interview , and , being a very little boy the time , saw the termination with great satisfaction . Ellick was a prime favorite of mine . The young negro about town ? stable boy , house servant , barber 's apprentice , or what not ? was a good-natured , lazy , whistling , singing creature , cheerfully obeying the Scriptural command to take no thought for the morrow , and , having food and raiment , to be therewith content . Also , and in particular , he nude it ondant study to give the least pos-ililc lidoir for the food and raiment . The cis , monotony of his existence was Ion liv occasional thrashings. varying iu frequency and severity according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temper a ail ili , position of the master . It occurs to me that I have referred 1 , I ? ? ro than once to this matter of the use . , f dic whip ; and as this is , so far as it , t history of the times , I think it as II to say that in the part of the coun-icv in which I lived , and , so far as I know , throughout the middle and eastern slave . talet. there was but little whipping , exitlit of boys , whom the owner thrashed for misconduct , as he would his own chit- ( ea , thin igh , of course , I do not mean to always in the same spirit . Except 071 Ihe large plantations , on the lower watrs of to rivers , the slave property of any one man usually consisted of one or itcc or , perhaps , three families . It frequently happened that one family came with the husband ; another was brought to him by his wife at their marriage . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that there might exist , and did exist in most cases , : iiinething of a patriarchal condition . The older men were generally of sufficient character to do as they were told , and man- of them , very many , possessed the regard , and what might be called the respect , of their owners , and reciprocated and they assisted them in the government of their own children . My father 's slaves , for instance , were of two families , ' timing through the channels suggested with the addition of a few whom it hail fallen into his way to buy for one consideration or another . Except in the case of my friend Ellick , I do not remember that a grown negro was ever whipped on our plantation . Of course , there were patriarchs and patriarchs , and it was not possible that a power so nearly arbitrary as that of the master should not be sometimes abused . But extreme severity was ol'very rare occurrence . A public opinion strongly against cruelty was a powerful cheek , and another safeguard lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am describing , in which , whatever may have been their faults , a disposition to oppress the weak was never a trait . There was a condition sometimes occurring , which may be worth mentioning , and which , in one case that I recall , led to a result which may affect the reader 's risibles , or arouse his indignation , according to the point of view . Unmarried women , as widows or maiden ladies , who were not able , or ( lid not choose , to chastise it misbehaving servant , sometimes turned him over to the town constable for correction . Miss Ellen  --  , an excellent and elderly maiden lady , who would not care to have her name in print , although she WAS in Paradise long ago , had about her well-kept house a sharp , mischievous , rascally black boy named Malachi , Who gave her a great deal of trouble with his pranks . All sorts of misdeeds were charged against hint , of which I may give , as a fair sample , the well-attested fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with different sponsors , the good rector , to whom all young negroes looked alike , not recognizing him . Good Miss Ellen had many times threatened to send him to the , constable , but her heart always failed her when the time came . At last Malachi committed some offense which was as the feather to the camel 's back , and the good old lady nerved herself to do her duty . The constable owned a hardware store , and in the back yard thereof was accustomed to execute his office upon the backs of such dusky offenders as were sent to him with instructions to that effect . Miss Ellen artfully called Malachi , in a voice that gave no hint of trouble , and gave him a note to Mr. Bowie , the constable , leading him to suppose that it was an order , such as she frequently sent , for some article of merchandise . Malachi took the note , but regarded it with suspicion , conscious of his deserts . The more he thought about il , the stronger his misgivings grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite fact that the note was scaled especially exciting his mistrust . Finally his fears , and his spirit of mischief , prompted him to call old Billy , beloved of liss Ellen , and her gardener and factotum , and to give him the note , telling him to take it to Mr. Bowie and get the things ordered , and be quick about it , as Miss Ellen was in a hurry . hilly trotted down as fast as his ancient legs could carry him , and delivered the note . Mr. Bowie opened it , and looked seriously ; vt . Billy . " Uncle Billy , " he said , " I neVer expected to have this to do . " " What de matter , Marse Peter " said Billy . ' the constable read him the note , which bade him give the bearer a whipping , not too severe , but sutlicield to serve him as a lesson for sonic time to come . In vain Billy protested , and told the story of Malachi 's treachery . The constable had heard ninny such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off your coat , and let ' s have it over with . " And he proceeded to administer upon the old inns , according to his instructions . Billy put on his coat , and returned in fierce wrat , 11 , to avenge himself upon Mal-add , but that young scoundrel had run away , and did not conic out of the woods till the frosty nights of November drove him in . Mr. Bowie lost a customer , and the story went that Miss Ellen put her faithful old gardener to bed , and kept him there for a week , tending hint with her own hands . The negro , on the whole , was well enough off . Ile was not allowed to be off his premises after nine o'clock at night without a pass from his master , which was a Wholesome restriction . Ile was not a competent witness against it white man , a role of law which might have been modified to advantage , and probably would have been later on . Ills marriage was not recognized by the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with its kindred evil , the occasional and often unavoidable separation of husband and wife , parent and child , was the most evil consequence of the institution of slinerr , and the one which most engaged the tcntion of thoughtful slaventwows iis far hack as I can remember . A discussi , a , it would scarcely be within the range of this narrative , but I may say that imlirielors naturally , and for their own imcrest Its well , encouraged marriage and decent living among their slaves , not generally did all in their power to make the tie permanent . I have known very many , ove couples to live faithfully together 6 ; death parted them ; and some of the owl . tiest pictures in my memory are the aid-dings of female servants of our own , mulattoes and blacks , solemnized in our sad parlors by the rector of the parish . My sister took great interest in the dressing of the brides on these occasions . I do n't remember whether the rector used the full service , but there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march . These matrimonial alliances hail a humorous side , as well . One Sunday morning a negro from an adjoining plantation called on my father to ask ' tennission to marry One of our girls . The interview took place on our back porch , on father sitting , and the would-be groom standing on the ground outside . The dl-low was a preacher . Now my father had a general distrust and dislike of negro preachers , and of this one in particular . Accordingly lie squelched the matrimonial proposition with a prompt and ileeided negative . " No , I do n't want you nor any of your blood on my place . Van get no wife here . Take yourself off . " The reverend gentleman , a fat , sleek-looking rascal , stood , hat in hand , and looked with solemn sadness at my father . " 1 du n no as you 've thought of it , Ali .

He laughed heartily , and so far relented as to say that lie world ascertain the girl 's feelings in the matter , and talk hi lice suitor later . It turned out that the .1 Sketch in Black and 117ritc ( i07 do-kv belle did not take the " disappintlati ( " much to heart , and there was no Frew the beginning , when I undertook 11:E : iml unwelcome task of writing these led reminiscences , I have foreseen Mat I/IV retrospect would carry me over a part of the ground which , considering the raison d'are of these pages , I have kill a mind to pass over and go on my But if I did so , it would be at thin apparent to the intelligent reader that I was not giving even a fair outline of the relation of the negro to the Southern life of those days . I will , therefore , deal with it as frankly and as briefly as nifty be . It may have been noticed that , in my renal sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular masculine pronoun . The same description might have answered as well for the ordinary negro girl or woman of the plantation , with woolly head , and the other unattractive physical peculiarities of the pure black race . But , unfortunately , there were other female slaves whose presence everywhere in the South gave sorrowful evidence that the " sons of God , " the princely race of Adam , though they had not . as the Book of Genesis expresses it , taken unto themselves wives of the daughters of men ( the inferior race ) , had mingled more or less freely with them . We had black and tan , mulattoes , quadroons , octoroons galore . No man can deny the demoralizing influence of this state of things ; but , on the other hand , no Titan who was not reared in the South can have any correct idea of the situation from all its points of view . I have no inclination to dwell upon this unattractive part of my retrospect , and shall content myself with a rough outline of the peculiarities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of these women were ugly and slatternly ; some were comely and neat ; some were handsome and intelligent ; and here and there one might have been called beautiful . Many of them , to whose bring- Mg up some care had been given , married men servants of their own set , and lived respectably . Others , again , were of the circumspect and tpiaskupright sort ; and a numerous class , good-natured , careless , idle , I igh t-hea rted , were the easy prey of dissolute white men . of whom we had our full share , possibly more than our share . It must not be forgotten , however , that these men were , as a rule , and , of course , with exceptions , " lewd fellows of the baser sort , " the Southern gentleman generally- conducting himself toward his slaves as might be expected of a person of his birth and antecedents . There was quite enough that was bad , however , in this apparently unavoidable consequence of the presence of the inferior race , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been free for forty years . But there was one fact which every man familiar with tine ilk of that day will recognize at once , which it is a great comfort to think of , and which has always seemed to me a special dispensation in behalf of these poor creatures . It was this , and every Southern man of that day will vouch for it : that a lapse of the kind we are considering never seemed to degrade the slave woman , any more than the birth of Ishmael degraded Ilagar . It not only did not lower her in the eyes of anybody , white or black , but it had no degrading effect upon her whatever . If she had been gentle and good-tempered , and in general terms " a good servant " before , she continued to be so afterwards . If she had been your nurse , you need not have feared to leave your children with her . They would learn no evil . She was not rendered coarse or obscene . Her womanly instincts remained the same . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful way as if nothing serious had happened . I know a number of them still living , old mulatto women , many of them in the odor of sanctity , and esteemed by white and black neighbors , who in their youth had led lives which I will not here describe more particularly . My own old " mammy " had three daughters : the oldest was a bright mulatto , and my own much-loved nurse ; the two younger were as black us old Isaac , her husband , who look her to wife years after the birth of her first child . I am sure the good old creature is in the land of the blest . Think for a moment . What would a white woman have been who had passed through experiences like these ? I take it that no philosophical mind will doubt that the existence in any country of an inferior female class , to whom virtue in its ordinaq sense is not an essential , will tend to the exaltation of the upper class of women . It will make of them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , into which the libertine will not seek to enter . The Southern lady was held as a kind of queen in those ante bellunt slays , and kept her state accordingly . All men did her homage . No man looked upon her but with respect and honor . It followed that scandals and scandalous troubles were much less common than in these days . For this comparative innnunity we were indebted , as I think , not alone to the naturally high character of our women , and to their careful training , but also to the peculiar conditions of our society ; that is to say , to the institution of slavery . I willingly return from this sombre byway into the cheerful presence of my friend . I have said that the town I have described as my home lay near a river . As to the sanitary effect of this situation during the hot months , the people differed . Many , even well-to-do folks , spent their summers in the town , and suffered no ill ' result . Some went off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had summer residences in the rolling , sandy country back of the town . My own family was one of these . Our country house , which was a fair example , was an unpretentious frame building , erected upon our own plantation , and consequently having the negro quarters adjacent to it . It was comfortable and commodious enough , according to the simple ticites of those slays , which did not appromli oar own in the luxury of living . It lad isce intended as a summer home only , hut was provided with chimneys and fireplaces in case of need , and I remember that we passed a number of winters there pleasantly enough in our mild climate , renting the town house , partly froni considerations of economy , partly to ainid the trouble and inconvenience of niiicing . The distance from town was a sclll four miles , and the sandy roads were good in winter . The water for dr:id:hes was excellent ; the climate delightful : n stream ran near by in which homunculi : , could disport himself and learn to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melons , and plenty of " little niggers " to play with , under our mother 's eye . We had a big cider press of the primitive sort , under a big tree , where a fellow could lie down flat on his little stomach , and suck cider through an oat straw . We roasted sweet potatoes in the ashes , out in the negro cabins , and ears of green corn at their fires . Not that we had not plenty of these on our own lahle. but we could not have the little niggers there ; and then , it was good to cook for ourselves . I remember , when I was very small , begging that I might have one little boy , as black as your hat , to sleep with me , and being much exasperated and distressed at my mother 's peremptory refusal . We compromised by her consenting to let the little darky come in and say his prayers ( taught by her ) at the side of my bed . I had some sort of infantile idea that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gradual approaches , accomplish the desire of my heart . The woods were frill of blackhaws and chinquapins and fox-grapes and muse : , dines , and the air was full of sunshine . I was allowed to go barefoot in the clean white sand , and occasionally was turned loose , clad in one long garment , that being the customary slimmer costume of the young male African . I thought it was very delightful and becoming , being dis- i to imitate everything the little I. This is a curious childish trait , la Elie Way , and affords occasion for mount of philosophizing about the nsS.lencv of the human race to deteriorate and the like . All I know about it P. alma I would at any time leave the fried ken : psi rice and okra and egg plant id Pie hens , table , to say nothing of the to eat greens and pot liquor ( I ei id , if Inv friend from Massachusetts lames what that is ) and corn dumplings in Mammy 's cabin .

Anil indeed , he who was born in the early forties , served four years in the Confederate a r toy , and passed through the neverto-be-forgotten times that immediately followed , has lived three separate exist-tames . But while homunculus was kicking up Lis heels and having a good time out of doors in this primitive fashion , the grown talks in the house were , I think , leading a reasonably happy , though quiet life . I Salve not hesitated to go into these details of ray life with which the negro was associated , even at the risk of being a little tedious , because they make up the distinctly Southern views which I think my friend wanted to see . I am not so sure about the home life inside , which may not interest her , not having the charm of novelty ; one American home being essentially like another . I shall , therefore , make , this part of my sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive , and but little attention was paid to ornamentation of the grounds . A whitewashed paling , with a plain gate , a straight walk leading to the front entrance , with a circular drive for carriages , racks for the hitching of horses outside , a lane leading around to the stables in the rear , ? these were typical features . Here and there in front of the house were posts driven into the ground , With a sort of platform of boards nailed l'OL. 97- NO. 5 011 Ole lop , 1111 ( 1 110V111,1 With earth . On each of these , in SU111111111. , a quantity of rosin was laid , and set on fire aL night , making the darkness bright with its red flame , and filling the air with its wholesome odor . It was thought to be conducive to health . Also it kept insects away , and was useful to any guest driving up in the darkness . It was a turpentine country . My father was interested ill some distilleries , and rosin was cheap . Within , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good library , and always in good piano ; also my father 's violin . Besides my father , my mother , and myself , there was my sister , of whom I have spoken , ? some iii teen years older than I , there having been two children between us who died early . She was a handsome , graceful , bright woman , had been carefully educated , especially in music , and possessed a noble mezzo soprano voice , inclining to contralto , which , to me , is the sweetest of all voices . She attracted all men toward her , especially all who loved music , and it was my delight to lie on a sofa , in the evenings , and bear them sing . I do n't know just how old I was when , one evening , I heard three young men give the fine trio of Sir Henry Bishop : ? " To Greece we give our shining blades ; And one hearts to you , young ZCall maids. - I can not tell bow the music affected me , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . It was a new sensation . Perhaps it seas prophetic . I suppose I showed it in my face , for my sister came to my sofa and kissed me . " Did you like it , Frank ? " she said ; " I must teach you to sing . " Accordingly she taught me , in an irregular way , and would commend and praise me when I showed some sign of a talent for music . One memorable day , after one of my " lessons , " she called to my father , who was passing down the hall : " Come here , father , and hear this boy . He is going to have a voice . " My father came to the piano where she sat , a page of Mendelssohn 's St. Paul open before her .
