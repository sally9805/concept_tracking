txt Sheriff Cook and Deputy Sheriff Williams of this county were captured by two escaped convicts from the Fort Leavenworth military prison this afternoon at Pauline , five miles south of Topeka , and held prisoners in the farmhouse of a man named Wooster for several hours . The convicts finally escaped between a line of police sent from Topeka to reinforce the Sheriff , and are now at large . Both were slightly wounded . Wooster was badly wounded by one of the convicts when he tried to fire on them . Mrs. Wooster and Sheriff Cook were held before the convicts as a shield by the prisoners in making their escape . At 2:30 o'clock this afternoon some farmer boys near Pauline learned that the convicts were in the neighborhood . Hastily forming a posse , armed with target rifles . pistols . and clubs , they gave chase . Neither of the convicts was armed , and they were unable to make a stand . Later Sheriff Cook and Deputy Williams arrived .

Sheriff Cook was ordered to give up his gun , which he did . Deputy Williams by this time had reached the house , and entered without knowing what had happened inside , and he , too , was- made captive by the convicts . In the meantime , Chief Stahl of Topeka and eight officers were on their way . They arrived at the Wooster house about an hour after the officers had been imprisoned . Chief Stahl immediately began negotiations with the convicts to give up their prisoners and to surrender themselves . but the convicts only laughed .

One of the convicts told Sheriff Cook that he would be killed if he raadethe slightest move looking toward their capture . In the meantime the police officers on the outside had surrounded the building , but were afraid to make a move for fear that Cook and Williams would suffer . Mrs. Wooster fainted during the excitement . She finally revived , and at 7 o'clock the convicts placed the woman and Sheriff Cook in front of them as shields and made for the door . Then , after exacting a promise from the Sheriff that he would not permit any of the officers outside to fire on them , they started for the open .

The convicts had secured a good start before the officers had recovered from their surprise . Then some of the policemen wanted to pursue , but Sheriff Cook would not permit it , as he had promised the convicts immunity from arrest . Chief Stahl left some of his men on the scene and with the others started back to Topeka to take up the chase later on . From Topeka a posse was started out and Chief Stahl expressed the opinion to-night that he would land the men before morning . The convicts are well armed and have taken all the guns in the farmhouse , including those of the Sheriff and his Deputy. * They are both white men , but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
