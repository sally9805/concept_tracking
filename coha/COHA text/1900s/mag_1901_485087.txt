Mmusinsk and one to the great prison at Alexandrovak , in the vicinity of Irkutsk . At Mmusinsk the wonderful museum , with its unrivalled collection of bronze relics , was explained to the visitors by its learned founder , Mr. M. Martianoff , and its equally learned curator , Mr. Felix Cohn , both of whom were originally exiles , but have been so attracted by the beauties of the situation and the salubrity of the climate that they have voluntarily chosen Siberia as their permanent residence . Until one has been through Siberia in the summer season , he can have no adequate appreciation of the attractiveness , not only of the civilization , but also of the climate and the scenery . Indeed , almost every small town has its museum ; its impressive church , with its still more impressive church music ; its library , and its cultivated people Shortly before Miss Meakin was in Elagovestchensk , SaintSaens 's difficult opera of " Samson and Delilah " was rendered by a local musical society . During the latter part of their journey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to Vladivostok to fill an engagement with a first-class opera company . The opera-house in Irkutsk is fully equal , in size and equipment , to any we have in the United States . The information which Miss Meakin received concerning the massacres of the Chinese at Blagovestchensk , and the general operations of the Russians in Mantchuria , being obtained from hearsay evidence after leaving the region , is somewhat misleading . She represents the massacre as " inhuman " and " brutal , " following the current reports which appeared in English papers , though she received the account herself from eye-witnesses . Her witnesses , however , did not see all the facts . The full truth is , that the Russians were taken perfectly by surprise by the attack of the Chinese upon them in Mantchuria , and were utterly unprepared for it . To such an extent did the Russians confide in the good will of the Chinese that , as Miss Meakin herself says , they had completely denuded the place of soldiers , sending them down the river for general service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as can be appreciated only by one who was in the midst of the scenes which followed The expulsion of the Chinese from the Russian side seemed to be a military necessity of the most imperative order , for , owing to the suddenness of the attack , it was natural to believe that no Chinaman could be trusted , and that if the Chinese remained the city would be between two fires . The Chinese were therefore ordered across the river , and would for the most part have crossed in safety had not the Chinese themselves opened fire upon the rafts containing their countrymen . To one familiar with the conditions in Mantchuria at that time , it is clear that the last thing which the Russians wished to occur was the breaking out of hostilities between them and the Chinese War is , indeed , hell , as Gen Sherman truly said . But in this case it was the Chinese who forced its terrible alternative upon the Russians , and it was but the " fortunes of war " which they suffered by their own invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cleveland , 0 . : The Marine Review Publishing Co. 1901 . Paasch 's ' From Keel to Truck . ' upon which ' Patterson 's Nautical Encyclopedia ' is frankly admitted to have drawn largely , has a reason for being in that it gives marine terms in three different languages , English , French , and German ; but it is difficult to understand what want Mr. Patterson 's book is intended to supply . The title of encyclopiedia suggests an ample well from which the greenhorn may freely quench his thirst for knowledge . Applying this test at random to the five parts into which the work is divided , we obtain peculiar results . If we wish , for example , to learn what a " Pacific iron " is , we see , in Part I , that " stun ' - sail- boom irons are known sometimes as ' Pacific Irons ' " ; the fact being that a Pacific iron is a thing by itself and never confounded with anything else . Part II . tells us that " a ' cap scuttle ' Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the deck , with a flat or top which shuts closely over into a rabbet " ? a statement almost bewildering in its lucidity . In Part III . we read that the Index Correction is " the adjustment of the index glass of the quadrant , octant , or sextant , which consists of making the index glass perpendicular to the plane of the arc " ( this would have been news to the immortal Bowditch ) ; in Part IV. , that " circulating or condensing water is that which is run through a surface condenser to absorb the heat from the exhaust steam " ; and in Part V. , that " ' Jimmy Legs ' is a nickname for the master-at-arms . " These answers bespeak the dictionary rather than the encyclopEdia , and they assume , on the user 's part , either a tolerably wide acquaintance with the several subPacts considered ( Seamanship , Ship-building , Navigation , Marine Engineering , and Man-of-war phrases ) , or else the same optimistic spirit which , with a light heart , undertakes French in ten lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evasive key to his riddle from one definition to another , while the expert would instinctively turn to the less pretentious treatises , by well-known authorities , in which each branch is dealt with soberly and thoroughly . As a dictionary of sea terms the book has , possibly , some value , although it is not free from errors and from expressions which are , to say the least , novel . Few sailors know what an anchor shaft is ( p. 43 ) ; few would call a rowlock a thole-pin ( p. 79 ) ; none ever heard of a main boom sail ( p. 167 ) ; some have seen a horizontal donkey boiler ( p. 413 ) ; and all would wish , in 1901 , an Arctic chart of more recent date than 1875 . " An eminently sympathetic study , which will commend itself to the general reader for its avoidance of the minor pedantries into which writers on German subjects  --  not excluding Carlyle  --  are prone to fall . Particularly interesting is Prof. Thomas 's discussion of the philosophy of Schiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
