 | THE All-Russian Peasants ' Union is an effort to harness the whirlwind . There are in the country over eighty million peasants . Their wrongs are matters of history ; the hunger of their bodies and the bitterness of their hearts are so real that they can only be imagined . These things have a potential force which neither principalities nor powers can control ? this flood of eighty million desperate men can only be checked by itself ; it can not be stilled by those upon the banks . A short while ago a messenger came to me in Moscow saying that there was to be a meeting of the Bureau of the Peasants ' Union , and that if I wished to attend I must go at once to the house of the treasurer , who was a friend of mine . It was a chance I had been waiting for , and I hurried to her house . We had an uncanny ride , circling the city , changing from sleigh to sleigh in order to shake off possible pursuers , and dismissing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to an immense gray building , which had formerly been a school , but was now ostensibly a dispensary . The treasurer , my companion , was recognized by a watcher at the door , who , by a sign , told her that all was safe , and we went thru a long , dark hall into a damp , ill-lighted room . At first I thought the place was empty , but a voice spoke to me in beautifully pure English , and over in a corner I discovered a small gray - haired man with immense glasses ? the secretary of the union . He asked me a number of polite questions about the health of my family and the part of the country I came from just as tho we were meeting quite open-  | ly on a purely social basis , and he frequently found it hard to understand my Americanisms . We were interrupted by the entrance of a stout workwoman carrying on her head an immense basket of bread . She came in laughing . and as she swung down her load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was remarkable . From a workwoman she became a woman of culture and refinement . She sat clown on one of the low benches , and , still laughing , told us how she had just outwitted the police . " They had watched me so closely , " she added , that I have not slept twice in the same place for six weeks . But they are so stupid . Today they were not looking for a bread woman . Why , the Sergeant Ivan himself took bread from my basket . See , here are the three kopeks . " She laughed again at the thought of it . The room filled rapidly with a strange mixture of peasants , isvostchiks , sick people with their arms or heads bandaged , and a few in ordinary European clothes . But in the dim room the peasant caps came off ; the padded coats of the isvostchiks or drivers were thrown aside , the disguising bandages of those who had come ostensibly to the dispensary were pushed from sound heads and the only ones who remained unchanged were those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted the attention of the police . It would be hardly correct to say that the meeting " came to order , " for without any formality they got clown to business . The first one to speak was a young lawyer ? chairman of the printing cony mittee ? a man who I afterward heard spoke half a dozen languages and was familiar with the literary and political currents of Western Europe . He had a bundle of letters in his hand from comrades who were out in the country districts organizing the peasants . Every organizer reported that the peasants were anxious to unite and eager to read anything that could be given them , and asked for more literature . " I must have some more money , " he said . " I have n't a single printed sheet left . The last one has been sent out . " He looked appealingly to my friend . the treasurer of the bureau . " I have nothing very cheerful to re-  | port . " she answered . " At our last meeting I had sixty-three rubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went out to the Province of Tula and the same to Maria Petrovna -- you know she went down to Kharkoff . And so 1 have only thirty - three rubles left . " The idea of sending people out to work among the peasants in the dead of winter with only seven dollars and a half did not seem appalling to these " agitators . " Another one of their number was planning to go into the North country , and they finally decided to divide what was left in the treasury ? thirteen rubles for her and twenty rubles for printing . They talked over some other matters of detail and then broke up into groups to read the letters which had been received since the last meeting . The little gray-haired secretary with the great glasses sat down by my side , and I got from him the story of how the union was started . Last spring , he told me , a nobleman in the Province of Moscow , who wished to win approbation at Court , called together the peasantry on his estate , and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to the Czar . This letter , which was written by the nobleman , was printed and circulated thru all the empire as tho it were a sincere statement from the peasants . This began by thanking the Czar for his manifold kindnesses , and went on to say that the signers were perfectly happy , that they had all they wanted to eat , that they were in favor of keeping- up the Japanese war , and that they were so enthusiastically loyal that they hated all the revolutionists , and especially those " intellectuals " who were blasphemous enough to criticise his Majesty . Of course no one who knew the conditions believed in the truth of the letter , but it was widely circulated as a " campaign document , " and might not have been challenged if it had not come to the attention of a former peasant from this village named Kurneen . He had come to Moscow as a boy and had educated himself and become a clerk in a naphtha firm . The moment he saw the letter he knew it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that village , and many of the peasants from his home visited him when they came to Moscow . He wrote a reply , which was ughing.  | published in one of the liberal papers in Moscow , in which he clearly and forcibly exposed the real conditions in this village . The letter drew to him the attention of a number of educated people who were interested in the peasantry , and there were many conferences between them and Kurneen . The idea of the Peasants ' Union was his . He knew of the labor unions in the cities ; he knew of the professional unions which have co-ordinated the efforts of the professional classes thruout the country , and he advocated the formation of such a union among the peasants . The " Intellectuals " helped him in the work , and last June a conference was called in Moscow . Altogether one hundred and two delegates came to the meeting , twenty of whom were people of education and culture . while the rest were peasants . The meetings took place in a barn a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were held at night ; the great room was dark except for a candle on the desk of the secretary . The delegates from the different sections spoke in turn , each telling of the sufferings of his people and their longing for some organization to unite them all . One delegate presented a resolution signed by the peasants of twentyfive villages in his district . Some had walked sixty " versts " to sign it . Another read a letter signed by five thousand peasants . But in spite of the great interest of their reports , the Congress because impatient before a quarter of the delegates had spoken . The time presses to business ! " This cry was taken up , and the , assembly turned its attention to organization . No labor union had ever dreamed of so gigantic a task as the organization of eighty million peasants , but it was decided that it could he done , and invitations were sent out for a general Congress . Two hundred delegates , all peasants , gathered in Moscow on the 6th of November . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This first Congress decided on a program , and worked out a very elastic system of organization . The central bureau was to have no authority . except to call meetings and to act as a sort of correspondence center , while the greatest possible freedom was given to each group . The Congress adopted a program which is not revolutionary in its wording . The union was to be strictly nonpartisan ; it would simply act as the spokesman of the peasants and not try to instruct them . The program does not directly attack the Czar nor the Orthodox Church ; but it expresses the absolute necessity of more land for the peasants and demands the immediate summoning of a constitutional assembly , based on universal , direct and secret ballot . The " Land Question " is one of the most serious that faces Russia . Everybody admits that the peasant 's allotments are too small , but even the peasants themselves are divided as to the remedy . Some think that the Church and crown estates should be confiscated , others favor the expropriation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . they expressly state that this question must be decided by the will of all the people and they bind themselves to accept the decision of the representative assembly . Other parties ? reactionary and revolutionary ? are telling the Russian peasants what they ought to do . There is none of this dogmatism in the Peasants ' Union . Their " raison d'etre ' ' is simply to formulate the desires that this preponderating majority of the population already have and bring some unity and definiteness into their actions . To carry out their idea they printed a leaflet expressing certain demands which they considered to be universal . To these demands were added a draft constitution for the local organization . This paper was accompanied by another explaining in the simplest way what each paragraph meant and stating that it was only prepared as a suggestion . Each group of peasants which joins is perfectly free to accept this constitution and set of demands , as drawn up by the Congress , or to substitute anything in their place , as they desire . This mild program became public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the revolutionary papers were calling on the people to arm themselves against the autocracy , and were wildly preaching bloodshed and revolt . The Government immediately recog-  | nized the danger with which this organization threatened it . For the Government relies mainly on the support of the rural communities , and it knows that this support depends on the ignorance and isolation of the peasants , so any movement which might unite them is a menace . Realizing this , they attacked the union savagely and relentlessly , and within a week of the publication of the Czar 's manifesto , which promised liberty of assembly and organization , the whole central bureau of six men were arrested . Kurneen , who was thought to be dying of consumption , was released on condition that he stay in his house and sever all connections with the union . His comrades are now afraid to communicate with him even to send him greetings ? for fear that it will result in his rearrest . The arrest of the original bureau did not seriously cripple the work of the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first the members had an office in the Technological Institute , but this was raided by the police and much of their literature confiscated ; and now the organization is entirely " conspirative . " All the meetings are held in the strictest secrecy and the printing clone " underground . " The work has , of course , been interfered with by the railroad and postal strikes . I asked the secretary how many peasants were enrolled in the union . He said that it was impossible to tell definitely , as the postal strike was not over , and he had no doubt that many hundreds of letters were waiting to be delivered to them , but from the returns that they had already received he estimated that there were about one million members . Some of the peasants had accepted the printed form which had been sent them , and had added their names to it , just as it stood . Others had drawn up demands of their own . The letters from the Volga Vallay , for instance , generally added to the demands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fish . But there was a striking similarity among them all . Coming from districts separated by thousands of miles , and from peasants of different ethnic stock , the demands were always fundamentally the same ? crude and unpolished declarations of the rights of man . Many of these documents were quaint in their wording , and they were generally accompanied by curious letters from the organizer , frequently the only man in the village who could write . " We have taken this writing to the Natchalnik ( Government official ) and he told us not to send it , but we have decided to do it anyhow , " said one letter . The spontaneity of the movement is shown by another letter , which read : " I have never seen any one from the union , but I read in the Sviet that there is such a union , and as I thought it would be a good thing I called the elders of the village together and we all want to join . Please write and tell me what it is . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union without savagely attacking it . A letter of great interest came from a village priest in the province of Novgorod . He had heard of the union and started to work to organize the peasants in the neighboring villages . His work attracted the attention of the police and he was arrested . The news scattered thru the district , and in the middle of the night he was awakened by a howling mob of five hundred peasants who had come to release him . The jailer was frightened and allowed hint to stand upon a table and talk to the peasants thru a window . He says that it was necessary for him to talk to them for two hours before they would go home to their beds , and he ends his letter asking for advice as to how he shall act , for his trial was to take place in a few days and he was afraid that many of the peasants would be killed in their efforts to liberate him . In this secret meeting of the Central Bureau in Moscow were types of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here was a dramatist whose plays have been produced in America ; here a man well known in international scientific circles for the ethnographical researches he made during his exile to Northern Siberia . Others were peasants of the type of hurneen , men who had overcome all the obstructions with which the Government opposes any effort to rise from one class to another . The women were all " intellectuals " ;  | and most of them had traveled extensively in Western Europe . All of them were inspired by the one idea that the future of Russia depends on the peasantry , For they make up eighty per cent . of the population , and in the democracy , which can not long be postponed , the fate of the nation will be in their hands . At last this Moscow committee began to disperse . It was a long process , for it was necessary to ' leave by ones or twos to avoid observation . The peasant caps were pulled down over scholars ' faces ; an isvostchik 's coat covered the dramatist ; the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread to her head ; the bandages were again drawn over faces ; and the committee began to fade away . It is impossible to forecast the part to be played by this gigantic and rapidly growing organization . From all over the Empire , from the Black Sea to the sparsely settled country of the North , from the Baltic Provinces to the most distant districts of Siberia , peasants are writing to be enrolled . Its founders have great hopes for it , and tho all these may not be fulfilled , it is certain that in giving the peasants a means for a coordinated and coherent expression of their wants , it will do more than anything else to prevent these faminestricken and cruelly oppressed people from breaking out in aimless and resultless jacqueries . Its aim is to produce a conscious change of social status . One of the letters received by the bureau began : " We , citizens ( formerly peasants ) of the village of .
