txt There is not the least doubt here that the developments in Santo Domingo , reported to-day , will be used as the basis for a new attack upon the President when the Senate re ; convenes . The attack will be made by I Democrats and winked at by Republicans , even by some of the highest in the maI jority councils . There will be perfunctory defense of the President by Republican Senators . No Democrat will have any trouble in getting ammunition . This does not mean that the President 's men in Santo Domingo will cease to be protected . If necessary , warships will go there to look out for the American collectors of customs . But it does mean that the President will have vastly greater difficulty in getting Senatorial indorsement for his Santo Domingo policy . It means . too , that his dream of seeing that country behave itself under American direction is further off than ever . The collectors of customs are American citizens , but they are employed by the Morales Government . If they are in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Morales 's officials , but as American citizens . They will go right on with their work without regard to this affair , whether they need the aid of American guns or not . There is resentment among the Reptiolicans against the President for entering upon the Santo Domingan venture without consulting the Senate leaders , not even those on the Committee on Foreign Affairs . They are not sorry to see an event which in their opinion gives the Democrats a powerful weapon to use in attacking the " big-stick " policy . The news of the flight of President Morales from his capital produced very little surprise in official circles here . At the State Department It was the general comment that the expected had occurred , and there was little concern as to the outcome of the affair . Minister Dawson for several months has kept the depart- - ment well advised of the many dissensions among members of Morales 's Cabinet and the leading men opposed to his administration . That an outbreak ' was sure to come has been a foregone conclusion in the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No distinct account has been received at the State Department as to what act led to the flight of Morales , but it Is ; supposed that he was frightened by some I of the factionists whose friends had been shot by Morales in his operation to seize I and hold the Presidency . It was stated to-night by a high au-1 thority in the Administration that this Government would take no hand in the situation . It is the view of the President and Secretary Root that no agreement exists between the two Governments under which Major Colton and his assistants are collecting the customs and depositing * , S per cent . thereof to the credit , of foreign creditors of the republic . The American customs officers were simply named  --  or , as the more technical phrase is. " presented " ? by President Roosevelt at the request of President Morales as fit and capable persons to organize and op-11 // TROOPS HUNT MORALES ; FIGHT NEAR CAPITAL1 // erate the Customs collection system of the country . It may be accepted as coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no aid whatever to Morales . Under the treaty which is before the Senate Clause 7 provides that whenever the President of the Do-1 mingan Republic may ask this Governmentto provide a police power to preserve order in the island , and to protect the collection of customs , this Government may comply with that request . As this treaty has not been ratified and is int in force , this clause has no effect , nor will the spirit of it be observed in any way by this Government . It was the theory of ex-Assistant Secretary of State Loomis that the installation of customs collectors from this country would serve to quell the tendency to revolutions in Santo Domingo , and for that reason chiefly the arrangement was suggested and finally was proposed by Morales . As long as Morales had the backing of United States gunboats he was strong enough to hold himself in power , but Secretary Root has entered on a different policy and the support of the naval power of this Government is no longer behind the fleeing Domingan President . It is the expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win not be molested in the performance of their duties , and that they will be as much desired by any new faction as by the Morales Government . Should there be the least danger they would be amply protected by this Government on the broad ground that they are American citizens and on no other . This Government will not fire a shot in support of any notion that it is acting as a trustee in Santo Domingo . The President and Secretary Root consider Major Colton and his force of collectors as Domingan officials , although they are American citizens . Internationally they are simply expert employes of Santo Domingo . The Domingan Government can dismiss the men any time it ehooset Acem ding to all advices received here , there is no feeling against the United States in the present uprising . This Government expects to have the same support for the pending treaty that has been given by Morales . While the treaty was pending it was internationally the duty of both Governments , after signing the convention , to preserve the status quo , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into that set up the Trustee collectorship . The only sign of opposition to the financial arrangement between Santo Domingo and the United States , according to the dispatches , seems to come from the towns of Guayubin , Dajabon , and Sabaneta , in the Province of Monte Christi . These are very small towns , and , it is said by those who know , they could not raise an army of 150 men . Nothing serious is expected to follow from any alleged feeling against this Government . One of the chief reasons why the United States Government interfered in Santo Domingo was not its desire to see that the island republic 's debts were paid , but its wish to prevent revolutions . It was a theory that if the Custom Houses were in American hands , disturbances would cease . That is why the present situation is so serious for the Administration . Its theory is completely disproved . At the time of the agreement persons familiar with Santo Domingo told members of the Administration that they were wrong in their premises . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Custom House loot , but the insecurity of life and property in the republic . " Most of these revolutionists , " said a man acquainted with all the various party chiefs there to-night , " would not only be satisfied : they would prefer to lay down their arms and cultivate their farms . The trouble is that it is actually unsafe to do so . No man in power trusts an opponent Who has surrendered . There was Gonzales , for instance , who laid down his arms and went home to his family . Two days later two soldiers came with an order for his arrest . He was , according to the order , to be taken to another city to teetify in a law case , " Gonzales knew what that meant . It was night , and there was no boat leaving for the city which was his nominal destination . He bade his family good-bye forever , and went . On the road be was shot in the back , and the soldiers gave the customary report , that he had attempted to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to part with his newer . He is not safe without a dozen Generals at his command . " Under Morales there have been a great number of executions without even the pretense of a court-martial . Two days before his inauguration , while he was acting as provisional President , Ginebra , Minister of Posts and Telegraphs , came to him and said : " A demonstration is planned against you on inauguration day . " " Is that a fact ? " said Morales , wheeling around in his chair . I know it to be true , " replied Ginebra . " All right , " said Morales. " to-morrow 1 morning take out Gen. Mansueta and Commander Gilheaux and have them shot . " It was done and there was no demonstration . Cable advices to the State and Navy Departments say that the Captain of the Port of Puerto Plata was hailed and that the Provincial Governor has defied the General Government and barricaded the town . The following was received from Acting Controller and Receiver of Customs Edwards , dated at Santo Domingo : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital last night with few followers . His intention is said to he to join the followers of Jim Inez , in opposition to the adherents of Horacio . Conflict between the two forces is imminent , probably vicinity of San Juan or vicinity of Puerto Plata . ' Morales may attempt to establish new capital and new Cabinet . Political excitement , but without disturbance here . Receivership is not affected yet . Colton should be Monte Cristi Tuesday . "
