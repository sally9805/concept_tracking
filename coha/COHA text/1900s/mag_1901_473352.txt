almost as convincing as would have been n personal acquaintance with her in real life . Alice in Wonderland , and yet not wonderstruck I A sweet , childish spirit at home in the midst of mystery ! An exile of that faraway Stork Country ? the prenatal wonderland ? with its atmosphere still clinging to her and coloring her fancy . And yet a little girl is she , with lessons to learn and duties to perform ? a demure , quaint little girl , with a strict regard for the proprieties of life , and a delicate sense of consideration for the feelings of others , even when her companions happen to be Mice , Dodos , Gryphons , and various other strange and awe-inspiring things . And underlying all this is that simple , sincere faith which seems to be the peculiar property of childhood , and which upon all occasions induces in her a respectful attitude , howeVer absurd may be the situation . Such is my impression of Alice as she lies asleep on the green bank of a vagrant brook on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our waking thoughts , like this must she he when her gray eyes are open in wakefulness . Gray eyes , did I say ? Yes , surely she must have gray eyes , and large , through which her soul looks out flutteringly , like a white butterfly just issued from its cocoon into the air and sunshine . And yet there is a self-reliance about her as pronounced as the confidence of the palpitating insect when it spreads its untried wings to soar above the roses or ihe flowers of the field . Her face , wreathed in a wealth of brown hair , is delicately modelled , with the roundness and dimples of babyhood still modifying its contour and shaping the outlines of her petite figure . And as other summers come and go I think I can see her develop into a woman , with delicately chiselled features and a form of modest grace , and the concern of life gradually creeping into her eyes . And the same tenderness of the little Alice of long ago will abide in her heart , happily adjusting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quiet evening hours she will again wander through the mystic world of a more mature fancy , until in the twilight of life she will enter into that Wonderland the glorious vistas of which lead the traveller on and on in a never-ending pilgrimage . Quite as delightful , though in a different way , are the companions of Alice in her remarkable adventures . The per- sonification of the dumb animals and the inanimate things is so skilfully done as to appear quite natural and appropriate . One would not be greatly surprised to hear a Rabbit or a Gryphon speak , if their words produced an impression similar to that created by their inarticulate or immobile expression . And so , in the mind of the reader , there is no classification of her friends intotheir various orders , but all are real characters on a common plane of human action and interest . What an excellent idea we obtain of that extinct specimen of the pigeon tribe , the Dodo , after witnessing its extraordinary exhibition of liberality in awarding prizes ( from the pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Alice in particular ! And how well does the contradietary , crusty manner of the Caterpillar seem to he adapted to that singular worm as it sits , wreathed in a cloud of smoke from its hookah , on the top of a toadstool , where Alice chances to encounter it ! And what a droll scene is that where the Fish Footman ceremoniously delivers the Queen 's invitation to the Duchess to play croquet to the equally pompous Frog Footman I How well suited to each other do the Hatter and the March Hare appear to be as they sip their tea and wrangle over the half-recumbent form of their comfortable friend , the drowsy Door Mouse ! The Cheshire Cat , the Queen , the Gryphon , the Mock Turtle ? all are bits of realism from the world of fancy , to use terms apparently contradictory , but which seem to me to be is a play in which the subordinate actors are quite as excellent in their way as the leading character . They are differentiated from each other by a variation in their personalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain . Creatures are they of a vagrant fancy , which , like a rushing mountain stream , ofttimes reflects distorted images , but is ever pure , with the sunlight glancing from its bosam . But , like the rapid-flowing brook , there are placid pools in its course , and in one crystal , reposeful spot is the face of Alice . Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland is a book which appeals alike to young and old . It is an object-lesson that tends to make us realize the truth of the adage , " Men are but boys grown tall . " And what more healthy influence can be at work in the world than that which inclines busy , careworn mtn to identify themselves with an eternal youth ? Genial , kind-hearted , loving Lewis Carroll ! What better tribute can be paid to his excellence than to say that it was his mission in life not only to popularize purity in child literature , but to incite an emulation in other writers , productive of results the extent of the beneficent effects of which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
