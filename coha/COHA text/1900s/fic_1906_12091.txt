JASAMINE ( Cue for song ) " HERE IT COMES AGAIN " I b'lieve I 'm ' bout to find myself where I started from , They say that money does all things - well I 've been handlin ' some And yet I knew bad luck would come , it 's plain as A.B.C . Cause something 's buzzing in my ear and whispering to me. p. 55 CHORUS Here it comes again - plague take it , here it comes again But when that feeling comes a-stealing , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , but I was figuring too fast My dream it was too good to last ( spoken ) Dog bite it , here it comes again . 2nd verse . I had brain fever one time and had fierce pains in my head , And now I know exactly what Doc . Smith meant when he said " If any time insanity should stare you in the face , You 'll find an awful funny strange sensation taking place . " CHORUS Here it comes again ( Spoken ) Good gracious , Here it comes again , But when that feeling comes a-stealing , it 's no use to complain , The Doctor says it 's a fact , that I 'm some kind of maniac , My upper story it is cracked , ( Spoken ) I feel it , here it comes again . 3rd verse .

Ben Brown and I once met two girls who called him ' cross the street One had a face that looked just like a yard of sausage meat , I said to him " She sure has the limit face on her " Just then he kicked me hard and said " why that 's my sister sir " p. 56 CHORUS There it wuz again ( Spoken ) Dod bust it , there it was again , He kicked me cruel , like a mile and caused e lots of pain , Said I " You are mistaken Ben , I meant the other homely hen " " Why that 's my wife " said he - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 5th verse .

I 'm very fond of chickens , but they never took to me , It seemed somehow that they 'd get soared and fly right up a tree , At night I 'd go to Squire Smiths and coax them out with bread , But they was all so scared of me , that now I ' spose they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes again , That chicken feeling comes a-stealing , it 's up with some poor hen , It ai n't no use for you to beg , and if he gets you by the leg , You 'll never lay another egg , ( Crows ) here it comes again . 7th verse . One night we went to Chinatown and while down there it seems , A " Chink " presented me a pipe that gave me funny dreams , I dreamt a lovely fairy came and sat upon my knee , She said that I was handsome and she loved on one but me ( Lights pipe ) p. 57 CHORUS Here she comes again Oh ! joy and rapture here shes comes again , I 'm bound to marry that sweet fairly , Oh ! lady tell me when , She answered with a pretty pout , that she is mine without a doubt , But shucks !

( At finish of song , emblems trophies &amp; etc in hands of all ( Except American party ) thrust forward electric effects to be arranged to suit taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plains near Borema Springs . RASTUS I thought as much - Here I am devoting every minute of my valuable time , improving your physical condition and Pedistrianism is the best means to that end , and this is the way you appreciate it and I suppose you 'll round off your ingratitude by asking me to dismount so that you can ride ? JASAMINE Words fail to explain how much I appreciate your devotion to my physical condition . You 've proved that to my entire satisfaction when ever there was a chance for both of us to ride , you 've always let me walk and another thing , there never was a selfish bone in my body . RASTUS Then why do you wish me to dismount ? JASAMINE Sympathy for the mule . ( Ras dismounts ) RASTUS You 're right , you 're right ( Ras goes over and shakes Jas 's hand ) You 've a great big heart in that rusty body of yours . I never thought there was such a thing as sympathy in your make up . I was just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the case , I  - -  -  RASTUS ( Interrupting ) p. 60 No , no not another word , you 're about to say you 're sorry you spoke to me in that manner after all my kindness ( Shakes hand violently ) but you 're right , you 're right , you 're always right ( Calls to servant ) Hadji ! ( Stops shaking Jas 's hand , takes roll of money from pocket ) Here 's Five Dollars , take that poor little beast safe into camp , we 'll walk . I never gave the matter a thought . Poor little beast . ( Exit servant - Ras watching exit expressing mock sympathy by wagging head murmuring ) sympathy for the --  ( Goes to Jas and shakes his hand once more saying ) you 're right , you 're right . JASAMINE Did n't you forget something ? RASTUS Forget what ? JASAMINE To kiss the mule good-bye . RASTUS ( Takes roll of money from pocket ) Here 's a couple of thousand , buy yourself an automobile , forget the mule and be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at things with the eye of a Philosopher . JASAMINE And you 's a Philosopy ? RASTUS Philosopher . JASAMINE What 's the duty of a Philoso- philoso- ( finally add pede ) p. 61 RASTUS Philosopher . JASAMINE Well what 's his duty ? RASTUS To look on the bright side of other people 's troubles when you have n't any of your own . JASAMINE ( Chaking Ras 's hand violently ) You 're right , you 're right . RASTUS Now we understand each other , I 'll let you into a little secret . JASAMINE Before you tell me that secret , give me one of the crackers you 've got in your pocket ? RASTUS You must learn to withstand temptation . Over feeding is not conducive to good physical condition , allow me to quote Shakesphere on the subject " Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits make rich the ribs , but bankrupt quite the wits " and I want you to have your wits about you at all times . JASAMINE The day that Shakesphere said that , I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham sandwich under his belt . RASTUS ( Takes out roll of money ) Here 's Ten Dollars , we 'll reach the Capitol to-morrow , when you get in town buy yourself a good chicken dinner . Forget your troubles of the day before and be happy . JASAMINE Shakesphere , Ten Dollars and an argument to keep from giving me a single cracker . Ras johnson that 's the persification of meanness . RASTUS I have to be cruel to be kind , when I brought you away from home you was the acme of physical perfection , do you suppose I 'm going to allow you to gorge yourself until you become absolutely useless to yourself or any one else - a disgruntled , dyspeptic , unfit for the association of respectable people ? ( pause ) p. 62 No Sir ! JASAMINE ( To audience ) Did you ever see a man stick so tight to a cracker ? RASTUS As I was about to say , I have a little secret I want to impart . You remember I caught Fifteen Thousand Dollars in the Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 125 acres we have down in Wilson County , Kansas . JASAMINE Umph ! Umph ! RASTUS You know I promised Aunt Cally , Uncle Rube Fowler , Miss Primly and the other girls , I 'd take them abroad . JASAMINE And me- RASTUS Of course you , you 're here ai n't you ? Well at first I only figured on going as far as Paris . JASAMINE ( Dance and Sing ) As I stroll along the Boise-de-Boulogne . RASTUS ( Slapping Jas on back ) We had a good time in Paris , Eh ! Jas ? JASAMINE ( Returning slap with interest ) Go on Donne-Lui Ce qui est La , Madam ? Oh pshaw ! RASTUS That will do how , that will do . As I was saying , I did n't intend to go any further than Paris , but something happened in Paris . JASAMINE Yes you got arrested for fighting a French man . RASTUS No , no , I mean something important happened ( looks around suspiciously beckons for Jas to come closer. - Bus . for Jas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil industry of Kansas , well the biggest oil well in the County was discovered within the borders of that 125 acres . Our agent sold the 25 acres surrounding the oil well , for a big bunch of money and I received the coin the day before we left Paris , hence the fresh supply of Mazuma . JASAMINE After you give me one of them crackers , there 's another secret that 's been troubling me more than anything else ( Looks around suspiciously then whisperes ) Why did you leave the Boise-de-Boulogne for the sandy De-Dez ? RASTUS ( Sighes ) Paris is a wonderful place-attractive , luxurious , magnificent who could forget the Palais Royal , Louvre , Luxembourg --  JASAMINE And the Bois-de-Boulogne . RASTUS ( Shrugs shoulders , gesticulates like Frenchman ) To pick up my narrative --  JASAMINE ( Interrupting ) If it do n't make any difference to you , would you mind picking up a cracker at the same time ? RASTUS ( Ignores question ) This fresh supply of money gave me an opportunity to gratify my one life long hobby " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about more funny diseases since you 've had money , then any man I 've ever seen . Neuritis , Neuroma , Neurosis . Nephritis of the Pedal extremities , Chiropody and now you 've got the Hobbyastronomous . RASTUS Astronomy is n't a disease , its a sience . Astronomy treats of the heavenly bodies . Considered as to their nature , heavenly bodies may be divided into two great classes . Class one-incandescent bodies which shine by their own light . Class two- Opaque bodies which are visable only by reflecting the light of some incandescent body in their neighborhood . Now the three fundemental facts which determine the phenomena of Astronomy are : TheGlobular form of the earth , its diurnal rotation on its axis and its annual revolution around the sun . To represent the position of the stars , astronomers imagine circles on the Celestial sphere , corresponding to the circles of longitude and latitude on the earth . To explain to you longitude and latitude , the Meridian of Greenwich , Celestial meridians and the like , would be a waste of time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 64 If you 'd just show me the photograph of a cracker -- - RASTUS Now if I should take you at your word and afterward did n't give you the cracker , it 's more than likely you would have a serious case of muscular contraction of the oesophagus , in that case , what would you do ? JASAMINE Say my prayers . RASTUS If you 'll agree not to interrupt me for five minutes , I may furnish you with a few of these crackers . JASAMINE I 'll sign the Arimistice . RASTUS As I was saying , I might be able to interest you by stating that I lingered a bit in the rear of the Caravan to-day to try an experiment . JASAMINE ( Interrupting ) I thought -- - RASTUS ( Interrupting ) But you are not to think at all and by interrupting me , you have broken your agreement on the cracker question . JASAMINE I appeal from the decision . RASTUS I 'll give you the crackers if you 'll just keep still . JASAMINE Unconditional surrender . RASTUS To resume : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better place than here on the Continent where the first authoritative school of astronomy had its birth , I refer to the Alexandrian school . If what I learned of a disciple of this school of of astronomy at Cairo , be true , I shall be able to bring about any weather condition I desire which of course will be a great benefit to Kansas . Change day-light to darkness , darkness to moon-light , moon-light to star light and visa versa ( Jas strats to speak ) p. 65 Do n't interrupt please , my first attempt will be to produce total darkness- ( Looks at gun carefully ) JASAMINE ( Making mock address to audience ) Ladies and gentlemen , with the kind permission of the audience , Rastus Johnson will smother the sun . RASTUS ( Walking down stage two or three steps and fondling gun ) I will now bring about a total eclipse . For your benefit , I will explain what an eclipse is . An eclipse is an obstruction of the light of a heavenly body by another , effected either directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly by its interception of the source of light which illuminates the body- ( To Jas ) You understand , do n't you ? JASAMINE ( By expression shows he does n't understand ) Oh ! yes ! RASTUS Very well . Of course this being a total eclipse , will be unlike the eclipse of 1928 and 1967 . JASAMINE ( With emphasis ) When ? JASAMINE ( Calmly ) 1928 and 1967 . In these two , the moon 's shadow will just graze the pole of the earth . JASAMINE In 1928 and 1967 RASTUS In 1928 and 1967 . JASAMINE Excuse me PRoffessor , but ai n't this 1905 ? RASTUS This is A.D. 1905 . JASAMINE ( Looks intently at Ras , then to audience ) p. 66 Decision reserved until the mental responsibility of the defendant has been established . RASTUS That you are skeptical , does not surprise me at all , but as in all cases where sience is conserned , people of your mental calibre , must have an ocular demonstration , and that I shall try to give you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing an unusual humidity --  JASAMINE ( Interrupting ) Further explanation unaccompanied by ocular demonstration will not be tolerated . According to Hoyle , the best proof of the pudding is the eating , so let 's taste . RASTUS ( Raising gun and pointing upward and off stage in L.2.E . ) Stand behind me and observe. - ( Fires gun the report of which must be very light-louder reports to follow off stage about ten seconds later- then the gradual lowering of the lights . When about two thirds down , insert colored medium until total darkness- Ras and Jas stand with back to audience - Ras produces small pocket lamp which he lights ) JASAMINE I 'm awful glad you sprung that light , I ai n't skeered , but Ha ! ha ! ( Without humor ) I-I you know I jes ' naturally when the sun-when the sun - say ai n't there some way you can use the best part of the sun for your experiment and let me have the rest of it ? RASTUS ( Excitedly pointing upward ) p. 67 See ! JASAMINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stars one by one are peeping from the firmament . JASAMINE I wish they would n't be so bashful and come right out , no excuse for peeping when there ai n't nobody to --  RASTUS ( Interrupting ) Ah ! ( Long drawn ) There 's Luna also . JASAMINE ( Inquiringly ) Who 's loony ? RASTUS The moon ( Enthused ) Is n't it beautiful ? JASAMINE ( Pantomines to audience that Ras is crazy and conveys the idea that he ( Jas ) is humoring him by showing great interest - looks intently at the moon and raptuously exclaims ) Lovely- Lovely . ( Pause then ) Say Ras , you ai n't forgot them crackers , have you ? RASTUS Wait a minute ( Fires gun- light report as before , followed about five seconds later by loud report off stage - one of the stars takes on the appearance of a comet - the same to be repeated two or three times - drop must be made transparent and lights worked from behind ) p. 68 Try your gun , but be careful not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said try your gun and I presume you mean for me to alter the appearance of one of the stars and I have selected that Lumminary ( Pointing to star nearest the moon ) next to Luna - so stand back and take note of the experiment . ( Shoots - light report from gun followed immediately by several loud reports off stage - moon increases in size- picture in moon - Bus . &amp; etc . ) RASTUS You 've made a mess of everything , now I 'll be compelled to reverse the present condition . ( Shoots - all lights go out ) JASAMINE ( Excited ) Say Ras , light that light again . ( Ras produces pocket lamp just then chicken crows off stage ) Ras are you going to give me some of them crackers ? RASTUS Here , take all of them ( Gives crackers to Jas - again the chicken crows louder and louder this time ) JASAMINE Rastus Johnson , do you hear that voice calling out in the wilderness ? ( Takes light , picks up stone , leaves stage R.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full up - Bus . catching chicken . Jas returns with chicken ) p. 69 RASTUS You 've got keen ears , Jasamine Jenkins . JASAMINE I 'd a knowed that voice in the middle of the Red Sea , Rastus Johnson . RASTUS Come we 'll depart , Jasmine Jenkins . JASAMINE Lead on , we 'll follow ( Holding up chicken - follow- exit to music )
