For the first time since the foundation of the Republican Party , a House of Representatives has been elected haVing a working majority of one hundred for the party also in control of the Senate and the Presidency . In the Fiifty-second CongresS , 1891-93 , the Democrats had a majority of 140 in the House , but Harrison was President and the Senate was Republican . ln the Fifty-fourth Congress , 1895-97 , the Republicans had a majority of 133 and controlled the Senate , but Cleveland was President . The Fifty-first Congress , which passed the McKinleyact , had a workingmajority of only 7 , while in the Fifty-fifth , which passed the Dingley act , the Republican majority over Demoterats and Populists was 42 . Aside from the weakening of the Opposition ' ? always a regrettable thing in a legislative body it is particularly unfortunate that the minority in the next Congress should be so largely sectional . Northern States wihich are represented by 55 Democrats in the presenc . Congress have elected only 29 to the next . There will be at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , and several more With but one Democrat each . New York loses 6 Democrats , New Jersey 2 , Pennsylvania 3 , Illinois 5 , Indiana 2 ; Ohio 3 , and Missouri 5 . Such strong men as Cowherd of Missouri and Williams of Illinois are among the fallen . Whether the - minority can recover from this blow sufficiently to make next year anything like the effective opposition it did in the last under Mr. John Sharp Williams , is a question-in which men of all ' parties have an interest . Southern comments on Mr Roosevelt 's victory are in the main good-tempered . The Richmond Tones-Dispatch calls attention to the fact that the President did not carry a single Southern State as though this were a rebuke to him , but it had probably not heard from the border States , Maryland , West Virginia , and Missouri , when it wrote It earnestly but vainly hopes that Mr. Roosevelt will now adopt the Southern view of the negro . The Norfolk Landmark freely admits that , but for the Washington dinner and the Crum incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone for Roosevelt . The Columbia State , ordinarily of excellent judgment , thinks it necessary to print " just a word of advice to the negroes of South Carolina . " It notices some evidence of jubilation among them over the election . To this it hasno objection , but it adds significantly that it " would be exceedingly unfortunate if they should conceive the notion that they have captured South Carolina and actaccordingly . " Further ? " It would be well for them to realize that , if trouble is provoked , the negroes will be the chief sufferers , and a dozen Roosevelts can not help them " Compared with these words of menace , the utterances of the Richmond News-Leader are refreshingly frank and sane . " It is possible , " this newspaper concedes , " that some outbreaks and barbarities of which Southern communities have been guilty have contributed to the result . " Now , more than ever , then , is the time for the Southerners to obey the laws and to be " rigidly just in their dealings with the negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but " we Southerners can not hope for the respect , confidence , and good will of the people of our country unless we deserve them by our own conduct . " Secretary Hay gravely remarks that the " baselessness of the attacks upon the President 's Panama policy has now been ' demonstrated . " This shows what a joke it was on the professors of international law when the defenders of the Administration pretended to answer their arguments . That . was simply Marking time till the election came ; and the real way of finding out whether precedent and law and treaty had been violated etas to ' count noses . It was like Pension Commissioner Ware 's appeal on a point of law from the lawyers to the blacksmiths The blacksmiths won by a large majority , and the lawyers naturally felt pretty cheap So must tha ' professors of international law whom Secretary Hay now puts down with the election returns Woolsey and Mac-vane are clearly ' outweighed , as they are outvoted , by Nokes , Stokes , and Boggs . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately side with Aristotle in insi'st'ing that the only verdict which counts in such matters is thiat of the judicious . - He would not really wish the colleges to burn all their books and decide questions of history and law by holding a caucus in a saloon . And no one knows better than the Secretary that the voters ' did not on November 8 pass upon the Panama question  --  or , for that Matter , any other question of ' pure policy . Never was there a campaign in which " argument " went for so little . Roosevelt voters simply looked queer when it was adduced , and said , " Granting all that , we are going to vote for Roosevelt just the same . " Governor-Chairman Odell regards the result in New York State as a personal vindication , and people who are inclined to dispute this view must admit that , at any rate , Odell is now absolute master of the Republican machine . He staked all on the result of the balloting on November 8 , and he won . The Governor-Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has conducted the campaign here with little or no interference from Mr. Cortelyou . He has profited by President Roosevelt 's general personal popularity ; he shares the benefits of a striking victory for which he deserves relatively little credit . His own equity in this estate  --  if we may use such a terra  --  is indicated more accurately by the vote cast for Mr Higgins . Had any one told Mr Odell on November 7 that Higgins would fall 100,000 behind Roosevelt , the State chairman would have confessed that the jig was up with the candidate for Governor Mr Odell 's feverish activity , his stump speeches , in the last days of the fight are sufficient evidence of his apprehensions . And yet Mr. Higgins has the eminently respectable plurality of 75,000- The State was so strong for Roosevelt that 100,000 votes one way or the other was an inconsiderable trifle Tag or no tag , Mr. Odell has elected his ticket and a big majority in the Legislature . He may fairly ask , " Can I not do what I will with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a post mortem He is , in fact , a very lively and good-natured corpse . In crushing defeat he bears himself with the same smiling poise and quiet dignity that marked him throughout the campaign . His wholesome and steady personality made friends for him everywhere , and bore out the epigram of the Republican judge who said that , of course , he was going to vote for Parker , but thought he would not be elected because there would not be time before election for the voters who had seen Roosevelt to see the Judge Aside from this pleasing personal impression , which will go with Mr. Parker into retirement , he will be long remembered as a candidate who stoutly advocated principles , whether men would hear or forbear . He stood for political truths which ought to be popular , if they are not just yet ; and when they come to fruition  --  when the corrupt alliance between the tariff beneficiaries and the Republican party is broken up ; when we recover the Declaration of Independence and apply its principles to the Filipinos ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen sound doctrine before they were ready to receive it , and will be honored accordingly . Gorman 's defeat in Maryland is a genuine cause for rejoicing . It is not to be believed that even if the Democrats - had carried the State his attempt to disfranchise the negroes would have been successful , for it had been denounced by ' the Democratic Governor and many prominent Democrats . But he is a perpetual mischief-maker , a leader who bodes no good to the cause with which he is allied . An avowed protectionist , he belongs in the Republican ranks Unscrupulous as Tillman himself , he has been as ready as chat demagogue to stir up race hatred . He will , of course , remain in the Senate ; but he really ought to be in retirement along with Hill . We may still hope that Addicks will be kept out of the Senate . He is eight votes short of a majority in the Delaware Legislature . The nine Republicans who are against Addicks assert that they would rather see the State unrepresented than misrepresented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nine anti-Addicks Republicans may yet save Sodom . In their present stand , it is to be hoped that they will have the countenance of President Roosevelt . Not to be compelled to receive a man like Addicks officially in the White House should surely be the wish of its occupant . Of course , the arch-co rruptionist will move heaven and earth  --  or hell and earth  --  to compass his election . His contest in the Legislature will be watched by the whole country , and the hope of all honest men will be that Delaware may be spared the disgrace of Addicks , and that this particular bit of rotten wood may not have been swept along triumphantly on the Roosevelt flood . Wisconsin was honored by more preelection speculation , perhaps , than any other State . The riddles propounded since the third ticket was put in ' the field , however , have received very simple answers . Gov . La Follette has run 90,000 votes behind President Roosevelt , but it-is plain that the prominence of the men participating in the bolting movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , the figures show clearly the indifference of the average Democrat this year to the fate of the national ticket . Every one agrees that a large part of La Follette 's following is made up of " fair-minded Democrats , " who would naturally be supposed to favor Parker . Yet , apparently , the national ticket interested them so little that they were unwilling to go even to the small trouble of marking a split ballot to help it out . In Milwaukee County the Socialist vote even ran ahead of the Democratic . La Follette plainly has secured the allegiance of a great part of the Wisconsin Democrats . The Stalwart faction did not , of Course , vote for its own candidate , and it is probably immaterial as regards the future whether or not it keeps up its separate organization . The adoption of the new primary law , in any case , makes a contesting convention a thing of the past , so far as Wisconsin is concerned . John A. Johnson , the successful Democratic candidate for Governor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his youth was spent in the most abject poverty . Some ten days before the election , a campaign circular was sent broadcast stating that Johnson 's father . had died in the poorhouse and that his mother had taken in washing . The press of the State at once investigated the truth of this story . It appeared that the candidate 's father had been a town loafer . The son had left school when ten years old to help support the family , and his mother had , it was true , taken in washing , but the father was put , by well-wishers of the family , where he would no longer be an incumbrance to it . The story of the boy 's self-reliance and his success under so heavy a handicap not only destroyed the effect of the Republican slurs , but created such a revulsion of feeling in his favor as has never been seen in this country . In a State whose total vote is probably not more than 325,000 , Johnson ran something like 140,000 ahead of the Presidential candidate of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about by less than 15 per cent , of the voters splitting their tickets . in Minnesota , the incomplete returns indicate that nearly 23 per cent . marked their ballots for Roosevelt and Johnson  --  an exhibition of independent voting probably without a parallel . In an election the most encouraging feature of which . was its demonstration of the willingness of great bodies of voters to look farther than the party label , some of The faults of the ballot laws now in force also stand out strikingly . Maryland 's electoral vote , for instance , will be divided . Why ? Not because any voter in the State wanted seven of its votes to be cast for Parker and one for Roosevelt , but because , through ignorance and carelessness in marking ballots , the elector whose name came first on the Republican side ran ahead of the man at the tail of the Democratic column . The " will of the people " was that eiteer Parker or Roosevelt should receive the undivided vote of the State . There are some voters , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lists and vote against an elector on their own side whom they consider unfit . Thus , a single Cleveland elector was once chosenin Ohio because Republicans " scratched " an unpopular candidate of their own party . But the Maryland split means absolutely nothing . In this case it has no effect on the result , but if the close vote of 1876 should ever be repeated , a similar blunder might swing the casting vote In this State the defeated candidate for Governor- made ballot reform one of the issues of his campaign , and it is a subject which his successful op ponent may take up to advantage . Higgins 's majority was swollen without doubt , by our law , which puts a premium on straight-ticket voting . The Massachusetts plan removes this drawback , not by making it easy to vote a split ticket , but by making it hard to vote a straight one . Voting machines , which reduce to a minimum the - mechanical difficulty of voting any sort or ticket and eliminate the spoiled ballot , were used this year more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , and there seems to have been no serious complaint of their working . After a campaign remarkable for its thoroughness , it appears that the Constitutional amendment designed to give Chicago a new charter has been adopted in Illinois . That city had ? o far outgrown the system under which it was governed that the cartoon showing a strapping twenty-year-old girl dressed in a tattered , inadequate pinafore was an accurate description of the state of the municipal wardrobe But , in order to get a new dress , the city was compelled to appeal to the State and secure the approval df the majority of all the voters who cast ballots for Presidential electors . New Yorkers are familiar with the general indifference of the country electorate towards the affairs considered vital to great cities ; in Illinois , the " down-Staters " were appealed to in the course of the campaign ' by thousands of workers , and an " educational " bureau , backed by every organization of importance in Chicago , sent out millions of circulars What has been won , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago itself , through a referendum provision , the proposal to consolidate some twelve taxing bodies now holding the levying power into one , to create a uniform system of municipal ' courts , to raise the debt limit , basing it upon the real value of taxable ' property instead of upon the appraised , and to wipe out completely the anomalous old township governments that have survived from the time when Chicago was but a small prairie village . It is a significant commentary on the awkwardness of strict State control over municipal government that Chicago has had to wait so long to be rescued from her plight . Election being over , there is no reason now why the Smoot case should not be pushed to a conclusion on reasonably non-pra.rtisan lines . Bitt the abandonment of the trip of the Senate subcommittee to Utah does seem unfortunate , since the Mormon question in politics is still to be Investigated The Smoot proceedings , as a great many people seem never to realize , are not in any sense a repetition of the Roberts ease of five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he on grounds which would apply equally to any high officer of his Church . The proof of Brigham Roberts 's unfitness , according to American standards , to sit In the national legislature was simple enough : he had more than one wife Smoot is a monogamist , of eXcellent personal reputation , and well thought of by his associates . The whole question TS , " How far does his Church control him9 " If the question is to be answered in a way that will conyduce the public , an immense amount of testimony , all indirect , must be sifted . It seems to be just the sort of question which ought to ' be investigated on the spot , and not in a city something like 2,000 miles away . In the - matter of expense alone it would seem that inquiry at Salt Lake was almost Obligatory . The New York Presbytery on Monday voted almost unanimously not to units with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of the South , and the New Brunswick Presbytery defeated the proposal by a vote of 40 to 2 These decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation of the Presbyterian General Assembly last June . It is to the credit of the Church that there are influential men in it who will not consent to a union which would draw the color line , and force negro Presbyterians into separate negro presbyteries If there is one place where color prejudice is absolutely out of place , it is in churches erected to the glory of Him who hath made of one blood all nations of men . The attitude of some Southern churches in denying entrance to colored people , in refusing to allow them even to be married or buried by white ministers , must ever be a serious shock to those who still believe that all men stand upon one footing in the eyes of the Christian Church . Reballo Ling in the Italian general elections has confirmed the Socialist defeat In many constituencies Conservatives and Clericals united against the Ferri candidates . Most significantly , at Rome members of the Papal party , and even priests , were encouraged to vote against Ferri himself , who conducted a multiple candidacy , winning in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Milan all repudiated members prominently associated with the recent , strike or otherwise connected with the Extreme Left . The general participation of Roman Catholics in the election makes it probable that a formal reconciliation between the Court and the Curia is among the possibilities . Indeed , the Holy See can not afford to let the non expecht lapse by default . The occasion is opportune for a settlement The Government needs Clerical votes ; the Holy See needs the allowance which the Government has regularly put aside But on the part of the Curia the opportunity may be brief. - After Roman Catholics have become identified with the various political groups , or else have formed a solid Opposition , the Government may have lost either the motive or the mood to compose the quarrel . Meanwhile , though Giolitti has , technically triumphed , the sources of his new majority are not apparent , nor can they be until the new President of the Chamber is elected With due ceremony was celebrated in Paris on October 30 the hundredth year since the adoption of the Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , was implied in the discourse at the Sorbonne of the Minister of Justice . M. Valle traced the growth of the unifying process in the laws and jurisdictions of France back to an early day , and showed how Chancellor after Chancellor and report after report had led up to the work of the Convention . To call it Bonaparte 's would be as erroneous as was Mr. Gladstone 's description of the American Constitution as wholly a product of the men who wrought over the old material at Philadelphia . The Minister of Justice admitted that Napoleon ordered the jurieconsults about their work as if they were so many corps commanders under him , and that his personal views were stamped upon the articles relating to marriage and to foreigners , but he concluded ? " Despite these personal creations of Bonaparte , which have been , moreover , largely effaced by subsequent legislation , the Code of 1804 was declared , and appeared to the world to be , the legal consequence of the French Revolution . " The President of the Court of Cassation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges in enlarging the Code under the guise of enforcing it . He referred to the " free ' interpretation " and " complementary decisions " which had changed certain parts of the Code into something to - make its original framers stare and gasp Ingeniously stating the point of view of a judge given the task of finding warrant for new practices in old prescriptions , Presiding Judge Dallat-Beaupre said that the judicial interpreter " ought not obetinately to inquire what was , a hundred years ago , the thought of the authors of the Code , but to ask how they would have drafted a disputed article if they had it 1 o do today , since both justice and reason required that the text ought to be liberally and humanely adapted to the exigencies of modern life . " Another professor has shown that he is not fit for practical statesmanship . This time it is the eminent Austrian economist , Professor Boehm-Bawerk . He has just been forced to retire trom the Koerber Cabinet , in which he held the portfolio of Minister of Finance What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulged in financial whimsies ? No , the infatuated man had made the capital mistake of trying to economize . This was bad enough , and showed that the professor was dwelling among the dust and cobwebs of an exploded theory of government finance ; but when we add that he proposed to effect his economies in the expenditures for the army and navy , we need look no further for the cause of his fall . The Admiralty said , of course , that it could not take a crown less , and naturally Boehm-Bawerk had to go back to hie lectures . His financial theory is admired throughout the world , but applied finance  --  especially the application of the obsolete doctrine of economy  --  was not for the likes of him Terms of the new Japanese loan , as announced from London last week , do not suggest progressive impairment of the country 's credit . The loan of last April was made specifically a first lien on the Japanese customs revenue . At the time , Japan was criticised for pledging the whole of that revenue when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it was generally thought that the next loan would have to be guaranteed-by some other security . But the new loan , though for a larger sum than that of April , is to be secured merely by a subordinate lien on the same customs revenue . Furthermore , it is to be offered to the public at 90% in London , as against 93% asked for the loan of April . When the magnitude of the loan ? $60,000,000 ? is considered , and the fact that its ultimate security is inferior to that enjoyed by its predecessor , it must be said that the price at which the bankers take the loan is pretty good testimany to their faith in the Japanese Government 's credit . Even Great Britain , whose consols issue of 1901 was sold at 94% , had to reduce the price to 92% in the loan of 1902 . It is true that the 6 per cent . interest rate and the special lien on revenue have all along made Japan 's Aid for foreign capital unusually tempting . It has cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it costs Russia But it can hardly be said , in the light of the latest announcement , that Japanese credit is declining .
