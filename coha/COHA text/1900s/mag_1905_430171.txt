 | The South needs white labor , but does the South want the immigrant ? This is a question which is agitating business men throughout the Southern States . The negro population has proved unequal to the task of furnishing an increasing supply of efficient labor , and the negro must be supplemented ? perhaps to some extent supplanted ? by the white man . But is the immigrant of today the kind of white man whom the South stands ready to welcome ? Irish , Germans , Swedes , and Norwegians , no matter how poor , have always been welcome . They once formed the bulk of our immigrants . In their place are now coming Austro-Hungarians , Poles , Italians , and Russian Jews . These people were only one per cent . of the immigrants in 1869 . In 1902 , they constituted 70 per cent . of the total . The Italians , mainly from Southern Italy and Sicily , come in the largest numbers , some 200,000 yearly . Our liberal immigration laws have been severely criticised . The immigrants are illiterate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said that " they are beaten men from beaten races , representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence , " degraded , criminal , quiescent , lacking initiative and responsibility , or the capacity for taking advantage of new opportunities ; these immigrants have a low standard of living , which they are not inclined to improve if they prosper ; and they are likely in a few years to fill our almshouses , insane asylums , and hospitals . Furthermore , the influx of large numbers of unskilled laborers intensifies the struggle for existence among the laboring class , the more so because these new people do not seek the farms , but crowd into the large cities , complicating the problems that confront municipal administrators . The South should most carefully consider this problem of immigration . From no other source can the Southern States obtain their labor which they need ; and yet , with the negro already on the land , to bring in the Italian and the Slav may greatly add to social and economic difficulties , now almost insurmountable .  | This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an agricultural laborer , and to reach a conclusion as to his adaptability for Southern needs . To the ordinary American the Italian is a dirty , undersized individual , who engages in degrading labor shunned by Americans , and who is often a member of the Mafia , and as such likely at any moment to draw a knife and stab you in the back . The newspapers are to blame for this impression . They are quick to publish sensational tales of disorder , strikes and murders , but overlook the significant facts that show progress among these newcomers . Only recently have articles been written showing an appreciation of this frugal , moral and industrious people . Hitherto , in America , the Italian immigrant has settled in the city , and here he has not had a fair chance to show what good was in him . Essentially a country dweller , life in New York and Chicago too often worked upon him for evil . Several reasons may be advanced in explanation of this tendency to settle in the city . While nearly all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on isolated farms , but are crowded together in closely-built villages , going to work every day on their little farms in the surrounding country . They are a gregarious people , and this characteristic , added to their ignorance of English , causes them on landing in the United States to seek their own people . They know nothing of our farms , and their long years of painful effort , when the taxes were so heavy that after paying them they had scarcely anything left , make them think farming is unprofitable . They wish to find remunerative labor , but as they are unskilled workmen , they are obliged to go to work on the railroad , on construction of large buildings , about mines , as street sweepers , and in factories . Because of this tendency Americans have failed to recognize that these apparently unskilled laborers are really skillful farmers of the kind needed in many parts of the country . This may be shown by the success of Italians who have been settled in Southern New jersey for the past thirty-five years , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two types of settlements in Southern New Jersey , Vineland and its vicinity , founded by Signor Secchi di Casale , to which the Italians came under leadership ; and Hammonton ,  | which is of special interest because of its natural , unorganized development . In both cases the Italians have become successful farmers and good citizens . For many years the pine barrens of New Jersey were considered worthless . Within the last twenty-five years , however , there has been a growing appreciation of the real value of the sandy soil , which requires a fertilizer , moisture , and above all , thorough cultivation . When properly treated , it produces excellent crops of fruits and vegetables , sweet potatoes being a specialty . This land could not compete with the productive West in growing heavy crops , but the healthful climate attracted New Yorkers and New Englanders who disliked long , cold winters , or who had contracted lung or throat diseases . Land was cheap , but it was hard work to clear it , for it had to be grubbed out . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thick undergrowth . There were also swamps to drain . A cheap labor force was required , and it was here that the first Italians who came to Hammonton became of value . When many acres of land were planted in berries , pickers were needed . Italians who are used to gathering olives are admirable berry-pickers . Accordingly it became customary to bring Italian families from Philadelphia for the berry season . A few Italians came to Hammonton before 1865 , but it was not until after the war when the demand for fresh fruit and vegetables arose , that the possibilities of New Jersey soil became apparent , and a direct immigration began . Among the first to come had been a Charles Campanellafrom a small town in north eastern Sicily , near Messina : Mr. Campanella first brought over his brother , and , as the two prospered , they were followed by relatives and friends , until now more than half the inhabitants of that town are in the United States , and other Italians from the rural districts about Naples have been the forerunners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pickers also have been pleased with the country life and the opportunity to buy cheap land and have settled here . The main object of the Italian is always to make a home . If he comes without his family , he finds work at the neighboring brick yard , on the railroad or on a farm , and saves until he has enough to buy land . When he has his family with him , they may live in one room in the house of another  | Italian , until they save enough for a home . If the land is wild land , the Italian takes his leisure time to clear it . When the land is finally placed under cultivation , he asks one of the building and loan associations for a loan , which is usually enough to build a house . He gradually pays off the debt , and often buys new land in this way . Italians have bought out many of the old settlers since 1880 . The sons of the farmers went west or to the cities , and the older generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newcomers . On the small farms the work is frequently done by the women and children , while the father continues his work at the brick yard or at the factories , or on the railroad . In most cases the Italian farmer , in addition to managing his own place , plows and clears land for American farmers , and works at odd jobs during the winter to increase the family income . Frequently the whole family goes as berry pickers to the better strawberry region further south , as well as for later crops in Hammonton . Cranberry picking is considered so remunerative that well-to-do Italians leave their farms to earn $75 for a good season . The average holding of Italians is 14.6 acres . The principal selling crop is berries with sometimes sweet and white potatoes , tomatoes , peaches , and pears . Grapes are extensively grown for their own use , but the sour wine made from them is occasionally sold in Philadelphia . The Italian works the New Jersey soil with great success . His careful hoeing and fertilizing , his continuous patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make it possible for him to derive a comfortable living where an American would starve . The Italians have added materially to the wealth of this community . They have brought much valuable land into cultivation , and they have maintained good farms . In 1903 , 237 Italians were assessed on $130,415 , 15 per cent of the total real estate of the towns . The houses built by the Italians are plain , but substantial . The assessment on personal property is $9,000 out of $89,525 . The Italian savings are valuable assets of the local bank am the building and loan associations , thus adding to the available capital of the community . In the Peoples ' Bank , $56,614 or 21.7 per cent is owed to the Italians , while $26,231 or 29.5 per cent  | is deposited by them in the savings department . In one building and loan association 129 out of 553 shares , averaging 51/z shares to a holding , are owned by Italians , while in the other association , 79 out of 460 stockholders or 17 per cent are Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment are strong and well grown . They have the advantage of good schools where they come in contact with American children They speak excellent English , for many of them learn English at school , instead of on the streets , as in the cities where they learn slang and the broken speech of other foreigners . The children obtain American ideas , and as they grow older , they improve in appearance and intelligence . When they go to homes of their own , marked improvements in the manner of living are noticeable . Those who remain in Hammonton identify themselves with the interests of the community . Many parts of the South are still covered with pine forests , similar to those in New Jersey . Before settlements are made , the roots and underbrush must be grubbed , and the swamps drained . The climate of the South is less rigorous than that of New Jersey , and is better suited to immigrants from Southern Europe . The products are much the same . The negroes of the South have paid little attention to home gardens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the fruit and vegetables that might be so easily grown . Wherever Italian farmers have settled , their gardens are always models . They have introduced some of their own vegetables to Americans , and they adopt American plants , for instance , asparagus , celery and rhubarb . Several thousand Italian farmers are already located in the South . In Louisiana they are used in the sugar cane region with success ; while , in a recent number of the SOUTH ATLANTIC QUARTERLY , Mr. Stone gives an interesting description of their value in the cotton regions . There are strawberry growers in Independence , La. , farmers about Greenville , Miss. , truck farmers near Memphis , and many Texan cities , and vine growers about Mobile . Critics of the negro accuse the race of indolence , intemperance , immorality and lack of thrift . The Italians have the corresponding virtues . They are hard , patient workers , willing to do any kind of work , and to do it thoroughly . Although they consume large quantities of their sour wine , they are not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies in large cities , show that lack of work , ill health and general misfortune rather than drink or vice cause Italians to ask for aid . They are an essentially moral people , possessing the domestic virtues to a high degree . The women are invariably chaste . The lapses of the men are most often due to separation from their families . While a few criminal Italians come to this country , they would never be induced to go to country districts . Violence among Italians is largely the result of overcrowding and the close competition of city life . Italians never harm Americans . They have a great respect for the law which in this country tends to modify their primitive methods of ending disputes . Hammonton is free from crime , and from the fear of crime . Italians never burglarize houses , even when known to be empty . Americans are never afraid to meet them alone , day or night . Above all , the Italians are a very thrifty people . They can save money on the meagre wages of unskilled labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The negro tenant farmer will borrow up to the limit , mortgaging his future . The Italian has only the barest necessities advanced to him . To be sure his standard of living is low , but it is adapted to his means , and it permits the accumulation of property . While the first generation makes no change in its manner of living , the second and third adopt American ways and increase their expenditures. but this is made possible by the previous savings of their parents . Italians become enthusiastic Americans . No nationality , when once it breaks its ties to the home land , is more anxious to adopt American ways . The children do not care to speak Italian . They demand the freedom of American children ; they adopt their dress . their ideas , and their ambitions . Granted that the Southern Italian will prove an acquisition to the South , how are these immigrants to be obtained ? They are very poor , too poor to pay extra railroad fares . In New York , they find friends and work . To go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but shelter and $100 or more per family to tide them over until a crop can be raised . The founding of colonies , such as Sunnyside which only failed because of Mr. Carbori 's death ? demands a large outlay . Mr. Martio Valeria , of Chicago , founded two colonies , at Daphne and Lamberth , with families already used to our city life . This  | page deleted
