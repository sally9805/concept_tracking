txt Tweny-4hree judges of the Municipal court yesterday heard the case against their associate , Cleland . the " patole " jurist . The statement of the case was embodied in a ' report prepared by an investigating corn-mate of three ; and after it had been read twenty other judges joined in. condemning Judge Cleland for at least six varieties of illegal nractIce on the Not one of all the judges present at the meeting went to Cleland 's aid . His own defense was half hearted . It was prepared be : . fore he knew the contents of the investigating committee 's report ; and when he had heard that lengthy document read , he had no further statements to make . Instead of entering a denial in response to the verbal queries fired at him by a dozen judges , he admitted the charges against him or evaded the questions . The doom of his " parole system " was sounded with the reading of the report , and the end of It was brought in sight when Chief Justice Olson ordered him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the civil branches of the court next Tuesday morning . Less than two hours later saw the closing chapter of his " system " at the Shakspeare avenue court . The eighty paroled defendants whom he has had reporting to him at evening sessions every two weeks , appeared before him to " report . " and as each made Hs usual assertion of good conduct , his case was dismissed Cleland in Defiant Mood . Judge Cleland took the announcement of his prospective transfer defiantly . He declared he would " . continue to be the only judge " of the branch over which he presides . It was the impeachment  --  for that was what it amounted to  --  that hurt him . Chief Justice Olson told him candidly that he would not " believe him in this matter or any other important matter . " His states meats repeatedly were declared " false . " " The court 's quarrel with you , " said the chief justice , addressing Judge Cleland , " Le not that you may have shown kindness to the , prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by every judge of Blip court . The court 's quarrel with you is that you have usurped rights of citizenship that are as old as the Magna chaste . You have overridden the rights of the pool ' and the ignorant , who knew nothing of a writ of habeas corpus or an appeal to the Suprenio court . " Other judges challenged Cleland to stand before the people and confess himself ignorant of the principles of the law he had , violated , and the chief justice declared that the jurist under fire acknowledged the danger from the upper courts when , as he once did , he said he would dismiss the case against a paroled prisoner in order to keep an appeal or an application for a writ of habeas corpus from being heard . Accused by Fellow Judges . What the Investigating committee , composed of Judges Blake , Eberhardt , and Foster , considered Judge Cleland 's " more serious violations of the law " were the following : " ** has made a general practice of ? suspending sentence in cases of those found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner which we think Is not only unauthorized by the constitution and laws of this state , but has already been condemned by our Supreme court . " ** has continued many cases in- ? definitely and in such a manner as to lose , in our opinion , all jurisdiction over the defendants . The sentences and orders subsequently entered by him were , we believe , void , and the fines and terms of imprisonment inflicted in pursuance. thereof unlawful under the decisions of our Supreme court . " 3 . He has , before any finding of guilt or sentence , Imprisoned thirty-seven persons in the county jail , all ' without ball ' ? which amounts , in our opinion and according to judicial usage , to a denial of all bail  --  for periods varying from one day to one month , In violation , as we think , of the constitution of this state guaranteeing to every citizen accused of crime the right to give bail In all cases except when accused of a capital offense , and even then , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the police station without bail , and has in numerous other cases exacted excessive and oppressive bail . ' " 4 . He has in the first instance tried defendants and found them ' not guilty ' and at subsequent dates has changed this finding and found them ' guilty ' on the same charge and In the same case . He has done this even in state cases , in violation , as we think , of the constitution forbidding the placing of any person in jeopardy twice for the same offense. " 5 . He has upon trial found defendants guilty , and at subsequent dates has sentenced them a second ( and in ' some cases a third ) time , and to pay even heavier fines for the same offense , and actually imprisoned some defendants for two or three separate periods on the same complaint and in the same case . " 6 . He has , as it appears to the committee assumed , In addition to the judicial powers , the power of the legislature to make new laws and the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to commute the sentences of those guilty of violating the law . " Motive of the Investigation . The motive of the investigation was set forth thus in the first paragraph of the re-port : " When a member of this court adopts a Judicial ' system ' which he applies wholesale to cases coming before him and proclaims It to the world as ? The New Gospel of CrImibology , ' his associates on the bench may , we think , properly inquire as to its legality , so that , if legal and desirable , it may be adopted by his associates , and if found to be illegal , the practice may be condemned , act the chief justice , who is charged with Certain duties in the assignment Of . lld gee . Meg be fully advised In the performance of such duties . " It was stated that two Invitations had been extended to Judge Cleland to be present at the committee meetings , but these he failed , to accept A statement also was made that the report was based on the records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Were attached , as an appendix , showing the " Wholesale " nature of his abuse of the law . The committee expressed itself in favor of an adult probation law , but sated two dee eledons of the Supreme court shtaving that no eenstruction having such an effect could be Pieced on any section of the Illinois statutes . Series of Facts Set Perth . In reviewing the evidence against Judge Cleland . the report set up among other things the following facts : He " paroled " 1,100 or more persons while at Maxwell street . Ho " paroled " about eighty persons at Shakespeare avenue . He imposed fines of $200 on persons charged with disorderly conduct , and later discharged them . He Imposed fines of g100 on 504 persons ? charged with disorderly conduct , and later discharged them . He assumed jurisdiction In cases after be had lost it by letting the prisoners go " indefinitely . " He encroached upon the prerogatives of the governor when he modified and vacated sentences imposed . ? He heard and tried cases in which his - Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grand jury or release . After running through these Instances of Misconduct and Illustrating them with the reoords of specific cases , the committee took up some of the " particular phases involving more serious violations of the rights of individuals as guaranteed by the constitution and the laws of the state . " Illegal Imprisonments Alleged . The chief of those was Judge Cleland 's commitment  --  without any finding guilty and without any sentence  --  of thirty-four men and three women to the county jail for periods varying from one day to one month . On the record in his court in nearly all these cases and on the mittimus sent with the prisoner the words " without bail " are written In . In addition the records show that he held much in the same way In the police stations where his court was located thirty men and two women for periods of a few days . These defendants were sometimes subsequently discharged on motion to vacate the judgment and they were sometimes found in the first instance not guilty . " The record in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that the defendants were in fact innocent . Take , for Instance , the case of Hulda Schmidt , who was charged with disorderly conduct . On May 10 , 1007 , her case was postponed without any finding as to her guilt or innocence to June 11 " without ball , " and she was committed to the county jail under a mittimus containing the same words . There she was confined a month , and upon being brought back to court on June 11 was on that day found not guilty and discharged . " Two Tines for Same Offense . The committee then called the attention of the meeting to the occurrences in which prisoners had been fined twice for the same offense . There were twenty-three of these cases , and there were at least two in which the defendants were fired three times for the same offense . " Even in state cases , " the report ran . " where the constitutional provision forbidding the placing of a defendant in jeopardy a second times applies . Judge Cleland found defendants not guilty and afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another " abuse of judicial discretion " recorded was the jurist 's requirement of excessive hail for minor offenders before trial . The instance of a man charged with disorderly conduct . punishable. by a fire of not more than $200 , whose bail was fixed at 810. - 000 , in default of which he was imprisoned three days . at the end of which the ball was reduced to $200 , and . the prisoner released on his awn recognizance. was cited . Several others of the same sort were mentioned . Two instances of " unique records " were quoted . One was that showing the binding of a man to the grand jury without complaint or warrant . and the other was one showing that the prisoner was fined because " he had been drinking . " The confirmation that this charge was considered an allegation of crime was found in the form of caplas ' used for paroled prisoners . These read that the defendant was arrested " for the crime of violation of parole . " Cleland 's Excuses Are Refuted . After Judge Gemmill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleland read a written statement he had prepared before the meeting . It sounded more like a cry of defiance than a defense , and it brought two speedy replies . The first was from members of the committee , who denied that they had held secret sessions , and read letters proving that Judge Cleland had been Invited to two meetings , The other was a contradiction from Chief Justice Olson that he had approved at any time of the methods followed by Judge Cleland . , " That statement , like many others Judge Cleland has made , Is false , " declared the presiding justice . He then read a number of letters , the first of which was dated June . 1007 , which he had written to Judge Cleland calling his attention to the result of a motion to vacate judgment . Another declared his postal card report scheme illegal . and warned the jurist against sending defendants to the county jail on charges of disorderly conduct . At another time , when he warned Judge Cleland of the attitude that would be-taken by the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice Olson said the jurist told him he would discharge a defendant if an appeal or habeas corpus proceedings were instituted . " Unless this court interferes with your methods hot " are these poor people to be protected ? " was one of the forcible utterances of the chief Justice . Statement of Judge Cleland . When asked by Chief Justice Olson if he had any statement to make Judge Cleland re-plied : " 1 have received no notice to the effect that any complaint has been made against one or that I was to be put on trial by , the other judges of this court . " I have been elected to this office by the people of this city , and my rights and duties are plainly net out in the laws of this state . The law also plainly specifies the powers of the other Judges of this court to be no greater or less , than my own . No judge nor committee of judges has any power whatever to pass upon my ' legality , validity , and conduct , ' as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attempt to do so is more foolish than ridiculous . Will Appeal to the Public . " The members of this committee have held Secret sessions to which I have not been invited except at times when to he present I would have been compelled to neglect my duties . and if I find it necessary or advisable to reply to these charges It will be in no ' star chamber ' session of a committee , but at a time and place where the public , which Is entitled to be present , will be invited . " It is well known that what I have been doing has been done and is being done every day by every other judge of this court . " It is also well known that my methods had the express and public approval of the . chief justice until a month ago , when , for some reason unknown to me , he attacked them publicly , in an undignified way . Talks of Threat to Transfer . am well aware that the chief purpose of this report is to furnish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clvil ' branch , which he has several times publicly threatened to do , but apparently has not ' wished to accept the responsibility of doing . " It will probably be difficult for the public to appreclite the reasonableness of this , Inasmuch as all the orders complained of are from one to two years old and with a full knowledge of this , the chief justice assigned me to the trial of criminal cases after I had statedlo him that I would continue the same methods which had proven so successful at Maxwell street court . " I am perfectly willing now , as I have always been , to take my assignment , but I will continue to be In the future as In the past , the only judge of the branch court over which I preside . "
