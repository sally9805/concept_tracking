I WAS eleven years old when my education , then a slender enough little plant , I sin sure , was transplanted from American to French soil . Such a transplanting may seem to you of no great consequence , but , I assure you , to me it was a matter of great importance . " But , mother , shall I have to study everything in French 2 " " Yes . " " But I do not know any French , ? not any at all . " " But you will learn it very quickly . " This seemed to me absurd optimism on a gloomy subject . I had studied German a little ? and disliked it . My sisters had studied French under a French governess ; but I , being the youngest , had been let off from studying it , and I knew literally nothing of French , save one song , Frere Jacques . I came of a people who loved languages , and I was expected to inherit the taste . I knew that one of my grandfathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? when he was engaged , had written his love-letters to my grandmother in Italian , for the pure pleasure of it ; and she , for the same reason , had written her replies in the same dulcet language . That used to seem to me romantic . I was sorry enough now that they had ever done it . My mother would have comforted me . " In my old home , " she said , " my father and mother always spoke French together . It was that more than anything else which helped me to learn quickly . I was always so eager to know what they were talking about . It will be quite the same with you . You will hear all thelittle French children talking , and you will wish to know what they are saying . " She finished with a French sentence containing , no doubt , an encouraging sentiment ; but , like a flash of heat-lightning , only leaving things darker than before . But no sooner had we arrived in Paris than the gloomy dread concerning my French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went at different times to two different schools in Paris , but it was the school of Mademoiselle Mallet which was , I think , the most characteristic , and which I remember best . It was no school at all in the ordinary sense of the term . There was certainly no air of a school about it . There was not a desk anywhere , nor , if I remember rightly , a blackboard . There was Mademoiselle Mallet herself , a woman whose smile I remember as one of the most delightful things in Paris . Oh , it was well worth winning , that smile , and easy to win . If you pronounced a word correctly you were rewarded with a smile . If you looked up suddenly from your studious book and caught her eye , you were rewarded with a smile . If your eyes were dreaming out of the window and your glance wandered back and found that she had caught you dreaming , you were rewarded with a smile . It was very charming . Yet she was serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; none . What Mademoiselle gave her pupils , more , I should say , than anything else , was respect . This , I believe , was the keynote in her education of them . I used to sit in perfect despair sometimes , looking at my book , the tears rolling silently down my cheeks . It used to seem to me I should never , never learn the impossible language . English was not forbidden , it was simply not understood , which was worse . Neither Mademoiselle herself nor the pupils knew a word of it . But even in these worst moments Mademoiselle never petted me . I was also never once rebuked for my tears , nor told that it was babyish or unbrave of me to cry . I was treated like a little person . I have always liked the term " little people . " The French have a way of treating children like " little people , " little persons . I do not remember in all my French school days once being patronized or talked down to . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my few years of school in America I had often been treated very much as a child , and often as an unequal . The teachers in America seemed always to be descending to my child-world and then returning ? upstairs as it were ? to their own world , and closing the door after them . Here there was nothing of the sort . I was always expected , it would seem , to go into the grown-people 's world when I chose . We lived on the same floor , on the same level . If I chose to stay out in the garden of my childhood , playing with little people of my own age , well and good ; the grown people wanted me to enjoy that , too ; but the doors of their friendship , and the comfortable cool rooms of their companionship and understanding and approval , always stood open . I make a point of this because I should not be surprised if this were the most really important , the most really educational point in my whole French training . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom I was thrown . They , too , were " little people , " and little people of no small importance . There were perhaps ten or twelve little girls altogether , but only two destined to remain clear , portrait-like in my memory : Genevieve Martin and Wanda Galezowski . Genevieve was French , Parisian to the tips of her slender little fingers . Wanda was the ( laughter of a Polish , now famous , oculist , even then oculist to the Czar , I believe . I loved these little girls very much . I loved their very names . I do not mean that Galezowski or Martin thrilled me at all ; but Genevieve , pronounced in the soft French fashion , how lovely it was ! And Wanda , ? what a story-book name ! I had known only one Wanda . and she was a princess in a fairy tale . There was a little boy , too , ? Ernest , ? a little lad not more than six years old , I should say , and the pet of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black alpaca blouse every morning , always smiling over the task , for Ernest , silent or talkative , quiet or restless , was always amusing , and Mademoiselle had a sense of humor . Whenever a visitor or any of the parents came to the school , Ernest was always called on to exhibit his learning . " Voyons , Ernest , " Mademoiselle would say , always with a smile and a glance toward me , as if to say , " This question is for your benefit , too , my dear : " " Qui est-ce qui a &convert; l'Amerique 2 " ? And Ernest would beam and say , delighted with his own erudition , ? " Christophe Colombe ! **31;245;TOOLONG . " " Christophe Colombe ! " any one could understand that to be our own Christopher Columbus , and it gave readily enough the key to Mademoiselle 's question ; but it took many a repetition of this exhibition of noble learning on the part of Ernest for me finally to discover that the other words which he rattled off at awful speed meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasure , perhaps because it was by Christopher Columbus 's own method that I finally learned French . I discovered ! it , and that , I believe , is by all odds the most sound of educational methods ? the method of discovery . Nothing was hurried , nothing pressed on me , unduly . It was never explained to me , nor insisted on , that " **32;311;TOOLONG " meant **31;345;TOOLONG ; That it was in that year that Christopher Columbus made his memorable discovery . I sailed many days without so much as a glimpse of land on that subject , though I always knew that sometime that dark saying would be clear to me. .1nd then , one day , along the low horizon of my childish understanding , there it lay , like new land . Of course ! Quatorze cent-quatrc-vingt-donne meant **30;378;TOOLONG ! Of courseI And the discovery and the land as well were my own , my very own . II In American schools as I had known them , I had acquired a vast conception of my own ignorance and my teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flexible people I soon gained a great idea of my own ignorance , to be sure , but not from any insistence laid on the matter by the manner of my teachers . On the contrary , I was treated as though I were nearly as well informed as they . It would be difficult to give you an ade ( mato idea of the friendliness , the camaraderie , the respect , the courtesy of it all . But though courtesy and respect were fundamental , important factors in my French school days , they were by no means the only ones . Next to them in importance , I think I should place the spirit of reverence which I there learned . I noticed it first in the streets of Paris . One day I saw that the doors of the great church of the Madeleine were draped with heavy black pall-like draperies , bizarre enough , such as are commonly used in France over the doorways of the churches or private houses where there is a death or where a funeral is to take place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slower pace , and raised their hats , remaining uncovered as they went past . Or if it chanced to be laboring men or gentlemen passing by , even on the other side of the street , they too all raised their hats in silent respect as they went past the house of the dead . This impressed me a good deal . There was reverence and fellowship too in the simple tribute . Had I been a boy my own cap would have come off . But to go back to the school . Reverence was learned there , too , and more particularly , reverence coupled with enthusiasm . As an instance : I had heard of Joan of Arc all my days , of course , but you must not suppose that the Joan I had always heard of was like the Joan I now learned to know . The Joan I had learned of was an enthusiastic girl who had gone , in full armor , at the head of an army , and fought as bravely as a man ; but the Joan I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was told about by Mademoiselle Mallet herself ? well , she might have been a dear and personal friend of Mademoiselle 's , so cherished , so beloved , so reverenced , so talked of from the heart was she . Mademoiselle described her to inc as accurately as one would describe one 's best friend : not too tall ; pale , with eyes of blue ; her hands thin and spiritual ; a broad clear brow ; eyes that looked always to be seeing visions . I learned about her home-life ; such heart-seeking , little intimate anecdotes about her : of how she loved her father , who did not well understand her ; and one story of a lamb , forgotten of the fold one night ; and Joan waking in the darkness , St. Michael 's voice having roused her . " Is it France that needs me now ? " and Joan rose kneeling in bed , awed and ready . " No , my good little Joan . Non , ma bonne petite Jeanne I not yet ! Only a little lamb forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good St. Michael went out across the snow together and sought and sought . " Ah , it was very cold , ma chem . Very cold , I do assure you ! " Joan sought it and sought it with all her heart , as though it had been the whole of France to save . " The whole of France , ma clam , instead of only a little young lamb . " And she carried it home with its head in her bosom . ? Then finally , the call to arms ; Joan 's leave-taking ; the people of Domremy gathered to see her go . Then the battles ; the wounded ; the slain ; the weary march ; the soldiers devoted , oh , devoted day and night to guard her ; though she had no fear , ? St. Michael was her champion . But oh , the weary march ! Mademoiselle must have been on that march herself , I think , to have known so minutely and heartfully the details and happenings of it . And then Joan at Rheims ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowning the young Dauphin ! I must have sat , a very attentive little child , you may be sure , fascinated by it all . Here was a story indeed ! and the story of a real person ! and told , as is not too often the case , by a real person . The climax approached so steadily and gloriously , like the sure tramp of an army ; now lost at some turn of the road , now coming on again , surer than ever . And then when it came to Joan ? la petite Jeanne ? in the cathedral among all the banners , raising the crown above the bent head of the Dauphin kneeling before her , the glorious moment of complete triumph was too great for Mademoiselle in the telling of it . Her voice broke , her eyes filled with tears , she could not go on for emotion . I shall never forget the direct simple impression that had on me . I had , along with most children , learned to look upon tears as something childish and unworthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a strong , wonderful grown person , her face aglow with enthusiasm , her eyes fairly radiant with love and devotion and reverence for Jeanne d'Arc , ? a girl dead and gone these hundreds of years , mind you ; yes , and the tears slipping down over Mademoiselle 's cheeks out of the fullness of her heart and sheer warmth of feeling . It is in such moods of radiance and emotion that the world sometimes sees nature in the spring . It is under such moods that young things and growing plants thrive ; and out of such moods that a bow of hope sometimes gets itself spanned gloriously enough across the heavens . Here indeed was my first lesson in that real enthusiasm , coupled with real reverence , which is so large a part of education in France ; yet , happily , like many another lesson learned under Mademoiselle 's kind teaching , I did not know it for a lesson at all , This was no task , no instruction . It was , no less than the rest , discovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land which my mere wandering sails had found . But my foot touched it on that day ; once more , I knew it and claimed it as my own . Joan from then on was one of my friends , ? intimately , reverently , as she was one of Mademoiselle 's friends ; and were I to tell a little child about her now , I should feel it a neglect not to tell the very color of her eyes . If you think I make much of this , well , it meant much to me ; I feel sure it would mean much to any child . But where to-day , I ask you , in our ordinary schools , so-called , shall you find children getting lessons like this ? You will find many a teacher dutifully enough giving out many a chalky blackboarded kind of instruction , but you shall not so readily find one with her eyes aglow , her whole soul swimming to the surface like that ; and the tears on her cheeks , from sheer whole-souled , unselfish , out-of-self reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life ! Although we have our purses continually in our hand , the better part of service goes still unrewarded . " So it does . I have still those neat bills of Mademoiselle 's sent to my mother for instruction of les denwiselles Porter . They are not small bills at all , and a good many extras , cahiers , pencils , pens , and the like , were charged to swell the account . But neither do they in any way cover the price of the service rendered ; and there is no mention in them , as indeed why should there be , of all the priceless things which stood in Mademoiselle 's unpublished curriculum , and were included generously in her daily instruction . // prince of England , who yet died nobly for his sister at the sinking of the " White Ship ; " and the page , in the same tale , who came before the old King , the Prince 's father , mute , and dressed all in black , because none of the nobles , no , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of news ; dared not , mind you , because of the King 's grief , which would be so great that it was to be feared no less than the anger of any other king . There were heroes , heroines , kings , queens , traitors , citizens , doctors , men of law , men of science , poets , monks , nuns , musicians , men of letters . I was daily in as varied a company as Chaucer himself on his way to Canterbury ; and I only a little child . It may seem absurd to you , but I knew George Sand , and whatever a child would have liked about her , I liked . I knew Madame de Stahl in no stiff fashion . I knew about her this , for instance : that when Napoleon exiled her from Paris , she pined , oh , yes , she pined for France , even among the glories of Switzerland ; and when some one , visiting at her chateau on Lake Leman , urged on her the loveliness of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is beautiful , beautiful ! " and then , sadly , " Mais donnezmoi mon petit ruisseau dans la rue du Bee . " She would give it all gladly , gladly , for that ! This , too , was not explained to me . It took me quite a while to discover that the ruisseau was just the little gutter in the rue du Bac in Paris . Paris , her own and her beloved ! Ali , she was very human , this Madame de Stahl , and I liked her for it . I even thought it would be very nice to be so loyal to the gutter that ran past my house in my own little home town . Perhaps it is even largely due to Madame de Stahl. as Mademoiselle Mallet introduced her to me , that I later grew to this very loyalty ; that my own old home , and my own home town , in years of exile from them , are so wonderfully dear to me. 77 ( 1 My French School Days I met , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I not only knew little intimate things about their lives , but I knew their heroes and heroines . I learned by heart page after page of Le Cid , Polyeucte , Athalie ; by heart , you see , rather than waiting to read them later by head . This may seem to you an absurdity . Well , ? it was Mademoiselle 's method . What has a little child to do with Le Cid , Polyeucte , Athalie ? ? I answer you : It was Mademoiselle 's method . Nor was this method Mademoiselle 's alone . That we might advance the more quickly in our studies , one of my sisters and I went , two afternoons of each week , to be given instruction by one Madame Bonnard , a very beautiful Frenchwoman , young , high-bred , around whose life was woven a story of a good deal of mystery and romance . Ifer home was beautiful , and the great salle where we had our lessons was hung with wonderful old tapestries , and full of a solemn light admitted through windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was instructed in no cut and dried fashion . Madame Bonnard was of an entirely different type from Mademoiselle Mallet , yet the method was the same , and the tears could come to her eyes , too , it would seem . My first lesson was from the seventh scene of the second act of Athalie . I was to learn by heart all the part of Joas , the child ; my oldest sister was to learn the part of Athalie , the Queen ; Madame Bonnard herself would take the unimportant part of Josabeth . Unless you are familiar with that rich scene , full of keen dramatic interest from start to finish , you can hardly have an idea how I enjoyed it ; enjoyed learning it by heart ; piecing out the sense , discovering for myself the interest , the meaning , the beauties . How I enjoyed those poignant questions put by my sister in the person of Athalie ! how I delighted , I , Joas , to answer them so wonderfully , so tellingly ! deleted materialAh that was my cue ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best : How I loved to give them ? the confounding replies of the child Joas ! The scene grows in meaning with each line , ? opens out like a flower . Athalie at last speaks in pity of the young child whose days are all spent in the service of God in the temple . She offers him instead her patronage , the pleasures of her court . She would treat him as her own son . There , too , was a part that I loved , I , the child Joas. deleted materialThat last said , oh , tellingly , I assure you , once I had gotten the full meaning of it . These you may call mere fragments of learning , and not to be compared with any right-minded spelling-book or arithmetic . Fragments they were , but of noble proportions , and they carried with them something that was like those fragments of the Parthenon which , great in themselves , give one the suggestion of something still greater . Then , too , you must not forget that there were spelling-books and arithmetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school to Paris as well as to Mademoiselle Mallet ; and , my books closed for the day , I did but go into a larger and more delightful class-room . We had a little Swiss maid who had a band in my education , too , but who believed her duty to be solely to button our shoes , to brush our hair , to tie our ribbons , to keep us tidy , to wait upon us , and to see to it especially that I , the youngest , was kept content and happy . It was in company with her that I went about Paris : to the Louvre gardens and galleries , to the Punch and Judy shows , ? a penny a chair ! to the Luxembourg , to Cluny , to dozens of other places , not sight-seeing , but pleasure-enjoying . I had learned the French method now , I knew the zest , the interest , the meaning they put into everything . What did Champs Elysees mean ? Tie French would not have given it that name without some meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not enlighten me . But I soon learned what the Elysian Fields stood for in ancient religion , and in story and romance . Ah , did not tell you that these people would not have given a meaningless name ! I did not think of it then , for I was in no critical humor , but I think of it now . Do you suppose that these people , full of associations , and devotions , and cultured enthusiasms , would have elected to call a great stretch of the most beautiful park land in the world " Central Park , " as we have done ? No . A small strip , not too wonderful , as we all know , is to them the " Elysian Fields ; " and topped and bottomed , if you please , by an " Arch of Triumph " and the " Place of Concord " ? the " Place of Peace . " Then there was the street of the Little Fields . What were they , these little fields The rue Louis le Grand ; ah , him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace ? ? for it was sure to commemorate an especial peace . The rue de Rivoli , the rue Richelieu , the Chaussee d'Antin , the rue Quatre Septembre ; the colonne de Juillet ; Boulevard des Capucines ; des Italiens ; Boulevard St. Michel ; St. Germain des Pres ; Champs de Mars ; how well named ! Place Moliere , and I knew well now who Moliere was ! Chapelle Expiatoire ; ah , that ! That had meaning ! And these were only a few ! Streets , boulevards , and monuments full of meaning , and each with an especial interest . Why , Paris had as many stories to tell as Mademoiselle ! Dear Mademoiselle ! Dear , delightful Paris ! IV One day a great event was astir , a great event for me . There was to be a Children 's Ball ; a Children 's Fancy Dress Ball at the Grand Opera House in Paris , and I was to be allowed to go ; not merely as an onlooker , but I was to go in a fancy dress , myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other little children . This was wonderful , of course . And what was I to wear . I was to go as " little America " ? that was soon decided on . My dress was to be of soft American flags . My cap was to be a little liberty cap . The shopping was a matter of great interest . The flags were bought , a lovely soft sort of veiling flags they were . The cap was made of a smaller silk flag . As for the stockings , they must be striped red and white lengthwise , of course . And the slippers must be blue , of a blue like the field of the flag . The shopping might have been difficult anywhere but in Paris . But did dear sympathetic Paris have stored away in her little boutiques a pair of red and white striped stockings of an exact size and of a perfect match for the flags ? Yes , of course . And a pair of blue satin slippers , high-heeled , just the right size , just the right shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmounted photograph of Washington and one of Lafayette , to be sewed upon little fringed flags , one French , one American , for me to wear as epaulets ? ? Yes , yes ; certainly . So the great day came at last , and I was dressed for the ball . Ah that was a ball , indeed ! The very stairway of the Opera was a wholly fairy-like thing . And once inside the great doors , oh , the great vast place it was ! vast it seemed to me with its gold and its glittering lights ; its tiers on tiers of boxes ; its flutter of children ; so many , so many , all dancing , laughing , talking , fanning themselves ! I had scarcely got on the floor when a little French Columbine came toward me , clapping her hands with delight . " Oh regardez ! regardez la petite Amerique ! " A little Lohengrin with a huge cotton swan under one arm ran up to me , and beamed in unaffected delight : " Mais oui ! Bon jour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made the swan do so too . So it was amid a little hum of appreciation and surprise that I danced in my high-heeled blue slippers , and looked over my shoulder in a maze of pleasure . Oh , I never danced so well , I assure you . They would appreciate , if any audience would , the pride of my step ; and each step I took was for America ; America which I had come to love now with such zest and enthusiasm ; yes , even as the French love France . A little French boy in peasant costume and his lass followed dancing near-by , near enough to read the name on the epaulet on my right shoulder : " Washington " pronounced the little boy proudly . Then they polka 'd around to see the other . " Eh , Lafayette ! Tiens ! Vive l'Amerique et la France ! " How they entered into it all ! What a good thing it was to be a little American girl , and a little American girl in Paris , and a little American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Opera ! Not a soul of them did I know , save my partner , an American boy . But I was among friends , and when the children did not actually speak to me , they would smile and nod in the most friendly manner ; and I doubt if ever the stars and stripes got a prettier welcome . I do not know when I first learned of it , but gradually , all over the sea of dancing children there was the stir and murmur of some happening . I was slow to trace it , but I found out at last ! There on the left of the Opera House , two boxes from the stage , in the lowest tier , so low that you could touch the crimson velvet rim of it with your hand , ? there was the great man of all Paris , ? Victor Hugo . Close beside him was his little granddaughter Jeanne . I can hardly tell you the impression , the influence his presence had on the ball ; he who loved children so ! Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He who loved Paris so ! he who had been exiled , he too ! He who was the idol of the people , their great man , their man of letters , head and shoulders above the rest . I was prepared to like him in true French fashion . We danced up close to the wonderful opera box . I looked with a child 's eyes . I saw a man undeniably ugly ; yes , I thought him very ugly . His white hair stood up stiff and rather short and straight ; and his white beard only added to the unkempt look . His eyes were small , and they seemed , to me at least , slightly crossed . His figure was stocky , and his head was sunk forward quite a little . I was disappointed . He was in no sense my idea of a hero . Jeanne kept close to him , and , if I remember , with her hand in his all the while . The thing that did not disappoint me was his evident interest in the ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him , couple after couple ; and his name was repeated over and over , each child telling the other , " C'est Victor Hugo . " " Oui , et sa petite-fille Jeanne ! " I do not know why , nor just how the impression was conveyed , but this seemed his world , this world of happy , light-hearted children . He seemed full of keen interest all the while . He watched the dancers . Sometimes he smiled and nodded to them . I do not know whether he noticed me especially , but I hoped that he did , and I felt the prouder that his look had brushed over me . I do not know how long the ball lasted . It seemed as though it might go on forever . In the midst of it I was told that it was time for me to go home . I had had a glorious afternoon . In the open place outside the Opera House were the same crowds that had waited to see the costumed children arrive . There had been a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage and went into the Opera House , I along with other little children . I was anticipating the scone murmur now , when my mother touched my hand and bent and said a few words to me , then directed her eyes to some one standing almost beside me . I looked . It was he . He and Jeanne were leaving the Opera House , too . He had a slouch hat pulled down over the stiff unkempt-looking hair , and a coat with a cape about him . Jeanne 's hand was in his . They stood a moment , freed from any immediate crowd , at the head of the steps . At once the people recognized him . The recognition and feeling seemed unanimous . Instead of the narrow walkway left by the crowd , men and women fell back a little with one accord , until a broad way was left free to him , down the open approach to the Opera ; a broad way , even , orderly , as though gendarmes had made it . The great man and the little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little further forward . I waited , breathless and fascinated , to see the two of them go . He seemed to me a very great man now , with Paris silent , respectful before him . I have never seen anything like it . As he went , slowly , and even a little uncertainly , ? for he was an old man , and even then within only a few short strides of his grave , every man in that crowd raised his hat silently , and without demonstration , and stood uncovered while Victor Hugo and Isis little grandchild passed down the line to their carriage . I saw Jeanne get in . The great man paused , bent his head still more and followed after her . The door was closed by the guard , and the carriage drove away . It was then that the men replaced their hats . And I , I had learned one more lesson , made one more discovery in reverence and enthusiasm ; this time at the hands of Paris herself . Ah , what schoolmistresses they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the days . They came and bloomed and went like flowers ; and like flowers there were always others to take their place . The studies were often difficult , but there was a glow in life , a constant kindling of enthusiasm . From older years I can look and see that much that has been most beautiful in my life has had root in these French traits , ? enthusiasm and reverence . My mother 's reverence , her loving enthusiasm for beauty , for greatness , for goodness , was this not perhaps taught her in large part by the education , more French than American , which my grandfather saw given to his children ? Is it not owing largely to this and to my French school days that there is so much beauty and goodness and enthusiasm in life for me now ? When I returned to America it was with many misgivings . I did not know the capitals of the States , or the dates of American battles , or my tables of American weights and measures , all of which my companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departments of France and kilogrammes and millimetres do me ! But if I did not know the things in knowledge of which my little comrades were so glib , I was yet far advanced in hero-worship . I might stand at the foot of my American classes , but before school , at recess-time , or after school , there was hardly a child in that class who would not listen gladly , eagerly too , all but the slightly envious , to the tales I could tell , of Roland at Roncesvalles , of Louis it Grand , of Jeanne , of Athalie , and of all the rest . But here in American schools are we not beginning to make a great point of the telling of stories of great men and women ? Yes , but it does not stein to me the same ; and we tell them with so much less intimacy , and , if I may say it , with so much less graciousness ; more as a duty than a delight . I know , I know that we have what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and wonderful theories of education . But teaching ? as I take it ? is neither a theory nor a system , not more than is painting . It is a great art , a great creative art , no less . And , like all the other arts , it requires the devotion of the individual . I loved my American teachers . Yet , as I recall them ( and in twelve years of American schooling as against two of French , I had many American teachers ) , all of them seem , beside Mademoiselle Mallet , Madame Bonnard , and the other Frenchwomen who taught me , strangely lacking in taste , in culture , and in interest . No one of them had at her command such a host as was at the disposal of all these Frenchwomen . Yet here is a matter of importance enough in education , for the sympathetic teacher knows the child must forever be her guest , and her schoolroom rather a house , a home where more than elsewhere the child shall memorably meet , intimately , warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I see how this more intimate , more French method of teaching is avoided , as it is skillfully , by so many . For all teaching of all subjects is finally , as I take it , and in one form or another , the teaching of history . Make education as dry as you like , it is still hound to be , at bottom , the story , the life-story , of something or of somebody . Even the most abstruse subjects are woven in with human history , and bound up with strands of human meaning , with human joy and misery , human baseness or nobility . " The address of all history , " says Fronde , " is less to the understanding , than to the higher emotions . We learn in it to sympathize with what is great and good , and we learn to hate what is base . " Il a beau dire ? ce bon Fronde ! The history examination papers approved by our boards of education still contain few enough questions asked or answered concerning human nobility or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them a great insistence and nicety as to dates and eras , as to the exact age of dynasties , republics , and successions . No American teacher told me , as a child , the whole ragged , wonderful , solemn , heart-breaking story of Lee 's surrender as it well might have been told . Lee 's surrender ! Lee 's farewell to his soldiers ! " Ah , mais je vous demande ! " What an occasion would not Mademoiselle Mallet have made of that l I was only expected to know the date of Appomattox . I still remember the picture of Lincoln , tacked to the blackboard in the chill February days , and the dates of his birth and death written in colored chalk , ? and that I failed utterly on the dates of the battles of the Civil War . Since then it has become the fashion to teach of Lincoln the man . There are few of our heroes so humanized . Yet even this has become , in large measure , a part of the " system . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " theory of how to give children the hero-thought , " who must separate from the " prescribed order of Lincoln exercises for the day , " and from the learning " in concert " the Gettysburg speech , Lincoln the man . It is still she who will gather about her a group of eager children , and who will tell them , perhaps with a break in her voice ( I hardly see how it could be otherwise ) of the life and death of Lincoln , her friend Lincoln . The things which set my French school ( lays apart as more colored , more valuable than the rest , were , first of all , the entire French method : that delightful method of discovery , for instance , of which I have told you ; the method of unfailing respect and courtesy shown me , which lent charm and dignity to the days ; the constant association with forms of great art . These things seem to me I can not say how valuable toward the sound and successful education of any child . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reinforcing individuality , the personality , the personal charm of the Frenchwomen who taught me . Though " systems , " and the fashion of books and slates and rulers and examination papers may dwell long among us , yet it is still forever the personality of Socrates that makes famous the garden of Academos . In a later age it is not the theories of Ascii= that are so keenly remembered , good though they may be , but Ascham himself , the friend and leacher , who stands out pOrtrait-like , lovable , influential . One memorable day I learned that Mademoiselle Mallet had had a lover who was killed in the Siege of Paris . Mademoiselle ( lid not tell us this . I do not now know rightly who told it . But so fine a piece of color in France would not be hid , you may be sure . It explained many things besides Mademoiselle 's feeling description of the Siege . It accounted for how much of her reverence , her warmth , her enthusiasm , her lovely personality ! One would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would one seem to insist that a teacher to be eminent in matters of education must needs have a lover killed in some war ( we can not all be Mesdemoiselles Mallet ) . Yet if any had , why then , as a matter of eligibility , I for one should say , " Eh hien I so much the better . Tant mieux I " I have never returned to France . I have never refreshed at their fountainhead these memories of my French school days . I have never since looked into Mademoiselle 's kind , direct eyes . My French , once her great pride , ? " Quel accent parfait a-t-elle , cette petite ! " ? is grown rusty in places . Between her and me " wide seas have rolled , " since the " old long-since " of those days . Yet I know well that it is due chiefly to her that , no matter how long hence , in turning back the pages of a more complete life , few chapters will seem of such lasting importance , few will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , as that chapter with its simple heading , ? School Days in France .
