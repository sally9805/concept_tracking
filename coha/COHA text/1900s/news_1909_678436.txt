Turner , taking advantage of the clearness of the night , brought his vessel to her pier . The breaking of the propeller blade occurred on Monday morning , and it was followed by a great shaking of the steamer that brought many passengers from their staterooms or sent them flying away from the breakfast table to find out what had happened . The excitement was shortlived .
