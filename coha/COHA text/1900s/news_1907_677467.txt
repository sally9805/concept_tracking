txt The Republican County Committee 's Splecial Committee of Thirty-five , which for the last month has been investigating transit conditions in the city , will report to the County Committee next Thursday and advocate measures of reform , a the same time presenting figures to show that the New York City Railway Company . which operates the surface lines , is not only not utilizing the full capacity of its system , but has reduced its service since the merger of the Interborough and is actually running 500 cars less than than it ran five years ago . The Committee of Thirty-five , of which Robert Kelly Prentice is Chairman , met yesterday afternoon in the Fifth Avenue Hotel and received reports of its various sub-committees , among which was one On statistics and one on law . Senator Nathan Elsberg was Chairman of the Committee on Law , and part of his report read at yesterday 's meeting wr.s a recommendation that a new railroad commission , such as suggested by Gov . Hughes in his message , be advocated , and that it received power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elevated , and underground railroads in the City of New York as it deemed necessary for the safety , health , and convenience of the public , such regulations to have the effect of orders . " It is suggested that the company may , within a limited time , appeal from the order direct to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court , and that the matter shall take precedence , so that it will be heard at the earliest possible moment . In the meanwhile , however , the company affected must obey the Order Of the commission . Failure to obey the order pending the hearing or providing no appeal is made within the time specified , shall constitute a crime on the part of the corporation . and in addition , on the part of the individual officials of the corporation . Mr. Elsberg 's sub-committee decided that only by fixing the responsibility on the individual officials could the companies be compelled to live up to their duties . It was found that in every instance where a charter or a franchise bad been granted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road was to be operated , first of all , for the convenience of the public , and the sub-committee also found that the convenience of the public had in every ease been the last consideration . It found , too , that while there are sufficient laws in existence at present there is a woeful lack of means of enforcing them . The new commission , it is declared , will , if it is given power enough , , be able to do much in the way of improving transit conditions . The facts concerning the Metropolitan , which the sub-committee on statistics brought to light , make interesting  --  reading , in view of the frequent declarations of the company officials that the . road was being operated to its fullest .... apacity . " The merger of the Metropolitan and the Interborough , " said Mr. Prentice after the meeting yesterday , " was announced in January , 1906 . Our committee obtained the figures filed with the State Railroad Commission for the first three-quarters of 1906 , the full year reports not being obtainable , and compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A very simple computation showed that the cash fares received by the . Metropolitan , or New York City Railway Company , after the merger , showed an increase of 11,709,000 fares for the threequarters , whereas the car mileage for the same period was decreased 529,000 car miles . These figures apply to Manhattan alone , and show that there was a curtailing of the service on the surface lines after the merger . " - The sub-committee also found what was termed ' the consolidated load line of the Metropolitan . ' giving the number of cars in use on Sept. 4. 1901 , in Manhattan . between the hours of 5 and ( 3 in the evening , as 2,250 . The average number of cars in use last November was 1,719 , which was increased in December to 1,775. - " Did you find out why the 500 cars ; were taken off ? " Mr. Prentice was asked . " Not exactly , " he replied , " but the disposition of 100 cars of the old Third Avenue line may throw some light on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars of the large type with a seating capacity of forty-eight , the Metropolitan , after it got hold of the Third Avenue line , sold sixty-nine to other roads , converted two into freight cars , and . in the case of the twenty-nine it kept , tore out the old seats , reducing the seating capacity of each car eight seats , so as to make more standing room . - " As to the number of cars at present in use , we found that the company owns at present 1,975 box cars . Of these 800 are of the short variety , seating from twenty-four to twentw-eight paizsengers ; twenty-five are of a larger type , seating forty passengers , and 1.150 arc what is known as the standard Metropoll ? an type , seating thirty-six . We have fig.ired the thing out and now know that if the company would substitute big cars for the small ones It operates , it would increase the seating capacity 20 per cent. , and if it would put on the five hundred cars which . it has been clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seating capacity another 20 per cent . . " On Nov. 11 , 1906 , the State Railroad Commission , going to the limit of its power , recommended ' that the company increase its service 10 per cent . It is a ! fact , which has since been admitted to us by the company , that the number of cars in service was increased , in response to that order , less than 4 per cent. , and the actual service was increased-less than 1 Per cent Since the agitation for an in- ; vestigation and the Goi-ernor 's message , there has been another increase , showlag that a greater increase than that in-I after the Railroad Commission 's ' recommendation was easily possible . " t The fundamental-and general trouble which , . results in the transit problem in this city , " concluded Mr. Prentice , " is that- all the transit facilities are in the hands ofa monopoly . and the control of . the.roads is so sub-divided that it is possible to fix -- responsibility . The Rapid Transit Commission - has power Over . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend . Our work will be to bring about , through the County Committee , the establishment of a commission such as advocated by Gov . Hughes , and have that commission force the monopoly to perform its obligations. - It was also ascertained that the sub . committees found the worst conditions in the city on the surface lines and on the subway expresses . A number of improvements in the subway service can , it Is believed , be brought about by the run ; .. ning , of additional ' Urinal trains and other small improvements . In reference to the Bronx lines . the committee was told that while the Metropolitan Company owned the stock , it had nothing to do with the operation . An investigation brought out the fact that , taking the Metropolitan 's own figure of minimum headway , a total of 180 cars could be operated from the terminal at 129th Street and Third Avenue every hour , Whereas the number actually dispatched from that point in rush hours was eighty-seven , and these were distributed to ten different lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whole . sale Changes of Motive Power . The New York City Railway Company is to do away with the last of its horse cars . President Vreeland announced this yesterday afternoon , after action of the Directors of the company , directing the President to proceed at once to make contracts , order materials , and do everything necessary to expedite the work of changing from horse power to electricity . For several months President Vreeland and Oren Root , Jr. , General Manager of the company , have been completing the plans for this work . The State Railroad Commission notified yesterday or the decision , and President Vreeland also wrote to property owners on the east side , stating that work would he begun in First Avenue as soon as the frost was out of the ground , and that the job would be completed at the earliest possible date . The decision to abolish the horse cars means the entire rearrangement of surface traffic conditions in Manhattan . It is expected that congestion will be relieved on many of the lines now overcrowded . such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have been taxed beyond their limit , while by the electrification of the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Street lines traveling facilities across town in the midsection of the city will be greatly improved . New routes will also soon be laid out to touch the important traffic centres to be opened for public use in the next few . years . Especial attention will be given to facilities for passengers arriving at the new Pcnro. ? ylvania Railroad Station . Meantime the question how properly to accommodate people desiring to use an east side surface line , and to cross from Brooklyn by the Blackwell 's Island Bridge . the new Manhattan Bridge , and the Williamsburg Bridge have also been solved . It is proposed to run a main trunk line of the street surface system down First Avenue connecting all the bridges . As to the disappearing horse cars , President Vreeland said after yesterday 's meeting : " There has been a very grave misunderstanding on the part of the traveling public caused by the horse cars being operated of late years in Manhattan . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to solve . " We all know of the vast public and private improvements which are being made nn and around New York , creating new centres for the distribution of passengers . New bridges are being constructed across the East River , and new tunnels are under way . tip to a few months ago it was not definitely known what arrangements the city and private corporations would make at the new terminals in New York to accommodate the traveling public . It would have been futile to plan for accommodating passengers arriving over the Blackwell 's Island Bridge without knowing where the city was to put the terminal . " As a matter of fact , however , passenger traffic business in and to New York will undergo a complke change of conditions within the next few years , and the New York City Railway Company by putting into effect the plans adopted to-day will be in a position to give the traveling public greatly increased facilities .
