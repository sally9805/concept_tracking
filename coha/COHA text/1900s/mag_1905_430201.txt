 |p1097  IN an article in THE INDEPENDENT of April zoth , entitled " The Church and the Reward of Iniquity , " Dr. Washington Gladden charges Mr. John D. Rockefeller with having committed perjury in that when he was examined under oath before a committee of the - New York Legislature concerning the South Improvement Company he took part in the following colloquy : " There was such a company ? " " I have heard of such a company . " " You were not in it ? " " I was not . " Dr. Gladden follows this by saying : " Mr. Lloyd appropriately adds , So help me God . ' " Throughout the entire article Dr. Gladden makes much of his position as an original investigator , and says that it is within the power of every intelligent man to find out from the original documents whether the statement is true or not . An examination of the original documents shows that his statement is untrue and that his whole charge of perjury rests upon a garbled report . The questions and answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Investigation Relative to Trusts , New York Senate , 1888 , " pages 419-420 . Any one turning to that report will find that the company concerning which Mr. Rockefeller was being interrogated was not the South Improvement Company , as Dr. Gladden states , but the Southern Improvement Company . In a former article , published through the Associated Press , I called Dr. Gladden 's attention to this fact , and also to the fact that these were two entirely different corporations ; that the Southern Improvement Company was incorporated by act of the Pennsylvania Legislature , approved April 16th , 187o , and that the South Improvement Company was incorporated over a year later by an act approved May 6th , 1871 ; that both of these charters are printed in full in the Statutes of Pennsylvania and are accessible to all ; and that tho Mr. Rockefeller was connected with the South Improvement Company he had no connection with the Southern Improvement Company , and therefore that his testimony quoted above was true . In a published reply , under date of April 29th , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the corporation concerning which Mr. Rockefeller was examined was not the South Improvement Company , but the Southern Improvement Company . He , however , challenges my statement that there were two corporations . He says he has searched the records to which I cited him and has not been able to find the charter of the South Improvement Company , and says : " No such company was incorporated on the clay he names , May 6th , 1871 . " As Dr. Gladden says that he has succeeded in finding the act to incorporate the Southern Improvement Company it is unnecessary to refer to the page where that is printed . If he will take the Laws of Pennsylvania for the year 1872 he will find in the Index , page 1438 , the following : " Improvement Companies , South , Act to Incorporate 1,278 . " Repealed 715 . " If he will turn to page 1278 he will find it entitled " Appendix , 1871 , " and on that page , set forth in full , the charter of the South Improvement Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had previously informed him . Notwithstanding that Dr. Gladden 's attention had been specifically called to the fact that these two corporations were entirely distinct , and he had been given the dates of their respective charters , he says in his reply to my article that " the Southern Improvement Company was the name of the company whose charter was purchased by Mr. Rockefeller and 1098 THE INDE  |p1098  his friends . " This shows the most amazing recklessness of statement . In his article in THE INDEPENDENT he said : " The South Improvement Company was one of the schemes invented by the Standard Oil magnates to plunder their competitors . " He now says that its name was the Southern Improvement Company . There is absolutely no foundation for this latter assertion , and his only reason for making it is his desire to disentangle himself from the net in which he is enmeshed . The falsity of the statement is easily demonstrated . His chief authority , Miss Tarbell , in her History of the Standard Oil Company , " Vol . I , page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company was repealed by the Legislature , and the agitation which led to this repeal is mentioned in Dr. Gladden 's article . If he will look at page 715 of the Statutes above referred to he will find the repealing act . It is entitled " An Act to Repeal the Charter of the South Improvement Company , " and it reads as follows : " Be it enacted . . . that the Act entitled ' An Act to Incorporate the South Improvement Company , ' approved the sixth day of May , Anno Domini One Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-one , be and the same is hereby repealed . " The fact that it gives the name of the corporation correctly as the South Improvement Company , and refers to the date of its charter , which is more than a year later than that of the Southern Improvement Company , shows that there is no excuse whatever for confusing the two corporations . So much for Dr. Gladden 's competence as an investigator . It having been shown in my former article that the company concerning which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Gladden was not the South Improvement Company , as he had stated , but a totally different corporation , Dr. Gladden in his reply seeks to shift the issue by saying that while Mr. Rockefeller did answer truthfully the question which was asked him , he was bound to answer , not that question , but some other , which he might have imagined the examiner had intended to ask him . This is puerile . A witness on the stand is bound to answer the question which he is asked , and he is not required , nor is he permitted , to assume that the examiner did not say what he meant . Furthermore , perjury is a serious crime . No man commits crime without a motive , and no person with any proper sense of responsibility for his utterances would accuse another of it without first inquiring whether there was any apparent motive . There could have been no possible motive for Mr. Rockefeller to testify falsely with . regard to his connection with the South Improvement Company ; and if Dr. Gladden had pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no desire on his part to do so . The South Improvement Company was investigated by a Committee of Congress in 1872 , and on March 3oth of that year Mr. William G. Warden , secretary of the company , gave a list of the stockholders , including the name of John D. Rockefeller . It had therefore been a matter of public record and public notoriety for sixteen years prior to the examination which Dr. Gladden speaks of that Mr. Rockefeller had been a stockholder of the South Improvement Company , and it would have been the bight of folly for him to have denied his connection with it , even if there had been any object in his doing so . If Dr. Gladden will examine the testimony taken by the House of Representatives with relation to the Standard Oil Company in that same year , 1888 , he will find , on page 387 , that Mr. Rockefeller was then examined concerning the South Improvement Company , and testified with the utmost frankness with regard to his connection with it . It thus is proved : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Gladden 's charge Mr. Rockefeller was not examined with regard to the South Improvement Company , but with regard to the Southern Improvement Company , and that his testimony was true ; Second , that the South Improvement Company and the Southern Improvement Company were totally different corporations ; Third , that Mr. Rockefeller could have had no possible motive for testifying that he was not connected with the  |p1099  South Improvement Company , nor did he so testify ; and , Fourth , that when he was examined concerning the South Improvement Company he testified with perfect frankness with regard to his connection with it . This certainly disposes of the charge of perjury . This ridiculous falsehood appears in the books of Mr. Lloyd and Miss Tarbell , and has not heretofore been deemed worthy of notice . But when a man of Dr. Gladden 's standing , as Moderator of the National Council of Congregational Churches , assumes the responsibility for it , and gives his hearers to understand that his statements are made only after a careful study of the records and official documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records which I have cited were just as accessible to Dr. Gladden as they were to me . The proof of the falsity of his accusation did not require any inside knowledge . It is perfectly evident that he made this charge of a disgraceful crime against Mr. Rockefeller without any attempt whatever to investigate its truth . And now that his error has been pointed out , his struggles to avoid the necessity of a frank retraction and apology are , while very human , not in accord with the lofty standard of ethics to which he would hold his neighbor . The Vlaster said : " Judge not , that ye be not judged . For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged ; and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured unto you . " There is practical wisdom as well as divine sanction in those words . If one were disposed to judge Dr. Gladden with the same uncharitable judgment which he has applied to Mr. Rockefeller he might be tempted to use a style of expression of which we prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly .
