The belief in the continuation of personal existence after the death of the body was prevalent in very ancient times . The conception of the immortality of the soul , with which this older belief is usually confused , is , however , relatively modern , and although evolved from the more ancient notion , it has become quite diverse from it in form and content . The more ancient view was altogether part and parcel of the materialism with which the thought of the savage was permeated . Something that belonged to , and was characteristic of , the body of the man when alive and awake was supposed to leave him temporarily when he slept , and permanently when he died It is true that this something came to be , in a measure , identified vaguely with the man 's mental life , nevertheless , the distinction between mind and body not being clearly appreciated , the something that left the man 's body and returned again diurnally , and that finally deserted it permanently , was thought of as endowed with bodily characteristics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immortality appeared only in conjunction with the conception of a non-material soul -- a conception which probably developed in connection with the earliest crude criticism of experience , although not explicitly appreciated until much later But to the soul as thus conceived there still clung not a few materialistic traits , which belonged to its more clearly material prototype pictured to himself by the savage , traits which in truth still attach to the soul , as the average uncritical man of our own day thinks of it All this is sufficiently commonplace ; but here , as often , we are prone to overlook the obvious In the main , our beliefs are maintained without attempt to rationalize them ; and when , with growth of intelligence , a demand arises for this rationalization , we are likely to accept our concepts without inquiry as to their origin , or as to the meanings of terms this origin has involved Such is the case with the conception here considered Among the people of the Western world , of which alone I can here speak , modern religion has translated the tenets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altering their significance , and , taking them thus , has woven the conception of the soul 's immortality into the very warp and woof of its doctrine , but it has done so , in the main , rather as a matter of faith than of reason , and its devotees as a rule have thus naturally waived all critical examination of concepts or careful definition et terms On the other hand , the student of science , which busies itself with material objects , noting that the soul is conceived of as non-material , has naturally turned away from the problem of its future existence Where , however , this problem has been forced upon him , the scientist has not often stopped to consider the limitations of his habitual point of view , and has , therefore , been content to describe the soul as an epi-phenomenon , which flits shadow-like in the train of the mechanically ordered body , and goes out of existence when this body dies and is disintegrated . A view so subversive of a most cherished belief has naturally fired the religious man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main , to hurl anathemas at those who have thus disturbed his placid faith Had he not been too well satisfied with the easy-going acceptance of an inherited dogma , the reasoning of the skeptical scientist might , on the one hand , have opened his eyes to his own lack of insight , and , on the other , might have led him to disturb the self-confidence of his scientific opponents by asking searching questions as to the meaning they attach to his own words and theirs We shall never make definite advance in the solution of this problem of immortality until all parties come to something like a substantial agreement as to the meaning of soul , of personality , of the permanence of personality , of the relation of personality to body , etc In speaking thus of the mode of thought of the religious and of the scientific man , I , of course , leave out of consideration the religious thinker who is a technical metaphysician , for whom this doctrine of the soul 's immortality has been a matter of serious discussion And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we find the question receiving marked attention , as is clearly indicated , for instance , by the dissertations given on the Ingersoll Lecture foundation , and from time to time in the current numbers of the Hibbert Journal But these interpretations of the doctrine are couched in terms which are entirely incomprehensible to the average highly intelligent and educated man , who , in natural dissatisfaction , turns anew to the devotees of science , whose speech seems not altogether an unknown tongue The non-philosophical scientist , who , so far as metaphysical questions is concerned , is in the same class with these lay inquirers , comes forward from time to time with an encouraging answer to the doubts raised by his fellows He , however , if we are to judge him by two recent works* , is not inclined to grapple with the difficulties which the metaphysician so keenly appreciates , but he seems content to i est upon hypothetical constructs , which not seldom display an amazing brilliancy of imagination , even if they do not convince one of their probable validity and value The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to astonish us when we consider the contempt he has habitually accorded to hypotheses of a metaphysical type because of their lack of dependence upon experiences subject to experimental investigation  --  to astonish us until we recall that of late years in his own particular field he has indulged in a very riot of hypotheses , unverifiable by experience , in relation to the ether and atoms , to vortex rings knotted and unknotted , to electrons , etc , etc These hypotheses are intensely interesting , and valuable in that they lend themselves to the correlation of a mighty array of facts in nature , but admittedly they are highly imaginative It is not , then , so surpris-ng after all to find in the books before us a wild use of hypotheses by men of training as physicists ; nor can we discountenance these hypotheses altogether on the ground that they do not rest upon a firm basis , provided only they appear to lead to convincing correlations of experience But such is surely riot the case here Fournier frankly turns back to materialism , pure and simple Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature and life . he bases the assumption of the existence of attenuated , unobservable forms of matter which pervade the living body , and which still persist after death in forms which are of the essence of the individual during life These correlated " psychomeres , " he holds , live eternally as " astral bodies " in the atmosphere above the earth , assuming naturally fish-like or flame-like forms , which occasionally are given to our perception , but which more usually communicate with us through transformations more closely allied to our own nature , as in the ghosts and voices and " messages " of the mediums This hypothesis might be passed over as altogether unworthy of attention did not the writer make so much of , and show such a grasp of , facts favorable to the conception of continuity ; were there not much strength in the general position he thus maintains ; and did he Nero Light on Immortality By E E Fournier d'Albe Pp 327 New York Long-mans , Green &; Co $1 75 net Science and Immortality By Sir Oliver Lodge Pp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in support of his contentions make such full use of quotations from the works of serious scientific contributors , as , for instance , our biologist , E B Wilson It is therefore worth while , perhaps , to call attention to the fatal defect in the author 's argument , a defect which is at once apparent when we discover that the attenuated material particles which he assumes to exist in and of our living bodies , are designated as " psychomeres or soul particles " , when we note , in other words , that on reaching the unobservable he assumes , without a shadow of proof , that his matter has suddenly become mind The possibility that this assumption is invalid does not seem to occur to our au ' thor , in fact , he can scarcely be said to give us any notion that he observes the leap he has taken , As a consequence , his conclusions prove to be entirely unworthy of serious consideration They are not likely to satisfy the inquirer who looks for confirmation of the conception of the immortality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their position by the spiritist who are becoming more and more annoyed by attempts like those of Podmore* and l3rucei- to " naturalize " the phenomena they present to us Sir Oliver Lodge 's book , however , must be taken more seriously because of the eminence its author has attained in the scientific world The work is divided into four parts , two of which relate respectively to criticisms of the established English Church , and to " suggestions toward the reinterpretation of Christian Doctrine " , and which contain much excellent matter , although this is strangely placed in the volume , and bears little or no relation to the aim of the writer as suggested by his title and by the body of contents Turning to the author 's principal contentions , we note that he finds himself deeply interested in the common man 's conception of a separate soul essence , a conception which he accepts without adequate criticism ; and he makes use of the very doubtful claims and theses of spiritism , and of notions derived from late studies of " dissociated personalities , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientific form of the concept of the soul 's immortality It may be well perhaps to present a brief summary of his argument , if such it may be called " The soul , " he tells us ( p 144 ) , is " that part of man which is dissociated from the body at death , ?

" It is also ( p. 152 ) , a " controlling and guiding principle which is responsible for our personal expression , and for the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestry " " In its higher development it includes also feeling and intelligence and will , and is the storehouse of mental experience " Beyond this ? In the higher organisms . . it begins to acquire some of the character of " spirit , " by which means it becomes related to the Divine Being Soul appears to be the link between " spirit " and " matter " ( p. 153 ) . We learn further ( p. 159 ) that " no really existing thing perishes , but only changes its form . " The " perceptible or incarnate existence " of a dew-drop " is temporary As a drop it was born , and as a drop it ales ; but as aqueous vapor it persists Even it , therefore , has the attribute of immortality " ( p 160 ) So is it with life , which can not be a nonentity , nor can intellect and consciousness and will , nor memory and love and adoration ? They are not nothing , nor shall they ever vanish into nothingness and cease to be . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the temporarily separated portion of that general life , will return undifferentiated and unidentified to its central store . But " a memory , a consciousness , and a will , in so far as they constitute a consistent whole , constitute a personality , personality or individuality itself dominates and transcends all temporal modes of expression , and so is essentially eternal wherever it exists " ( p 163 ) Again : If all that really exists is immortal , we have only to ask whether our personality , our character , our self , is sufficiently individual , sufficiently characteristic , sufficiently developed  --  in a word sufficiently recd : for if it is , there can be no doubt of its continuance ( p- 164 ) Note that here it is the self and not the soul that is held to be immortal . and that we are not told by what criterion we are to be guided in determining when this sufficient reality is present Sir Oliver further believes ( p 173 ) that " the facts of ' telepathy , ' and in a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as practically established in the minds of those who have studied them " Telepathy alone tends mightily to strengthen the argument for transcendence of mind over body , so that we may reasonably expect the one to be capable of existing independently , and of surviving the other . Further corroboration is found in the facts of automatism : The body , or some part of the body , though usually controlled and directed bysometimes be found capable of responding to a foreign intelligence acting either telepathically through the mind , or telergically by a more direct process straight on the brain ( p. 178 ) . Moreover , in the opinion of Sir Oliver , the subliminal faculty , and the occurrence of genius , point in the same direction . One can not read the above series of statements without being struck by the author 's failure to grasp the connotations of the terms he so glibly employs ; and especially by the lack of logical coherence in the propositions presented , and by the carelessness with which he introduces mere metaphors as steps in his argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's immortality by reference to the persistence of aqueous vapor as a " form " existing before , and after , and through , the process of dew drop production The soul which " includes what is connoted by the term ' mind ' " is " the link between ' spirit ' and ' matter , ' " and " is responsible for the construction or the body . " This responsibility and constructive power , however , apparently do not belong to the soul as such , but only to that part of it which we call mind . Mind " has the power of liberating detente and pulling triggers in that strange physiological link with another order of existence " ( p 63 ) " Mind determines , life directs " ( p 64 ) Life guides , i e , is capable of the " influencing of activity without ' work , ' the direction of energy without generating it , the utilizing and guiding existing activity for pre-conceived and purposed ends " ( p 61 ) These preconceived and purposed ends are , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusion is observed where we read , on p 3 , that " energy from the outside world " is " amenable to nerve messages sent from his brain , and so ultimately from his mind " We might go further to show the changes of meaning given , in the course of our author 's argument , to the word spirit , which at one time is dealt with as an attribute of the Deity  --  a view which , in a measure , we may share with him  --  and again appears to apply to the agency responsible for " spirit rappings " might show like changes of meaning in his statement of pantheism ( e g , pp 31 , 37 , and 40 ) , but this is not needful to confirm us in the view that his discussion will satisfy neither the philosopher , the logician , the scientist , nor the religious devotee To sum up , we have in Sir Oliver Lodge a man who has gained distinction in the realms of science , and who here essays to show to those whose interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems with which they are deeply concerned Inquence of propositions , a careful definition of terms and consistent use of the terms as thus defined , a rigid and judicious sifting and weighing of evidence , an avoidance of mysticism and of all unnecessary and doubtful hypotheses , and a clarity of exposition which aide the reader to separate merely theoretical positions from what is based upon firm foundation . That none of these demands are met by the author , must be apparent to the reader of the summary of the contents of the work as above given His complete failure to exemplify the ideals of scientific method , and to satisfy the cravings of the intelligent among the audience to which he appeals , must be still more evident to one who reads the book itself , even without careful analysis and without special search for the basis of the author 's conclusions H R , M G R Putnam of the Coast Survey , delivered a course of lectures on Nautical Charts at Columbia University last winter which John Wiley &; Sons have recently published in book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninteresting , but , of course , it appeals to a very limited circle of readers The historical notes are brier and dry The detailed description of what a chart shows on its face is wholly superfluous to the navigator As might have been expected , the author speaks favorably of the polyconic projection , so much disliked by practical men Unnecessary alike to the hydrographer and the sailor , this little book may yet prove attractive to the curious in maritime matters . " Hydraulics and Its Application , " by A H Gibson of the University of Manchester , a volume of 747 pages and 310 illustrations , is issued in this country by the D. Van Nostrand Co It might seem that with so many books on this subject but little new or valuable material could be found Yet Mr Gibson has undoubtedly succeeded in securing not only new material , but in treating it with some novelty To be sure , certain propositions based on the processes of mathematical physics can not be changed , and in all succeeding books must appear in practically identical

part of the preface Were water a perfectly non-viscous , inelastic fluid , whose particles , when in motion , always followed sensibly parallel paths , hydraulics would be one of the most exact of the sciences But water satisfies none of these conditions , and the result is that in the majority of cases brought before the engineer , motions and forces of such complexity are introduced as baffle all attempts at a rigorous solution This being so , the best that can be done is to discuss each phenomenon on the assumption that the fluid in motion is perfect , and to modify the results so obtained
