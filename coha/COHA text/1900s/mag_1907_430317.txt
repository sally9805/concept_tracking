 | MODERN SPANISH FICTION THE battle between the old and the new , between the conservative spirit and the spirit of progress , is being fought out still to-day in Spain as perhaps nowhere else in Europe . This fact gives a special interest to the Spanish fiction of the last half-century . This fiction is almost unknown in the United States . Save in our universities and colleges , it is not known that Spain possesses a modern fiction of great wealth and interest . Yet a score of novelists of the first order have combined to give such a picture of the social , political , and religious condition of their picturesque land as charms the student and piques the curiosity of even the casual browser in the field of foreign literature . Sufficient attention is now devoted to the Spanish language in our country , and sufficient translations are easily accessible , to warrant some account of the development of Spanish fiction since 1850 . The first half of the nineteenth century saw in Spain , as elsewhere , the regrettable triumph of the pseudo-historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unreliability and lack of . inspiration , are the marks of the genre in Spain . Seldom was a literary reform more urgently needed . Seldom has a clearer call been uttered than that of Fernan Caballero , whose La Gaviota appeared in @# 1848 . After all the false coloring and fulsome nonsense of the romantic novels came the healthy dictum of Fernan Caballero : " A novel is not the product of invention , but of observation . " In a letter to a friend she developed this thesis by declaring that it was her only desire to write " in smooth Castilian prose of what really happens in our towns , of what our people think and do in the different classes of our society . " Such statements are forcible as the platform of a new school of realism just coming into prominence . They are truly remarkable when we know that they were made by a woman ( Cecilia Bohl de Faber ) , born in Switzerland in 1796 , the daughter of a Hamburg merchant with literary tastes , and of a Spanish mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversified details that she outlived three husbands , that she was an ardent Catholic , and that she was devoted to her adopted province of Andalusia , living in the neighborhood of Seville until 1877 . It is clear from the preface of La Gaviota that this woman had a distinct purpose upon entering the ranks as a historian of Spanish society . This purpose was ? while cherishing the glorious national tradition and while looking to a new Spain which should rise upon its own wings to happier things ? to set  | her adopted country before the eyes of Europe in its true colors . Fernan Caballero did well to decry that servile foreign imitation which has always wrought havoc with the Spanish national genius . But she contributed nothing toward that political and social regeneration of Spain for which others have more effectively yearned . Hopelessly optimistic , she dwells fondly upon just those peninsular qualities of mediaeval Catholicism , narrow provincialism , and local prejudice , which have enhanced the fiction of Spain while they have impeded national progress ; which , in short , make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all foreign influence , Fernan Caballero succeeded in the task she set herself . She has presented the Andalusian peasant in all the high lights and shades of his peculiar character . One who would know this southern province ? where passions run high , where the luxury of ease and diversion is allowed to replace the necessities of life , where the people are morally aristocrats while remaining material paupers ? should read La Gaviota , Clemencia , La f amilia de Alvareda , and Elia . Fernan Caballero has the faults of a foreigner and of an innovator : she is discursive , almost incorrect as a stylist , over-sentimental in her moral teachings and in her enthusiasm for the humble life which she shared . But her importance is that of the painter of the Spanish life and character . Her most solid qualities are her knowledge of popular tradition and her sympathy with its spirit . It is by these latter qualities that this foreigner was destined to inaugurate a new genre in Spanish literature , ? the regional novel . She lived to see grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers who devoted themselves to the social history of a restricted province . Estebanez Calderon , Juan Valera , and Alarcon carried on the regional novel in Andalusia . Then there is Pereda , with his many novels dealing with the fishing villages around Santander in the north- west ; Senora Pardo Bazars , the Galician novelist ; Alas , and his favorite province of Asturias ; Valdes , who presents the mining populations of this same province . This list of authors may be said to include , with one notable exception , the most distinguished Spanish novelists of the last half-century . They represent a formidable production , of which little idea can be given in a brief survey . They . all deserve to be known outside of Spain by any one who wishes to form at first hand an accurate conception of the Spanish people . Further , they are all in some degree exponents of the regional novel . They have followed Fernan Caballero in utilizing for their local color the social , political , and religious atmosphere of some obscure provincial community with which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their value as historians of a still existent mediaeval society which may soon disappear . Our own American public has shown such favor toward regional novels that we may pause a moment to learn what the Spaniards mean by a novela regional , and what their method of procedure in its production may be . To begin with , it must be understood that Spain is essentially provincial : that is , though a political entity , the provinces are socially distinct . The Andalusian has little in common with the Galician ; Catalonia has totally different traditions and ideals from those of Don Quixote 's La Mancha . No one writer can hope to have a thorough conception of the character of more than one of these isolated provinces . To write a faithful regional novel he must restrict himself to one province , preferably his native province , whose local spirit he has absorbed with his very life blood . A Galdos may discuss broad national questions in a problem novel . But a national novel , in the sense of the term as employed in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Spanish novelist of manners . The varying mixture of Keltic , Roman , Moorish , Gothic , and Gypsy blood prevents  | any literary merger which shall express the traditions and ideals of the entire nation . In Madrid and in Barcelona alone is there a faint suspicion of cosmopolitanism . Spanish novelists , then , have played their strongest card in adhering closely to the life which they know best , instead of falling in with the long line of French chroniclers of Cosmopolis . Pereda , who was the most consistent of the regional novelists , may speak first for the school of writers to which he belonged . He defines the regional novel as one " the subject of which is developed in a district or town which has a life , character , and color of its own , which enter into the work as its principal feature . " Upon this platform Pereda stood so firmly that only the human interest of the drama he unfolds can save his masterpiece ( Sotileza ) from the charge of being narrow . Needless to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , in Escenas montanesas ( 1864 ) , this same eulogist of the good old times thus put his own sentiments in the mouth of one of his characters : ? " I can not help remembering with enthusiasm those antique customs which are nowadays so ridiculed by modern reformers . They nourished me , among them I grew up , and to them I owe the establishment of this family which today surrounds me , and which , though brought up in modern fashion , still respects my hobbies , ' as you gentlemen call them , and permits me to live fifty years behind the times . " Hatred of exterior forces in literature and politics , a passionate sympathy with the drama of life in the humble fishing towns of the Biscayan coast , ? such are the salient traits of the marked personality who was until last year the doyen of Spanish fiction . His novels , with all their localism and difficult dialect , head the list in the genre we are discussing . In so far as Pereda 's theory of the regional novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been echoed by others of his generation . Estebanez Calderon thus prefaces his fragrant short stories , Escenas andaluzas : " Their principal object is to relate and reveal Spanish manners and customs in such fashion as shall be as peculiarly local as possible . " Valdes thus explains his reasons for placing his story El cuarto podcr in an ohscuie locality : " In the small towns and villages , on account of the long , intimate and constant association of the characters , it is possible to penetrate much deeper into the soul of each individual than it is possible to do in the large cities . " The lamented Juan Valera , a man of the world , and , by his training in diplomacy , rather cosmopolitan than provincial , still acknowledged the demands of the national taste in the preface of Juanita la Larga ( 1896 ) : " This kind of novels is now greatly in vogue , an exact copy of reality and not a creation of the poetic spirit . " At the same time he further proclaims himself to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich imagination and invention . " These declarations indicate in what channel the current of fiction has run in Spain since the impulse was given by Fernan Caballero . The work of almost all the writers who hate been mentioned is essentially regional and realistic . Some drama of human passion is set forth with characters and scenerx that are new to us . The appeal to the foreign reader made by these writers is like the appeal to the foreign traveler made by a walking tour through the Spanish provinces . In a regional novel we are not concerned with the right and wrong of political and social institutions . Like the writer in this respect , we accept conditions as they are . We are simply fascinated by the objective presentation of these tableaux of a civilization unknown to us . As I write these words a score of memories crowd in : of bull-fights , street-fights , village dances , rustic wooings , provincial elections , petty ecclesiastical jealousies , noisy . discussions in the cafes and the casinos ,  | convent scandals , and the idle gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has of late had a more serious function than the artistic presentation of genre pictures which should interpret provincial life . It is in the novel and in the drama that the intellectual emancipation of Spain is working itself out . In the toils of medæval superstition until the nineteenth century , Spain has joined in the march of European intellectual progress only within the last half-dozen decades . Her intellectual life is still comparatively stagnant ; her social life is provincial ; her religious life is saturated with superstition and unproductive mysticism ; her political life is unstable and puerile . If we think as we read , all this sad state of affairs is evident from an acquaintance with the regional novel . But , beside the self-satisfied partisans of the mediaeval regime of intolerance , superstition , and intense insularity , we have a group of novelists whose point of view is altogether different . To be sure , controversy has from time to time been introduced into the novels of such facile writers as Valera , Valdes , Alas , and the Jesuit Father Coloma . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We come now to the recognized leader of another school , ? a man who is a thorough iconoclast , the apostle of free thought , a renovator who would put out all the drones from the hive of politics and religion , and hand it over to young workers who are trained in the generous spirit of modern science . Turning our back upon the regional novel and its pictures of the conservative past , we must fix our attention upon the liberal aspirations of young Spain . They are expressed preeminently in the novels and dramas of Don Benito Perez Galdos . That acute and caustic critic , the late Professor Alas , had a profound admiration for Galdos and for the work he is doing for the intellectual emancipation of Spain . Speaking of Gald6s in 1881 , he hails him as " the most appropriate writer to dare to tell the Spanish public , so recently emerged from fanaticism and intolerance , that above the artificial distinctions which create diversity of creeds and parties , there exist the natural laws of human society , ? love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of truth , and love for one 's neighbor . " These words indicate that a campaign of education needed to be undertaken iii Spain . Such is the case , and no one is doing more than Galdos to carry it on in his novels and dramas . The life of Senor Galdos has been very retired . He has said nothing about himself in his novels . We may here direct our attention exclusively to his profession of faith , and to his method of combating the retrogressive tendencies which we have already remarked in Spanish fiction . Of quiet and amiable conversation , a listener rather than a talker , this man for over quarter of a century has been mercilessly showing up in his work one after another of Spain 's sore spots . His popularity , in spite of this antagonistic attitude , is extraordinary . Let us quote once more his best informed critic by way of explanation . The novels of Galdos " do not attack the fold0ns of Catholic dogma , the attack onl customs and ideas which are held with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this proviso could the novels of Galdos penetrate to the very bosom of families in every corner of Spain . This guarded attitude , this prudence is not calculated on the part of Galdos . It is natural for him to write this way . But the result is the same as if Galdos proposed to prepare the ground to preach the most open rationalism . There is , perhaps , in no literature a case similar to that offered by the influence of Galdos upon the public , and by the popularity of his essentially anti-Catholic novels in this Spain of ours , so Catholic , so prejudiced , and , until recently , so intolerant . It should be remembered that there is no civilized country where fanaticism has such deep roots ; and let it be  | borne in mind , too , that Gald6s 's novels have not only influenced free-thinking students and members of the athena ? ums and clubs , but that they have also penetrated the sanctuary of those homes where formerly the spirit was nourished by books of devotion and profane works filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity and beauty . " It is fairly evident from this statement that Galdos holds the interference of the Church in society and politics to be responsible for Spain 's degeneration . His quarrel is not with personal religion , not even with the reasonable administration of public worship by the secular clergy . He is very clear upon that point . But his protest is against the shams , the delusions , the ignorance , which Spanish Catholicism has fostered for its own advantage ; and in the second place , against the interference of ecclesiastical machinery with the life of the family and the policy of the nation . Galdos , then , is a polemical writer . We see at once his field of operations . Without any theory of the universe to hamper him , he strikes off red-hot his arraignments of national abuses . Like his great countrymen , Velasquez and Lope de Vega , Galdos thinks and works simultaneously . The novel grows under his very pen . He works with prodigious rapidity : some years have seen as many as five of his novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a stylist , nor does Galdos covet the reputation of the dignified and elegant Valera . To Galdos the idea is the main thing . On turning to his own works , we are struck by the tremendous force of his revolutionary sentiments . His novels and plays ordinarily present a protagonist as the disputed prey of the darkness of the past , and the brightness of the future . The darkness of the past is made more visible by the paralyzing contact of Spanish Catholicism ; the future is lighted by the rays of applied science and a personal philosophy . In this survey of Galdos 's work we pass over the twoscore volumes of the Episodios nacionales , an unparalleled series of historical novels , upon which their author has been engaged for thirty years . They are naturally objective , and hence fall without our sphere . But in the far greater Novelas contempora'neas , such as Gloria , Dona Perfecta , Leon Roth , and Angel Guerra , Galdos discusses matters of contemporary import . In one form or another he reverts to the vital question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretchedness which has resulted because the Church has not restricted its interest to the care of the soul . As early as 1877 , in Gloria , one of his novels most admired in Spain , Galdos breaks out thus : " Religion ! Still the same horrible goblin that continues to torment us ! Terrible Shadow cast by our conscience , everywhere we meet it ; it does not allow us one free idea , one sentiment , one step of our own volition . It is , in truth , a tremendous fact that what comes from God sometimes seems more like a curse . " At the end of the long novel , in commenting upon that dramatic strife between common sense and religious intolerance which had caused the death of the heroine , Galdos cries out , " The awful quarrel has endured , endures still , and will endure , and before it is settled many other Glorias will succumb , offering themselves as victims to satisfy the formidable monster which stands midway between History and Philosophy , ? a monster which has no name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by joining the most beautiful thing in the world , Religion , with the vilest thing , which is Discord . Yes , many Glorias will succumb , snatching themselves away from a world which they find hateful because of its conflicts , and hastening to present their cause before the absolute Judge . " The vivid pictorial language just quoted is characteristic of Galdos when he launches into one of his impassioned arraignments of human folly . It must be  | remembered that his virulence is not without reason . Feeling runs high in Spain to-day upon the two great matters of common import , politics and religion . Not only in the pulpits and in the national assemblies , but in the clubs and in the tertulias , in private conversation everywhere , the attention is monopolized by enthusiasts upon one or the other of these disputed topics . Is it not strange that the two subjects most commonly avoided in our American society should be those which are most continually discussed in Spain ? Discussion instead of action is the curse of the Spanish people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gald6s , concerned for the intellectual emancipation of his nation , should frequently return to the charge in the hope of inciting his readers to action after all this futile discussion . In his usual pictorial style , he has recently said , " Spain is a bowl full of fishes whose water they have forgotten to change . So the poor little fishes are swimming about with their mouths open , eating each other 's food , breathing and maintaining life as best they may , with a thousand struggles , in their foul water . " These words convey exactly the impression which any thoughtful observer must feel while conversing with young Spaniards in their own country . No people are more aware of the pitiful stagnation of national life , or more powerless to emerge from it . Galdos , as a practical and far-seeing man , believes that the welfare of the nation requires the religious and intellectual emancipation of the individual , the introduction of foreign ideas , and the development of the vast natural resources of the Peninsula . Such a programme sounds simple enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain to understand how difficult is its realization . We may be permitted to make one long quotation from Dona ' Perfecta to bring home the situation to foreign readers . The following conversation takes place between a young engineer , full of modern ideas , and  | is laid out in state . All possible miracles are reduced to those which I do when I please , in my laboratory , with a Bunsen pile , an inductive coil , and a magnetic needle . There are no more multiplications of loaves and fishes except those accomplished by industry with its moulds and machines , and those of the printingpress , which imitates Nature , reproducing from a single type millions of copies . In short , my dear sir , orders have been issued to put out of business all the absurdities , falsities , illusions , dreams , sentimentalities , and prejudices which cloud man 's understanding . Let us rejoice that it is so . " To us , so far removed from medievalism in this respect , such a difference of opinion as that herein indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nay more , it exists in the bosom of families , tearing them apart and dividing them by a wide gulf of misunderstanding and lack of intellectual sympathy . The eighteenth-century feud between theology and science has not yet been patched up . Such a review as this of recent Spanish fiction has not served , perhaps , to bring out the many lovable traits of the @# Spanish character . To know this character is to love it . Nor have the bright possibilities for the future development of national prosperity been more than hinted at . Signs are not lacking , however , that with a better system of education , the elimination of " graft " from government jobs , the exploitation of mining and agriculture , and , most important of all , an injection of energy and ambition into the rising generation , ? a renaissance awaits Spain in the twentieth century . This review will at least have served to indicate the two definite preoccupations of the modern Spanish novel : to give a clean and faithful picture of old Spain , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically the momentous problems of Church and Society which are occupying the intelligent men of the nation . The greatest claim of the Spanish novel is that it is of the soil and that it has something to say . For the American reader who has exhausted the repertoire of French , German , Italian , and Russian fiction , a rich field of information and delight is waiting in the Spanish novel . @#
