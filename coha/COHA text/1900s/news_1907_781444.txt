txt Announcement was made bit B. F. Yoakum yesterday that the mutual agreement by which the Harriman interests and those of the Rock Island Company have controlled the affairspf the Chicago &; Alton . Railroad in alternate years had been abrogated by mutual conscnt , The agreement was entered into In 1904 , and the ? Rock Island interests in their turn have been conducting the affairs of the Chicago &; Alton since last September . It wan the testimony of Rock Island officials regarding t the financing of the Alton by the Harriman interests during . their control of the Chicago &; Al  - -  ton - which gave the Inter-State Commerce Commission last February its first insight into the vethods of the Harriman regime . This natter is still under investigation by the commission , and after a Conference In Washington between the President and members of the commission it was reported that proceedings would be instituted against Mr. Harriman and his associates for offenses against the Inter-State Commerce laws brought out at the Feb/vary hearing . Although it was denied last night by an official of the Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce Commission 's investigation or the more recent conferences between the members of the commission and the President , had anything to do with the decision to abrogate the agreement of control , it is understood that the commission 's attitude toward the Harriman administration of Chicago &; Alton affairs was used as a letter by : the Rock Island interests in bringing the Union Pacific Directors to concurrence in their view that the agreement should be abrogated : Mr. Yoakum stated that the Chicago Alton stockholders will hereafter manage their property . deleted 1 paragraph " At a meeting of the UnionPacific Executive Committee , this communication was submitted for action along with . an opinion of Union Pacific counsel that the agreement was not illegal . The committee authorized me to notify the Rock Island that the Union Pacific would agree to the abrogation of the arrangement , but that it was advised by counsel that - the agreement itself was not illegal . " That is the situation to-day , and the road is therefore under joint control no longer . " Under the agreement the alternate control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have lapsed in 1914 . The- termination of this plan is said to be without prejudice to either party . There will be no change , it was said , in the policy of the road as it has been conducted by the Rock Island contingent in the Directorate since they went into power under the joint control agreement last September . About a month ago James B. Forgan , who was one of the Directors of the Chi-cage &; Alton when the Harriman interests became large ' stockholders in the company , and has since retained his position in the board as a Harriman man , sent in his resignation . His letter came before the meeting of the Directors a fortnight Ergo. and was passed without action . It was then said that it would be left to the Union Pacific interests to choose his successor , thus keeping their representation in the Board up to their quota of five members under the agreement . It has been understood that whatever change in the management of the road might result from the inimical attitude of the Inter-State Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in October . ( inextion as to a Contest . Until it occurs it is impossible to tell whether there will be a contest for ec9 , - trol between the Union Paciflo and the Rock Island . Wall Street will suspect that the Rock Island people , who turned up with their big blocks of Alton almost , overnight , have already picked up , or , at least , located enough of the floating supply to permit it to dominate the Alton ; but this is , of course , only a guess at the best . Op the other hand , it is considered doubtful if the Union Pacific has any notion of contesting the control ' It is believed that the reasons for its purchases by Alton have largely disappeared and that , satisfied with the road 's progress under its management , more than $22,0012,000 having been spent on improvements of one kind or another , with the property , according to an earnings statement of last week , paying interest on its bonds , and dividends on the preferred stock and showing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its interest in Alton .
