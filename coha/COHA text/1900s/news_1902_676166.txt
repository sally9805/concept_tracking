txt Lieut . Robert E. Peary arrived here to-day on the steamship Windward from the arctic regions . He did not reach the north pole in the course of his trip of tour years , but he says that in his last dash with that object in view he made important discoveries . The most northerly point reached was 84 degrees 17 minutes , northwest of Cape Hecla . On board the Windward also was Mrs. Peary , who is just recovering from a fortnight 's illness , and who is glad to reach land once more . She will it is expected , recuperate quickly on proceeding to a more congenial clime . Little Marie Peary and others of the party are in good health . Lieut . Peary is recovering from an accident to one of his legs , which he suffered last Winter . He is slightly lame , although this is not specially noticeable . ? Neither Peary nor Dr. Dedrick , who was on the Windward , would make a statement pertaining to their reported quarrel some time ago . Members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intercourse whatever since the doctor was taken on board at Cape York , where he spent the Winter . Dr. Dedrick leaves here to-morrow for his home in New York . THE WINDWARD 'S CARGO . The Windward is pow lying at the Government wharf here . where she is discharging one of the most interesting cargoes that has ever been landed at this port . Eskimo canoes , sledges , and implements of all kinds , a musk-ox , a walrus , ten of the dogs which dragged Peary 's sledges over many a weary mile of ice , and a hundred other curios , large and small , are being loaded on freight cars . The work is now almost completed . Peary , who received the news of his promotion from the rank of Lieutenant to that of Commander a few hours ago , was kept busy most of the day receiving and answering telegrams and granting interviews to newspaper men . While he states that it is not likely that he will ever visit the frozen North again , it can be clearly seen that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Pole . After attaining to 84 degrees 17 minutes north , within 343 miles of the pole , he can see no reason why to reach the pole is not possible . " If I were a man of independent means , " he said this afternoon , " I would continue my ' explorations until I was successful in reaching the pole , and I would feel certain of success within a very few years . The pole can be reached . There is no question of that . All that is necessary is for a man , I do n't mean any man , but an experienced explorer , to start from Winter quarters somewhere on the eighty-third degree , either from Franz Josef Land or from the north of Greenland . The jourrfey , of course , would have to be made altogether by sledges . " I have only tried to reach the pole during the last four years , and only on one occasion did I have a suitable starting place . In my trip from S1.44 degrees in 1891 my men were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they were in any condition at all at my disposal . " It is now sixteen years since I started my exploration in the Northern wilds , having visited Dasco Bay in 1885 . In 1891 I went out again , and I may say that I have been at it ever since . " What have I accomplished ? Well , I am well satisfied with the result of My labors . It is two years since I discovered that Greenland is an island . In May , 1900 , I reached the most northerly point in Greenland and started down the eastern coast . Then I have charted Cape York , the Whale Souf7d region , Hay Sound , Princess Marie Bav , the land north of Hager Land , and the east coast of Greenland , besides correcting many inaccuracies in previous charts . " In four of my sledge trips , in 2892 , 1894. 1900 , and 1902 , the distances I traveled would have carried me to the pole if I had started from a point on the 83d degree , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point , for once there I would become acclimated . It is just as easy to live on the Sad degree as on the 03d or 73d degree . At all these places musk oxen and hares would furnish supplies . All through the north musk oxen and hares are very plentiful . I have shot as many as twenty-five musk oxen in a day , while a party of three could live off the hares alone . " There is nothing whatever , the explorer says , in the old popular notion of an open polar sea , nor is there any foundation for the claim that the pole is surrounded by an Immovable sea of ice . The water of the polar region is covered with shifting masses of ice . The Natural History Museum will reap a rich harvest as the fruit of Peary 's labors , for he has skins and skeletons of all the animals which are hunted in the barren regions . The rarest of these is the twohorned narwhal , the original of the unicorn . The only specimen which has ever // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peary 's Eskimos at Cape Sabine . LIEUT . PEARY 'S REPORT . Lieut . Peary sent the following report to the Peary Arctic Club : " Left at Erik Harbor . on . the , Ellesmere coast , Aug. 29 . The party reached Fayer Harbor Sept. 10 , crossing Roose Bay partly by sledge and partly by boat , then walking across Bedford Pim Sound . About a week later my Eskimos began to fall sick , not one escaping . By Nov. 19 six adults and one child were dead , nearly all the others very weak , but out of danger . " Early in January Eskimos came across from Anvilik , bringing news of the ravages of a fatal epidemic through the tribe . Word was sent back by these scouts for as many of the survivors as could come to me , and by the end of the month they began arriving . In February a large depot of dog food was established near Cape Louis Napoleon , some sixty miles north of Sabine , On March 3 my advance party of six sledges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 started with the main party of sixteen sledges , leaving Percy in charge at . Payer Harbor . Conger was reached in twelve marches , arriving within an hour or two of the advance party . euy supporting party of Eskimos returning from Conger brought down the instruments , chronometers , and arctic library . Eight marches more took us to Cape-Hecla . The north end of Robinson Channel was all open across to the Greenland coast , lakes of water extending northward as far as could be seen from Black Cape and Cape Ransome . Front Hecla another supporting party returned , " April 1 started northward over the Polar Sea with Henson , four Eskimos , and six sledges . Old floes covered deep with snow and , intersected , with rubble ridges and lanes of young ice , were encountered from the moment we left the ice foot , the same kind of traveling , except the lanes of young ice , as found by the English expedition of . 1876 . " After six marches , open leads , floes in ? motion were encountered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floes bee came smaller , the pressure ridges on a grander scale , and the open leads more frequent . Each day 's match was more ' perilous , and our general course deflected west by the character of the ice . ? IMPOSSIBLE TO GO FURTHER . " Finally , at 84.17 N : latitude , northwest of Hecla , ' the polar packebecame ? impracticable and further efforts ; to advance were given ? up . " New leads and pressure ridges with foggy ' weather , made our returneein some respects more , trying than the advance . Hecla was regained April 29 , and Conger May 5 . Leaving Conger May 5 , Cape Sabine was reached on the 15th . A few days later went north as far as Cape Louis Napoleon to complete the survey of Bobbit Bay , returning the 1st of June . A proposed trip across Ellesmere land westward was prevented by open water in Buchanan Bay . " The ice broke up earlier than in 1001 , and Payer Harbor was blockaded almost continuously . " The Windward bored her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. 5 , and got out again the same afternoon with scarcely fifteen minutes to spare before the harbor . was closed by the ice . Forcing our way across Smith Sound , my Eskimos , with their belongings , were landed in Ingletield Gulf . Several days were devoted to hunting walrus , then tile Windward started south , reaching and leaving Cape York the afternoon of Aug. 28 . " Calling at Godhaven , . and Cape Haven , BaffinLan , the Windward arrived at Chateau Bay , Labrador , Sept. 14 , and sent dispatches . The Summer voyage has been without mishap , and the Windward , with her engines , has made as good time as the larger and more powerful ships that have been going north the past ten years . " The year at Payer Harbor was passed comfortably , though an anxious strain caused by the ravages of disease among my faithful people was not light . Food was abundant , and our supply of musk ex and deer meat continued throughout the year . The northern sledge trip . in the Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering , or danger , more than is necessarily incidental to serious arctic work . " Equipment and personnel were satisfactory , and further advance was vetoed by insuperable natural conditions . The Windward has on board ' the instruments , chronometers , and arctic library abandoned by the Greely expedition : and numerous specimens of natural history , bear , musk ox , reindeer , and ? walrus skins . The skeleton of a two-horned warwhal , a rare arctic specimen ; also living specimens of musk ox , walrus , arctic hare , arid Eskimo dog are on board . " The anchor and chain lost by Erik last Summer are on board . The Fram left Godhaven about Aug. 20. bound home . She has been in Somer Sound , whence , it is understood , explorations were made to the northwest . One death ( a fireman ) is reported since . Others on board said to be well . The little schooner Forget Me Not , which was caught in the ice at Cape Haven last year , is now on her way to St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , and the Windward will probably go to Newfoundland for the Winter . RECEPTION TO PEARY . The citizens of Sydney gave Lieut . Peary a public reception in Alexandra Hall this evening . Mayor Crow presided and addressed to Lieut . Peary an eloquent speech commendatory of his work , - to which the explorer made a brief but effective response , " God Save the King " and " America " were sung by the audience , after which many of those present were presented to Lieut . ' Peary . Lieut . Peary has received an invitation from the Scottish Geographical Society to visit Edinburgh and receive a gold medal , its highest honor . He has also been elected an honorary Fellow of the National Geographic Society , whose headquarters are at Washington , D. C. Mrs. Peary said to-night : . . " I have naturally taken a keen interest in arctic exploration . Like my husband ; I have been cured of the arctic fever to some extent , but it still runs in , my veins . This has been , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely make another trip in search of the pole . I do not know whether I should accompany him or not if he did , but I think that I would . " LIEUT . PEARY 'S POLAR WORK . Lieut . Peary , while he failed to reach the North Pole , as he set out to do , it is believed has contributed as much to the fund of knowledge about the . frozen North , and sacrificed as much in the ; causeas any living Arctic explorer . Lieut . Peary 's work in the North covers a period of . almost one full score of years . In 1886 , when exploratiorein Greenland had been immensely stimulated . through the trips of Prof. A. E. Nordenskjold , the Swedish explorer who later discovered the northeast passage , and through that of Fritjof Nansen , Lieut . Peary undertook an exploration to Greenland , and accomplished ' more than either of the eminent Scandinavians . In that year Lieut . Peary , starting from Disco , succeeded in making has way fifty miles inland on the ice cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done best , had only succeeded in 1=reaching a point forty miles from the coast . In 1891 Lieut . Peary wintered at McCormick Bay , in Greenland , and in the Spring of 1892 the again started across the inland ice . During the Summer of that year Lieut . Peary reached Independence Bay , 81 degrees 37 minutes north . In 1893 and in 1895 Lieut . Peary again made trips of extraordinary danger and difficulty to the interior of Greenland . In these trips he carried the latitude of the territory which had been explored 2 degrees further north and the longitude 15 degrees further west , considered a notable achievement . Lieut . Peary returned from the latter of these expeditions on Sept. 21 , 1895 . GREENLAND EXPEDITION . In May , 1896 , Lieut . Peary made a. very successful expedition to Greenland for the purpose of collecting natural history specimens . Prom this trip Lieut . Peary returned to Sydney , Cape Breton , in September of the same year . . In 1898 the explorer started on the trip from which ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for the exploration of Greenland , he engaged in what was probably his last arctic trip with the avowed , purpose of reaching the , , Nerth Pole . A NOTABLE DISCOVERY . The most notable of these discoveries he accomplished- when on May 8 , 1900 , accompanied by one white man and an Eskimo , he reached the northern extremity of Greenland , and rounding it by this means determined beyond a doubt that it was an island . In Lieut . Peary 's own estimation the most important results of his work in 1000 were : To accomplish this purpose Lieut . Peary intended to establish a base of supplies as far north as possible on the west coast of Greenland . and to proceed from that point northward by sledge journeys to the pole . His vessel , the Windward , left New York on July 2 , 1898 , and went to Sydney , Cape Breton , where Lieut . Peary joined the expedition . In August Lieut . Peary reached Allman Bay , where his vessel became ice-bound for the ' period of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peary in exploring the coast southwest of Allman Bay . During this period Lieut . Peary visited Fort Conger , on Lady Franklin Bay , Grinnell Land , where the Greely expedition made its headquarters in 1881 . A period of several months followed , during which Lieut . Peary was incapacitated from active work . His feet had been badly frostbitten and the amputation of several toes was made necessary . The three years which followed have been used by Lieut . Peary to the best advantage . He surveyed a part of the unknown coast of Melville Bay , on the west coast , and a series of other geographical discoveries which may serve to rectify earlier surveys and correct existing maps of Greenland . " First  --  The rounding of the northern limit of the Greenland Archipelago , the most northerly known land in the world . probably the most northerly land . Second  --  The highest latitude yet attained in the Western Hemisphere ( 83 degrees 50 north . Third  --  The determination of the origin of the so-called paleocrystic ice , floe berg , &c..; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peary has traveled. 2,400 miles or more on the inland ice cap . lie has made two trips across Grinnell Land . and contributed much to the knowledge of Its shape and extent . Lieut . Peary has been further north than any other American explorer . Besides being  --  the pioneer explorer in extreme northern lands , his work has been considered more earnest and more useful than that of those whose only aim has been to reach the north pole . In the task of approaching the north pole Lieut . Peary has been Less successful than both the Duke of the Abruzzi , who reached 86 degrees 33 minutes north , and Explorer Nansen. who reached 86 degrees 14 minutes north . Lieut . Peary only succeeded in going as far ' north as 84 degrees 17 minutes .
