txt November corn touched 50 cents to-day . It made an advance of 5 cents a bushel for the day , of 10 cents for the week , and of almost 1 : cents , within four weeks . Young George . H. Phillips sold what . corn changed hands at 50 cents . Shorts did the buying that advanced the market to that quotation . The five-cent advance . over the close of last week made the day the notable one so far for the campaign . A roar and a cheer gave notice of the half-dollar achievement , and there was a flocking toward the already overcrowded corn pit from all over the floor . The tiptop figure was made in the first hour , November starting at 46 , selling between 46 and 50 cents , and closing at 40 cents . The slight final recession was , like the others which have been experienced , brought about by selling by the bull leader . The man with a corner in the hollow of his hand is apparently not ready to let it get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men with corners , and believed that most of them lost because of their greed to extort the last penny . All the morning the little " corn king " stood at the edge of the pit and watched the ebb and flow of the haute . Whenever the clamorous " shorts " howled up the price in the face of unresponsive takers he pushed to the front of the line and let out more corn . Some of the dealers thought the juvenilelooking speculator was in straits and was running to wind up his string . They jumpea on the market and tried to sell corn at - i0/2 . Phillips turned instantly from seller to buyer , from bear to bull , and snapped up every man who was offering to shade the price that he was making . The decline stopped at once . Phillips showed to the corn pit that he was its master ; that he could regulate it at will . The men who tried to get some of the corn king 's money , in the delusion that he was weakening , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing price was 49 cents , a reaction due to Phillips 's buying . It was significant to some traders that the firms who are reported to be at the mercy of Phillips have not given any sign of extreme worry . They have not shown their hands in the pit . There Is still some talk of special trains coming from the country with corn enough to make good the obligations to Phillips . To the outsider there is no sign of this predicted movement . The receipts for the day , including Sunday . were more than IWO cars ; not more than 10 per cents . graded No. , 2 . Compared to the requirements for settling day , . this was not a drop in . the bucket . Advices from the corn belt are that corn is danip and ' ' under ' grade . ' Very little of ? the Tiew crop has , been taken from , the husk.The rains of the past two weeks have stopped outdoor operations . The . excited market was the unmistakable admission , of the corn trade that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some of the other brokers , who tried to nurse a little corner in November corn last Summer , and who got tired of doing so about the time they had worked the bulk of the contract corn off the market and left a smooth path for their successor , envy Phillips . but they are not throwing anything in his path . Phillips 's conduct to-day won him great praise . Few men have been able to keep a cool head under like circumstances . He parted with 300,000 bushels , about one-tenth of his holdings . He bought 100,000 when the bears tried to drag him off his pedestal . He made 830,000 . Apparently he is going to keep the settling price around 50 cents . If the " shorts " are meditating a coup on the last day they may wake up to find that Phillips has closed out his line . He claims now that he can not be squeezed . whatever may happen . As long as he keeps on selling more than he buys and holds the market down to 50 cents he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hit corner . Other speculators have been broken by buying at a big price in order to hold up the market and playing their funds on margins . George A. Seaverns is said to he giving aid to Phillips . Some think the elevator man is backing his former employe in the trade . At any rate , the drying and cleaning house of Seaverns , which in the past has been able to turn out contract corn with great rapidity in times of stress , has not added a bushel to the supply since the Phillips corner has developed . Mr. Seaverns 's inactivity is not credited to pure benevolence . To-day 's price of corn is the highest since June , 1895. when a predicted famine ran the price for corn up . December corn felt the influence of the short grading in November , and went up half a cent over Saturday . COLONEL OF TWENTY-THIRD . Gen. Alfred C. Barnes was last night elected Colonel of the Twenty-third Regi ? ? ment , N. G. N. Y. , in Brooklyn . Capt . Jasper Ewing Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected Lieutenant Colonel .
