txt // read on p. 276 ) leave our thoughts almost entirely to themselves ; they give hardly any hints as to their organisation , and leave our single ideas , which correspond to separate words , to stand by the side of each other in unrelated independence ( in beziehungsloser selbstandigkeit ) ; the speaker is not led to analyse them , and must rest contented with marking a few rough distinctions between principal and subordinate conceptions . " It will be seen that this is not exactly the same thing as the view attributed to Waitz by Sayce . " In opposition to this ( we further read ) the polysynthetic languages force the speaker as much as possible to grasp each conceptual whole as a unity , to join subordinate ideas as closely as possible to the principal idea , to view as it were at a glance the whole situation , that has to be rendered in speech , and not to make the modifications be added piecemeal and little by little to what is the chief element of thought ; these languages hinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first ( or isolating ) class . " As for flexional languages , Waitz seems to look upon them as standing higher than the others , but his expressions are somewhat vague and partly contradictory ; on pp. 275 and 277 he says it is characteristic of flexion that secondary subordinate elements of thought are expressed by sounds which have no meaning of their own , but are inserted as integral portions of the main word ; while on p. 276 we read : " The fundamental idea of flexion is that the principal and the subordinate elements of thought remain in THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE . iii dependent and separate , and never coalesce into a single word " . Sayce quotes this passage , but I fail to understand how Waitz 's expressions can be interpreted as implying the inferiority of flexional languages . 99. ( 51 ) But , if the theory I looked for was not to be found in Waitz 's work , it is in SAYCE 'S ; although he does not give it as his own , and although he can hardly be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great influence I'rof . Sayce 's works on linguistics have had on me ; his suggestive remarks have often made me take up lines of thought which perhaps I should not have been led to , if it were not for him . So much the more must I from my point of view regret that this bold opposer of the idola of the ordinary linguistic school is in some very important points as much warped by prejudices as most other philologists . " Though he repeatedly hints at the difficulties of drawing a sharply-defined line of division between agglutinating and fluxional languages , yet he holds that there is a great gulf fixed between them , and he says : " The Finnic idioms have become so nearly inflexional as to have led a recent scholar to suggest their relationship to our Arian group ; nevertheless , they have never cleared the magical ! frontier between flexion and agglutination , hard as it may be to define , since to pass from agglutination to inflexion is to revolutionise the whole system of thought and language and the basis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past psychological history and tendencies of a speech " .1 Revolutions do , however , take place in the world of languages , even if they take more time than it takes the French to change their constitutions : if a thousand years suffices to change a type of speech like that of King Alfred into the totally different one of Queen Victoria , then the much longer period which palaeontologists and zoologists accord to mankind on this earth could work still greater wonders . In spite of such expressions as this , " Species passes gradually into species , class into class , " Sayce stands , with regard to those three or four types of speech which are distinguished by linguists , in much the same attitude which naturalists kept with regard to the notion of " species " before Darwin carne ; he uses the same sort of expressions , e.g. : " With all this gradual approxima-tion the several types of language still remain fixed and distinct " . 100. ( 51 ) Neither is he right in his manner of viewing the value of phonetic attrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , of Chinese as a " decrepit " language ( i. , 372 ) , that " has been affected by phonetic decay to an enormous extent " ( ibid. ) , and " the whole speech has grown old and weather-beaten . It is the Mandarin dialect which chiefly shows these marks of ruin " ( ii. , 221 ) . We are here reminded of Schleicher 's words ( above , ? 6 ) that the languages which we speak now-a-days in North-western Europe are " senile // specimens of speech , " and we search in vain for any real thought in connexion with such expressions . A language which is old , weather-beaten , and decrepit , which is perhaps ? that is only one step further ? falling into dotage and second childhood ! what can this mean ? Are the English no longer able to express their thoughts by means of their language ? Is the speech of the Chinese like that of an old toothless crone , whose ideas and sounds are equally incoherent ? Similarly , Sayce does not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noundeclension which has taken place in historic times ; he says : " The history of the noun is one of continuous decay . . . . Long before the age of Arian separation , . . . the creative epoch had passed , and the cases and numbers of the noun had entered on their period of decay " ( ii. , 149-150 ) . And although the pages he devotes to the relative estimation of languages ( i. , 374 sqq. ) contain many excellent and suggestive remarks , and begin by stating the true l , rim iple , " what we really mean when we say that one language is more advanced than another , is that it is better adapted to express thought " ; yet the writer does not go the full length of his own opinion , for on the very next page he tells us that it is all a matter of taste : " Preferences of this kind can as little be referred to an absolute standard as preferences in the matter of personal beauty . The European , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro , and the Negro from the Mongol . " On some of the most vital points , Sayce has not attained to a settled and consistent belief . 101. ( 52 ) In favour of the theory here expounded it may be said that it leads on every point to a mon-istic view ; while Schleicher , though clearly perceiving that all science and philosophy tends in our days towards monism , ' is yet by the very nature of his standpoint obliged to set up a dualism in some de-cisive points . Thus , he establishes an opposition between phonetic decay and simultaneous develop-ment of richer resources in syntax and style ; while according to our view the evolution in both departments goes hand in hand , if we consider phonetic evolution rightly as an evolution towards shorter and easier forms . Inseparable from this is another dualism of Schlei-cher 's , according to which grammar falls into two sharply divided parts : on the one hand , phonology and morphology , " the nature side of language , " which is to be treated as a natural science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , syntax and style , " the more spiritual side of language , which is to a greater exTHE // tent subject to the free determination of the individ-ual , " and which is therefore to be treated by the liter-ary student ( der philologe ) on the historical method . ' In contrast to this view it must be asserted that there is only one method for the whole of the science of language , and that a separation of grammar into two divisions , treated independently of each other , has only been , and can only be , injurious to the right understanding of linguistic phenomena ; for form and meaning always influence each other to a degree unsuspected by readers of philological periodicals . Fancy just for one moment a division of a dictionary into two parts , one of them containing the forms of words without the least regard to their significations , and the other marshalling up nothing but the mean-ings . But as syntax is nothing but the theory of the functions , i.e. , meanings , of the grammatical forms ? this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tones ? it will be seen that many recent " grammars on a compara-tive basis " correspond only too closely to the first part of the supposed dictionary . And this one-sided-ness can not possibly be conducive to scientific pro-gress. 102. ( 53 ) The most important of Schleicher 's dual-isms , however , is that of two periods of directly oppo-site tendencies , a prehistoric period of progress , evolution , or construction , and an historic period of retrogression , decay , or destruction . In opposition to this view we must assert that the moment of a nation 's entering into history is of no consequence at all for the direction of linguistic change , which goes on in an essentially identical manner now and in the days of old . If history has any influence at all on linguistic evolution , it seems to be only that of accelerating the movement along the same lines as before ; the languages of those nations whose lives have been most agitated by historical events have gone farthest in evolution . Besides the more lively exchange of thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , ? ? 140 , 143 ) ; an interesting contrast is that between the slow development of Lithuanian , which is rendered so precious to the antiquarian philologist by the great number of old forms which it has kept , and the rapid evolution of English , which on account of its great number of directly observable changes is an inestimable mine to the philosopher of linguistic history . On the other hand , literature , which Schleicher places side by side with history , certainly , though perhaps not so powerfully as generally supposed , has the effect of retarding the tendencies of change in language by keeping older forms alive for a longer time than if language was only transmitted orally . But these accelerating and retarding agencies have no influence on the direction of change . If the theory arrived at in the preceding chapters is really and completely monistic , and requires us at no point to assume any breach of continuity , it must // also throw some light on that vexed question , the origin of speech . I think it does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this book to show that ; but before venturing out into that chaos of grey theories , it will be well for some time still to continue studying the " golden tree of life " in the development of some special points of the English language . CHAPTER VI . ENGLISH CASE-SYSTEMS , OLD AND MODERN . 103. ( 54 ) The arrangement of inflexions current in grammars , according to which all cases of the same noun , all tenses , persons , etc. , of the same verb , are grouped together as a paradigm , is not a truly grammatical one : what is common to Old English dceg ? dcege ? dceges ? da ; as ? da ur ? daga , ? for instance , is not the flexional clement , but the word , or stem of the word ; the tie between all these forms , accordingly , is not of a grammatical , but of a lexical character . That such an arrangement may offer some advantages from a practical point of view can not , indeed , be denied ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wrested from one another which belong together grammatically , e.g. , the termination - um , which is common to the dative plural of all the flexional classes . Besides , it forces us to separate from one another the two parts of grammar which treat respectively of the forms of words and of their uses . In the latter , we must of needs deal with ( say ) all datives under one head , all genitives under another , and so forth , while in accidence these forms ( 138 ) // are distributed according to declension classes . Such a disjunction , however , of accidence and syntax , beyond what is strictly necessary , is doubtless injurious in every respect ( cf. above , ? lot ) . At any rate , this paradigmatic arrangement of grammatical phenomena will not answer the purposes of this chapter , where we seek to get as perspicuous a survey as possible of the grammatical forms of two distinct stages of one and the same language . 104. ( 55 ) Many works of comparative philology , however , employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more by itself , so that either ( as iii Schleicher 's Compendium ) the accusative singular , for example , is treated separately in each language , or ( as in Brugmann 's Grundriss ) the mode of formation of one definite case in one definite class of nouns ( i-stems , etc. ) is followed out through all the allied tongues . According to this arrangement all those facts are brought into a single class which are related to one another from the point of view of a student of comparative philology ; but , as an inevitable consequence , the survey of the forms of any one language ( or stage of language ) is obscured ; the unity of time and place is effaced ; and , moreover , we get only a formal conception of the phenomena . The morphological element has been brought to the front at the expense of the syntactical , which has to be treated in another section , so that the constant reciprocal action of form and function is generally lost sight of . // 105. ( 56 ) Lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement . The grammar of a language is , as it were , an answer to the question , What general means of expression does such and such a language possess ? 1 Now , by the purely grammatical arrangement the methods of expression existing in a particular language at a particular time are tabulated in such a manner that those forms come together which are grammatically analogous . By this arrangement , forms which belong together from a dictionary point of view , e.g. , dreg , dcege , are wrested from one another , and the same may be the case with forms which belong together historically , e.g. , Old English nominative plural neuter /tofu and word ; it is true that they were once formed with the same ending , but an Englishman of King Alfred 's time could not possibly be aware of this point of agreement . Clearly by this mode of treatment the individual element , by which I mean that which is peculiar to each language or to each successive stage of language , is brought more distinctly into view ; we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each particular language : we see plainly where the differences between the various cases are so well marked that they can easily be kept distinct , and where they bear such a close resemblance to each other in form or function , or in both alike , as to run the risk of being levelled and blended . In an ideal language it would be an easy matter to // carry out such an arrangement : since each modification of meaning would have its own expression , which would be constant for all cases and quite unambiguous , a separation of accidence and syntax would be precluded , ipso facto ; whether we should say , the genitival relation is expressed by -a , or -a denotes the genitive , would be quite immaterial . 106. ( 57 ) Not so in the idioms actually existing or recorded with their countless freaks of chance and capricious exceptions . In Latin , for example , -i siiinctilnes denotes the genitive singular , sometimes ( 1w nominative plural , and if , conversely , we ask how the genitive singular is formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now by - is , etc . Consequently , we get two different modes of arrangement , according as we take as our base I. Analogies of form ( such and such a termination expresses such and such a meaning ) ? the morphological classification , or , I I. Resemblances of function ( such and such a relation is signified by such and such terminations ) ? the syntactical classification . The two arrangements stand to one another as the two parts of a dictionary , in one of which the form ( say , some German or French vocable ) is given , and the signification sought ( in other words , the English equivalent is appended ) : in the other , the meaning is the known quantity , and the appended part is the German or French term which was required to be known . // 107. ( 58 ) Before attempting to give a synopsis , arranged upon these principles , of English casesystems at different epochs of the growth of the language , I have to premise with regard to Old English that , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main , West-Saxon forms , though for a thorough understanding of the historical process of development of Standard English it would have been better if I had been in a position to avail myself of a Mercian , or , still better , a London grammar representing the language as spoken about the year Boo . Again , in stating the function , I shall have to be very brief , and content myself with merely giving names , leaving it to the reader to understand by " dative " ( for example ) ? not the notion of dative in itself , for such a notion has no existence , but ? " Old English dative " . For the particular use which English people of a thousand years ago made of their dative case , I must refer to the Old English syntax , which is , unfortunately , still to be written . In the present chapter I can give nothing but a skeleton-like scheme , which does not aim at completeness . 108. ( 59 ) It will not fail to meet with general approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed SIEVERS 'S excellent Angelsachsische Grammatik ( 2 Aufl. , 1886 ) . In accordance with my general views , however , as stated above , I shall differ from Sievers in paying much more regard than he does to what would naturally appear to King Alfred and his contemporaries as the significant element in // language : I shall have to separate word and case-ending , as far as this is feasible , in the same manner as the instinctive linguistic sense of that time would have done , regardless of the prehistoric condition of things . Old English eage , for instance , is historically , it is true , an n-stem ; but for my present purposes I shall have to look upon it as consisting of eag + the nominative ending -e , the genitive being eag - I-  an , and so on . We want a special term for this distinction ; and I propose to call the substantial part of the word , felt as such by the instinct of each generation as something apart from the ending ( eag in the example chosen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic " stem " . No doubt , in some cases it will depend on a more or less arbitrary choice , how much of the traditional form is to be treated as kernel and how much as ending . For instance , eage itself might be said to be the kernel , the genitive ending being -n , before which the e of the kernel is changed into a . This division would , however , seem to be unnatural for Old English ; although so much must be granted , that in Middle English we must look upon eie ( not as the kernel , to which the ending -n is affixed in the nominative plural . ' The fact is , that along with the perpetual wearing away of words there is often an alteration in the Iceling as to the relations of kernel and ending . // Now a little more , now a little less may be included in one or the other , exactly as when one generation considers the sound-combination anaddere as consisting of a + naddere , whilst the next looks upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , or when mime uncle is transmuted into my nuncle. 109. ( 6o ) It will be seen that if Old English eage is said to be an n-stem , what is meant is this , that at some former period the kernel of the word ended in -n , while , as far as the Old English language proper is concerned , all that is implied is that the word is inflected in a certain manner . If , therefore , in the following pages , I shall speak of n-stems , istems , etc. , it is only as designations for classes of declension . It follows , however , from my view that we are not properly entitled to put down , eg. , wyrm as an i-stem , for by doing so we should fail to give a true picture of the real condition of things in the Old English period . If a modern linguist is able to see by the vowel-mutation ( umlaut ) that wyrm was an i-stem , an Englishman of that time could not have suspected any such thing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those of ( the o-stems , e.g. ) dom . When Sievers reckons wyrm among i-stems , or gives szge as an es- os-stem , he is writing for the benefit of those who take only a secondary interest in Old English grammar , and care chiefly for the way in which it reflects prehistoric phenomena . He is thinking little of those other students who make the first object of their investigaENGLISH // tion the mutual relations of the facts of a language at a definite historical epoch , and who go to the study of Old English partly for the sake of seeing the mechanism of this particular idiom as an organically connected whole , partly with a view to seeking in it the explanation of later developments of the l ? nglish language . 110. ( 61 ) In the succeeding tabulations the follmvin ; ; abbreviations are used : Table // Italicised letters indicate the stem ( class of declension ) : ? o ( words like do n , hof , word ; by others termed a-stems ) , i , etc. ; c=those consonantal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as n , r . What is said about the d-class applies likewise to the wiz-stems with a long vowel or a diphthong preceding the w ( S , ? 259 ) , so that , in mentioning wd , I only mean those in which the w is preceded by a consonant ( S , ? 26o ) ; the jd-stems are only referred to when they present deviations froin the other dstems ( g p ) ; abstr. - - words lilac stre ? q-u ( S , ? 279 ) . n a p n ob must be read : nominative and accusative plural of neutral o-stems consisting of an originally short syllable . 1 .

Where the i-mutation is found through all cases as in cynn , it does not concern us here . // ( 2 ) U-mutation , o n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an early period , leaving perhaps but one trace , in the differentiation of cliff and cleeve , see Murray 's Diet . and my Steadier over Engelrhe Kasus , ? 198 ; other instances of u-mutation , see S , ? ? 241 , 253 , anm. 1 , Cosijn , ii. , p. 3 ( cncoht ) ; comp. also cucu , cwices , Sievers , P. P. lieitr. , ix. , 259. ( 3 ) Interchange of re and a , found with greatest phonetic regularity in st. adj. hwaet , hwates hwate , while in the nouns ( of the o-class ) ce is carried through in the singular and a in the plural deg , dages  - -  dagas . After a palatal consonant we have the peculiar change seen in geat , gatu , which is by-and-by levelled out in different ways . Note also gers , grasu . For the still more complicated change in magu m.ccge(s) , plural m:ecga(s) magum , see Kiuge , Literaturblatt f. germ. u. rom . I'hilol. , 1889 , 134 , and Paul 's Grundrass , i. , 368. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : maeg , magas ; in an aenne , long a and short ce interchange . ( 5 ) Interchange of single and double consonant : cyn , cynnes , S , ? 231 ; in the nominative cynn is also found , and it is not easy to see if the difference is only a graphical one or indicates a real difference in pronunciation . There is a tendency to utilise the difference for sense-distinguishing purposes in mann , " man , " and man , corresponding to French hommeon , or still more closely to Danish nand , man , see Cosiin , ii. , p. 47. ( 6 ) Interchange between final voiceless and medialENGLISH // voiced consonants : wulf , wulves ( written wulfes ) , hus , huze ( written huse ) , bap bai5as ; see my Stitcher over Engelske Kasus , ? 193 if . The related interchange between hand g : beah , beages ; h also interchanges with w : horh , horwes , the adj. ruh , ruwes ( old " grammatical change , " determined by Verner 's law ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forms with no consonant , but with contractions and perhaps lengthening of the vowel : fifth , furuni ( ? forum ) , sc(c)uh , sc(e)os , feoh , dative , fen . here we very often see levellings , the /e-less form being as a rule generalised . Interchange between forms with and forms without w : treo , treowes , later on levelled both ways : treo , treos ; treow , treowes ; compare also sna(w) , S , ? ? 174 , nr. 3 , 250 , anm . I. The forms are differentiated in " law " and w " marriage , " S , 269 , anm. 3 . Interchange between e or i , u or o and the corresponding vowel-like consonants j and w : here , herias , herigas , hergeas , herigeas ; bearu , bearwas ( L bearuw , bearuwas ) . ( 1o ) Interchange between the advanced and palatalised open g in dg and the back open g in claps ; 1 so also byrig , burgum . In the latter word // we have four sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllable ; ( b ) the vowel of the svarabhakti-syllable , which is also often left out ; ( c ) the voiceless and voiced consonants , see above sub 6 and 7 ; ( d ) the palatalised and unpalatalised consonants . ( 1 I ) Vowel change in unstressed syllables , due to an old gradation ( ablaut ) : - ung , ingum ( S , ? 255 , anm. 1 ; see however Cosi n , ii. , pp. 21 , 22 ) ; bro6or , brei5er ; morgen , mergen ; see , for instance , Oros. , L. 194 , 12 , on mergen = C. 92 , 40 , on morgen . ' Interchange between a full vowel in final syllables and a weakened one in the middle of the word : rodor , roderas , S , ? 129 . Interchange between preserved and omitted weak vowel : cngel , engles ; deofcl , ( leaks ; see especially S , ? 144 . At a later period this leads some-times to a differentiation of consonants , pointed out for en , el by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 188 . Interchanging vowel quantity is probable before many consonant groups ; an indubitable case in point is did , cildru. 124. ( 75 ) A comparison of Old English with Proto-Arian will show that a good many case-endings have been given up , and that similarly the change of accent and that of vowels ( by gradation ) have disappeared from the declension ; nor does the Germanic inter-change of consonants according to Verner 's law play // any part in the declension ( compare , however , ? 123 , 7 and 11 ) . l Wherever the Old English language shows traces of these phonetic changes , it is always so that one form has been carried through in all cases , so that the other is only shown by the corre-sponding word in other connected languages , or by other derivatives from the same root . See on these traces especially Joh . Schmidt in Kuhn 's Zeitsc/erzft , xxvi. , p. 8 If. , and Plura/bilclun . en o'er in ' , . Neutra , passion ; Kluge in Kuhn 's Zeitschr. , xxvi. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grlrnc/rlss , i. , p. 387 ? 125. ( 76 ) It is of greater importance to our subject to examine the extent in which cases which were dis-tinguished either at an earlier stage of the language or in other Old English words , have coalesced in one and the same word . Such coalescence of cases is found very frequently , though sometimes the form which is identical with that used in another case is not the only one in use for that particular case . ( 1 ) a s. = n s. in all words except ( a ) d giefu ar , accusative giefe are ; from this class the distinction is transferred to i 1 ben , bene , instead of the older ben , ben , while on the other hand the late O. E. levelling , by which for instance loft/ comes to be used through the whole of the singular , obliterates the distinction . n mf guma tunge , accusative guman tungan. pron. and st. mf.

( 77 ) This list , which does not include indeclinabilia like strengu , shows that the chances of mistakes were pretty numerous in Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any case , except only dative plural ; sunu is everything except genitive ( singular and plural ) and dative plural ; dura is everything except nominative , accusative singular and dative plural ; fader may be any case in the singular ; so also sweostor , which may moreover be nominative or accusative plural ; the only thing we can affirm on such forms as guman or tungan is that they are neither nominative singular , dative plural , nor genitive plural , and in a late text we can not even be sure of that , and so on . II . SYNTACTICAL CLASSIFICATION . 127. ( 78 ) In the following survey of the manners in which the syntactic categories are expressed in Old English , I have not found it necessary to indicate 16o PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE . in each case which stems had each ending , as I should then have had to repeat much of what has been said above . A dash denotes the unchanged kernel ; -a denotes the kernel with an a added to it ; + means the mutated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endings are printed in black type , the rare forms or endings are put in O. Nom. sg. ? ; -a , -e , -u , ( - an ) . pl. - as , ? , - an , -a , -e , -u , + , ( - ru , - es ) , ( -n , +e ) .

( 8o ) I now pass to a similar survey of the caserelations and their expression in MODERN ENGLISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with the really spoken language , taking no account of what belongs only to the written language , e.g. , the distinctions made between gen. sg. king 's nom. pl. kings gen. pl. kings ' lady 's ladies ladies ' . The three forms sound alike , and the systematic difference now made between them is quite recent . Before the middle of the eighteenth century they were all of them written alike ; thus we find for instance in the original editions of Shakespeare , Kings , ladies , for the three cases . The apostrophe was at that time used ( without any regard to case-function ) where a syllable was added in pronunciation ( Thomas 's ) , or where the spelling - es was still commonly used , the apostrophe being then used to indicate that no new syllable was to be pronounced ( compare the modern spelling stabb 'd ) ; in Shakespeare you will find , e.g. , earth 's as a genitive singular and prey 's as a nominative plural . Sometimes the apostrophe is even in our ( lays used before the plural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -e in Danish gode gud with the Latin and Greek vocative ending is , of course , wrong , but that does not make his syntactical observation less correct . II // speare 's Twelfth Night ( ii. , 5 , 96 ) the spelling " her very C 's , her U 's , and her T 's " is kept unchanged in modern editions ; and the same manner of spelling may be found also in proper names , especially when they are not familiar to English readers ( Hrolf 's , in Carlyle , Heroes , 29 ) ; similarly in fly 's ( carriages ) as opposed to the more familiar flies ; compare also the Spectator , No. 8o , where Steele speaks of the manner in which people use " their who 's and their whiches " .1 Conversely the apostrophe is not written before every s denoting the genitive : whose , its , hers , yours being the received spelling , while it is true that some people write her 's and your 's . In dealing with the forms of the spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them in their usual spelling , though it would , of course , have been more consistent had I written all my examples phonetically . The abbreviations will be the same as in the Old English section , as far as they are needed ; " a. " means the modern accusative , dative , or common oblique case ( him , etc. ) ; " abs. " stands for the absolute form of the possessive pronouns ( mine , etc . ) . I. MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION . 130. ( 81 ) A. The kernel of the word unchanged . ( I ) n a s. in all words ; as exceptions might be mentioned those few pronouns which have separate forms for the accusative ( meus , himherthem ) . // ( 2 ) n a p. ( a ) you . ( b ) sheep and deer . ' ( c ) the ordinary compounds of - man , gentleman and gentlemen being pronounced alike ; so postmen , policemen , etc. some words ending in -s z : e.g. , means , species . many words are unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collectively : six pair of gloves ; twenty-three snipe ; people , fowl , fish , cattle , etc. 131. ( 82 ) B. The ordinary s ending . ( that is : the sounds - iz added to a sibilant s , z , sh , zhl ; the sound -s after a voiceless non-sibilant ; the sound -z after a voiced non-sibilant. ) g s. in all nouns and some pronouns : prince 's , duke 's , king 's , whose , somebody's. n a p. in the majority of nouns and some pronouns : princes , dukes , kings , somebodies. g p. in the same words as under ( b ) , if the g p. can at all be used : princes ' , dukes ' , kings ' ( some-bodies ' ) . The same ending denotes the idea of genitive in all those plurals which are not formed by the addition of -s : men 's , gentlemen 's , children's. absolute : ours , yours , hers , theirs . 132. ( 83 ) C. Other endings . - S. n a p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n a p. in oven . abs. in mine . 133. ( 84 ) 1l . Change in the kernel. without any ending . nap. : men , women , geese , teeth , feet , pnice , lice . The plural forms these and those might be mentioned here or perhaps better under ( 3 ) , as - se z is felt as a sort of plural ending . with the ending - Yen ( or -n ) . n a p. children ( brethren ) . with the -s ending . n a ( g ) p. wives ( and wives ' ) and others in f ; paths and others in th , houses , the change in the kernel consisting here in the substitution of the voiced for the voiceless sound . ' As an ulterior case in point might be mentioned the frequent omission of the i- sound in such plurals as months , sixths , elevenths , etc . In words ending in - nd the plural is frequently pronounced without the d : soun(d)s , etc . We are perhaps allowed to consider Shakespeare 's rhyming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as an early instance of this pronunciation . an entirely new kernel is finally used to distinguish cases in some pronouns : I , me , we , us , etc. // 134. ( 85 ) Coalescence of formerly distinct cases is found very extensively . n a p. = n a s. in the words mentioned above , A 2. g p. = g s. consequently in nearly all the same words . The three cases : gen. sg. , nom. ( and acc. )  |p1.  , and gen.  |p1.  , have become identical in nearly all words , so that you can very soon enumerate the very few words in which they differ from each other , namely : All the three cases are different : child 's , children , children 's ; similarly with man , woman , and finally with a few words where the gen. pl. is , however , scarcely used at all : tooth , goose , mouse , louse ; dice , Pence , oxen ; compounds on the model of son-in-law would belong here if genitive plurals , like sons-inlaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from n a p. , which is identical with g p. : wife 's , wives , wives ' and the other word mentioned under D 3 . The two genitives are different from the two noininatives in the nouns mentioned under A 2. 135. ( 86 ) A comparison with Old English will show that all the vocalic and most of the nasal caseendings have been abandoned ; the changes of the kernel have been considerably limited so that more particularly those which were not in themselves sufficient to distinguish cases have been given up ; further we see that one difference , which was unknown to Old English , has been made subservient to casedistinguishing purposes ( O. E. genitive wulfes , nomina166 PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE . tive plural wulfas , both of them pronounced with v ; modern , wolf 's , wolves ) , and finally the provinces of the unchanged kernel and of the s form have been very considerably extended . II . SYNTACTICAL CLASSIFICATION . 136. ( 87 ) Na.sg. : p 1. : -s , + , ( -n , ? ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pl. : -s , + s , ( - ns ) ; poss. pron . Here , as in a few places above , I have silently omitted the exceptional forms of the personal pronouns . 137. ( 88 ) A comparison with Old English will here show that ? apart from a few pronouns , which distinguish a nominative and an objective case ? the old nominative , accusative , dative and instrumental cases have coalesced to form a common case , which shows moreover a few traces of the fact that the old genitive plural grew to be formally identical with the common case of the singular number ( e.g. , a twopenny stamp , a five pound note ) . 138. ( 89 ) The question naturally arises , How has it come about that the Old English system of declensions has been so completely metamorphosed ? Is it possible to point out any single cause as the effectual agent in bringing about this revolution ? // An answer which has been given often enough , and which is offered by some scholars even now , was formulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language as follows : " Any violent mixture of two languages is against nature , and results in a rapid destruction of the forms of both . When a great mass of French words rushed in upon the English language , few if any forms passed over to its grammar , but the Saxon forms suddenly collapsed , because they did not agree with the new roots , and because the genius of the language was led by the crude employment of the foreign material to neglect the native flexion . . . . This rapid sinking from the more perfect Anglo-Saxon forms . .. is easily explained by iijluence from Danish and Norman-French . According to a universal and natural law , where two different tongues come in collision , grammatical forms are lost . One of the most important consequences was the thorough introduction of s in all plurals , which agrees with French usage and is not entirely unknown to the Saxon grammar . " 139. ( 90 ) Such an influence from Norman-French , however , is contradicted by various considerations , partly of a general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been at least imaginable , supposing GRIMM , Deutsche Grarnneatik , i. ( 1819 ) , pp. xxxii. and 177-178 . So also Madvig , Kleine philol . Schrifteu , 2.7 ; Earle , Philology of the Engl . Tongue , 1st ed. , p. 41 ; Elze , Englische Philologie , P. 245. x68 PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE . that the two constituent elements of the population , the French-speaking and the English-speaking , had been co-equal in numbers . But this was not the case . Moreover , it is admitted that the vast majority of the conquered people spoke English and never learned , to speak French ; they were not , therefore , exposed to having their sense of the grammatical structure of their native dialects impaired by commixture with foreign modes of speech . And , where influence from the foreign idiom could not be avoided , it must have taken place essentially in the same manner as French and English influence each other at the present day , by the adoption , that is , of single words , which are then incorporated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as a modern Frenchman inflects the loan-words leader , sport , in accordance with the laws of his own language , and turns the English verb stop into stopper ( strppant , etc. ) ,  --  just as , when some composite expression passes into his language , he does not shrink from forming such a derivative as strugg(le)-for-lifeur ( Daudet ) , ? precisely in the same manner did the English peasant act when he caught up a word from the courtly speech of the Normans . Quite instinctively he affixed to it his own terminations without troubling himself for a moment whether they would or would not " agree with the new roots " . 140. ( 91 ) But , whilst the Norman Conquest ex-erted no direct influence on English grammatical // structure , there can be no doubt that it went far to accelerate the development of change indirectly . This was principally due to the fact that England , was for some centuries without that retarding and conservative influence which will always make itself felt wherever cultivated classes speaking a " refined " speech exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branded as vulgarisms , or as downright solecisms . Any such control as comes from an upper class whose more old-fashioned lan-guage is looked upon as a model , and , partly at least , imitated by the lower classes , was precluded at the period we are speaking of , inasmuch as the upper classes did not speak English , or , at best , spoke only bad English . In consequence of this , not only was the literary tradition of the English language lost or re-duced to a minimum , but even in its oral transmission , which is always the more important matter , and was especially so then , one element was wanting which generally assists in stemming the tide of revolutionary tendencies . 141. ( 92 ) If now we look at the only detail in English accidence for which a Norman descent is claimed ( namely , the plural -s x ) , some remarks will // have to be made which perhaps have not been all propounded before . ( i ) The growth of the plural -s can not be separated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter gained ground even more rapidly and extensively than the plural -s , and French influence is here utterly unimaginable . Why , then , resort to it with regard to the other ending ? ( 2 ) The plural in -s was long before the Conquest extended to many nouns which had formerly had other endings , belonging to the i- and u- classes , as also to some of the consonant stems ( zvyrmas , winas , sunas , haele 5as , etc. , see ? 119 ) . This shows that the tendency of the language would have been the same even if William the Conqueror had never crossed the Channel . ( 3 ) -S became universal in the North at an earlier date than in the South , where we should expect to find French influence strongest , but where - en seems for a ! one ; dn to have had better chances of prevailing in all nouns than - s. ( 4 ) In Old French -s was not used to the same extent as now as a plural ending ; indeed , it can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most numerous and important class of nouns the sign of the nom. sg. and of the acc. pl. , but not of the nom. pl . If , therefore , an Englishman of ( say ) the thirteenth century used the -s in the nom. pl. , he was in accord with the rules of his native tongue , but not with those of French . ENGLISH CASE-SYSTEMS , OLD AND MODERN . iryi If -s was due to the Normans , we should expect it in the plural of the adjectives as well as of nouns ; but , as a matter of fact , adjectives take it extremely rarely , ' and hardly except in those cases where a Romance adjective is placed after its noun . Every-where else , Middle and Modern English adjectives have no -s in plural , agreeing therein with the old native tradition , but not with French grammar . And , finally , it is worth noting that the two endings , Norman -s without any vowel , and English -I 's ( originally - as ) with the vowel pronounced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are not confounded till , in the fifteenth century , the weak e disappears in pronunciation . 142. ( 93 ) Thus , at the one definite point where the theory of French influence has been advanced with regard to accidence , it is utterly unable to stand the test of historical investigation . And it is the same case , I believe , with many of the assertions put forward of late years by E. EINENKEL with regard to a French influence exerted wholesale on English syntax . ' Einenkel 's method is simplicity itself . In // dealing with any syntactical phenomenon of Middle English , he searches through Tobler 's Verm . Beitrage zur Frz . Granturatih and the ever-increasing literature of German dissertations on Old French syntax , in quest of some other phenomenon of a similar kind . As soon as this is discovered , it is straightway made the prototype of its Middle English analogue , some-times in spite of the French parallel being perhaps so rare a use that even Tobler himself can only point out a very few instances of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In several cases French influence is assumed , although Einenkel himself mentions that the phenomenon in question existed even in Old English , or , not unfrequgntly , though it must be considered so simple and natural a development as to be quite likely to spring up spontaneously in a variety of different languages . A little knowledge of Scandinavian languages would , for example , with regard to many points have con-vinced Einenkel that these present the very same phenomena which when occurring in English he explains from Old French . 143. ( 94 ) A far greater influence than that exer-cised upon English by the Gallicised Normans must be ascribed to the Danish Wikings , who for such a long space of time were acting a prominent part in Britain , and whose significance for the life of the // English people can not easily be over-estimated . As for the language , it should be borne in mind that the tongue spoken by the Danes was so nearly akin with the native dialects that the two peoples could understand one another without much difficulty . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grammar should be sacrificed , the intelligibility of either tongue coming to depend mainly on its mere vocabulary . It is in harmony with this view that the wearing away and levelling of grammatical forms in the regions in which the Danes chiefly settled was a couple of centuries in advance of the same process in the more southern parts of the country . A fully satisfactory solution of the question of the mutual relations of North English and Scandinavian at that time must be regarded as hopeless on account of the small number , and generally inadequate character , of linguistic records ; and , unless some fresh sources become accessible to us , we shall probably never learn clearly and unequivocally which points of correspondence in the two languages are attributx ( ble to primitive affinities , which others to loans from one language to the other , or , finally , how much may be due to independent parallel development in two areas which offered such striking analogies in so many essential particulars . But , as I hold , any linguistic change should primarily be explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other languages may serve as illustra174 PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE . tions and help to show what in the development of a language is due to psychological causes of a universal character , and what is , on the other hand , to be considered the effect of the idiosyncrasies of the particular idiom . 144. ( 95 ) I return to the question of the cause of the simplification of the English system of declensions , and I will quote another answer , which agrees better than Grimm 's with the linguistic theories prevailing now-a-days . This explanation is formulated by one of the most competent English scholars of our time , Dr. J. A. H. MURRAY , as follows : " The total loss of grammatical gender in English , and the almost complete disappearance of cases , are purely phonetic phenomena " . In other words : a phonetic law which operates " blindly , " i.e. , without regard to the signification , causes the Old English unstressed vowels -a , -e , -u , to become merged in an obscure -e in Middle English ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old English cases were consequently lost . Another phonetic law was operating in a similar manner by causing the loss of the final -n , which was equally utilised , though in a different way , in the Old English declension . Upon this I have to remark , first , that beside the phonetic laws must at all events be mentioned analogy . It is this which , for ex-ample , has led to the levelling of the nominative plural and dative plural : if phonetic decay had been // the only factor , Old English stanas and stanum would still have been distinguished from one another , namely as stones and stone ; whereas , in fact , the former form has been extended to the dative . This , however , must by no means be interpreted - as an objection to Dr. Murray and the scholars who hold his view , and who are as fully alive to this principle of explanation as anybody else . 145. ( 97 ) I have stated elsewhere my reasons for disbelieving in the axiom of the so-called young grammarian school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of sound laws and analogy sufficing between them to explain everything in linguistic development . ' Here I shall add , with re-gard to the special question concerning us in this chapter , that the young grammarians ' view does not look deep enough in its search for explanations . If simplification of forms is to be attributed in the main to the phonetic law of unstressed terminations , what , then , is the cause of the phonetic law ? And if , on the other hand , analogy has played an important part in this development , the question arises , if it is not possible to suggest causes why the principle of analogy should have thus asserted itself . Let us for a moment suppose that each of the terminations -a , -e , -u , bore in Old English its own distinctive and sharply defined meaning , which was necessary to the right understanding of the sentences in which the terminations occurred . Would there in // that case be any probability that a phonetic law tending to their levelling could ever succeed in establishing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been sure to counteract any inclination towards a slurred pronunciation of the terminations . Nor would there have been any occasion for new formations by analogy , as the endings were already sufficiently alike . 146. ( 98 ) The above comparative survey of the declensions of Old and Modern English furnishes an answer to the questions proposed , and makes the whole causality appear in a much clearer light than would be possible by any other arrangement of the grammatical facts : the cause of the decay of the Old English apparatus of declensions lay in its manifold incongruities . The same termination ( lid not always denote the same thing ; the same case was signified now by this , now by that means ; many relations plainly distinguished from each other in one class of words were but imperfectly , if at all , distinguishable in another class . And yet there is a still further cause of mixture and confusion which our arrangement does not bring out ? the one , namely , which is latent in terms like dative , accusative , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning in the case of Old English , any more than in the case of kindred tongues ; in many cases it did not even matter which of two or more cases the speaker chose to employ . Thus , not a few verbs existed which were employed // now with one , now with another case ; and it was often impossible to perceive any accompanying difference of meaning . ' And so also with other parts of speech : the preposition on , as applied to time , sometimes governed the dative ( instrumental ) , sometimes the accusative : thus we find in close succession ( Chron. , 979 , C. ) , on hys Beare . . . on hone sunnanda'ig ; ( ibia ' . , 992 , E. ) on here nilate 6e hi on one drri togaedere cumon sceoldon ; 2 similarly ( Oros. , 136 , 23 and foil. ) on westeweardum hisses middangeardes , . . . on casteweardum beosan middangearde ( comp. same page , 1 . 7 ) , and so on . 147. ( 99 ) This condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which manifested itself partly in a rather inaccurate pronunciation of the endings , partly in the use of them in places where they did not belong . This now and then happened in such a manner as to bring about coincidences of sound without assisting clearness , nay , even at its expense , as , for instance , is the case when we find in the Cura Past. , 166 , 2 and 20 : to anra tiara $'reora burga , instead of anre ( see Sweet 's note in his A. S. Reader , p. 191 ) . Generally , however , such uses of endings on analogy ' See particularly the materials collected by M. Sohrauer , Kleine Beitr. zur ae . Gramm. , pp . Io-26. 2 On with the dative case here corresponded to an older in , while with the accusative it was the old an ( comp . Germ. in , an ) , but I doubt very much if the old West Saxon author was alive to any difference in his use of on in the two phrases . I2 // are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional terminations are not sufficiently distinct , or where cases have been levelled which it is important should be kept apart . For example , giefa stands alike for the nominative plural and the genitive plural , and misapprehensions are the consequence . These are obviated by the extension to the nominative and genitive respectively of the termination -e from the i-class and - ena from the n-class ( nominative giefe , genitive giefena ) . But if the transmutations , phonetic as well as nonphonetic , of the old declensions took their rise from the numerous inconsistencies of the system and its want of fixed boundaries , formal or functional , then what is described above as the true grammatical arrangement exhibits the prospects of the various cases and endings in their struggle for existence . By its aid we arc , in some measure , in a position to cast the horoscope of the whole system and predict the main features of its destinies . 148 . ( Ioo ) The vocalic terminations ( B ) were evidently the least distinct and least sharply defined ; each of these had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different classes of inflexion . Here accordingly every succeeding generation when it came to learning the language was offered only scanty points of support and a great many chances of going wrong . It is therefore not surprising that these endings were confounded and effaced and in a later period entirely dropped , as // there was no well-defined barrier between the use of the bare kernel of the word , and the kernel plus the vocalic termination -e , in which the endings -e , -a , -u , had at that time been merged . The nasal endings were possessed of greater power of resistance . But they , too , were doomed , chiefly owing to the exceedingly common use of the ending - an in the weak forms of adjectives , where it was of no consequence whatever for the signification , and could therefore be neglected without any loss . In the case of verbal forms , too , where endings in -n occurred also , they did not perform any function of sufficient importance to check the tendency to drop the sound in pronunciation ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like binde we , binde g-e , mote we , etc. , in which the -n had fallen away ( Siev. , ? 36o ) . 149. ( ioi ) Where , on the other hand , the -n was protected by a following vowel , it could withstand the levelling tendencies better . This would be especially the case in the genitive plural , because of the distinctive meaning of this genitive . The same thing is also particularly true of the two -s endings , each of which was confined to a sharply limited sphere of use . The -s is too important to be left out ; if , on the other hand , the two endings - as and - es are levelled in the Middle English - es , this is mainly due to the influence exercised by the other endings . As -a and -e were not distinctive enough in point of meaning to oppose a strong resistance to the tendency prevailing in all Iso PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE . languages to obscure vowels in weak syllables , nay , even invited this tendency , - as and - es had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This they did without any very great detriment to intelligibility , the connexion in which they occur being nearly everywhere sufficient to show whether the genitive singular or nominative plural was meant , especially after the rule had been established by which the genitive is always placed before its governing word ( see chapter viii . ) . As regards the prospects which changes of kernel have of maintaining themselves , we can only be certain of this much , that those which have become attended with inherent change of signification are , by a natural consequence , more likely to be permanent than the others , which are more liable to be affected by levelling tendencies , inasmuch as a new regular form which agrees with the shape of the word in other cases is sure to be understood as well as , or even better than , the traditional one . But , on the other hand , forces tending to change pronunciation are continually at work , and these give rise to fresh changes of kernel ; we may mention , for instance , the laws of quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Modern English words shade and shadow . To foretell the durability of such modifications is , of course , a matter of impossibility . 150. ( 102 ) To suin up , setting aside changes of kernel , the other modifications of the nouns in Old English declensions are of a character to enable us // to form an opinion on the main features of their destinies by considering the reciprocal relations of phonetic expression and inward signification , the more so as it was just the least ambiguous endings ( - as , - es ) that were used to denote the syntactical relations which are the most distinctive and appear to be the most indispensable in language , viz. , plurality and connexion ( genitive ) . Logically to define the other case-relations is a matter of much more difficulty : the dative and accusative cases often come in contact with each other , and both have also some points of agreement with the nominative . Hence arises the chance of endless confusions , even where the forms are sharply distinguished ( see the next chapter ) . l In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , alike from a formal and syntactical point of view , to prefer the arrangement of the cases prevalent in Den-mark since Rask ? nominative accusative , dative , genitive ? to any other , and more especially to that still current in Germany where the genitive is placed between the nominative and the accusative . CITAPTER VII . CASE-SHIFTINGS IN THE PRONOUNS . 151. ( 103 ) In the Oldest English pronouns we find the nominative , accusative , and dative cases distinct both in point of accidence and syntax , although in a few pronouns there is no formal difference between the nominative and accusative ( in the plurals of the third person ( his ) ; in the neuter ( hit , hwcet , etc. ) , in the feminine form heo or his ) . The first step in the simplification of this system is the abandonment of the separate forms mec , , bec , usic , eowic , uncit , incit , which are used only in the very oldest texts as accusatives distinct from the datives me , fie , us , eow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the latter forms . By parallel developments occurring somewhat later , the old dative forms hire ( hir , her ) , him and hwam ( whom ) are made to fill the offices held hitherto by the old accusatives heo , hine and hwone . In some of the southern counties hine is , however , preserved up till our times in the form of an , see Ellis , Early Engl . Pronunciation , v. , p. 43 ; in the literary transcription of these dialects this is written ' un , e.g. , in Fielding 's Tom Jones ( Squire ( 182 ) // Western , etc. ) , and in Thackeray 's Pendennis ( i. , 62 , " Show Mr. Pendennis up to ' un " ) .1 In the plural , also , the dative form has expelled the old acc. ; hem ( O. K him , heom ; preserved in familiar and vulgar speech : " I know ' em " ) and the later them are originally datives ; 2 the neuter singular , on the other hand , has preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that ) , hweet ( what ) , at the expense of the old datives . The reason of this constant preferring of the dative forms in the person-indicating pros ouns is no doubt the fact that these pronouns are used as indirect objects more often than either nouns or adjectives ; 8 at any rate , it is a phenomenon very frequently found in various languages ; compare Danish ham , hende , dein , hvenn , originally datives , now also accusatives and partly even nominatives ( while it is true that in mig and dig the acc. has outlived the dative ) ; North // German wem for wen , ' French lui as an absolute pronoun ( while the acc. has carried the day in elle , eux , elles ; moi and toi may be either ) ; Italian lui , lei , low , ' etc. 152. ( 104 ) Iii this chapter I propose to deal at some length with those tendencies to further modi-fications of the pronominal case-system which may be observed after the , p.ccusatives and datives have everywhere become identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Table Simplification has gone further in the case of the pronouns of the second person than iii that of the others ; in fact , if we were to believe the ordinary grammars , the substitution of you for ye is the only point in which a deviation from the old system has taken place . But ordinary grammars are not always trustworthy ; in laying down their rules they are too // apt to forget that the English language is one thing , common-sense or logic another thing , and Latin grammar a third , and that these three things have really in many cases very little to do with one an-other . Schoolmasters generally have an astonishing talent for not observing real linguistic facts , and an equally astonishing inclination to stamp everything as faulty that does not agree with their narrow rules ; and the precepts inculcated in the school-room have no doubt had some influence in checking natural tendencies , though the following pages will suffice to show that the best authors have in many points de-viated more from the rules laid down in grammars than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomena I shall treat of have , as a matter of course , been noticed and partly explained by modern grammarians of the historical school ; I shall specially mention KOCII , His ' . Gramm. , ii . ( especially p. 2441 ) ; MATZNER , Engl . Gramm. , ii . passim ; ABBOTT , A Shakespearian Grammar , ? 205 ff . ; A. SCHMIDT , Shakespeare-Lexikon ; STORM , Englische Philologie , 1881 , p. 207 ff . ; GuMMERE , The English Dative-horn. of the Person . Pron. , in American Journ. of Philol. , iv. ; W. FRANZ , Die // dialektspr. bei Dickens , Engl . St. , xii. , 223 f. , and Zur syntax des dlteren Neuenglisch , ibid. , xvii. , 212 ff . ; KELI.NER , in the Introduction to Caxton'sBlanchardyn ( EFTS . Extra Series 58 ) . On the whole these authors content themselves with a purely lexical treatment of the matter , giving for instance all the examples of I for me and vice versa under one head , and only occasionally offering an explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Storm 's excellent work . In the following sections I shall attempt a systematic arrangement according to the psychological or phonetic principles underlying the phenomena and causing speakers or writers to use another case than that exacted by the rules of ordinary grammar . I shall first take those classes of caseshiftings which are of a more general character and may occur more or less frequently iu all languages of our type , giving last those which belong more specially to English or to one particular period of English . It must be specially mentioned that in many of the sentences quoted two or even more causes of shifting have operated concurrently . I. Relative Attraction . 154. ( 105 ) A pronoun in the principal proposition is often put in the case which the corresponding relative pronoun has or ought to have . This is particularly easy to explain where no relative pronoun is used ; the so-called relative ellipsis originates // in a construction apt ) koinou , the personal pronoun belonging equally well to both propositions . Examples abound , both where the relative pronoun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. , 5 , 623 , " Him that she cheest , he shal her have as swythe " Caxton ( see Kellner , xiv. ) , " him that he rought with full stroke was all in to brused " Shak. , Cor. , v. , 6 , 5 , " Him I accuse ( : ) the city port by this hath enter 'd " Ant. , iii. , 1 , 15 , " hung we serues serve 's away " Dour. , 1032 ( ii. , 3 , 85 ) , " her I lone now lloth grace for grace , and loue for loue allow " ( the oldest quarto she whom ) Haml. , ii. , 1 , 42 , " him you would sound .. . be assured he closes . . . " Temp. , v. , 1 , 15 ; As , i. , I , 46 ; I H. VI. , iv. , 7 , 75 Tennyson , 370 , " Our noble Arthur , him Ye scarce can overpraise , will hear and know " Troll. , Duke 's Ch. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have come to be known as her whom your uncle trusted and loved , as her whom your wife trusted . .. " Very often after it is : Marlowe , Jew , 1034 , " ' T is not thy wealth , but her that I esteeme " ( = I esteeme her ) 1 Sh. , 2 H. VI. , iv. , 1 , 117 , " it is thee I feare " Sonn. 62 , " ' T is thee ( my self ) that for my self I praise " Thack. , Pend. , i. , 269 , " it 's not me I 'm anxious about " ibid. , iii. , 301 , " it is not him I want " Troll. , Old Man , 121 , " It is her you should consult on such a matter " . // Nom. for acc. is rarer in case of relative attraction ? Sh. , V. 11. , 109 , " thus he that overrul 'd I overswayed " Trod. , ii. , 3 , 252 , " praise him that got thee , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. , 2 , 105 ; 2 H. Vl. , iii. , 2 , 89 ; R. III. , iv. , 4 , 101 f . Bunyan ( see Storm , 21 I ) , " the encouraging words of he that led in the front " . II . Blendings. 155. ( 106 ) Contaminations or blendings of two constructions between which the speaker is wavering occur in all languages . The first class of contamina-tions concerning us here is caused by vacillation be-tween an accusative with infinitive and a finite verb , exemplified in the Bible phrase : O. E. , " Ilwcene secgad men Ja t sy mannes sunu ? " Auth . V. , " Whom do men say that I the son of man am ? " ( Matt. , xvi. , 13 ) , as compared with the more " grammatically correct " con-struction in Wyclif : " Whom seien men to be mannus sone ? " In the parallel passage , Luke , ix. , 18 and 20 , Wyclif writes : " Whom seien the puple that Y am ? .. . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors I shall quote : Chauc. , Morr. , iii. , 26 , 803 , " as ye han herd me sayd " rhyme : apayd ; for me saye or I said B. , 665 , " yet wole we vs auyse whom // that we wole that v. r. om , that shal ben our Justyse " Sh. , Car. , iv. , 2,2 , " thenobility .. . whom we see haue sided in his behalfe " Temp. , iii. , 3 , 92 , " Ferdinand ( whom they suppose is droun 'd ) " Meas. , ii. , I , 72 , " my wife whom I thanke heauen is an honest woman " Tiara , iv. , 3 , 120 , " a bastard , whom the oracle Hathdoubtfully pronounced thy fol. the throat shall cut " 1 Fielding , T. J. , iv. , 130 , " I would have both you and she know that it is not for her fortune he follows her " Darwin , L ? and L. , i. , 6o , " to assist those whom he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one whom all the world knew was so wronged and so un-happy " . I Note also Sh. , Car. , i. , I , 236 , " And were I anything but what I am , I would wish me only he , " where he is the only natural form , as him would only obscure the meaning of the phrase . 2 In R. Haggard , Cleopatra , ii. , // 121 , " rather than I would see her thy wedded wife and thou her loving lord , " we have an approach to the phenomenon mentioned below , ? 164 . When we find in the middle of the sixteenth cen-tury such sentences as these : Roister D. , 38 , " And let me see you play me such a part againe " ibid. , 76 , " I woulde see you aske pardon , " we may be pretty sure that the author meant you as the acc. case and the verbs play and aske as infini-tives ; but to a later generation neither the form of the pronoun nor that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominative before finite verbs ( let me see ( that ) you . . . ) . 156. ( i io ) In these cases the blending was due to the fact that what was grammatically the object of one verb was logically the subject of another verb . This is particularly frequent in the combination let us ( go , etc. ) , supplanting the older construction go we , etc . ' The logical subject is here often put in the nominative , especially if separated from the word let : Genesis , xxi. 44 , " Let us make a covenant , I and thou " 2 Udall , Roister , 21 , " Let all these matters passe , and we three sing a song " // Sh. , Merck. , iii. , 2 , 21 , " let fortune goe to hell for it , not I " 1 Cos. , iii. , 1 , 95 , " let no man abide this deede , but we the doers " I Byron , iv. , 240 , " Let He who made thee answer that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " let you and I cry quits " . Storm ( E. Philol. , 211 ) has some modern quota-tions ( from Dickens , who writes also : " Leave Nell and I to toil and work " ) , and quotes the Norwegian and Danish colloquial lad vi del for lad os dct . In the corresponding Dutch construction both the nom. and ace. are allowed : " laat mij nu toonen " as well as " laat ik nu toonen " ( let me now show ) ; similarly laat hem hi nu toonen , laat ons laten wij nu toonen , lat hem laten ze nu toonen " .1 In a passage from Guy of Warwick , 3531 , " Let hym fynde a sarasyn Andy to fynde a knyght of myn , " we have a tran-sition case between this phenomenon and that dealt with in ? 164 . A similar confusion after the verb make is found in Sh. , Temp. , iv. , 1 , 217 , " mischeefe which may make this island Thine owne for ever , and I thy Caliban for aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his sentences and goes on as if the begin-ning had been " this island shall become " . So also in Rich . II. , iv. , 1 , 216 , " God make me , that nothing // haue , with nothing grieu 'd , And thou with all pleas 'd , that hast all atchicu 'd " . In these cases the nominative is used in spite of grammatical rules requiring the acc. , because the word is thought of as the subject ; this is even , though rarely , the case after a preposition ; in Roister Doister , p. 72 , I find : " Nay as for they , shall euery mother 's childe die ; " and a phrase in a letter that is read aloud twice in the same play runs the first time " as for all them that woulde do you wrong " ( p. 51 ) , but the second time " as for all they " ( p. 57 ) . In ? 170 if . we shall see some rnore instances of the nominative , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acc. , required by earlier grammatical rules . 157. ( 107 ) Other contaminations leading to con-fusions of two cases are found here and there . In Sh. , Temp. , ii. , I , 28 , we read : " Which , of he , or Adrian . . . First begins to crow ? " This is a blending of " Which , he or A. , " and " Which of the two him and A. , " or else of may be a printer 's error for or , as conjectured by Collier . In Sir Andrew 's interruption , Tw . N. , ii. , 5 , 87 , " you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight. ? That 's mee I warrant you , " me is due to the use of the accus. in the preceding sentence ( = with me ) ; immediately afterwards he says : " I knew ' t was I ; " in Malvolio 's speech , " If this should be thee , " thee is similarly the // object of the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 87 , " If ever I saw a man in love , that man is him " . The opposite result of the contamination is found in Sh. , Troll. , ii. , 3 , 102 , " Achillis hath inveigled his foole from him. ? Who , Thersites ? ? He " ( = who is it ? it is he ) ; parallel cases occur at every moment in colloquial language . 158. ( i 12 ) A good deal of confusion arises from some words being both prepositions and conjunctions . With regard to but , Dr. Murray says in N. E. 1D. : " In some of these uses , the conjunction is , even in Modern English , not distinctly separated from the preposition : the want of inflexions in substantives , and the colloquial use of me , us , for I , we , etc. , as complemental nominatives in the pronouns , making it uncertain whether but is to be taken as governing a case . In other words nobody else went but me ( or I ) ' is variously analysed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else went except ( that ) I ( went ) , ' . and as these mean precisely the same thing , both are pronounced grammatically correct . " ( Comp. also Murray 's examples , especially under the heads C. 3 and 4 . ) It should , however , be remarked that the confusion in the use of but is not a consequence of the want of distinct case-endings in the nouns and the use of me instead of I in other connexions ; in my view it is on the contrary the existence of such twosided words as but , etc. , that is one of the primary causes of mistakes of me for I or vice versa and careless uses of the cases generally . Even in such a 13 // language as German , where the cases are generally kept neatly apart , we find such combinations as " niemand kommt mir entgegen ausser ein unver-sclururtcr " ( Lensing ) ; " wo ist ein gott ohne der Kerr " ( Luther ) ; " l:ein gott ist ohne iclz , " etc ? Sometimes both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in these quota-tions from Murray 's Dict. : " Se is a:thwam freond butan dracan anum bot Pe haf i na frend " . In the follow-ing examples there is a conflict between the two con-structions ; and in some of them ( which I have starred ) the nominative is used , although both the preposition and conjunction would require the accusative , or vice versa . Ancr . R. , 408 , " no Ping ne con luuien ariht bute he one " Chauc. , C. , 282 , " no man woot of it but god and he " ( rhymes with be ) Min . P. , 2 , 30 , " no wight wont it but I " Malory , 42 , " **32;64;TOOLONG " Mar-lowe , Jew , 1576 , " I newer heard of any man but the Malign 'd the order ofthe I acobines " 2 Sh. , Cymb. , i. , I , 24 , " I do not thinke , so faire an outward , and such stuffe within endowes a man , but*hee " ibid. , ii. , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As , i. , 2 , 18 , " my father had no childbut ' I " Mhiii8 // " There is none but he whose being I doe feare " Romeo , 250 , ( i. , 2 , 14 ) , " Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but *she " R. III. , ii. , 2 , 76 , " What stayes had I but *they ? " 2 H. VI. , i. , 2 , 69 , " here 's none but thee and 1 " Temp. , iii. , 2 , 109 , " I neuer saw a woman But onely Sycorax my dam , and *she " Thackeray , Van . F. , 521 , " how pretty she looked . So do you ! Everybody but me who am wretched " R. L. Stevenson , Child 's Garden , 17 , " So there was no one left but me " .1 159. ( 113 ) Save ( sauf ) presents similar phenomena of confusion , although it is comparatively seldom found as a preposition , as in Matth . Arnold , Poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gods is no one there , save me alone " ; and in Tennyson , p. 319 , " Who should be king save him who makes us free ? " 2 In Chaucer sauf ( save ) is very common with nom . ( B. , 474 , 627 ; G. , 1355 ; I , 25 ; L. G. W. , 1633 ; Morris , ii. , 221 , 493 ; 342 , 801 ) , so also in Shakespeare ( Tw . N. , iii. , 1 , 172 ; Cues. , iii. , 2 , 66 , etc. ) , and in modern poets ( e.g. , Byron , iv. , 332 , " Who shall weep above your universal grave , save I ? " ) . Where the word is not meant as the subject , the accusative is used ( e.g. , Chaucer , B. , 4491 , // " Save yow I hcrde neuere man so singe ; " where , however , one MS . ( H ) has ye ) . An example of an abnormal use of the nom. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in this wide universe I call , save thou , my rose " . For except , compare the following examples : Meredith , Trag . Corn. , 28 , " And everybody is to know him except I ? " I Muloch , Halifax , ii. , 22 , " No one ever knew of this night 's episode , except us three " Mrs. Browning ( a letter in Mrs. Orr , Life and Letters of Rob . Br. , 232 ) , " Nobody exactly understands him except me who am in the inside of him and hear him breathe " I Hardy , Tess , 101 , " Perhaps any woman would , except me " . 160. ( 114 ) The conjunctions as and than , used in comparisons , give rise to similar phenomena . As it is possible to say both " I never saw anybody stronger than lie " scil. is , and " than him " ( ace. agreeing with anybody ) , and " I never saw anybody so strong as he , " and " as him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here easily obscured , and he is used where the rules of grammar would lead us to expect him , and conversely . The examples of complete displacement are here , as above , starred : Chauc. , B. , 1025 , " So vertuous a lyver in my lyf Ne saugh I never , such as sche " I ibid. , M. P. , 3 , 984 , " Ne swich as she ne knew I noon " I Udall , Roister , 33 , " for such as thou " ( compare ibid. , 44 ) Marl. , Tamb. , 1814 , " depend // on such weake helps as we " ibid. , 1877 , " for these , and such as we our selues , For vs " Greene , Friar B. , 12 , 66 , " I do love the lord , As lie that 's second to thyself in love " ( relat. attr . ) Sh. , Rem. , 239 , " For men so old as we " Shrew , i. , 2 , 65 , " ' twixt such friends as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Heere shall he see grosse fooles as he " 1/Vint .

J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that as well as thee ? " The word like is normally used with the dative , but on account of its signification being often identical with that of as , the nominative is sometimes found : Sh. , Rom. , 1992 ( iii. , 5 , 83 ) , " And yet no man like he cloth grecue my heart , " evidently on account of the following verb , whose subject in a way he is ; compare , on the other hand , ibid. , 1754-6 , " wort thou as young as I . . doting like me , and like me banished " R. Wintle , A Regular Scandal , 35 , " Yes , if it was a sweet young girl . . . and not one like I " . 161. ( 115 ) Examples with than : Chaucer , L. G. W. ( B ) , 476 , " To me ne fond I better noon than ye " j Sh. , Cor. , iv. , 5 , 170 , " but a greater soldier then he , you wot one " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my soule . . . hates nothing more then ' ' he " ( compare Trail. , ii. , 3 , 199 ; Cymb. , v. , 3 , 72 , " then we " ( obj. ) ( relat. attr. ) // Field. , T. J. , i. , 49 , " My sister , though many years younger than me , is at least old enough to be at the age of discretion " ibid. , iii. , 129 , " you are younger than me " ibid. , i. , 221 ( vulg. ) , " gentle folks are but flesh and blood no more than us servants " Byron , ii. , 351 , " none Can less have said or more have done Than *thee , Mazeppa " ibid. , iv. , 213 , " Yet he seems mightier far than them " 1 iv. , 223 , " I uglier things than ye are slaves ; and higher Than them or ye would be so " v. , 226 , " than *kiln " Shelley , 237 , " I am . . . mightier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she fancies her-self better than you and me " 1 Trollope , Duke 's Ch. , i. , 221 ( a lady says ) , " She should be two inches shorter than me " . This use of the acc. after than , of which Bishop Lowth in his grammar ( 1762 , p. 145 ) is already able to quote many examples from the writings of Swift , Lord Bolingbroke , Prior , etc. , is now so universal as to be considered the normal construction ; that is , to the general feeling than is a preposition as well as a conjunction . Even grammarians acknowledge the use of the accusative in this connexion , ' though their reasons are not always of the best ; thus W. Smith and D. Hall 2 mention : " A stone is heavy , and the zoo PROGRESS IN LANGUAGE . sand weighty ; but a fool 's wrath is heavier than them both " ( I'rov. , xxvii. , 3 ) , as " a construction founded on the Latin , " namely , the ablative ( without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison ( major Scipione ) , with which the English idiom has of course nothing whatever to do . Nevertheless , many grammarians , and consequently many authors , reject this natural use of the accusative , and I think I am justified in considering the nominatives in some , at least , of the following examples as called forth by a more or less artificial reaction against the natural tendencies of the language : Carlyle , Heroes , 93 , " the care of Another than he " Troll. , Duke 's Ch. , i. , 136 , " he had known none more vile or more false than I " G. Eliot , Mill , i. , 186 , " I have known much more highly-instructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide " Tennyson , Becket , 1 , " But we must have a mightier man than Ire for his successor " Meredith , Egoist , 14r , " if I could see you with a worthier than I " Buchanan , few , 87 , " Naming the names of lesser Gods than I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 , " I love and am loved by a better man than he " . The accusative is always used in than whom ( found in Shakespeare , Love 's L. , iii. , 18o , in Milton , etc . ) ; Alford is right in observing that than who is here excluded because the expression does not admit of an elliptical construction . I only once remember // having found than who , namely in the sentence , " Mr. Geo . Withers , than who no one has written more sensibly on this subject , " and then it occurs in the book on The King 's English ( p. 338 ) by Mr. Washing-ton Moon , who is constantly regulating his own and others ' language by what in his view ought to be , rather than what really is the usage of the English nation . III . Anacoluthia. 162. ( rob ) Of the different forms of anacoluthia we have here first to do with that which results when a speaker begins a sentence with some word which takes a prominent place in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to its syntactical connexion ; if it is a word inflected in the cases he provisionally puts it in the nominative , but is then often- obliged by an after-correction ' to insert a pro-noun indicating the case the word should have been in . This phenomenon is extremely frequent in the colloquial forms of all languages , but grammarians blame it and in literary language it is generally avoided . I shall first give some examples where the case employed is correct or the fault is at any rate not visible : // Ancren Riwle , 332 , " pc beste mon of al pisse worlde 3if ure Louerd demde him al efter rihtwisnesse 7 ' lout efter merci , wo schulde him iwurden " Chauc. , B. , 4268 , " oon of hem , in sleping as he lay , Him mette a wonder dreem " Sh. , As , iv. , 1 , 77 , " verie good orators when they are out , they will spit " ibid. , iv. , 1 , 177 , " that woman that can not make her fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Next I quote some instances in which the nominative ( or , in the first sentence , acc. ) might be also caused by relative attraction ( ? 154 ) : Oros. , 78 , 31 , ' Vied gewinn poet his faeder astealde he . . . for JJcem V gear scipa worhte " Cuura P. , 29 , 2 , " Se 6e god ne ongit , ne ongit god /line " ' ibid. , 31 , 16 , " Se 6c aenigne 6issa ierminga besuic6 , him ware betere , " etc . Chaucer , B. , 4621 , " For he that winketh , whan he sholde see , Al wilfully , God lat him never thee ! " Chaucer , Morris , iii. , 165 , " for certes he that . . . hath to gret presumpcioun , him schal evyl bitide " ibid. , iii. , 196 , " He that most curteysly comaundeth , to him men most obeyen " Malory , 150 , " ye that be soo wel borne a man . . . , there is no lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the regular O. E. construction in relative clauses ; compare the modern translation , " He who knows not God , God knows not him " . // Matt. , xii. , 36 , " Every idle word that men speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment " Sh. , Cor. , i. , 4 , 28 , " He that retires , Ile take him for a Volce " ( com-pare Hand. , iii. , 2 , 252 ) Sh. , R. III. , iii. , 2 , 58 , " that they which brought me in my masters hate , I liue to looke vpon their tragedie " ' Sh. , H. V. , iv. , 3 , 35 , " he which hath no stomacke to this fight , let him depart , his passport shall he made " 1 Carlyle , Heroes , 9 , " Ile that can discern the loveliness of things , we call hull Poet " . There is no relative attraction in the following sentences : Oros. , 24 , 7 , " Seo us fyrre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 188 , 26 , " Athium bcet folc him gePuhte " Sh. , Meas. , v. , 134 , " But yesternight my lord , she and that fryer I saw them at the prison " Sh. , Wint. 11 , iii. , 2 , 98 , " My second joy , And first fruits of my body , from his presence I am bar 'd " .1 Sometimes no corrective pronoun follows : Sh. , Meas. , v. , 531 , " She Claudio that you wrong 'd , looke you restore " Sh. , Wives , iv. , 4 , 87 , " and he my husband best of all affects " Sh. , Tim. , iv. , 3 , 39 , " Shee , whom the spittle-house and vlcerous sores Would cast the // gorge at , this embalmes " her ; in the first folio a different punctuation is used R Browning , Tauchn. , i. , 235 , " She , men would have to be your mother once , Old Gandolf envied me , so fair she was ! " 163 . ( Ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other it often happens that the appositum does not follow the case of the first word ; the speaker forgets the case he has just employed and places the appositum loosely without any connexion with the preceding . M. Sohrauer ' gives some O. E. examples ( to Nichodeme , an 6era Judeiscra ealdra ) , to which may be added : Caron. , 984 A , " seo halgung fices cefterfilgendan bisceopes Atlfheages , se e o'Sran naman wws geciged Godwine " ( rel. attraction ! ) I Sweet , A. S. Reader , 15 , 7 , " Pram Brytta cyninge , Ceadwalla geciged " ibid. , 1 . 45 , " sumne arwur'ne bisceop , Aldan gehaten " ibid. , 1 . rot , " to Westseaxan kyninge , Cynegyls gehaten " ibid. , 1 . 144 , " on scrine , of seolfre asmiJiod " . This is extremely common in O. E. with participles ; in more recent periods it is found in many other cases as well : Chauc. , B. , 1877 , " prey eek for us , we sinful folk unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bcseching her of mercy and of grace , As she i Kleine Beitrage zur Altengl . Grammatik , p. 29 ; see also Matzner , Gramm. , iii. , 343 if . // that is my lady sovereyne " I Chauc. , Morris , iii. , 12 , 325 , " to folwe hire , as she that is goddesse " I Sh. , i H. IV : , i. , 2 , 16 , " by Phoebus , hee , that wand'ring knight " Sh. , Love 's L. , iv. , 3 , 7 , " this loue . . . kils sheep ; it kils ' nee , I a sheep " I Sh. , Win/ . T. , v. , r , 86 , " Prince Florizell . . . with his princesse ( she The fairest I hauc yet beheld ) " Sh. , i H. IV. , ii. , 4 , 114 , " I am not yet of Percies mind , the Ho/spill-re of the North , he that killer Inc some sixe or scaucn dozen of Scots " ' 1 Shelley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , The Titan ? he who made his agony the barrier to your else all-conquering foe ? " Relative attraction may , of course , have also been at work in some of these sentences ; and the following example ( which I quote from A. Gil , Logonomia , 1619 , p. 77 ) might be accounted for in no less than three of my paragraphs ( 154 , 156 , 163 ) . This illustrates the complexity of the mutual relations of grammatical categories : " Sic etiam casus inter duo verba , nunc cum hoc , nunc cum illo construitur : vt , Let Tomas cum in , J men hi at kdm yisterdai : aut I men him " . What is the reason of the accusative in Sh. , cymb. , v. , 4 , 70 , " we came , our parents and vs twaine " ? 164. ( 109 ) There is a peculiar form of anacoluthia , // which for want of a better name I shall term uncon-nected subject . In English this phenomenon is not confined to those exclamations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages ( Dan. , " Du gore det ! Han . i Paris ? " French , " Toi faire cca ! Lui avarc ? " Italian , " Io far questo ! " Latin , " Mene incepto desistere victam ? " etc. ) , but is found in other cases as well , especially after and , by which the subject is more or less loosely connected with a preceding sentence . ' I shall here in the first place give some quotations in which the case employed is the same as would have been used had the thought been expressed fully and in more regular forms : Sh. , Love 's L. , iii. , 191 , " What ? I loue ! I sue ! Iseeke a wife ! " ibid. , 202 , " And Ito sigh for her , to watch for her , " etc . Meas. , ii. , 2 , 5 , " all ages smack of this vice , and lee To ( lie for't " As , iii. , 2 , 161 , " I eauen would that shee these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slaue " ( = I should ) Tim. , r , 50 , " Is't possible the world should so much differ , And we aliue that liued ? " Math. , i. , 7 , 58 ( 455 ) , " If we should faile ? We faile ! " ( Here , however , the best reading seems to be " We faile. " with a full stop , the verb being taken as an indicative ) R. II. , I , 129 , " And shall the figure of God 's Maiestie . . . Be iudg 'd by subject , and inCASE-SHIFTINGS // ferior breathe , And he himself not present ? " Milton , S. A. , 1480 , " Much rather I Manoa shall choose To live the poorest in my tribe , than richest , And he in that cala-mitous prison left " = if Samson is left . .. Field. , T. j. , ii. , 85 , " A young woman of your age , and unmarried , to talk of inclina-tions I " G. Eliot , Mill , ii. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r . Kenn ? Heaven forbid ! " n. , 307 , " Could anything be more detestable ? A girl so much indebted to her friends . . . to lay designs of winning a young man 's affections away from her own cousin ? " But in the following instances the nom. is used , although the construction , if regularly completed , would have led to the use of an accusative : Chaucer , E. , 105 , " I dar the better aske of yow a space Of audience to shewen our requeste , And ye , my lord , to doon ryght as yow leste " Malory , 71 , " hym thought no worship to have a knyght at suche auaille , he to be on horsback and he on foot " Sh. , As , i. , 2 , 279 , " What he is indeede , More suites you to conceiue , then I to speake of " ( Kellner quotes from Sh . also Err. , i. , 1 , 33 ; All s , ii. , I , 186 ; 7imon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii. , 2 , 83 , " the soft way which . . . Were fit for // thee to vse , as they to clayme " ( compare also Cor. , iii. , 2 , 124 , and ii. , 2 , 54 ) . 165. ( 109 ) Similarly where no infinitive is used , but a participle or some other word : Chaucer , 700 , " What coude a sturdy husbond more dcuyse To prcue hir wyfllood and hir stedfastnesse , And he continuing euer in sturdinesse ? " Mal. , 95 , " whan Balen sawe her lye so with the fowlest knyghte that euer he sawe and she a fair lady , thenne Balyn wente thurgh alle the chambers " Marlowe , Tamb. , 244 , " Me thinks I see kings kneeling at his feet , And he with frowning browes and fiery lookes Spurning their crownes " Sh. , Romeo , 537 , " good manners shall lie all in one or two men 's hands and they vnwasht too " Lear , iii. , 6 , 117 , " that which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fathered ! " Field. , T .. J. , ii . 249 , " I thought it hard that there should be so many of them , all upon one poore man , and he too in chains " Meredith , Trag . Cor. , 165 , " let her be hunted and I not by and let me not be by ; when I am not by , beast it is with her " Ward , David Grieve , iii. , 133 , " It made her mad to see their money chuckled away to other people , and they getting no good of it " . In some of these sentences the construction might be called a kind of apposition ; in others we have w ; . CASE-SHIF7'INGS IN THE PRONOUNS . 2cxj something closely resembling the absolute participle. of which more will be said below , ? 183 ; the use of an " unconnected subject " may have favoured the substitution of the modern " absolute nominative " for the old " absolute dative " . 166. ( 109 ) Sometimes the phenomenon mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corresponds very nearly to the Latin accusative with the infinitive , only the nominative is used : ? 1 Malory , 40 , " this is my counceill . . . that we lete puruey x knY3tcs men of good fame , &; they to krpe this swerd " ibid. , 6o , " for it is better that we slee a coward than thorow a coward alle we to be slayne " ibid. , 453 ( quoted by Kellner ) , " T/iow to lye by our moder is to muche shame for vs to suffre " ibid. , 133 , " And thenne hadde she me deuysed to be kyng in this land , and soo to refine , and the to be my quene " . But this use of a nominative with the infinitive does not occur often enough to be a permanent feature of the English language .
