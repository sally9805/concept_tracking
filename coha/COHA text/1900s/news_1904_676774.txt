txt By a vote that was almost unanimous members of the unions comprising the employes of the elevated system of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company yesterday decided to support with a strike if neces- I sary . the attitude of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in demanding that the wage for motormen in the subway shall be $3.50 for a working day of nine hours . Last night officials of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employes of America and of the two brotherhoods involved in the differences between the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and its empolyes were a unit in declaring that a tie-up of the elevated system would surely follow within forty-eight hours unless the company decides to accede the demand of their men . They declared that no compromise or half-way concession would be acceptable to them . Warren S. Stone , Grand Chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers , who has been in the city for several days . was in constant attendance at the voting yesterday . John Hannahan , Grand Master - of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Assistant Grand Master Charles Wilson as his representative to this city . William D. Mahon , International President of the Amalgamated Association , arrived from Detroit last night These men , with Local Chiefs Jencks and Pinney , and President George E. Pepper of the local branch of the Amalgamated Association , will hold a conference early to-day for the purpose of deciding upon a line of action . Although the National officers of the brotherhoods and of the amalgamated association have power to declare a strike immediately , there is said to be little likelihood of any such policy being adopted . One of their officers said last night that a reasonable time would be allowed to elapse , so as to give August Belmont , President of the interborough company , and the other officials , as he put it , an opportunity to hack down from the attitude of uncompromising resistance to the men 's demands which they have maintained ever since the demands were fhade . The men , apparently , are also of the opinion that they wil be able to strike a harder blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday , which is a legal holiday , and declare a strike on Tuesday morning when the business rush of the ' week will begin in earnest . Police Asked to be Ready . In the meantime indications were not lacldng that officials of the Interborough Company are preparing for a fight and making arrangements to meet any trouble that might come their way as a result of the action taken by the men . Vice President and General Manager E. P. Bryan and Superintendent Frank Hedley of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company called at Police Headquarters late yesterday afternoon and were closeted with Commissioner for more than an hour . Neither of the two railroad officials was willing to do any talking when the interview came to an end , but the Commissioner admitted that they had discussed police arrangements in case of a st-ike on the elevated system . ! They did not tell me that there was going to be a strike , " said Mr. , " and I do not want to be understood as saying that there is going to be one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case , but the police will do their duty in maintaining order and will be well able to cope with any emergency . " The vote of the electrical employes was taken ' at all-day meetings behind closed doors at their local headquarters . The members of the two brotherhoods cast their ballots in Horton Hall , 110 East One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street . The members of the Amalgamated Association , which comprises all the employes of the elevated system , except the men belonging to the brotherhoods , voted in Marion Hall , 150 East Cne Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street The polls opened at 10 o'clock in cach place , and at that hour already there were little clusters of men waiting to register their votes . The voting went on briskly throughout the day . " Strike or No Strike . " The vote was not on the question of an ultimatum , but flatly on the proposition of strike or no strike . On the ballots used by the members of the brotherhood were the words " For Strike " and " Against Strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a cross to indicate their attitude , and there was also a dotted line . for their signatures . The ballots of Arnalgated members bore the following question : " Are you in favor of sustaining your Executive Committee in the agreement made with the Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen ? ( Vote yes or no . " ) The meet ; rgs ended at about 10:30 o'clock , and then Local Chief Jencks of the Brotherhood of Engineers said that- the number of votes cast at the Brotherhood meeting was about 750 . Some of these , he said , had been cast by proxy . They were the ballots of the men who are out of town . // ELEVATED- EVI , OYES VOTE FOR A STRiKE // He added that practically all of the members of the Brotherhood had voted and that not more than 1 or 2 per cent of the total membership had neglected to vote . lierefused to tell the result of the balloting ? but a member of the Executive Committee volunteered the information that the Brotherhood men had voted unanimously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands of the men . At the meeting of the Amalgamated Association it was said that out of the 3,700 members of that organization 3,300 had voted in favor of a resolution to sustain the Amalgamated 's Executive Committee in an agreement it had made with the Brotherhood to stand by the Brotherhood in the fight . The balloting figures , however , were not given out officially . - There had been some " doubt until yesterday ' as to what attitude members of the Amalgamated Association would . take in the struggle between the Brotherhood men and the Interborough Company . President Pepper and a conuruttee of the association called upon Vice President Bryan of the ' company a few days ago for the adjustment of some differences in reference to the matter of priority and seniority of Manhattan employes desiring to be shifted into the subway . Mr. Pepper and his colleagues went away declaring that all differences ' between their organization and the company had been satisfactorily adjusted , and for a time the relations between the men of the Amalgamated and members of the Brotherhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preside t Pepper dispelled every doubt On the q estion of their present relations by deelari g the three organizations would ; tend tog Cher through thick and thin until they d won this fight . To make an alliance with gny Organization outside of the " Big Four " Railroad Brotherhoods is a new departure for the Brotherhood of Engineers , too , but Grand Chief Stone asserted , as had Mr. Pepper . that on this matter they surely would make common cause to the end . Chief Stone of the engineers and Vice Grand Master Wilson of the fireman made speeches both at the meetings of their own men arid those of , the Amalgamated Association . Mr. Stone , in answer to questions put by reporters , said he had received no communication from officials of the cornPanY , and that he did not expect any for the present . " It is all up to Mr. Belmont , " said Chief Stone . " He alone can say the word that will avert a strike . Mr. Belmont 's attitude is that he can get , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs for the subway , at $3 a day . We want these men to have $3.50 a day , and we will not give in until they get it . Mr. Belmont seems to forget that the tunnel is a public property and that he will be responsible for the safety of passengers carried in it . " We . maintain that Mr. Belmont should engage for the responsible position of motormen only a class of men better than those that can be gotten for $3 a day . " We can not afford any compromise in this case , What the company wants to do is to reduce the existing wage schedule all round in the subway , and we will not stand by and see that done . " Mr. Stone expressed the opinion that there was still a possibility of peace . at another conference with officers of the company , but said the ' initiative must by taken by them . The Interborough 's Side . General Manager Buell of the Interborough last night issued a signed- , statement which he began with the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railway Company and the engineers , firemen , and motormen employed on the road and the engineers ' and firemen 's brotherhoods . This contract , which provided for a nine-hour day , with a pro rata overtime charge , was , he continues , inherited by the Interborough . Mr. Bryan continues : " The Interborough Company was aware that the contract provided for a higher rate of pay and for shorter hours than were being granted motormen anywhere else in the United States . The former management of the Manhattan Railway explained their reasons for giving these exceptional rates of pay and hours for work as being on account of the long and faithful service of the engineers . " These engineers were ? not motormen . They had been trained in their duties as such ; many of them were familiar with the vacuum brake only , then being used on the Manhattan Railway , and had to be instructed in the use of train line air . In many instances they were past middle life and have not as readily learned such duties as , would younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful investigation was made as to the highest rate of wages for motormen , thoroughly equipped as such , and thoroughly familiar with automatic air ; also the hours required for service from such motormen ; and the rate of $3 per day of ten hours was fixed as the salary for motormen in the subway. there being no higher rate of pay or shorter hours for similar service anywhere in the United States . " " All employes in the train service of the Manhattan Railway have been allowed to understand that preference will be shown to them for positions in the train service in the Subway . " The Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employes , consisting of a large Part of the train employes of the Manhattan Railway other than motormen and firemen , had signified their willingness to accept the positions offered in the Subway at the salary and hours named , and many of them have applied for positions as motormen . At this time a committee of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen appeared before the officers of the Interborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same hours which applied on the Manhattan should be applied on the Subway . Several conferences were had with this committee , and it was explained to them that the contract made with the brotherhood would be strictly adhered to by the Interborough Company , but that we would not consent to have it extended to the ' Subway divieion . " Explanation was made to the committee wily these exceptionally short hours and high rate of pay were given , and that we could not consent on the opening of a new enterprise , where a large number of outside men would begin service , to the establishment of a rate of pay and hours for labor Which were given to them as a mark cf special favor for their long service , and which are more favorable than the rates of pay and hours of labor on any other electrically operated railroad in the United States . " A final declination of their demands was made on Sept. 1 . The chief officer . of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers hap been present at several of these conferences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads , where it is possible to fix the hours , his men are working ten hours per day , and in some instances twelve . " The facts are that at all the large railroad centres where yard and switching work is done the hours for engineers and firemen are twelve ; that is , they are required to report and take their engines at 6 A. M. and are relieved at 6 P. M. " We regard the action of the chief officer of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers as being ' an effort upon- his part and his associates to establish a rate of pay and hours for engineers whom he hopes to install as motormen upon the completion of the electrification of several of the large steam systems now working toward that end for their terminals in and adjacent ' to New York .. " The Interborough Company will fulfill to the letter the contract made by the Manhattan . Company with its engineers and firemen , collectively and individually , regar  --  less of any action that may be taken by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
