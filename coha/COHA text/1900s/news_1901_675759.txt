Kennedy left the building in tome for the 4 o'clock Staten Island ferryboat , and was taken down to the ferry in a newspaper delivery Automobile , to avoid the crowd which thronged the corridors in the street in front of the building , and which awaited only a chance to cheer the man ADMITTED TO BAIL .

Upon an examination of the papers it was ascertained that Lieut . Hand did not have the property in his own name , the title being vested in his wife and lie holding an unrecorded mortgage for V.3.000 . He then produced a quarter of a million dollars ' worth of bonds and first mortgages , but it was explained that only real estate or cash could be accepted as security , and he said he would go to his home and bring his wife down to sign the bail bond : Mrs. Eleanor M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the District Attorney 's office shortly after2 , and her bond was accepted and Kennedy was sent for . Clerk Cowing put the usual , questions , and Kennedy and Mrs. Hand , answered them wind the necessary - papers were signed . the whole operation ' taking less than five minutes . Thd ? released man and his counsel then briskly walked out of the courtroom through the corridors , that were jammed with sightseers . As the two came to Elm Street there was such a crowd that policemen had to clear a passageway and surround Kennedy to protect him from the hundreds of hands that were extended toward him . " What 's the matter with Kertnedy ? ? He 's all right . " " What 's the matter with Bob Moore ? ? He 's all . right , " was the cry which arose again and again , and finally became continuous . Kennedy and Moore walked as quickly as possible to 320 Broadway , the attorney 's offices . The crowd tried to follow , but was kept in check by the police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore was the tenth juror . William Wiswall . The seventh juror . Louis R. Searles. called shortly after Mr. Wiswall arrived for a like purpose , and to accompany Kennedy to his home and to see his family receive him and to congratulate the old Kennedy folks , who were unable to appear in New York . Mr. and Mrs. Eton , - the father and the mother of Mrs. Kennedy . were also at the officeor the attorneys , and Mrs. Kennedy herself sat in the private office of Mr. Cantwell awaiting the return of her husband . Besides these , there were dozens of friends from New Dorp , , the dentist 's home , a small array of reporters , many of whom during the three long trials had come to know the Kennedys intimately , and many strangers who had come merely to see Kennedy and to congratulate him and to be able to say they had shaken hands with him . Into this mixed crowd of several hundred , all in a happy mood , Dr. Kennedy walked unexpectedly . MEETS HIS WIFE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked in the office , then the door opened , and as quickly as the two had entered they reappeared , oniyeto disappear into the office of Mr. Cantwell , where was the devoted wife . As Kennedy caught sight of the woman who had refused to desert him , his face broke out into a radiant smile and tears of joy came into his eyes . Mrs. Kennedy threw herself into her husband 's arms , and . burying her face against his shoulder , sobbed . It was decided to take the 4 o'clock Staten Island ferryboat. but the crowd below was so dense that it was feared that there would be a parade down Broadway were the Kennedys allowed to take the car . It was decided , therefore , that Mrs. Kennedy and the rest of the Party take the cars , while Kennedy was to go down town in a newspaper delivery motor vehicle , As the boat entered the slip at St. George - Kennedy emerged from the smoking room . The crowd caught sight of him through the wagon gates , and the same cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tombs were repeated . Kennedy for the ft-1.st time appeared to notice them . He half turned toward the cheering mob and raised his hat . On board the Garrett the deckhands , who all had ? known the doctor as an old commuter on the ferry , came and shook hands one by one , and said they were glad to see him again . Capt . Cole then appeared and offered the party his pilot house . There all repaired , and on the trip across Mrs .. Kennedy sat close beside her husband on a lounge in the pilot house , and leaned her head against his shoulder and clasped his hands in her own , and listened to him telling of his experiences . The bright sun was shining into a window behind Kennedy 's head , and he asked to have the shade drawn . " I am not at all well , Y think , " Kennedy said ; " I am so weak that I can hardly walk any distance  --  you know I am not used to exercise . The walk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so that physically I feel worse than I have since I was arrested . I will not be able to work for some time , I fear , but in time expect to resume my practice . " Mrs. Kennedy , dressed in a black skirt and a black waist , with a white lace collar . and wearing a sailor hat trimmed with white chiffon , and a blue polka dot scarf , was the happiest woman imaginable . Asked to say something regarding the trial and the dpctor 's release , she said : " Ike have not made any plans this time . Weavere disappointed so many times that this ' time we decided not to make any plans . He will come horne ' ' and rest . Poor boy , he has been through an awful lot ; but he has kept up wonderfully . He looks well , but he is so thin . " pr . Kennedy will - practice in Staten Island . His practice is waiting for him there , and I would never be satisfied to have him open an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever believed he was guilty , and his friends have stood by him faithfully . We have also made many new friends . The newspapers have been good to us . But . for them and the eftorts of Cantwell &; Moore , our side would never have been known . " It was suggested that Dr. Kennedy owed more to her ( his wife ) than to any one elseHe thinks he dhes , " said Mrs. Kennedy , blushing and smiling ; " but I have done no more than any woman would hatye done . I feel very well , but pretty tired . -I have not had a day at home for a long-time , but I felt better when I was working for him . I got heart sick when I tried to stay at home to rest . " I am thankful that this day that I have hoped for for three years nearly has come at last . Of course I wish it had been an acquittal , but I am thankful to have my husband home again . I feared from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HP - Was the only man on the jury who never looked my husband in the eye . " KENNEDY TALKS OF THE CASE . Falling into the conversation , Kennedy interrupted : " It is a glorious thing , after this hideous ' nightmare , to be out again in God 's free air . I can realize What Molineux is going through now that he is waiting for the decision of the Court of Appeals . The suspense is awful . " I was well pleased with the Judge 's charge , and thought it particularly fair . He treated us well all through . " When asked which he found the worst opponent ? Mr. or Mr. Osborne ? Dr. Kennedy said : Osborne , in a way , made the strongest fight against me , and in a way he did n't . The men are entirely different . Mr. Osborne enters more into minute details and is more mathematical and vindictive , but Mr. is more magnetic . Aue , the foreman , was opposed to me from the start , 1 have since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified against me . " The worst shake-up I had was the day after I was put in the death cell , when my wife came to see me . She called twice a week regularly , and when I was brought back to the Tombs she saw me daily . . My cell was next to Molineux 's , and we could hear each other 's voices , but could not see each other . " William Wiswall , the tenth juror , then talked freely about the case . He said that he had entered the jury box with the impression that Dr. Kennedy was guilty , but was so convinced of his innocence by the ** that he would have staid there a moigth rather than consent to conviction in any.degree ... Upon arriving at St. George the party " a train for New Dorp , after running : the gantlet of the ferry hands and the railroad men who were acquainted with Kennedy before he was accused of the murder . All weht in to the last car of the train , and Mrs. Kennedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore and Mr. Cantwell and friends and relatives filled therest of the car .

A delay threatened owing to pepple who wished to congratulate , but the doctor wanted to get home to his parents , and-the brief walk of five minutes was made by the entire crowd . The aged father and the mother of the once doomed man stood in the entrance of their.garden . They had heard the arriving trail ) , and had come to welcome their son . At sight of the doctor his aged , gray-haired mother ran toward him and he toward her . and she threw herself into his arms and in presence of the entire crowd held him close and heigged him to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . while tears rolled over her withered cheeks . It was a sight that made many men weep . Old Mr. Kennedy meanwhile stood a little aside , smiling happily , until he could get a chance to welcome his son . " My boy ! My boy ! " was all he could say as the men embraced and the son 's eyes again filled with tears . Then came the greeting of Kennedy 's little son , and ' finally the younger Mrs. Kennedy decided that it was her turn all over again . All present were invited into the house . The rooms and the halls were decorated with flowers picked from bushes in the garden of the doctor , and- neighbors had sent in several cases o &; wine with which to celebrate the return properly . In time . one by one the strangers and friends drifted away , promising to call again at night , but preferring to give the reunited family a chance for solitude . In the midst of the group , smiling contentedly , was Mr. Moore . Again and again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctor . but the lawyer looked . merely happy . " I ought to have gotten him an acquittal if everything had gone right , ' ? he said . " But this serves the same end . It is the beginning . of the end . In the Fall I will move to have the indictment quashed. - they manage to get some new evidence against against my client I have no fear whatever that the case will be retried . And when it comes to new evidence , why , I have something up my sleeve that will knock their case sky high this time . " ? OVATION AT NEW DORP . Dr. Samuel J.
