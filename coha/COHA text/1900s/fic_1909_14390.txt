( The interior of a school-house , including a blackboard on platform at R. of stage , texts and maps on wall , and benches arranged so that the faces of children can be seen by the audience . Scholars on a bench in front of the platform at rise of curtain , teacher standing on platform holding open book . JOHN WARD , LAURA POST , WALTER DAVIS , CLARA , GEORGIANNA , KATIE SMITH , GEORGE , ANNETTE , CHARLES SPEAR , seated according to the order in which their names come . Each is dressed as a country child would be in a village school . ANNETTE should be tastily gowned with dark hair tied with ribbons to match , and have much manner and many smiles when spoken to . When scholars answer questions , they should stand , resuming seat at once . Two women and a small girl enter at L. of stage , appear awkward and shy , drop into seats near exit . They are in outdoor costume of a past fashion , neither grotesque nor antique , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array themselves . When addressed by the Teacher , they simply shake the head in answer . Several children sit before their desks in the schoolroom , including TOMMY EDWARDS and JIMMY DUNN , MARIA and her little sister ROSIE , SARAH POTTER , JULIA SMITH , and one or two others . TOMMY and JIMMY quarrel , snatch each other 's things and show displeasure in quiet manner ; other scholars write and act as scholars do in school without claiming to themselves too much attention from spelling class . The French recitation can only be given by one familiar with error occasioned by an imperfect knowledge of English , and only when adults take the characters . The author has no recitation to offer as it was an original recitation by an actress who is now in France . Any recitation in broken English would be appropriate . ) TEACHER Will the two ladies and the little girl please come forward and take seats on the platform ? You prefer to sit where you are ?

I would like to explain to the parents and friends who are with us this afternoon , that it is my custom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written them , reserving corrections for another time . The compositions are more crude , in consequence , but the plan gives each pupil the opportunity to present his own ideas in his own way . Johnny Ward , what have you prepared for our entertainment ? p. 9 JOHN A love story . TEACHER A love story , eh ? How old are you , Johnny ? JOHN Fourteen , going on fifteen . TEACHER Fourteen , going on fifteen . Your love experiences may interest us , though they are not likely to be valuable to the world at large . JOHN ' Tai n't my own experience . It 's a made up story . TEACHER I thought you were rather young to have had an experience in that line . I beg your pardon . You may come forward . ( JOHN swaggers to platform , conscious and awkward , makes country bumpkin bow . ) Hold up your head , John , mind your stops , read slowly and distinctly , and try to avoid that sing-song you are apt to drop into .

JOHN ( in high set key , and without stopping till out of breath ) " Once upon a time there was a feller and he hed about a billion of freckles but he wuz kind . One day he wuz diggin ' pertaters an ' a girl come a past and when he went in fer noon vittles he asked his mother if she thought his freckles wuz as yeller and big as common and she said not by a long shot they wuz fadin ' out an ' not to worry he wuz ez good lookin ' as Lyzy Reubens any day , and that cheered him some and him and her went to call on Lyzy Reubens and old Mis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did and changed his religion and went to Lyzy Reuben 's church and hed it bad and kept a gittin ' it more and told her he would kill himself if she did not marry him and she laffed in his face and said then there 'd be one fool less and he said farewell and she laffed more and said if forever fare thee well and he come away . ( takes long breath , in higher key ) After that he went to Mexico and no one knew where he had went and there wuz times when he wished he hed n't went but he stuck it eout and growed rich and come back and got married to Lyzy ' cos she wuz old now and humbly and glad to git anybody . Moral . ( change key ) A great deal of trouble could be saved if girls wa' n't so measly mean , and after all freckles do n't caunt if a feller has a good heart inside him John Ward . ( starts for his seat after bowing ) p. 10 OMNES Please , Teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us ? TEACHER What do you say , Johnnie ? Will you sing for the scholars ? JOHN I jess as leif .

If it was n't for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the life a goin ' through the nose . Boys that stay in a room all day should not breathe too much . They should get out of doors . Boys in a room make bad , unwholesome air . They make carbonicide . Carbonicide is poisoner'n mad dogs . A heap of soldiers was in a black hole in India and a corbonicide got in that there hole and killed nearly squeeze the diagram . Girls ca n't holler and run like boys because their diagram is squeezed too much . If I wuz a girl I 'd ruther be a boy so I can holler and run and have a great big diagram . Charlie Spear . ( bows . Returns to seat ) p. 11 TEACHER Next . Sarah Potter . ( SARAH comes to platform , smiling , and reads ) SARAH Hope . Hope is a very good thing to have , particularly if you have n't got much of anything else . It helps a lot ! When a boy is a boy he hopes to be a man ! When a girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a woman is a woman , she hopes to be a widow . When a widow is a widow , she hopes to get married again . It is a good thing to have plenty of hope . Sarah Potter . ( returns to seat ) TEACHER Walter Davis . ( WALTER DAVIS comes forward , bows and reads ) WALTER Girls . TEACHER What ? Girls and their idiosyncrasies seem to be a favorite topic . Go on ! WALTER ( reading ) Girls think a lot of rags and dolls . They ca n't shoot marbles , nor climb trees , nor throw a ball worth a cent . Girls are always fooling a fellow . If a girl wants a fellow to carry her books , she ai n't satisfied less'n she gets the same fellow the other girl likes whether she wants him or not . Girls say fellows are awful , but when a girl gets to goin ' she 's awfuller than any fellow dares be . You ca n't lick her ' cos she 's a girl , so she gets the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' secrets . They make a secret out of nothin , and then they go ' round and tell it to the other girls just as if it was something dreadful , and wo n't tell a boy any of it . If you do what a girl tells you to do , you 'll do all sorts of foolish things and then she 'll make fun of you as quick as anyone . Girls are cowards and their brothers have to go for them after right , and because they are sometimes pretty . ( sly look at CLARA , and in low voice ) Not always !  --  and have long hair . If a girl scratches you or bites you , or makes faces , you must n't tell her mother or slap her face , but grab her and hold her tight in your arms and let her see how strong you are and the next time she wo n't do it , particularly if you kiss her . This is all I have to say about girls . Walter Davis , his composition . ( bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you told me your subject was flowers . CLARA ( coming to platform ) It was , but I changed it . Walter Davis told me what he had wrote , so I wrote one on him . ( turns to WALTER and makes up a funny grimace . WALTER laughs ) Mean old thing ! TEACHER You wrote a composition on Walter Davis ? CLARA It ai n't called Walter Davis , it 's called " boys " . I guess I know as much about boys as he does about girls , so there ! ( makes another grimace ) TEACHER Oh , I see , a sort of vindication . Well , the champion of her sex may now give her treatise on boys . CLARA ( reading ) Boys and girls are made out of the dust of the earth , only boys are much more dusty than girls . Boys are rude at meal times . ( in low voice and with glance at WALTER ) And other times , too ! ( resumes ) A boy becomes stuck up soon 's ever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something smart ! ( contemptuously ) Boys can swim and play hookey , and are never tired less'n their mother asks them to fetch in wood . Boys have large lumps on their arms . These lumps are called muscles . They are always asking girls if their muscles ai n't bigger than the other boy 's muscles , and if you say no , then they git mad at you . When a boy grows up he becomes a husband and stays out nights . Some boys think they know everything . Walter Davis thinks he knows more'n his father or mother , or their hired man , but this is not so , for the Lord made the sea and the dry land , and rested the Seventh Day . Clara Louise Kellogg Smith . ( goes to her seat ) p. 13 TEACHER Laura Post , you may read the next . ( LAURA comes wriggling to platform , stands , giggles , and with an effort announces her subject , and is overcome with amusement . ) TEACHER Laura , stop your giggling ! LAURA Pigs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your seat ! LAURA ( reads , gradually becoming normal ) Pigs are animals . Some pigs are black , and some pigs are white , and some pigs have spots on them , but most pigs do n't have much color . Pigs have legs , and big heads , and curly tails , and grow very fat , and grunt , and are nasty in their ways . Little pigs are real cunnin ' . Little pigs are a dollar apiece when they get big . This little pig went to market is what I say to our baby . It is a game  --  with toes . My mother says , our baby gets as dirty as a pig , but she does not mean it , it is only for fun . No more at present about pigs . Laura Post . ( takes hold of dress , makes little dip , goes to seat convulsed ) TEACHER Georgianna West . GEORGIANNA ( comes forward , smiling , makes a curtsey , reads ) Spring . Spring is a very pleasant time of the year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees are green , and there are birds in the woods , and beautiful violets , and a great many other things too numerous to mention . There are a great many kind of springs . Spring tides , and spring halts , and Spring bonnets , and bed springs . I think Spring is the best time of all . Georgianna West . ( bows , returns to seat ) p. 14 TEACHER George ! Page No. 14 Page No. 15trude , there are plenty of others who will jump at the chance , so I will bid you good afternoon . JULIA ( proffering a tract ) Here is a tract , Matilda Eliza . I wish you would take it home and carefully read . KATIE You may as well keep it and serve it with the gruel for I shall not read your old tract , Elinor Gertrude . JULIA Then I will bid you good afternoon , Matilda Eliza , ( starts to go ) for I fear the gruel will become cold . I hope you will repent of your worldly ways , and flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her seat ) KATIE Good afternoon , Elinor Gertrude . ( bows and leaves for seat , removing the flat and closing the parasol ) TEACHER Very good ! Scholars , what lesson can be learned from the conversation between these two friends ? As many as understand the moral it endeavors to teach , hold up the right hand . ( every child holds up her hand ) I am glad to see so many hands raised . Clara , what does the dialogue teach you ? MARIA ( standing ) Not to give away any tracts . ( sits ) p. 15 TEACHER Oh , no . Sarah , what do you learn from this dialogue ? SARAH ( standing ) Never to take gruel to sick folks . ( sits ) TEACHER Oh , no , no ! Laura , what do you say ? LAURA ( standing ) Please , Teacher , does n't it mean not  --  to  --  go anywhere with a basket ? TEACHER It means nothing of the kind . ( LAURA sits ) I 'm surprised that scholars as old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ask you , girls , which of the two friends you would rather be ? Matilda Eliza , who was selfish and worldly minded , or Elinor Gertrude , who was kind and benevolent ? Georgianna may answer . GEORGIANNA ( smiling ) Please , Teacher , I 've never went to a show , and I think I 'd like to be Matilda Eliza for a little while . CLARA ( aside ) So 'd I ! CHARLIE ( aside ) Me , too ! TEACHER Annette , will you recite something ? ( ANNETTE comes forward and recites a poem in broken English . JIMMY DUNN and TOMMY EDWARDS quarrel. ) p. 16 TEACHER Tommy Edwards and Jimmy Dunn ! What do you mean by interrupting the exercises in this manner ? Come forward ! ( move to platform ) JIMMY Wa'al , Teacher , ' tai n't fair what Tommy done ! ( makes sudden move to strike TOMMY , TEACHER arrests his hand ) TEACHER You naughty boy ! How dare you ! JIMMY ( shakes his fist at TOMMY ) I 'm a goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , or you may get whopped yourself . JIMMY Wa'al ' tai n't fair anyheow ! Tommie , he give me a top , fur keeps and I gave him some twine , and a slate pencil , and a ball , and a apple . And Tommie , he took back the twine , and swiped the top when I wa n't lookin ' , and broke the pencil , and et the apple . ( cries ) TEACHER Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? TOMMY ( hangs his head , mutters ) ' Did n't neither ! TEACHER Empty out your pockets ! ( TOMMY empties his pockets of every conceivable thing to be crowded into a boy 's pocket including articles mentioned ) Pick out the twine and return it ! ( does so ) Hand the ball back ! ( does so ) Now the top ! ( does so ) Now the slate pencil ! ( does so ) You 've eaten the apple so you can keep that ! Go and stand in the corner with your face to the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of sight during school hours . Go to your seat . ( As they retire , TOMMY looks fiercely at JIMMY . JIMMY makes funny capers on the sly to show his delight to TOMMY . TOMMY stands in corner , keeps peeping over his shoulder at intervals . ) Maria , you may recite your verse . ( MARIA comes to platform , looks frightened , fixes her eyes on a distant object , and in frightened manner . ) " Mary had a little lamb , it grew to be a buck , One day it rushed at Mary , and things rattled when it struck . She turned a summersault or two , and lit upon her head , When she revived her friends were shocked , to hear the things she said . The tender babe may grow to be , a bully , rough and strong . Take warning by poor Mary 's case , do n't keep your lambs too long . " " Toronto Globe . " ( Leaves platform without bowing and in a rush , goes to her seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My !

There are several apples on my desk , which their owners can have before going home , also some chewing gum . Now , Rosie .

I want to go home ! ( cries ) TEACHER Well , dear , you may ! School is dismissed . ( Scholars plunge to exit in the wildest disorder , pushing and laughing , crying " Wait for me ! " and similar exclamations , and appropriate stunts. )
