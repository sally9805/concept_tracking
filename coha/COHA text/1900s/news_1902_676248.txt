txt Material for a celebrated case in insurance annals is furnished by gie death of Robert C. Whayne , President of - the Whayne Manufacturing Company and a prominent business man of this city . He carried $340,000 insurance and had been accepted for $30,000 more . Of this insurance the Equitable Life Assurance Soc:ety of New York carried $200,000 and the Provident Savings Life Assurance Societyof New York $1,20 ; 000 . Mr. Whayne 's body was found last night in the vicinity of Jacob Park , within 100 yards of his home . There was a gunshot wound in his breast . About four feet on the opposite side . of a wire fence was a double-barreled shotgun . One barrel had been discharged . The other was loaded and the hammer was cocked . Suspicion is strong among insurance men that Mr. ** committed suicide . They have demanded the most rigid investigation by the authorities . Coroner Kelly , who has takenNthe matter in hand , went to the place where the body was found to-day . He said that circumstances are such that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquest for Saturday . and members of Mr. Whayne 's family and his friends wilt undoubtedly be questioned as to his personal affairs and the state of his mind recently . It is known that he suffered from rheumatism this Winter . Most of the ' insurance carried by Mr. Whayne was taken out in the last sixteen months . Before he evinced a desire to place a high value on his life he was a believer in insurance , as he had long carried policies in reasonable amounts . He suddenly began applying for policies , ' however , and in large amounts , and was generally accepted as a good risk . These are the polleies.he carried at the time ofhis death : Equitable Life Assurance Society of New York , four policies of 850,000 each , issued on Sept. 1 , 1901 ; Nov. 19 , 1901 ; Dec. 20 , 1901 , and May 10 , 1902 . Provident Savings Life Assurance Society of New York , two policies of $00,00u each , issued in January , 1902 , and February , 1902 . Union Central Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , 1898 . New York Life Insurance Company , one policy of $5,000 , issued in 1890 . Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company , two policies at $2,600 " and $8,000 , issued Feb. 0 , 1887 , and Aug. 22 , 1891 . It will be seen that he began taking out insurance in 1887 , when he obtained a $2,000 policy , following with another of $5,000 in 1890 , and a third of $3,000 in 1891 . This 810.000 sufficed until 1898 , when he doubled the amount . There was another interval of years and then he began the campaign with the Equitable Company and followed it with his applications to the Provident Savings Company . Each Of the Equitable Company 's policies contained the one-year suicide clause . On two of them this had expired . Mr. Whayne applied less than a month ago for a policy of 825,000 with the Manhattan instirance , Company and had been accepted . The policy was clue to arrive Dec. 22 . He had also applied to the Mutual Life Insurance Company of Vermont for $35,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday . It is said by agents of these companies , however , that he had not been formally accepted , and that , according to the terms of the policies , these companies need not pay . Mr. Whayne eight years ago applied for a ten-thousand-dollar policy with the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York and was accepted . Upon the policy being delivered he learned that it forbade him taking a trip to the tropics or to the Klondike without the company 's consent . so he rejected the , policy unfess the terms would be changed . The company refused , and the policy was- never placed in force . He told the officials of the local agency that he intended going to the Klondike , and , therefore , he could not accept such a rigid contract . Investigation showed that Mr. Whayne was always a believer in insurance . Suspicion centres in the fact that in the last sixteen months he had been obtaining policies apparently as many and as large as possible , as if having centred his attention in that direction . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion of suicide . They hold that the shotgun was accidentally discharged as he was attempting to climb the fence , They declare there has been no evidence that he contemplated putting an end to his life . PROVIDENT IS REINSURED . ' Half the Whayne Risk of That Society Has Been Assumed by Other Concerns . E. W. Scott . President of the Provident Saving , Life Assurance Society of 346 Broadway , said last night : " I have just heard of the death of Mr. Whayne , but know nothing of the particulars . Mr. Whayne took out endowment policies for $120,000 in our company last February or March . The commuted nature of those policies at this time is $74.000 , but as half of the total amount has been reiusurc ' by us in other companies , our loss , if it has to be paid , will only be $37,000 . I suppose that our officers will make an v Inestigation . " The courts have held that a life insurance policy is vititiated if the holder commas  --  suicide at any time within two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , was rendered in Illinois . I do not know the names of the companies in which half of our Whayne risk was reinsured. "
