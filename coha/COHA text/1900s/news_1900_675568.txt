txt The American Protestant Episcopal Church has taken the first step towards prohibiting the re-marriage of divorced persons by Episcopal clergymen , and preventing the participation of such persons in the communion of the Church when they have been re-married outside of it . The special committee appointed by the Protestant Episcopal Convention of 1898 to consider the subject of divorce was in session in this city all day yesterday , and at the conclusion of the session made public the canons on divorce which were adopted , and which the committee will report to the next annual convention of the church , which meets in San Francisco next October . These canons , if adopted by the convention , as there is every prospect that they will be , will be a declaration against divorce stronger than that which has been made by any other Protestant denomination , and similar to the stringent law of the Roman Catholic Church on the subject . The question of the re-marriage of divorced persons and their being permitted to retain their standing in the Church is one which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the General Episcopal Convention , held in 1898 , there was a protracted debate on the subject , which ended in the reference of the question to a committee of twelpp . This committee was instructed to draw up a report for submission to the convention and to make public its conclusions nine months before the assembling of the convention . The special committee met a year ago , but was not able at that session to come to any agreement . The members met again yesterday , and this time their effort to harmonize their views was successful . The Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix , who was made Chairman of the committee , presided over yesterday 's session . The other members of the committee present were the Rev. Dr. Eugene Hoffman of New York , the Rev. Dr. Mann of St. Louis , the Rev. Dr. Fulton of Philadelphia , the Rev. Dr. Eccieston of Baltimore , Francis A. Lewis of Philadelphia , Francis L. Stetson of New York , Charles H. Stanley of Washington , D. C. , and Judge E. G. Bradford of Wilmington , Del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the forenoon session of the committee nothing definite was accomplished . The committee assembled again at 3 o'clock , and when an adjoukumen , t x wo.g , taken at IS o'clock . it *as-atatbunc-ed that the committee had completed the work intrusted to it . The committee adopted three canons deal , ing with , the subject of marriage and di ' vorce . The first canon is entitled ? ? Holy Matrimony and Impediments Thereto . " The full tekt of this canon Is as follows : Holy Matrimony and Impediments Thereto . Section I. ? Holy matrimony defined . ( a ) Holy matrimony is an estate of life which for the purposes of this canon is sufficiently defined In the form appointed for the solemnization of matrimony in this Church . b ) The solemnization of holy matrimony is a service where the mutual consent of the parties is given in the presence of a minister , who then pronounces them , in the name of the Holy Trinity . to be man and wife . Section 2 , which is entitled " Impediments to Matrimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stated in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy . The second canon drafted by the committee deals with the subjects of the " Solemnization of Holy Matrimony . " It is sub-divided into four sections , as follows : Section 1. ? lt shall be the duty of all ministers of this Church to conform to the civil authorities relating to marriage . Sec. ** minister who shall solemnize a marriage shall without delay make such record of the same as may be required by the laws of this Church and the civil authority . Section ** minister shall solemnize marriage without the presence of witnesses tp whom the parties are personally known , except in a case in which It is impossible for such witnesses to be secured . No minister shall solemnize the marriage of any person not identified to his satisfaction . Seetioz. 4 . No minister shall solemnize marriage between any two persons unless , nor until , by inquiry he shall have satisfied himself that neither person has been , or is , the husband or the wife of any other person living , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competent jurisdiction for cause existing before such former marriage . It will be seen that the last section of the canon absolutely prohibits the remarriage by an Episcopal minister of any party to a divorce suit , whether guilty or innocent . except where the cause for divorce existed before marriage . In this case it would be held that there was no marriage . in an ecclesiastical sense , the offending I party not being in a position to enter into the contract . The third canon adopted by the committee guards against divorced persons who have remarried outside the Church re , entering into its communion . It excludes from all means of grace within the dispensation of the Church the offending party to a divorce suit who shall have remarried . While the offender is outlawed from fellowship in the Church . provision is made for his or her readoption into the Church on the condition that there is a show of true penitence and separation from the party to the second marriage . There is also provision for death-bed repentance . The canon is divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied baptism or confirmation or the holy communion under this canon until after the minister shall have given to the person due and sufficient notice of , such intended denial and of the right of appeal . Section 3 provides for an appeal to the Bishop of the diocese or missionary district , who , if he deems the cause sufficient . may take counsel with his neighboring Bishops and decide whether there shall be any dispensation . The report of those taking part in the conference was unanimous . One member of the special committee has died in the last year . When the committee had concluded its labors , the members were disinclined to discuss their action . They made public the canons adopted because required to do so by the convention . Both the Rev. Dr. Dix and the Rev. Dr. Hoffman . when seen last night , refused to make any comment on the committee 's action , except to sav that their action spoke for itself and needed no explanation .               @ @ @ @ @ @
