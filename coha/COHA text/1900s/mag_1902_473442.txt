WHAT may be called the marine biological station movement began early in the last century through the efforts of Carl Vogt , of Geneva , of Louis Agassiz , of Huxley , and of other great naturalists , who foresaw the important results which would flow from the study of marine life under the living and fresh conditions afforded only by a close proximity to the sea-shore . This movement culminated in the beautiful and resourceful station at Naples , and was extended to Africa , Asia ( including Japan ) , Australia , and both coasts of North America ; so that the world is now encircled by more or less permanent biological stations . Agassiz brought with him to America , along with his other enthusiasms , that for marine stations . In 1873 an eloquent address of his caught the eye of a New York merchant , Mr. John Anderson ; our first sea-side laboratory was established on the little island of Penikese , off the coast of Massachusetts ; and for one memorable season a group of men who have since exerted a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All have become leaders , but notably A. Agassiz , Brooks , Jordan , Lyman , Mayer , Morse , Putnam , Whitman , and Wilder . " Study Nature , not Books , " and other mottoes embodying Agassiz 's Socratic theory of teaching zoology , adorned the walls of this plain pine building , and have fortunately been preserved to perpetuate their influence at Woods Hell . After a second season , following the death of Agassiz , in December , 1873 , this island laboratory , somewhat too isolated , as it proved , was abandoned . All the credit for reviving the work belongs to Boston , especially to a number of ladies , who , in financial cooperation with Professor Alphaeus Hyatt and the Boston Society of Natural History , founded a new laboratory at Anniequam , which in 1888 was finally transplanted to Woods Holl . Professor Charles L. Minot , of Harvard , and Mr. Edward G. Gardiner , of Boston , have been active in its support . With Professor C. 0 . Whitman , one of the distinguished pupils of Agassiz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its walls , we may consider Woods Hell as the offspring of the Anderson school . After three decades , however , while the older zoological methods have survived in the collection and dissection of every form of life , in the study of migration , distribution , and feeding A SEA-SHORE habits , these still-fascinating " natural history " facts are now seen through the new glasses of the Darwinian theory of fitness , the struggle for existence , and descent , to which Louis Agassiz was never reconciled , although they formed the subjects of animated discussion at Penikese . But more than this , a new impulse almost undreamt-of at Penikese has transcended the old . This is biology , the study of the nature of life itself , us found in protoplasm . Even the genius of Huxley could not foresee the biology of the close of the nineteenth and dawn of the twentieth century , when in his famous address " On the Physical Basis of Life " he said : " Thus a nucleated mass of protoplasm turns out to be what may be termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fowl , reptile and fish , mollusk , worm , and polype , are all composed of structural units of the same character , namely , masses of protoplasm with a nucleus . . .. Hence it appears to be a matter of no great moment what animal or what plant I lay under contribution for protoplasm , and the fact speaks volumes for the general identity of that substance in all living beings . " The unity of protoplasm is the ultimate raison d ' ? tre for the Woods Hon laboratory . As we shall see , in our brief accounts of recent discoveries there , in the protoplasm of a star-fish egg may be wrapped up a secret of vast importance to the welfare of the human race . By the surpassing aid of modern microscopic lenses and technical methods , a new world of infinite minuteness and order is revealed in this substance which Huxley considered as comparatively simple in constitution . The rare opportunity which Woods Holl affords of advancing our knowledge of life by different methods of attack , and the equally rare companionship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working towards the same end , ? this is the intellectual at-traction of Woods Holl . Of all points along the coast this is the best adapted physically for a seashore laboratory . About ten years after the abandonment of Penikese , Spencer F. Baird selected this spot , and succeeded in establishing here the splendid station of the United States Fish Commission , with its fleet of vessels and extensive laboratory facilities , chiefly designed for the investigation and artificial culture of all edible forms of sea life , but also as a sympathetic and active factor in the prosecution of pure scientific research . This national station , under the administration of Goode , Rumpus , and others , has been a resourceful and willing ally of the biological laboratory . On the route between the famous old towns of New Bedford and Nantucket we pass from Buzzards Bay through the rushing tidal waters and dangerous channel of Woods Holl eastward into Vineyard Sound . Directly in front of the laboratory lie the beautiful islands of Nonamesset and Naushon ; stretching off to the south is the long chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar chiefly through the following rhyme ! Naushon , Nashuena , Nonamesset , Uncatena , Weepecket , Pasquenese , Cuttyhunk , and Penikese . This very coast-line , the mingling of northern and southern currents and the meeting of the tides , supplying pure water of different temperatures , the bays and inlets , mud flats and sand bars , intensely salt , brackish , and fresh water pools , favor observations and experiments on all kinds of sea life . The ardor of biological research has driven individuals and even small parties to the dangerous and too often fatal waters of tropical America and Africa , but no missionary spirit drives us to Woods Holl . Cool and invigorating breezes stimulate the work of the day and evening , the long collecting excursions , and the application of mind in the general and private laboratories . The life and the social congress are as varied as the coast-line : school-teach-ers from all over the Union ; students from the smallest fresh-water colleges and the largest universities ; young aspirants for the doctor 's degree eager to win their spurs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology , psy-chology ? all come under the magnetism of the " M. B. L. , " as it is familiarly known . Work is not too strenuous ; it is tem-pered by the undercurrent of the feeling that , after all , this is summer-vacation time , and one must not be too serious . In fact , at Woods Hull , as with our Eng-lish and Continental scientific brethren , life is well balanced and altogether rea-sonable , while no less productive . The lectures and courses , too , which now em-brace the widest range from the anatomy of a crustacean to the experimental psy-chology of the chick , vary in intensity from the purely didactic instruction of large classes of beginners , formal discus-sions of the most profound subjects before a select few specialists , and philosophical evening discourses given partly by the staff , partly by invited lecturers , before the whole gathering . Unconventional but never amateur , these evening talks are often the choicest distillation of years of observation and experiment ; the speaker selects a field in which he is an acknowledged master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest and most striking advances . A year ago sixty-nine universities , colleges , and schools sent teachers and students , and during the first twelve sessions three hundred different institutions were represented , while among the lecturers and visitors were numbered most of the leading biologists of this country , and many from abroad . In contrast with the beautiful Renaissance building at Naples , our three gray-shingled laboratory buildings are almost barnlikc in appearance . In fact , there is an inverse ratio between the real intellectual capital and the actual financial and material resources . Experiment and observation are now the watchwords at Woods FIoll . When we speak of the secrets of life as wrapt up in protoplasm , and of experimental morphology ( as in the cases now to be cited ) , and of experimental physiology , the layman does not look any the wiser , but perhaps the nature of the investigations we shall here describe may be elucidated after the manner of a biological primer , as follows : If a worm normally produces a head , a series of segments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm in pieces and reverse the ends ? Or a hermit-crab , fitted into its conch-shell , and well known to rapidly regenerate its large exposed claws , what will happen if you cut off one of the apparently useless hidden claws which have been lying for thousands of generations within the conch ? This is a problem of experimental morphology , with important bearings on the evolution theory , as well as on the phenomena of regeneration in general . The purposive quality in living things , the apparent determination to overcome all obstacles and attain an end , is best illustrated in the remarkable . experiments of the above kind , in which Professor T. H. Morgan has become a leader in this country . These have culminated in his recently published work , Regeneration , a hopeful and optimistic counterpart of Nordau 's pessimistic volume upon human society . The moral of these experiments is briefly expressed in Hamlet 's aphorism , " There 's a divinity that shapes our ends , rough-hew them how we will " ? a moral so strong that quite a school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vitalistic theory of living things as opposed to the chemical and mechanical theory . The similar coalescence experiments of Professor Henry E. Crampton are illustrated in one of our photographs . It is shown that two moth or butterfly pupal cut on one side and held in contact will unite , and that grafting of the most varied kinds is possible in pupa ; not only of one species of moth , but of different species as well . For example , the anterior end of one pupa united with the posterior end of another gives a moth of apparently normal form . Two-headed and twin unions are thus produced . Unfortunately the fact that fusion is restricted to the external parts of the animal renders it impossible to breed from the graft-hybrid moths , and to obtain data bearing upon the much-questioned action of the body parts upon the reproductive cells . To make clear what is the need of this line of research , in. which America , thanks chiefly to Wilson , Conklin , and Mead , is an acknowledged leader , we must revert to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If an egg ( not a hen 's egg , but the minute and delicate little surface-floating egg of some sea-urchin ) normally divides into two , four , eight , and ad infinitum cells to form the adult , what will happen if you shake these cells apart ? The general answer to all these questions is that the unexpected will happen . Life rarely acts according to the reasoning of the closet philosopher . Out of the careful observation of the unexpected , however , is coining the rationale of the life processes . But the initial step is to study the undisturbed process of division through " cell lineage . " The transformation of the simple fertilized egg cell is always accomplished by splitting up into many cells , which ultimately constitute the various tissues . It is obviously a matter of great interest and importance to trace the lineage of the tissues backward towards the undivided egg . This has been done to such an extent that we can designate the particular cells that give rise to the outer covering of the body , to the nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and germ cells . Very early in the history of the embryo the future functional and structural regions are marked off , and there is a beginning of what Spencer termed the physiological division of labor . Some biologists are inclined to carry this back still further , into the components of the egg itself . One would suppose that any rude disturbance of this beautiful process would abruptly terminate life . Quite the contrary , for again the unexpected happens . A number of amusing and at the same time highly instructive experiments have been made by shaking apart the cells after the egg has broken up into four or even into eight . The remarkable general result has been obtained that these isolated cells do not die , but again subdivide and form a lot of twin or quadruplet individuals , as the case may be . In the early experiments of this kind by Wilson and others , each separated cell produced a minute but entire individual . But when Crampton happened to repeat the experiment on certain snails ' eggs , the main result was that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sea-urchins , in which shaking also produced fractional animals , the missing fractions were supplied by regen eration , ? another very striking example of Hamlet 's aphorism . In 1900 Professor Jacques Loch announced the remarkable discovery , in star-fishes and some other forms , that by suitable treatment with solutions not only of various salts , but also of such substances as sugar and urea , unfertilized eggs may give rise to swimming lame . This discovery , like most others of similar character , was the natural sequence of experiments which had started lines of thought in this direction . Richard Hertwig , in 1896 , in Germany , had shown that strychnine starts the eggs of sea-urchins on the course of development ; and Morgan , between 1896 and 1900 , at Woods Holl , had shown that the unfertilized eggs of Arbacia , a sea-urchin , when treated with solutions of sodium and magnesium chlorides , would segment and advance into much later stages than those observed by Hertwig , ? though no swimming embryos were produced . Thus to Morgan and Loeb of Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most epoch-making discoveries of modern times , that of artificial fertilization . Parthenogenesis , or the development of a female egg without the access of a male element or spermatozoon , had long been known among various lower types of animals ; instances are to he found in the bees , social wasps , Bombyx psyrhe , Daphnia , plant-lice , and others . Here was a case of artificial parthenogenesis , and Loeb was led to compare these natural and artificial phenomena , reaching the conclusion that fertilization carries into the egg a catalytic substance which accelerates a process that would otherwise proceed too slowly . Thus fertilization , from having a purely vital aspect , assumes a ehemico-physical aspect , and the hitherto mysterious phenomena of parthenogenesis find a partial explanation . Let us take an illustration , where nature conducts a similar experiment : Bran , chipu.s stagnalis is a fresh - water crustacean , which if raised in concentrated salt solutions ( salt lakes ) becomes smaller , undergoes some other changes , and transforms into a species which has been known as Arterula salina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of external conditions , as observed by Schmankewitseh . This observer kept Artemia in salt water which he constantly diluted by adding fresh water , until at last it was perfectly fresh ; the crustaceans had meanwhile gone through several generations , and had gradually so completely changed their characters that finally they acquired those of the genus Branchipus . Tn his discussion of this development without the male element , Loeb says it has an important bearing upon the theory of life phenomena : " If we succeed in finding a substance which accelerates the process of cell division at the normal temperature , this will at the same ? time lead to a suppression or reduction of the antagonistic process that shortens life . It is not impossible that natural death ' is comparable to the situation in the mature egg after it leaves the ovary . Nature has shown us the way by which at this critical point death can be avoided in the case of the egg . " It is safe to prophesy that the bearing of these and similar discoveries on medicine and pathology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bacteria . The artificial process has been spoken of in the press as " chemical " fertilization ; this is a misnomer which should not be allowed to mislead us even in a popular article . The single fact that Albert P. Matthews has been able to initiate development by the shaking of the egg indicates that artificial fertilization is as much physical as chemical . Mead , Conklin , and many others , following the Belgian , French , and German schools , had long been studying the internal changes in natural fertilization , and as a sequel to these discoveries are the very recent researches and experiments of Professor Edmund B. Wilson on the changes which go on in the egg after artificial fertilization . These were presented before the International Zoological Congress of Berlin , and attracted much attention . They show that the unfertilized egg , by the addition of magnesium salts , is able to create a complete mechanism of cell division , but under this unaccustomed stimulus , in the words of Wilson , " they manifest a multitude of aberrations which constitute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a sense of amazement . " These aberrations. are of high interest on account of the side light they throw on many debated problems of normal cell function and structure . The value of all these observations hinges , as we have said , upon the essential unity of protoplasm throughout the animal kingdom ; as in Huxley 's prophecy , whatever applies to the protoplasm of sea-urchins we may be sure applies in some degree to the protoplasm which constitutes the basis of human life . Experimental biology is building up the very foundations of a knowledge of life-processes . The older school of anatomy and pathology , which dealt with fully developed results and with the external appearances of disease , must give way , and is fast giving way in intelligent communities , to the new school of medicine imbued with the true biological spirit , and intent upon the study of man not only by the examination of his elaborate and complicate structure , but by the study of vital forces in their simplest expression .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
