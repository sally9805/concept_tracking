txt A little knot of journalists were gathered In the reception room of the University of Copenhagen at 11 o'clock this morning . Word had gone forth that the Connietory had been summoned to receive a communication regarding De , ' *lei polar records from the examining commission . The scientists , arctic experts , and a majority of the newspaper men had come prepared to hear the verdict rendered by the university . The Consistory , which is made up a representatives of the various Faculties , was sitting in the Consistorium Hall , a little red-brick structure built 400 years ago and the oldest edifice in Copenhagen . It was practically a plenary session , twenty-one out of twenty-two members of the Consistory being present , Waiting for the Result . An hour passed . There was no indication of the session approaching its close , although Copenhageners lunch early , usually at 11 o'clock . Snow was falling , and the courtyard of the university became gradually covered with white flakes . Somebody suggested that Cook was being snowed under , while others of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the examination as pure as virgin snow . At 1:30 o'clock the Consistory arose , and the Rector Magnificus , Prof. Salomonsen , received the journalists . What he had to say to them may be told very briefly , for it amounted really to nothing more than this  --  there was no news . The Rector had received a communication from the examining commission , and the Consistory had been summoned to discuss it . Prof. Salomonsen pointed out ' that the university was primarily interested in. the work of its commission and naturally desired - to keep in touch with it as it progressed . He gave diplomatic replies , which conveyed no ' information , to a number of questions fired at him , and went to his belated luncheon , explaining that the Consistory had been in session three and onehalf hours and he was hungry . Evidence Not Convincing . Thus far only goes the official story , but I am able to add some details of interest and repeat the words which  --  I used in my dispatch on Friday , in which I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a the committee would be to the effect that the observations submitted by Dr. ' Cook were insufficient to establish his claim that he reached the north pole . I am bound to say I have no official authority for the statements which fellow , but I have good reason to believe them entirely accurate . The examining committee has already . made up its mind as to the value of Dr. Cook 's proofs . It met yesterday at the observatory at 1:30 P. M. and-sat tin 4 P. M. Then it met again at 8 P. M. and continued the work until midnight , when a communication was sent to the Rector , as a result of which he called to-day 's meeting . of the Consistory. deleted 3 paragraphs It was apparently the desire of the commission , if possible , to base the detelsion entirely on Cook 's records . This Method , however , did net have the approval of all the members . It was argued that Cook 's claims must be judged by all the evidence available , and that the question of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carrying out the prevailing idea of the commission that the first concern was with the scientific data some members went to such lengths that tram . the moment of their appointment they banished even the newspapers from their cognizance , lest they should mead anything that might influence the ettittide of mind in which they should approach the examination of Cook 's riocuments. deleted 3 paragraphs Now , the impressions given by the brief cabled summary and the complete documents are as different as chalk is from cheese . Inquiry Now into Faking . At the same time it was made known that should there be any need of a further examination the commission would neglect no evidence which it considered . material , end in this were classed the Loose-Dunkle affidavits . The question of the sufficiency of Cook 's records having been passed on , these are now to be taken up , and the inquiry broadens into an . examination of Cook 's reliability and the question of faking . The Danish press , which treated lightly the Dunkle-Loose revelations on the basis of the cabled summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been received here . The newspapers admit almost unanimously the importance of this evidence . The Politiken. which has been such a fervent partisan of Cook that until recently it refused to admit anti-Cook arguments in its columns , shows signs of wavering in its allegiance . The National Tidende , which enjoys a high reputation for soberness and editorial judgment , and which has hitherto been strongly in Dr. Cook s favor , acknowledges that Capt . Loose 's full statement constitutes the most damaging charge which has yet been brought against Dr. Cook . It says , in so many words , that its faith had not been shaken for a moment by the cabled synopsis , but , after a careful perusal of the complete affidavit received here by Thursday 's mail , one could not but ask in astonishment what relations Dr. Cook had with Loose . A Serious Shade on Cook . " Should there be seen to be any agreement , " continues the National Tidende , " between Cook 's and Loose 's observations , it could have been produced in two ways  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loose having copied Cook 's . In either case the situation would be critical for Dr. Cook . " It is not easy to understand why Dr Cook should have sought the advice of any one regarding his observations . /t is impossible to see for what purpose he had any relations with Loose , and this . in our opinion , casts a serious shade on Dr. Cook . " So absolute has been the secrecy maintained regarding the commission that Copenhagen to-day was not generally aware of any session at the university , and yesterday , when the real work of the committee began , the neighborhood of the university was entirely innocent of reporters in quest of information . Queer Stories in Copenhagen . Some papers , in default of accurate information , had recourse to invention , and some amusing stories have been published in what the Danes call the " dirt-press " of the methods of elimination pursued . One journal described with an abundance of detail how microscopes had been brought to the observatory to be used upon Dr. Cook 's diaries , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more recent date than the period covered by Cook 's sojourn in the far north . Another told how Chairman Stroemgren. when the committee assembled , daily brought out a strong-box in which Dr. Cook 's records were kept , and ' Which , it was added , were kept under a guard of trusty men night and day . Stroemgren then - read- out , aeeerding-to this veracious account , Dr. Cook 's typewritten 25,000-word statement the labor naturally occupying several . tings  --  and when the perusal ' should be completed the whole . would be dividea into several parts and distributed among the several members of the coin , mission , each a whom would eventually report on the particular section he had examined . There would then be held a general meeting , at which a common report would ' be agreed on , and thereupon conveyed by Stroemgren to the ConsiStory of the university . The facts are that the commission really began its work only yesterday . There had been - some informal preliminary meetings at which the members exchanged views and discussed procedure .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
