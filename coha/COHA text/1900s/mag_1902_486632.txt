When we consider how entirely distinct in most characteristics the provinces forming United Italy are , we must agree with our author that it is no easy task to give a just idea of Italian social life in a short volume . The broad demarcations of north and south , with the strongly marked individuality of their different populations , can not escape the notice of the most casual observer ; but not only the provinces differ essentially in character , thought , manners and customs , cookery , etc. ; each important city seems to have retained its own particularities which in the past gave a stamp to the architecture , painting , and sculpture of each place . In the north the people are industrious , active , full of business enterprise and capacity ; they take the lead in politics and in social questions , and consider themselves vastly superior to their southern compatriots , for whom they do not trouble to hide their contempt . The population of the Alta Italia provinces consider themselves wronged in having to pay high taxes in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally dissatisfied , complaining that the Government has always been more favorable to the north , promoting its industries with protectionist tariffs , making more railways and instituting more schools than for them . Moreover , in spite of the depressing conditions of its agriculture , the south , taxed just as heavily , has never received any aid from Government , besides having to endure the most incompetent officials , who seem to be reserved for important Government posts in the south . Before the Union , the debt of the Meridionali was very light , while now they share the public debt equally , notwithstanding the great sacrifices they made and the important part they played in the work of unity . Yet even in the south there is visible improvement . Bari and Naples are becoming important centres of commerce The great reproach the Meridionali have to bear is on account of their terrible criminal record , and the institutions of the Mafia , the Camorra , and brigandage ; the last still surviving in Sicily , as in Calabria and Le Puglie , where occasional cases transpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of Naples as of old . Besides these differences of character , our author cites instances of local rivalries of cities , having their sources in historical feuds , for example . Siena , where to this day Florentines are treated with scant hospitality on account of the battle of Montaperti , in 1260 , when the Sienese defeated the Florentines , and became for a while the rul ing power in Tuscany . The Sienese attribute all their present difficulties to the jealousy and enmity of the Florentines . They even consider the inefficient train service between the two cities as a result of Florentine bad feeling , on the other hand , they decline to organize any more convenient ' trains , as it might bring more Florentines to their city to damage their own commercial prospects by rivalry . This provincial exclusiveness is called the " spirito di campanile , " and prevails in such towns as Pisa , Arezzo , Volterra , Montepulciano and San Gemignano , while at Rome the pride of Roman citizenship extends from its princes , who hold themselves superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous in his acceptance of small favors Our author , ' writing on the aristocracy , considers that " good society " translates what is meant by aristoorazia , for bankers , merchants , manufacturers come under this denomination . Plutocracy has great influence here as everywhere Titles are - very common , there being no law of primo geniture in Italy , besides which they are frecniently adopted by those who have no right to them . On the other hand , there are many of the most ancient and noble families in Venice and Lombardy descended from burghers of the free cities , " optimates , " who are called nolnli or patrizvi , without bearing any title In the early days of Italian unity the Piedmontese nobles had much influence in the government of the new state , they were the King 's immediate advisers , and are said to have promotel the common good as far as it was in their power . Their special importance ceased when Turin was no longer the seat of government , though some of them still take part in politics They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in commerce and general progress . The Lombard nobles , both for their immense wealth and for their active participation in commerce and industry , take the most prominent position among the upper classes They travel much , and entertain with munificence at their splendid villas about the lakes , in the Brianza or on the plains . It is to their initiative that the Lombard towns owe their prcsperity . The Tuscan nobility have the quality of being good landlords ; they live on their estate part of the year , on friendly terms with their peasants , although their headquarters are at their ancestral palace in the town to which they belong , and where , as the one relic of their commercial origin , one often sees a little shop door in some out-of-the-way corner with Canova di Vine over it , in which wine and oil are sold at retail Tuscan nobles are considered intelligent and shrewd , but extremely conservative and narrow-minded , and rather mean . Their innate courtesy and fear of interfering with the prejudices of their neighbors make them very inefficient in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when they are quite wealthy . The me'tayer system of land culture brings about a feeling of part proprietorship with the peasant , and fosters that healthy republican feeling so noticeable in Tuscany . The aristocrats of the south are mostly absentees from their estates , exercising feudal rights in defiance of the law , and exacting money return : , from their lands , which are managed by extortionate bailiffs They care only to make a show in Naples or Palermo or Rome , with fine carriages , smart clothes , and other luxuries When in their old fortified castles in Calabria or Sicily , they live like feudal barons , and ride about with armed retainers , who are devoted to them , although the peasants on their estates , suffering as they do from their callous indifference to their welfare , regard them often with sullen hatred . Titles are often acquired , either by giving large sums to charities , or by purchasing a landed estate to which one is attached ; sometimes they are given as a reward for public services either in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author is by adoption , as follows " There are a great many titled people , especially in the south , who have gone down in the world and who exercise the humblest professions to earn their bread . The aspirant to nobility  --  a wealthy contractor , or a fortunate speculator in stocks  --  discovers one of these nobal decaclutl , and persuades him for a consideration to adopt him as his son At the death of the chimney-sweeping prince or the cabman earl , the parvenu adopted son inherits the title , and plain Signor Donatim blossoms forth into the Principe di Torre San Gennaro , with , coat of arms , coronet , family portraits , and liveries all complete . His position , however , is not altogether an enviable one , as he is much laughed at by all who know the story , and everybody does get to know it . " The dislike for work is the bane of the upper classes . The prejudice that a gentleman should occupy himself with landed property only is gradually giving place to more enlightened ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fit for anything but the usual life of the butterflies of fashion , so similar in every country . There are In Italy many young , healthy men who prefer to spend their time in caf  --  s , the theatres , and sauntering about the streets on a meagre income to turning their attention to any useful work . Mr. Villari considers that even among the laboring classes work is looked upon as a painful necessity , and that , were it possible , most people would lead an idle life . The factors of the great differences of character among Italians of different provinces are shown to be the climate and the government to which each province has been subjected for centuries For instance , Austrian rule in Lombardy , so oppressive in political matters , seems to have been beneficent in developing a business capacity and public spirit , and fostering an appreciation of honest civil administration . The language also varies immensely in its dialects , so that even Italians sometimes seem to be talking an unknown language when they use their special dialect before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the south there are remains of Albanian and Greek colonies , and in Sicily and Sardinia the race partly derives from the Arab , but the population of the mainland has been composed for centuries of different groups of the same race . Notwithstanding all these diversities and discordant elements . a unanimous feeling pervades all Italy of the great importance of the union of the kingdom . As a signal proof that there never has been any political party based on regional particularism of any significance , Mr Villari recalls the proposal of some Milanese Radicals and Socialists to create a separate state with Milan for capital . This plan was so unpopular that they withdrew it of their own accord . On the formation of a Cabinet by a new minister the first consideration seems not the fitness of each member for his post , but that ministerial honors should be equally distributed among Lombards , Tuscans , Romans , Piedmontese , and Sicilians The same sense of fairness to all regulates the creation of new Senators and the conferring of honors . Conscription has done much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian instead of the special dialects . The military authorities make it a rule also to have men of all the different provinces serve together , and they learn thus by hearsay of the condition of the whole country . We believe Mr. Villari to be mistaken when he says there is no feeling in Italy against the Jews ; we should say that there is a strong prejudice against them . Even the wealthiest are often at great disadvantage in society , but they are tolerated on . account of large donations of money , or public services of some kind . Foreigners are not generally admitted to Italian society unless they are especially introduced to some leading members So many of the noble families have married American and English women that the exclusiveness of former times is gradually disappearing . The love of outward show is a striking feature in Italian life . Great sacrifices of personal comfort are made for the sake of appearances , especially in the south . Our author says : " In Naples and Palermo , life is not considered worth living without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American gentleman who was spending the winter in Naples , had taken a flat in a palazzo , the first floor of which was occupied by a noble family in somewhat reduced circumstances . He noticed to his surprise that every day he met a servant going up or down the stairs carrying a pair of carriage doors At last the mystery was explained . The said noble family shared a carriage with some other people , but each had its own doors with the family coat of arms to make their friends believe they both had carriages ! " This love of display is especially noticeable in dress The women of all classes wear very smart clothes out of doors , love brilliant colors , and spend much money and thought on fine apparel , but we do not agree with our author that Italian ladies wear their jewels in the daytime more than the English  --  on the contrary , it is only at important evening receptions or state functions that foreigners have an opportunity of seeing Italian ladies wearing their splendid jewels , the heirlooms of their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of ornaments and rare gems begins at breakfast Great frankness is a striking characteristic of this instructive little book The author writes of what he knows from his own experience ; he has observed much , and recognized many of the deficient sides of the Italian character  --  the general slackness , the want of moral conscience , the absence of any high ideal , shown in a general desite to shirk difficulties , from the schoolboy at his examination who resorts to cribs , to the politician who makes use of the Mafia for his election The subject of public education , so important to a young nation , has much occupied the Italian Government , which expends vast sums on the national schools and universities In his chapter on this subject , Mr. Villari has had his father 's ( Prof. Pasquale Villari ) valuable writings and researches to consult , so that what he says bears the stamp of unquestionable authority . He points out that the great mistake has been to apply the same order of schools throughout a country where the degree of civilization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different schemes of education are necessary . There are five standards of elementary education , of which three are compulsory , unless parents undertake to have their children taught at home . The number of illiterates still existing throughout the country proves that the law is not sufficiently enforced ; conscripts , when they begin their military service , are often unable to read and write , and have to learn during their term . Religious instruction is optional , but is generally demanded ; there is no feeling against it in Italy as there is in France The poverty of elementary schools is very great ; they are held often in unsanitary buildings , and possess few maps or specimens for object-lessons , and yet they cost the communes $15,000,000 , of which the Government grants $325,000 . The teachers , who are trained for their work in special colleges , are badly paid . The average salary for a man is from $140 to $265 per annum ; a woman receives from $110 to $210 at most . ? The secondary schools are divided into classical or technical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which the very poorest people are exempted . The classical schools are divided into ginnasil and bad , The age for the former is from ten to fifteen , the IWO demands three further years of study . The teaching is all on set lines , leaving no liberty of initiative either to master or to pupil . Latin is more thoroughly taught than Greek , of which it is rare that anything remains after school time . Modern languages are neglected . Italian literature , history , geography , mathematics , the elements of natural science , and philosophy , are the subjects taken up The course at the technical schools is also of seven years ; the subjects are modern languages , arithmetic , bookkeeping , algebra and geometry , drawing , history , and geography . There are , besides , special schools of decorative design and modelling . We are told that the agricultural , mining , and forest schools have failed completely , as also the sulphur-mining school at Palermo . There are no games or sports in common at any of the public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which there are classes twice weekly , but from which they are easily excused on very futile pleas . We have known parents to get a medical certificate so that their boys should not run the risk of catching cold after getting heated by the prescribed exercise . Friendships are not made at school , the boys of good family keep strictly aloof from those of inferior social rank . There is no community of interest among them , so that school life loses much of the purpose it has in England and America , where recreation is part of the scholastic plan . Strolling through the streets after school hours and frequenting the cafes , or a formal walk , are often the sole ' resources of an Italian boy by way of recreation . There are as many as twenty-one universities in Italy besides the College of Superior Studies in Florence and the Milan Academy This is in excess of the requirements of the country , but , as most of them existed when there were separate indepen dent states , the fear of offending local susceptibilities prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , costs in fees paid in separate instalments from $90 to $170 The result of this cheap higher education is not happy ' it fills the liberal professions with men who can not earn their living in them , and who consider themselves too superior to undertake more useful work They drift into Government employment , where they have little to do , and , unless specially gifted , have to content themselves with a salary of about $240 or $100 a year . During the university course the young men generally live at home . There is no supervision of study , no enforced discipline ; they are not even obliged to attend the lectures provided for them . If any professor is unpopular or severe in exacting their attendance at his lectures , the students have it all in their own hands to organize riots , and scarcely a year passes without some demonstration of this nature ; and the students of other universities follow suit to show their solidarity . The only punishment for disorderly conduct is the closing of the University for a fortnight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have besides fewer lectures to read up for their examinations . The Minister of Public Instruction has the right to supervene and to suspend the ringleaders for a year , but any authoritative measures cause great discomfort to the Minister , who is tormented by petitions from the relatives of the offenders , or the local Deputy threatens to join the Opposition if he does not revoke the punishment ; and if the Minister remains unmoved , at the next Cabinet crisis he is generally ousted . It is this interference of the Ministry of Public Instruction which is so disastrous to the efficiency of the professors , often distinguished men of European reputation , but who are utterly powerless to bring about any material improvement in the system of education . The studies are regulated at the Ministry , the scholastic programme is there decided upon , the teachers are under its control , and the examination papers are made up there . In the course of thirty-two Years there have been no less than thirty-four different Ministers of Public Instruction , so that not one has ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in details of little value are constantly decreed and soon suppressed by the next man in power . It has often been declared that the post of Minister of Public Instruction should be permanent , ' not depending on party politics , in order to be in any way efficient . According to our author , this Ministry is overwhelmed with the care of trivial details . Even during his holiday in the country , the Minister is besieged with people requiring favors of him , while if passing through any provincial town , he is under the obligation of receiving the visits daily of the prefect , the Mayor , the head of the carabinieri , and the most important citizens , while if in a village , the local band plays every evening under his windows , unless as a change from this infliction he is serenaded by the children of the elementary schools . Mr. Villari 's chapters on Music , Literature , and Art are not in any way adequate The iliustrations , from instantaneous photographs , are very poor , and the style throughout is careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a shock to the reader when the subject treated of is serious . Notwithstanding these defects , the book will be useful to those who desire to know the life of the Italian people as seen through an Italian medium .
