txt Yesterday 's developments in the insurance situation included the acceptance by the New York Life Trustees of the S233,000 Which John A. McCall , the retiring President , refunds to the company for moneys paid in 1904 to Andrew Hamilton and unaccounted for by him ; the beginning of a suit in Saratoga County by E. H. Peters , a . Saratoga lawyer , to obtain an accounting of money improperly spent by the Mutual Life ; the announcement of an agreement between the three big life insurance companies to abolish rebates , and Ihe appointment of ex-President Cleveland as a referee in any disputes which may arise in such matters . All the Trustees of the New York Life I Insurance Company were quite willing ; yesterday , to admit that it was true , as THE TIMES said on Monday , that President John A. McCall has prepared his resignation , and that the Trustees will accept it . A member of the New Turk Life Investigating Committee also confirmed the story printed in THE TIMES yesterday , that Mr. McCall has made good the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton without an accounting in the year 1904. and that Mr. McCall 's successor in the Presidency of the company will be Alexander E. Orr. now President of the Rapid Transit Commission . Mr. Orr 's selection , it is learned , is not Intended by the trustees to be more than temporary . Mr. Orr is somewhat more than 70 years old and while he is sitll hale and active it is not believed that a man of his years will want to take up the duties of the Presidency of the New York Life for a longer time than would be consumed in picking out and electing a . permanent This , however , will not appear when he is elected , it is understood . but he will be chosen President without any reservations such as were placed upon the election of Frederic K. Cromwell , when he was made temporary President of the Mutual Life . I The New York Life 's investigating committee held a three hour and a half session in the Hanover Bank Building offices of the company yesterday , and talked about Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the members of the committee would talk for publication , except Chairman Fowler . The latter remarked as he came out of the room that the committee would not report to the Board of Trustees to-day on the Hamilton matter . It is probable that the acceptance of the resignation of Mr. McCall and the election of Mr. Orr will be the only business of importance further than the authorization of the publication of the company 's annual financial statement . This , as told in THE TIMES yesterday , is most favorable to the McCall achnimstration . The $2.35,000 which was put in Andrew Hamilton 's hands and has been unaccounted for by him was received by the Ntw York Life 's housecleaning committee from Mr. McCall yesterday morning . Mr. McCall sent a check for $85,000 and time notes for $150,000 . ThD committee accepted both , but did not . it was learned last night , relieve Mr. McCall of responsibility in the matter on the ground that the Hamilton accounts from prior years still unexplained are vastly more extensive than those for the year 1004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this money inconclusive , the Trustees in the housecleaning committee have determined to hold the matter in abeyance until it shall finally have been determined for what purpose Hamilton got money from the New York Life , in What amounts it came , and what he did with It . The complete analysis of the Hamilton situation may take a month or two to straighten nut completely . Several of the Trustees who sympathized with Mr. McCall called at his house , 54 West Seventy-second Street , - yesterday to try to urge him to reconsider his resignation . But this was of no avail . Mr. McCall himself would issue no statement . UNITE TO ABOLISH REBATES . Three Largest Life Companies Also Choose Mr. Cleveland as Referee . The first step in the establishment of closer relations between the three great Life Insurance Companies than have existed in the past became known yesterday in the announcement made at the offices of the Equitable Life , that that corporation together with the New York Life and the Mutual Life had entered into an iron-clad arrangement for the abolition of rebates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in - regard to which disputes may arise . Mr. Cleveland will receive a salary of $12,000 a year , which will be contributed by the three companies . The statement given out at the Equitable yesterday had it further that efforts were to he ' made ' to bring all the life insurance companies under the agree // meat . It is learned , however , that the negotiations ' between Mr. Cleveland and the Ryan interests in the Equitable over a proposal that he should enter into a similar relation with the three large companies for the solution of rebating and other problems susceptible of general discussion and concerted action , dates back several months . At that time correspondence was exr changed as to whether Mr. Cleveland would accept a position as referee for the questions arising between the three companies . It is learned that Mr. Cleveland then assented to the proposition in connection with his acting as a trustee of the Equitable 's majority stock , provided matters could be arranged so that the arrangement should not be open to criticism . The statement given out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Reform in the life insurance business has commenced in earnest . The three big companies  --  the ' New York Life , the Equitable , and the Mutual , ? have entered into an ironclad agreement with one another that rebating of premiums must cease , and any agent found rebating will be summarily dismissed from the company 's service , and will not be reemployed by any of the companies that are parties to the agreement . All questions in dispute in regard to such matters will be referred to the Hon. Grover Cleveland , who has been chosen as referee , with a salary of $12,000 per annum to be paid jointly by the three companies . This is the position ) nce occupied by the Hon. Thomas B. Reed . " It is the intention of the three big companies to secure the co-operation of all life insurance companies in this agreement . Mr. Cleveland has agreed to accept the position with the distinct understanding that he is to be seconded in his efforts to stop rebating , by the officers of . all the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers and agents that if rebating can be entirely abolished first year 's premiums can be reduced . " In many of the companies steps have recently been taken independently of the arrangement just announced to suppress the rebate evil , which insurance men who testified before the Armstrong Investigating Committee were disposed to consider , with the practice of " twisting " ? that is , persuading policy holders of one company fo give up their policies there to enter another  --  among the worst evils of the life insurance business . In a recent letter to the agents of the Equitable , Vice President Tarbell said : " We wish it to be plainly understood that no conniving or winking at rebating , directly or indirectly , will be permitted , and no agent will be allowed to remain in the company 's service who violates this rule . " MUTUAL TRUSTEES SUED . Brackett 's Neighbor Wants an Accounting of Moneys Spent . Summonses were served on several of the Trustees of the Mutual Life Insurance Company yesterday in a suit ' begun in the courts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saratoga Springs . to obtain an . ccounting of moneys alleged to have been improperly spent by the old management of the company . Mr. Peters has offices in the same building in Saratoga as Senator Edgar T. Brackett , and It was recalled when the summonses were served yesterday that Mr. Brackett had been instrumental in the bringing of similar suits against the old Board of Directors of the Equitable Life and against the Trustees of the New York Life . He has also in recent interviews suggestea the possibility of praceedings against the Trustees of the Mutual . Copies of the complaint in the Peters suit ' were not served yesterdaa , and all that is known of the action is that it seeks an accounting . In his actions against life insurance ' boards Senator Brackett had proceeded on the theory adopted by Attorney General Mayer in the suit against the old Equitable Directors that the Trustees were responsible for whatever maladministration had existed , and could in addition be held personally liable for any misapplication or waste of funds through particular acts in which they were involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit against the Mutual Trustees it would be on this ground . To-day 's meeting of the Mutual Life Trustees , it is expected , will be the most important since the election of Charles A. Peabody to the Presidency of the company . The report which the Mutual 's Investigating Committee submitted to the last meeting , only to have it laid on the table for a week , will come up , and its recommendations are understood to be such that a definitive line-up of the Trustees may result . The Investigating Committee is understood to be a unit with respect to this report and , according to the talk downtown yesterday , the recommendations are of the most drastic order . It is ascertained that many of the Mutual 's Trustees who originally stood out against the election of any one to the Presidency of the company until there had been timc for the InvesigatingCommittee to do its work , are now prepared to back that committee in any efforts it may make to bring about the restitution of moneys improperly diverted from the treasury of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to be responsible . The situation in this respect is well enough developed , it is said , to bring about some resignations from the board whenever the final test is made . In the opinion of several Trustees who were seen yesterday this test is not unlikely to come to-day . Charles A. Peabody took office yesterday as President of the Mutual Life . He installed himself in the office that has been occupied for years by Treasurer Cromwell on the second floor of the building , declining to use the sumptuously furnished offices set apart for the President in the days of Richard A. McCurdy . Mr. Cromwell became Treasurer yesterday again , but it is understood that as soon as he thinks things are running smoothly under Mr. Peabody he will start on an extended European trip . This is believed to foreshadow his eventual resignation , as he expressed his desire to retire from active life when he accepted the post of temporary President . Emory McClintock , newly elected Vice President of the company , will continue in active charge of the business end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCurdy gave up his active duties some weeks ago . The resignations of Vice Presidents Granniss and Gillette have not yet been sent to the Trustees . The firm of Charles H. Raymond &; Co. , General Agents for the Mutual Life in the metropolitan eistrict went out of business yesterday and , accordingly the profits to Louis A. Thebaud , President McCurdy 's son-in-law , through the channel of that concern 's new business have ceased . Mr. Peabody announced yesterday that he would see reporters at 4 o'clock in the afternoon . Then he changed his mind and saw no one . Most of his day was spent in consultation with the heads of departments . LEAVES THE PRUDENTIAL . Edgar B. Ward Retires from the Second Vice Presidency . Edgar B. Ward , Second Vice President of the Prudential Insurance Company of Newarit , announced his retirement yesterday from the active management of that company . Mr. Ward has been connected with the Prudential for more than thirty years . He was for many years at the head of the company 's legal department . He has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
