WHAT is called " the most beau- tiful drive in New England " is that from Brandon , Vermont , to Rochester in the same State , over the Rochester Mountain . Brandon is itself the subject of a well-placed laudatory nickname , for those who know it speak of it as " the drawing-room village of Vermont . " It is like a fanciful painting of what a town ought to be , or like a collection of model villas scattered over a rich green sward decked with spreading elms , and ready to be shipped to the next universal exposition in confident expectation of taking a first prize . The prettiest villages in England can only surpass it in the minds of those who value relies and monuments of a remote past above the living beauties of the instant , yet when it comes to the history of the place it can not be said of Brandon , as Matthew Arnold said of our thousands of Western towns , that " nothing ever happened in them and nothing ever will . " Was not Stephen A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was born stand in perfect order there to-day ? The drive over Rochester Mountain is one of precisely fifty attractive carriage journeys which may be made from Brandon to as many different places , or to a large number of points by fifty different routes . All this section is what may be called Ethan Allen 's country . Beside Lake Dunmore the people show you the hero 's cave in which be hid and to which he retreated with his Robin-Hood-like followers during the time when he resisted the efforts of the Governor of New York to parcel out Vermont among his English and Scotch favorites , while New Hampshire 's executive claimed a better right to the practice , and had the Green Mountain Boys on his side . One has to read about this cave in order to revere and admire it . In its actuality it is a small hole or chamber in a rock . It isonly when you read Judge Thompson 's glowing pen picture of it in his Green Mountain Boys that you discover how well and almost ingeniously suited it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a natural porch outside , and several chambers opening out of a central hall within . But it is sixty-two years since Judge Thompson wrote his thrilling story , and that is , perhaps , time enough for even a cave to undergo great changes . Fortunately for us , the marvellous beauty of the mountain lake is as great as ever , and I doubt whether any other feature of the immediate region has suffered material modification in the lapse of time . The thick woods which clothe the mountainous walls of this blue jewel must appear to our eyes almost exactly as they did to the eagle vision of the daring ranger who ruled the tree-clad emerald hills and wooded valleys all the way between the borders of the Bay Slate and of Canada . Not to miss any experience so highly praised , I took the drive over Rochester Mountain one autumn afternoon . As the livery-stable steed who dragged me and my artist companion played the chief part in the adventure , it is best that lie should tell the story in his own words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide , and of such age and degree of experience as to render him chronically sleepy and exceedingly ingenious in seizing every opportune moment for indulging his fondness for dozing . Being as artful as a fox , and coupling his cunning with a clumsy gait and meditative manner , he succeeded in inducing us to relish his periods of sleep as preferable to the peculiar rocking-horse movement with which he varied it when aroused . He could jog , or trot , as well as any horse , but he knew better than to air this accomplishment . It suited his purpose best to make a laughingstock of us by teetering and bobbing over the road with head and tail alternately tossing up and down whenever he was roused . He did this with humiliating success as we drew up in front of a line of farmers before the Rochester Hotel . " My master and I came to the front of the Brandon Inn at half past one o'clock , " he told his mate in the next stall afterward . " We believed we were going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen . Instead , we sent word into the hotel that we had arrived , and then we both went to sleep and slept two hours . All of a sudden , there shot out of the hotel a stout and sober-looking man in a cap , and a short , slender , excitable man in a hat almost as large as an umbrella . The manager and two bell-boys came with them , lugging things that fairly took my breath away , so that I wanted to shriek like a camel when it sees a heavy load brought out to be put on its back . There was a huge valise apparently full of lead , a smaller valise that made one of the boys perspire , a mandolin in a case , a earners , overcoats , storm-coats , an awful lot of canvas stretched on frames ready to he made into oil-paintings ? why , there was so much more than could be loaded into the buggy , that the stout man had to hang his tobacec , - pouch on the frame of the buggy-top , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he weighed two hundred pounds . Just think of such cruelty ! ? to expect a horse to take such a load nine miles up in the air over bumpy rocks ! And the horse being at that time unaccountably sleepy in the bargain . " I always start off like a Derby winner , so we dashed down the main street in a way to make all the little boys hurrah from the sidewalks . When I have made this first fine impression I always expect to slow up and catch a quiet doze while my fares are discussing which road to take ; but the nervous slender man , who looked like an umbrella because of his thin body and huge hat ? he was the driver , and he took out the whip and yelled at me very rudely . I was so hurt in my feelings that I began to rock along and brandish my thin tail at one end and my open mouth at the other . This generally brings a fare to his senses ; but I never took out a wild Indian before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learnall over again to have your way with wild Indians . He called me ' Kazooka Kazook , ' also Hi , there , Rabble , ' and kept shouting Wriggle , Rabble , ' until I never was so ashamed and mortified in my life . The solid man , who was cast in a foundry , and weighed two hundred pounds , kept writing in a little book and saying : We never can get over the mountain before dark . We shall not be able to see anything . Oh , why is my sad lot east in with artists , and why does the law allow artists to go freely about when so many more rational animals are kept fenced in ? ' " Suddenly , when we reached Forest-dale , where they make what they call wooden toys , three miles on our way , the umbrella man , who was driving , suddenly reined me up and said , There I I 've got to go back ; I 've left something . ' The cruelly heavy man asked if it was his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the umbrella man said it was his box of paints . Then I was turned around and had to race all the way back , while the wickedly heavy man said terrible things about his being chained to artists until he was afraid of catching their disease , and the umbrella man laughed and whipped me and yelled ' Hi ! Rabble , wriggle ! ' Bob along , wobbly one ! " Cazook-cazookas , ' and ever so much more of his gibberish . When we once again reached Forestdale I knew that my troubles were over . They could not run my legs off , because it grew darker and darker until it was pitch black , and they said they could not ace the road or the sky or anything . Of course , I knew the road very well , but I could not tell them , so at every farmhouse and cabin where the windows shone yellow and the women were carrying smoking and steaming dishes to the men who sat at tables in their shirt sleeves , the umbrella man stopped rue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The criminally heavy man was nasty to the umbrella man . Ile kept asking him how he enjoyed the most beautiful ride in New England , and whether he was going to spill a bottle of black ink on a sheet of paper and call it a scene on the ride . ' He had been ready to take the ride at breakfast-time , he said , and now it was so much time and money wasted , but a man who would travel with an artist was lucky if he reached home alive . The umbrella man only chuckled and called me nice old Rabble , ' and told the brutally heavy man that the less he saw , the less he would be hampered by facts . " Just before it grew too dark for my fares to see large objects , a fat bay horse that T knew very well , but do not recognize , because once when we were hitched together he kept biting my neck , and his master slapped me instead of him ? well , he appeared with a buggy that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I envied him ? going home and down hill in the bargain . Tho man that slapped me was in the buggy , and he leaned out and shouted , Look out ! there 's a bear loose in the woods ! ' I could feel my skin begin to twitch all over , I was so frightened ; but the outrageously heavy man and the umbrella man were not a bit afraid . They were angry instead . They said that the country bumpkin had called out about the bear , thinking it fun to try to scare them because they came from New York . The man that weighed almost as much as all the rest put together kept saying that he would like to give that bear man a piece of his mind . I wish be would , because that man had no right to slap me when his own horse was to blame . " Here the horse 's story ends with exclamations of delight over the fact that the heavy man gave the hostler at Rochester twenty-five cents for a " tip , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarts of oats , plenty of hay , a fresh bed of straw , a good drink , and a washing of his hoofs . My story goes on with a note of my surprise at the manner in which we dropped down from a mountain-top into a tidy prosperous village ablaze with electric light . All through Ethan Allen 's countrf electric light is abundant . What we had missed on our journey there was no means of judging , therefore it was determined that we should go back the way we came . In the mean time we meant to push on to a village called Hancock , famed all through the Ethan Allen country for possessing a hotel in which the most delicious game dinners , enriched by peerless garden produce , are to be enjoyed . Nowhere had it been said that VOL . CVI. ? No. 6.32 ? 26the journey to Hancock was noteworthy in any respect , and we set out upon it as pilgrims start for Mecca , with no thought of anything on the journey except its end . Thus it fell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains startled and then entranced us by its wondrous charms . To-day , after having taken , in broad day , the famed ride to which we had looked so eagerly forward , it is remembered only as a fairly pleasant prelude , and we declare " the most beau-tiful drive in New England " ( that we have seen ) to be the half-hour journey from Rochester to Haneock . The mountain folk say that there are three days in autumn , following the first hoar-frost , when the gaudy coloring of nature is to be seen in its full glory . That is , when few leaves have fallen , when the way-side flowers are still blooming , the maples are towering tongues of flame , the oaks arc red and yellow , the grass is richly green , and the sumac bushes touch the dark edges of the woods with strokes of red . Oa two of these three gorgeous days we made this journey . The youngster who wondered " why rivers always flow by large cities " should travel in the mountains , and then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside roads ? " Here it was the White River that displayed a fraternizing friendship for the earthen highway . The White River , just out of Rochester , recalls the appearance of the Thames above Maidenhead , yet has such noble accessories as the English river nowhere boasts : soft hills sloping down towards it on either hand , and everywhere showing a carpeting as rich in soft harmonious colors as an Oriental rug . The tiny valley bottom ? a spreading level ledge but little higher than the stream ? was decked with the capacious white homes and still larger red farm-buildings of a prosperous band of farmers , some of whose houses could be moved into our own New York suburbs without losing their attractiveness or seeming out of place . The wires of the telephone and electric light ran across the pastures to some of these homesteads , and suggested the bold thought that in another decade or two , perhaps , our most enterprising agriculturists may light up their farms at night , and hurry in their hay or do their early summer hoeing while their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cloud of tree leaves announced the neighborhood of Hancock . It is a place of only a dozen houses . Upon the porch of the commonplace-looking hotel stood the proprietor , an easy , kindly , rough-kept Boni-face , troubled by the bad news he felt certain he must break to us . His cook ? the best in all that country-side ? had left him for the winter , his wife was ill , he was alone and could entertain nobody . Iln said over and over again that he was very sorry , and to these words he added phrases so flattering to us and so well chosen that we magnified our misfortune in our minds , and grew to respect in ourselves all the importance his words imputed to us : " It is hard to have to turn you gentlemen from the door . I would be proud if I could entertain gentlemen like you . " How subtle is the high art of a true genius at hotel-keeping ! It is born in men and can not be acquired . As we drove up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uninviting . To-day we would go many miles out of our way to stop there . The gifted proprietor led us into his kitchen , and taking - op a fine large partridge , handed it to us with the air of a man who hesitates to offer a gift which he considers beneath the deserts of a friend . He bade us take this poor apology for the dinner we had expected , and drive three miles farther along the valley to a logging-camp . " The woman who has done all my cooking for me is the cook of that camp , " said he . " Tell her I said that she would give you a first-class dinner and would cook this bird as it should be done . " The journey onward was delightful . The mountains drew very near together , and we got the sensation of squeezing in between them beside a rushing stream that filled all the air with a loud silvery protest against our trespass upon its domain . A mere trail encumbered with bowlders led at an upward angle of forty-five degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a clearing before our dining- place ? our " Waldorf , " as the artist called it . It was a rusty old cabin with a shiny new addition of white boards , and the clearing before it was littered with firewood , a demijohn , a grindstone , a box , a handcart , and a clothes-line weighed down with drying clothes . A wholesome , brisk , matronly woman in a clean and tidy calico gown came to the door to inspect us , and we , in turn , looked over her shoulders and on either side of her into her inviting dining-room . It was as clean as any room in Rolland . A jovial red-faced stove near the door contributed its high spirits to the pots and pans that streamed and sputtered on its lids . A table set for half a dozen persons proudly displayed its irreproachable plates and dishes , spoons and knives and forks , upon a snowy cloth . A heavy and ancient brass clock shone upon a shelf , a colonial mirror hung upon one wall , a well-scrubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw the boudoir of La Cuisiniere ? a homely bed-room , but orderly and proud . We had been received as a matter of course , and as if New-Yorkers dropped in , two at a time , by the dozen every day . When we stated our errand and delivered our partridge , madame said , " All right ; you 'll hey to wait a half an hour " ? quite in the way you would expect the matter to be dealt with in a road-house where meals were served to strangers at all hours of every day . It was indeed a good repast she gave us . Whether it was because it was nearly two o'clock and we had been long in the fresh mountain air , or whether the novelty of the experience added sauce upon sauce to our hunger , it still was true that we enjoyed that meal and rated it among the best that have fallen to us . " Could the men hear me if I called to them ? " I inquired of this solitary figure in the wilds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't hear me , but I can hear them , sometimes , when they holler at the horses . ' They 're up on top of the mounting . " ( They always pronounce the word " mounting " in Ethan Allen 's country . ) " What a wild region this is , " I remarked ; " there is never a break in the woods . The land must look as it did when it was discovered . " La Cuisinrere said nothing for a moment , and then remarked : " There 's one man up here who gits all the bear 's skins and deer 's horns and heads and sells most on ' em in Boston . He makes a good living at it , too . " " Bears ? " the artist and I both ex-claimed . " The men surrounded two on ' em last week , " she continued , " but one on ' em got away . The one ' t was killed weighed 450 pounds . " " Then that man who warned us that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frighten us , after all , " the artist thought aloud . " What would you do if you met a bear and he did not run away ? " I asked . " Then I 'd run , you bet ! " said La Cuisini ere . " I 'd climb a tree , " the artist ventured . " The class in backwoods-ology is dismissed , " said I. " A bear can outrun and outelimb you both ; but if you pretended to be dead , by merely lying quite still on the ground , he would only sniff at you and roll you one way and another with his snout , then go off about other business . " " Jinarnaneddi ! " La Cuisiuiere exclaimed . " I 'd as soon he 'd eat me . " After dinner the artist discovered that the court of our Waldorf commanded a noble and lovely view of the whole valley behind us , ending where the farms climbed to the knees of the distant hills , and lay in green and yellow terraces above Rochester and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delight were but the prelude to two or three hours of painting , I threw myself on the grassy carpet of the court . " Let me make you up something for ye to lay on , to keep ye offna the ground , " said the kindly woman , and in a moment she had thrown down our carriage seat , put a pillow against the back of a chair turned upside down , and gone back to her stove , leaving me to sleep and my companion to paint . We returned by the now disparaged " most beautiful drive in New England , " and found it a mere woodland ride admirable onl ? at the ends . From the Rochester snit saw the sumptuous valley of the White River from a slight elevation , and from the western end the no-Me expanse between the Green and the Adirondack mountains spread wide and glorious beneath us as we stood upon a bare shoulder of Rochester Mountain . As if held by the wings of some huge bird high above the earth , we overlooked this great region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Otter merging into the fertile , populous basin of Lake Champlain . And in that basin we saw a territory more rich in interest to all Americans who love their country than almost any other on the continent ; the largest page bearing the historical records of our people . If the most sacred buildings in Boston and Philadelphia are properly rivals ; n claiming the title of the Cradle of our Liberty , then here in the Champlain Valley is surely the scene of its birth . From this eyrie on Rochester Mountain one may see the great " lake that is the gate to the country , " as the Indians named Lake Champlain ; one may see the Otter up which the paint-smeared savages crept to make their murderous attacks deep in Connecticut and Massachusetts ; one may scan where Ticonderoga lies in shameful abandonment , the spot where Champlain fought the red men 293 years ago , where the French built their most important fort in the chain that ran from Montreal to New Orleans , where Amherst took it from them , where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was secretly buried . It reqUired but little imagination for the mind 's eye to see the path that Ethan Allen and his band took to gain , at this fortress , our first great victory in the Revolutionary war . From where the white church-spires marked the seats of Rutland , Pittsford , Brandon , Whiting , Castleton , and Middlebury , one fancied he might almost see again the tall , rugged " Mountain Boys " stalking the trails to the rendezvous with Allen at Shoreham ? newly noted now as the birthplace of Levi P. Morton . All of these villages are prosperous and beautiful places to-day ? the summer resorts of well-to-do folk from a score of distant cities . Even the edge of the rich valley , where the lake waters lap the Vermont shore , now shows the beginning of a movement to stud the lakeside and the islands in the lake with fine summer hotels and palatial mansions set in great estates .
