Senator Proctor 's Rutland speech reads like that of a miserable anti-Imperialist . His open dislike of expansion over noncontiguous territory , his shrunken ambition which would be contented with such a pent-up country as could be bounded by the two oceans , the Arctic Circle , and the Gulf of Mexico ; his sentimental concession to the desire of all people to " govern themselves " ? why , the weakling and the craven seem suddenly to have clasped hands in this leading Republican Senator . The President will have to threaten him with a repetition of the speech exhorting us not to be afraid of being great . Rather than hear that again , we presume that Mr Proctor would consent to annexing the most distant isles of the sea  --  or would even flee to them His utterance , however , is a sign that the sobering-off period is about due after our Imperialistic , as well as after our speculative , debauch Senator Allison , in his speech at Clinton , Iowa , on Saturday night , dispelled any doubt that may have lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . He expressed the belief that no change would receive the sanction of a Republican Congress that would " so revolutionize our system as to deprive the Government itself of the substantial control that it now has and exercises over bank circulation , as well as over other forms of paper money " This means , of course , that no asset currency scheme will make headway in Congress prior to the next - election . Senator Allison , however , is of the opinion that legislation will be enacted this winter to relieve the nation from the inconvenience arising from the accumulation of money ' in the Treasury . - It is a question how far others will share this view The matter of so changing the policy of the Treasury as to accomplish this very desirable end is one which will arouse a sharp conflict of opinion  --  possibly as sharp as would be created by an attempt to substitute an asset currency for our present banknote circulation . While a measure allowing the Treasury to deposit both its customs and its internal-revenue receipts in the banks on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists and business men , it is probably useless to expect any action along this line in the immediate future . On the other hand , when it comes to the question of enacting a law permitting the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit his surplus funds on other collateral The tariff , of course , came in for a large share of Senator Allison 's attention , the burden of his remarks being that though our tariff and currency laws are not without defects , these may best be cured by the Republican party . Probably nothing would please the country better than to have the party demonstrate that fact . Secretary Shaw also contributed to the tariff discussion of last week by his speech at Akron , Ohio . Mr. Shaw has a way of presenting our . face facts that is quite impressive , as when , last Saturday , he said : " Our farms produce $4,000,000,000 , our shops and factories produce more than all the shops and factories of any other two countries on the map by $3,000,000,000 per annum . The productive capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export , in round numbers , $1,500,000,000 , and import $1,000,000,000 . " This is , of course , magnificent , but it could be wished that the connection were shown a little more clearly between these figures and the tariff . Mr. Shaw 's calm assumption of a cause and effect here is followed by this statement : " Suppose we open the doors and allow Europe to clothe us and furnish us our manufactured products , who will consume the products of our farms , and what shall we do with the products of our factories ? " The only answer which this calls for is the further question , If Europe impoverishes us , what advantage will she gain in the long run ? Mr. Shaw 's weak point is his failure to clearly understand the reciprocal nature of trade . The Treasury statement for August showed that upwards of $19,000,000 of national banknotes were included in the Government 's cash holdings . The September statement showed $15,500,000 . Under Secretary Gage the average amount of banknotes held in the Treasury was about ane-third of this sum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for except on the hypothesis that the Secretary has stopped or curtailed the redemption of banknotes by the banks issuing them . The Treasury must redeem with its own funds all such notes sent in , but if it fails to call upon the banks for reimbursement , if it fails to enforce the law in that particular , it makes a loan of its own money to the banks , payable on call , and then it holds a sword of Damocles over their heads If the Secretary has taken this course , he has not only put a new obstacle in the current of banknote redemptilin , already to sluggish , but he has brought a new-danger into the banking system  --  that of holding command over the reserves of the banks . Mr. Shaw has been very much a law unto himself since he became Secretary , and there is some room for apprehension lest his arbitrary practices end in a misstep of some seriousness both to himself and his party . The Rhode Island Republicans have appealed to the sort of patriotism that is the last refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared as gently as any sucking ' dove in their remarks on bribery , but they were as fierce as a lion in denunciation of Gov . Garvin for his efforts to stop it : " The party- declares against bribery and corruption , and , while it condemns such practices in either party , it finds no words of criticism too severe to apply to the Chief Executive who has preached and written throughout his executive career concerning the debauchment of Rhode Isl-land voters , thereby impeaching his own party and defaming the fair name of the State which he has taken the oath of honor to defend " The Republicans of Rhode Island are not alone in their folly . When Joseph W. Folk began his work in St. Louis there was a wild ' outcry , not agaiMst the highwaymen who had been robbing the city , but against the man who was choking them black in the face When negro peonage was unearthed in Alabama . Gov . Jelks had soft words for the criminal authors of a new slavery . who had beaten a woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Federal officials who were champions of the oppressed , and for the newspapers that printed the news and exposed his own cowardice . Here in New York , also , the men who have attacked Tammany and its organized vice are always accused of befouling their own nests . In Rhode Island the Republicans make no attempt to deny Gov . Garvin 's charges ; they dare not , for the facts are known to every intelligent voter . They content themselves with declaring that the man who tries to stamp out bribery is a greater villain than the briber . The issue , then , is clearly joined . Gov . Garvin 's views on proportional representation or on the referendum are beside the mark . In his speech to the Democratic convention he laid stress on the great question of Constitutional reform , and the platform itself demanded this as the first change  --  pregnant with all others . In order to reduce the contest to its simplest terms , the Republicans have commended as " the foremost defender of our national honor and our national prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been the principal beneficiary of the system of corruption ; and they have nominated for Governor Col Samuel Pomroy Colt , its vice-president . With ' an amazing lack of humor , they crowned their work by attacking " the immense Trusts " that " destroy competition , " in spite of the fact that Col. Colt is president of the Rubber Trust and vice-president of the Woollen Trust The campaign , then , is a fair fight for decent politics ; and the protagonists are the people on the one hand , and , on the other , the most unpopular and unscrupulous corporation in Rhode Island . The completion of the New York Fusion ticket is the signal for an aggressive campaign . The men who have stepped into the breach left by the deserters . Grout and Fornes , are unexceptionable candidates . Mr. Hinrichs ' named for Comptroller , has an admirable record in public office , proof that he is equal to the duties he is asked to assume . His character is an appeal to the united Fusion vote ; for though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidacy for Lieutenant-Governor upon the Gold Democratic ticket is evidence of his willingness to sacrifice partisan advantage to principle . Edward J. McGuire , who is nominated for President of the Board of Aldermen , is recognized as one of the ablest officials of the present Fusion Administration . As Assistant Corporation Counsel , he has conducted some of the most important litigation in which the city has been engaged ; in particular , he has distinguished himself in legal work connected with the Dock Board corruption under Charles F. Murphy . Mr. McGuire , too , is a Democrat of the most independent type He supported Palmer and Buchner in 1896 ; and he was one of the committee that resisted Croker 's attempt to control the judiciary , while in 1898 he conducted an independent campaign for the reelection of Judge Daly Both men are eminently suitable leaders in a contest for non-partisan government of New York city . Mayor Low , in his letter of acceptance , confines himself largely to a review of the many achievements of his Administration . The change from the condition of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would in itself be worth any sacrifice in the way of expense and trouble to which the city may have been put . But the transformation has been so quietly brought about that only those directly interested , like Commissioner De Forest or Mr. Jacob A. Riis , are aware of the full extent of the change . Mr. Low 's position is buttressed by the fact that in every single department there have been many important improvements , and that in not one has there been a serious scandal or a financial loss to the city because of dishonesty . The Tammany Hall platform could only make three vague allegations of wrong-doing . Best of all is the tone of Mayor Low 's letter . He is naturally generous in his recognition of Mr. Grout 's work and the achievements of his subordinates . In short , this is the review of a broad-minded and trained executive who places the welfare of the city above everything else  --  particularly the interests of State and national parties and politics As Mr. Low has well put it , the contest is between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pull . Every honest and unselfish man must demand the Mayor 's reelection and enforce his views at the polls . Judge Grosscup of the United States Court took the ground on Saturday that the solution of the Trust problem lay in a national law of incorporation . He also believed that should a great party adopt this idea and pass such an act-in Congress , the law , if properly drawn , would be sustained by the Supreme Court . His comment is interesting because it brushes aside the paraphernalia States will ever make their laws of incorporation uniform . It is certain that a form of incorporation which required reasonable publicity of accounting and that nominal capitalization should approtimate actual capital , would solve many of the evils arising from the present blind combinations . This , we believe , dispassionate students . of the problem have generally conceded . Judge Grosscut is original only in asserting that a national corporation law would be Constitutional . At first blush this seems impossible . The right to incorporate companies is not one expressly given to the nation by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised by every State . To withdraw the power from the States would mean the reversing of a - century of precedent , and yet it is possible that a discreet court might sustain a National Companies Act , under the power to regulate interstate commerce . Such a court would recall that , first , the power of incorporation was never in dispute at the Constitutional Convention ? it was hardly worth fighting for ; second , that , in the right to impose a national bankruptcy law , the central Government wields quite as drastic a power , and one closely analogous to that now sought ; third , that the exercise of the right of incorporation by the several States might be ' called , in Hamilton 's words , " absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant " to a proper exercise by the nation ' of the power to regulate interstate commerce  --  for practically all companies do an interstate business Canada under this last principle has practically asserted the right ? of national control over dorPorations . The Canadian Constitution no more gives that power specifically than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1867 . The power had become valuable , and whereas eighty years later it had gone by default to - the several States of the Union , in the Dominion it is being gradually assumed by the nation , against the protest of the provinces This ? might serve , if not as a precedent , at least as an illustration , for a court ' considering a National Companies Act . Some additional light was thrown upon the ethics of unionism at the regiilar Sunday meeting of the Central Federated Union . - Speaking of the suspension of the Morse Shipbuilding Company , a walking delegate of the International Association of Machinists exulted in the fact as a victory for organized laboi . The Morse Company had refused to pay union wages , the Morse Comis any disgrace attached to this matter , , we are willing and anxious to assume it . " With all allowances for bluster , there is more disgrace attaching to Mr. Warner 's view than any union can afford to assume . The Morse works were not closed as the result of a strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unionism might take satisfaction  --  though here also the victory might be far too dearly bought . The Morse shipyard was closed because the union workmen loafed on their jobs and refused to do an honest day 's work . That at least is the story , and such is Walking Delegate Warner 's boast . He rejoices that his union has swindled its employers out of days ' work until the business and the days ' work had been destroyed together . He congratulates his constituents upon successful petty larceny of the time that belonged to their employers . It is a peculiarly despicable instance of the shifts to which the union oligarchy will stoop . The cotton goods statistics in the August trade statement of the United States are of especial interest . They reveal a state of affairs that is rather striking in itself , and they cast a sidelight on the very interesting discussion which Mr. Chamberlain is now stirring up in Great Britain . The member from Birmingham said last week at Greenock that the cotton manufacturing industry of the United Kingdom was menaced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By an irony of fate , Board of Trade figures were issued the very same day showing a heavy increase in the exports of cotton manufactures for the first nine months of 1902 Presumably , the United States figured very largely in the late Colonial Secretary 's mind when he delivered himself on the cotton goods situation ; and it is interesting to note that our own August trade statement leaves him in the same plight as the Board of Trade figures . For , while the British exports for the nine months increased $6,250,000 , the exports of cotton cloths from the ' United States during the first eight months fell off $3,844,910 . Nor is this the whole story , for , far from menacing the Lancashire industry , this country had at last accounts imported $6,263,295 of cotton cloths from foreign countries this year , as compared with $4,956,354 in 1902 , and in particular had received $4 , - 845,270 from the United Kingdom , against $3,711,116 in 1902 , and $2 , - 795,257 in 1901 . A fact of considerable importance in this connection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price per yard this year than last , as regards both the month and the eight months . Notwithstanding the embarrassment to which he has been subjected by the high price of the raw material , the British cotton manufacturer appears to be gradually attaining a position in our market which gives the lie to Mr. Chamberlain 's utterances on the stump . But without any reference to Mr. Chamberlain , the recent figures regarding our exports and imports of cotton cloths are entitled to the most careful study . When it is stated that the exports for the first eight months of 1903 average something over five cents per yard , and that imports averaged in excess of sixteen cents , it is clear that it is in fine goods that foreign manufacturers are able to increase their hold upon the American market . In other words , on such lines of cotton manufactures as call for relatively high skill Europe ' continues to show considerable ability to compete with us . The exact cause " of this state of affairs is a debatable point , but among careful students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see , here the enervating effect of the tariff . As every one knows , this country has taken an enormous stride in recent years in increasing its output of coarse goods , the part of the South in this movement being especially noteworthy . During the boom period it was not easy to tell whether capital was being diverted to this industry too fast or not . It seemed to be generally agreed , however , that a growing foreign market was indispensable , and it will be recalled by many that some concern was felt in cotton-manufacturing circles in the United States over the great decline in the exports to China which followed the Boxer troubles , but which was only temporary , 1902 witnessing a resumption of heavy purchases by the Empire . The present year , however , is experiencing another recession in cotton-goads exports , principally in those to China . For eight months the shipments to that country were only 164,589,829 yards , against 254,892,479 yards for the corresponding period ' of 1902 . These figures not only explain in a measure why our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of the high price of the raw material this year , but they also show how vitally interested the industrial forces of this country . have become in all that affects the well-being of China . The new treaty with China , which awaits only the Senate 's confirmation , abolishes the likin tax on goods in transit , raises correspondingly the Chinese customs duties , promises reasonable arrangements for mining concessions and the protection of trademarks and copyright , and allots two free ports in Mantchuria In general , the treaty follows the line of the peace protocol drawn up in September , 1901 , after the relief of the legations at Peking . For the United States the treaty means assured and favorable conditions of trade ; for China it may be the beginning of much-needed fiscal reform . The likin tax which was levied at many points along the river and caravan routes , was an inordinately expensive one to collect , and liable- to diminution by pilfering officials . It subjected all goods for the interior to a wholly indefinite charge . The transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficiently collected , should tend to give stability to the Imperial revenues . But for that very reason the abolition of the likin on foreign goods will be bitterly opposed by Chinese officialdom . In a sense a series of concessions by China , the treaty really puts the Empire in a more reasonable , hence in a stronger , position , and leSsens the likelihood of foreign intervention in behalf of commerce . In this agreement Mr. Hay has shown himself , as at all times , the friend of China , although working primarily in the interest of the United States . A week ago the Russians were to have evacuated the two southern provinces of Mantchuria . Yet , as was anticipated , the military government has found insuperable obstacles to evacuation according to treaty , in the failure of China to accept certain conditions  --  chiefly those which secured to Russia a modified right of military occupation in Chinese territory . Everybody knew that Mantchuria was as definitely marked out for Russia as the provinces north of the Amur . Probably no Power will venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , How will the civil-iced world adjust itself to the fact of Russian ownership ? Except Japan , whose position remains to be defined , and China , which has nothing to say in the matter , the interest of America and of the European nations is simply that Russia shall continue in Mantchuria all commercial privileges and promises granted in that region by China . Meanwhile , Russia is hurrying troops towards the Korean border , Japan has practically her entire fleet in Chinese waters , and the Foreign Offices of the two Powers are negotiating for an adjustment of their relative claims in Asia . A diplomatic settlement can hardly be more than a . postponement of hostilities . Japan has no reason to believe that Russia will keep a new treaty otherwise than she has kept the Mantchurian convention . Japan , although financially embarrassed , could fight on better terms now than later . Accordingly , the drift is distinctly towards a war in which Japan would face alone the overwhelming might of Russia . The Anglo-Japanese alliance can hardly come into play ; it operates only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sympathy in abundance Japan will get from England and America , and arms and ammunition at the market rate . That is all . Just how far President Roosevelt wished to go in exterminating the Spanish before the declaration of war , is a question which has now been brought to the front by the article of ex-Secretary Long in the current Outlook In this paper Mr. Long confirms a story that was current gossip in and out of official life as far back as 1898 . Mr. Roosevelt , he says , in conjunction with - " some naval officers , was anxious to send a squadron across the ocean to sink the ships and torpedo-boat destroyers of the Spanish fleet while we were still at peace with Spain . " This " ardor " of Mr. Roosevelt , Mr. Long says , sometimes went faster than was pleasing to the President or the Department . Naturally . Mr. Long now expresses his surprise that this seems to some like a criticism of his erstwhile subordinate Does he not say that his relations with Mr. Roosevelt were always most friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he " gave his typewriters no rest " ? After such a tribute , why should any one accuse Mr. Long of sarcasm and of venting his spite ? Not we . In the interest of history we would merely point out that this is one of the episodes in the President 's ' career which he has had to live down , just as it furnished one reason why many conservative and loyal Americans watched him assume the Presidency with no little anxiety .
