 | MANY of us have seen beautiful gardens in England , France , and Italy . To many they are ideals hoped for , yet with the knowledge that the hope can never be realized . Little has been written about the gardens of Spain , and they are not so frequently visited as those of other countries , so that the lovely ones it was my good fortune to see last summer came upon me as a great surprise . The " castles in Spain " which I had expected to see on every hilltop seemed not to exist except in romance , but every chateau and villa , every tiny roadside inn , many factories even , had gardens where flowers of many varieties grew in greatest luxuriance . The climate of Spain , during the summer months , is dry and burning ; little or no rain falls ; streams and brooks become entirely dry , and many rivers flow only in a narrow channel . Except among the mountains , water seems to be scarce everywhere , and yet the gardens are watered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distance . The larger and finer gardens are usually irrigated . Sometimes the water for this purpose flows from a mountain lake , or from a reservoir built by the industrious Moors . Often it is pumped from wells by a patient donkey who walks blindfolded for hours around a narrow circle . Or again , the primitive pump is worked by two men . Everywhere houses were made gay by window-boxes filled with growing plants . Carnations seemed to be the favorite flower for this purpose , and I have seen as fine Carnations in the window-boxes of the poorer people in Spain as have ever been exhibited in New York . Every working girl wears a flower tucked into her black hair , white and red seeming to be the favorite colors , and many carry flowers in their hands . Landing at Gibraltar and having to stay there a day , we spent a most interesting afternoon in the Alameda , the public garden laid out in 1814 . Here , for the first time , I saw a peculiar pine tree which flourishes throughout Spain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our country . The color is a beautiful dark green , somewhat lighter than our white pine , or pinus strobus , and its shape is a perfect sphere . Smaller ones were like gigantic Bay trees in form , and being hardy could be used in the same manner for decoration without the disadvantage of having to be stored in winter . I never saw a beautiful specimen of this tree from the window of a slow-moving train without longing to have it dug up and sent to my own garden . In this Alameda at Gibraltar grew also stately cypress and gnarled cedars ; magnolias , and the feathery acacia mimosa , sycamores , oaks , and locust ; the beautiful pepper tree and the tender banana ; pomegranates , with their scarlet flowers , and orange trees laden with fruit ; olive trees with their silvery foliage ; oleanders , abutilon and fuchsia growing like trees . Blooming at one time were a great num-  | ber of flowers that with us would follow in succession and make a floral procession of several months . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again to understand a climate that would produce Chrysanthemums , Dahlias , Marigolds , and other late-blooming plants in early June . Japanese Iris was there in quantity . Paths were bordered with German Stocks , pink , white and purple , and with the old-time Clove Pinks . Great plantations of Carnations filled the air with their spicy odor . Phlox , Hollyhocks , the gay London Pride , and Sweet William in many varieties , were growing in masses . The fair Madona Lily and also Lilium Auratum raised their stalks of beauty above carpets of many-hued Pansies . Great hedges of arbor-vita and juniper formed wind-breaks to shelter the more tender plants . Geraniums and Heliotrope grew here like large shrubs , and the Century Plant and Prickly Pear were on every hand . The annual Larkspur was as luxuriant as the perennial variety , and Japanese Morning Glories of largest size and lovely color clambered to the very tops of great trees , and grew in tangles over rustic bridges and summer-houses . Nothing was formally planted in this Gibraltar garden . It seemed at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after wandering over grassy slopes and under the dense pine trees , we came suddenly upon a sunny place filled with masses of glowing color . Trellises were covered with Sweet Peas , Columbines and Daisies , and quantities of Ivy Geranium , the modest Mignonette , tall Foxgloves and Canterbury Bells , also bloomed in this garden of all seasons gathered into one . Glowing scarlet Hibiscus and starry Jessamine filled my heart with a desire to see them so growing at home . And last of all , were the Roses ? Roses of all kinds and all colors ; perfect in form and beauty , the standards especially , so laden with blossoms that each called forth expressions of wonder . Upon leaving Gibraltar we travelled to Cadiz , a city built almost entirely of marble . The tropical sun beating upon its whiteness would cause intolerable glare were it not for the palm trees of great height and beauty which flourish here and adorn all the public gardens and squares , and many of the streets . Camellias , Abutilons , and Carnations , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they , were here in great abundance . The cultivation of flowers was not so universal at Cadiz as in other Spanish cities , the people seeming to prefer palms and shrubbery of all varieties . Seville , however , was a riot of color . Nearly every house had its window-boxes , where Carnations , scarlet Geraniums , the beautiful pink Ivy Geranium , Fuchsias , and blue Hydrangeas seemed to be the favorites . At Seville , too , white marble is largely used for building both the exterior and interior of the houses . All the dwellings of any pretensions are built with a Patio , or central court , made entirely of snowy marble . There is usually a fountain in the centre , with palms and large pots of flowering plants placed around it and in the corners of the court . This court is roofed , sometimes with glass , more often with an awning . Comfortable lounging chairs make it a cool and delightful refuge in the heat of the day , and the lovely green of the palms and the splashing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon sends one to gentle slumbers and pleasant dreams . At the back of the court a door or grille of beautifully wrought iron leads to the garden , which also possesses a fountain and palm trees , and is , beside , filled with many varieties of flowers . Roses , too , climb against the garden walls , and often to the very house-top . But when one sees the Alcazar at Seville , that garden of gardens , the memory of all others grows dim , and it seems to be the only garden of the world . Some of it probably dated from earliest Moorish times ; other parts were made by Peter the Cruel , who lived there from 1350 to 1360 ; and still others by Ferdinand and Isabella , and by Charles the Fifth . Shut off from the world by the buildings of the Alcazar and by high walls , this garden has for hundreds of years survived the rise and fall of nations , and the palm trees and giant magnolias have sheltered many of the great and powerful , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walks paved with worn bricks , or sat upon the quaint benches made of Moorish tiles , my thoughts wan- dered to the Moorish sultan , Abu Yahub Vusuf , who , in 1181 , began to build the great Alcazar , and it seemed not improbable that he first began the gardens where , secluded behind high walls , the fair ones of his harem might disport themselves in freedom . To-day we see in one of the gardens a marble pool surrounded by a dense myrtle hedge over eight feet in height , called the " Sultana 's Bath , " and the legend is told , that the Sultan 's favorite wife came there daily to bathe . Passing under a beautifully carved old marble archway , we came to a small court planted with ancient orange trees . All but one are said to bear delicious fruit , and this one alone , set out by Peter the Cruel over five hundred years ago , bears oranges so sour and bitter as to be uneatable . The tree is said to have received from Peter his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of his guest , the Moorish sultan , Abu Said , in order to gain possession of his jewels . From a terrace we descended to a vaulted gallery to see the marble bath , some twenty feet long , ten broad , and four deep , where Maria de Padilla , the beautiful wife of this same Peter , used to bathe . It is said that the courtiers would gather about , and to show their gallantry and appreciation of her beauty would each drink a glass of water from the bath . Columbus was formally received in Seville upon his return from his first voyage , and we can imagine Isabella the Catholic , that great woman and queen , receiving Columbus under one of the magnolia trees , her industrious attendants seated near by , yet forgetting to draw the needle through the canvas while listening to the marvellous tales of the new Spain across . the sea . Charles the Fifth was married to Isabella of Portugal in the Alcazar . He improved and added to the gardens , building also , in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden dome , as a cool retreat in the heat of the ( lay . Philip the Second also lived here . Gloomy and morose , regretting the England he had lost , he doubtless paced the shaded alleys planning terror to the Protestant world , and new inquisitorial fires . In the gardens of the Alcazar grow such hedges of box and myrtle that one knows at a glance that generations have passed away while they have grown quietly on . The very roses that climb against the walls have trunks as large as one 's forearm . The  | rose trees and bushes also show their great age in their size . And such roses as they yield ! Dark red , pink , white . and adorable yellow ones , all of perfect form and yielding perfume delicious beyond words . The starry white Jessamine clambered up the palms and ancient cedars ; Heliotrope , like trees in size , flung its fragrant purple blossoms to the air . Great cypress trees , which had lived through hundreds of years , were trained to form arches over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oleanders with masses of pink or white blossoms and the size the mountain ash usually attains in our country , spread wide their branches . Here , too , were many of the favorites of our own gardens . Phlox Drummondii , California Poppies , Calendulas , Annual Larkspur , and Mignonette welcomed us with smiling faces . ; The garden of the Alcazar is one garden composed of several , each opening into the other by steps descending from a terrace or through arches in marble or living green . All the gardens are surrounded with wonderful hedges of myrtle , juniper , or box . If the gardens of the Alcazar should be stripped of all but their hedges , palm trees and magnolias , they would still be most @# wonderful . In some places , walls about eight feet in height separate the gardens , and against these walls are trained orange and peach trees , with a tangle of Jessamine and Roses climbing among them as they will . In fact , the flowers grow in such careless and natural profusion , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoe of a gardener had not visited the place for a hundred years . This very carelessness was one of the greatest charms of the place , and added to the effect of age that clung to everything . Modern gardeners would stand aghast at such apparent neglect . I recognized that the very lack of modern care was artistic and suitable , and yet wondered , if the place were mine , whether I could forbear the use of shears , trowel , and hoe . The hedges were trimmed . These , with some orange trees growing in a solid mass of green along some fifty feet of palace wall , and reaching to the very roof , alone bore signs of the gardener 's shears . The flower beds were of intricate shapes filled with a tangled mass of flowers , and always surrounded with box . And such box ! My heart sank within me when I thought of the box in my garden at home , where not even a hundred mild winters and a hundred rainy summers could give growth like the smallest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Seville  | as a model of beauty and elegance was to our eyes a most hideous thing . In shape like a pyramid about fourteen inches high , it was formed by fastening a magnolia bud to the top of a smooth round stick , and then winding flowers tightly around the stick , each succeeding row becoming larger , so that at the bottom the bouquet was probably two feet around . It was a frequent sight to see two men carrying a pole between them , with from six to a dozen of these bouquets swinging , heads down , from the pole . Every garden of the Alcazar has its fountain or fountains , and the pleasant murmuring of waters is ever in your ears . Some king of by-gone days who loved a practical joke upon a courtier , constructed under a brick walk a series of small pipes @# @# with tiny openings between the bricks . The unwary person who was to bear the joke was asked to take that walk , and when well in the centre , the king , by turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enveloped in hundreds of tiny jets of water , each some six feet high . Madrid was full of gardens . Vegetation here is not tropical . The winters are long and cold , and icy winds sweep down with killing blasts from the mountains north of the city . The city is situated in a nearly treeless plain , and the summers are parched and burning . Still , by means of irrigation and artificial watering , the public and private gardens are kept green and luxuriant . All the handsomer houses seemed to be surrounded with gardens , at which we would take curious peeps through either the tall iron fences surrounding them or an open gate or doorway in the protecting wall of brick . The Botanical Garden possesses a fine collection of trees and shrubs , and the large hot-house contains many specimens of tender plants . This garden is of comparatively modern date , having been founded in 1774 . I was particularly struck with the ivy , which completely covered the trunks of many trees . Throughout the gardens of Madrid bedding-out plants seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraniums , Coleus , Cannas , Gladioli , and tuberousrooted Begonias . Sunflowers , Marigolds , and Calendulas bloomed in great profusion , gratifying the Spaniards ' love for yellow . Myrtle and box hedges were everywhere. , but we saw none to compare with those at Seville . At Escorial , thirty-one miles from Madrid , are most lovely gardens . The first we saw of these was the garden of the Pahcio Real , that part of the great Escorial built first by Philip the Second as a cell in which to die , but added to by succeeding kings and converted into a palace , and decorated by them in the style of the Renaissance . These gardens were devoid of flowers , and consisted only of hedges , parterres , circles and squares and triangles of the most wonderful box I have ever seen , quite five feet in height , with paths running around and between them . From the shapes of many of these beds of box I imagine that they had originally been planted as edging for formally shaped beds , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of green . In the Monastery gardens we found many trees and plants to remind us of home . Everything was irregular , and the same careless luxuriance prevailed that we had noticed in other gardens . Great Beeches , old Horse-chestnuts , and Ailanthus shaded the alleys . The ground everywhere was carpeted with Vinca , our Periwinkle , in lieu of grass . Lilacs , Altheas , Syringa , and Deutzia were growing happily in all the sunny corners . Standard roses of many varieties bloomed in perfection . Great plants of Canterbury Bells , both purple and white , smiled at us as if they knew that we loved them . One long wall of the Monastery was entirely covered with a climbing rose , whose blossoms were large and double , and of a lovely silverypink color . At the foot of the hill from the Monastery is the Casita de Abajo , built in 1772 for the Prince Charles ; a most dainty and charming little chateau full of pretty things , and so homelike and lovable as to be quite different from the homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cypress , fifteen feet in height and four feet thick , formed a background to the entrance to the chateau grounds , and enormous ' spruce trees stood like sentinels on either side of the gate . From a terrace in front of the house we descended to a garden , not large ? perhaps two hundred by three hundred feet ? that was captivating . A pool in the centre , some twenty feet in diameter , with simply a jet of water , was surrounded by standard Roses , giant Poppies and Larkspur planted between them , and the bed edged with Pinks . Radiating from the pool were formally shaped box-edged beds of many-colored flowers . Madona Lilies were there in quantity , and superb Gladioli and Cannas ; Roses beyond number grew everywhere , and a wall eight feet high surrounding the sides of the garden was covered with them . Imagine climbing roses , pink , white , dark red and yellow , double , and as large as the Jacqueminot , or the Kaiserin Augusta . From their fra-  | grance and the quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the everblooming varieties . There being an unlimited water supply at Escorial from a mountain lake , this garden was irrigated . We were there about five o'clock in the after ? noon , and after watching the gardeners turn on the water , understood why the flowers were so wonderful . With rich soil , warm sunshine , and a thorough daily soaking to the very ends of the roots , the conditions were ideal for perfection of blooms . Behind the chateau the long windows of the lower floor open directly upon another garden of about the same size as the one in front . Here , however , there were fewer flowers , and more of the cypress and the great parterres of box that grows so luxuriantly in Spain . Everything about this gay little house and gardens was so charming that we thought it would be delightful to live there , and that now , at last , we had verily seen a " Chateau en Espagne . " Before leaving , we were told that the water from a near-by fountain was the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bottled water for weeks this was joyful intelligence . We hastened to the fountain , and never was anything more delicious than that cold , almost icy draught . Opposite the station at Escorial is a large chocolate factory , and surrounding it a beautiful garden . Here Nye saw wonder-  | ful Snap-dragons and great plants of Flos Jovis , pink and crimson , growing among the other flowers . Spruce , horse-chestnut , and locust trees made " caverns of cool shade . " It was an enticing spot , and the operatives who could spend their leisure hour resting there were fortunate indeed . We had heard at Madrid of some wonderful gardens at La Granja , a place near Segovia , but were told that there was no good hotel where we could spend the night , and that a day 's excursion would have to be made from Madrid . In the train for Escorial , a member of the party , with a talent for making out continental time-tables , discovered that nearly eight hours would be consumed on the railroad in going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive to La Granja , seven miles away , see the gardens , and return to Madrid the same day . This same clever person then said : " At Escorial you are nearly half way to Segovia ; why not go there this afternoon , put up for one night with whatever you find , and return to Madrid to-morrow after your sightseeing ? You will thus save four hours of railroad travel . " We had come out for a short day 's excursion , expecting to return to our hotel in Madrid by five in the afternoon . Now to me the dreadful slowness of the Spanish railway trains had many times proved vexatious , and to avoid four hours of them was a great consideration . At the same time the prospect of seeing one of the celebrated gardens of the world was an added attraction which could not be resisted . My vote was at once cast to continue the trip from Escorial directly to Segovia . It was an interesting journey at the end of the day from six to nine , through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild flowers . We counted over thirty varieties . The sinking sun lost its heat ; the air was fresh and cool ; lengthening shadows added to the beauty of the scene , and after the sun had set behind the mountains , leaving the sky a brilliant rose , we watched it change to daffodil and softly fade to violet , and the dusk of evening fell and night had closed upon us when we reached Segovia . The quaint town was thronged with people , whom a three days ' horse-fair , then in progress , had brought there . The inn , though somewhat primitive , was not uncomfortable . The table-d'hote dinner was at its height , probably fifty people being in the room when we entered . Instantly silence fell and every eye was fixed upon us ; many greeted us with a polite bow , and we caught a frequent whisper of " Inglese . " The dinner was excellent . I recall one dish that I shall try some day . It was composed of eggs , chicken cut in rather small pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green string beans , also cut up . It was a delicious mess for hungry travellers . Nine o'clock the next morning found us in a comfortable landau en route for those wonderful gardens of La Granja . For seven miles we drove along a perfectly straight highway bordered with stunted trees , with great fields of rye and wheat stretching out beyond on either side almost interminably . We passed many peasants going to the @# horse-fair , some driving horses or mules before them , others clad in their best , riding astride , balanced on the extreme hindquarters of the animal in a way that only a Spaniard can ride ; again , a mother and daughter , or man and wife , or two men , mounted on the same beast . All turned to gaze at us with wide-eyed wonder , as if we were curiosities . The courier said , in explanation , that few foreigners ever came to Segovia . The seven miles coming to an end , we presented our pass at a side building of the chateau , and entering by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the place and told to wander as we would . The chateau of La Granja was built by Philip V about 1719 , and has been ever since a summer residence for some of the Spanish Royal Family . High on the hills , with mountains rising behind it , and fertile plains spread out before , this mountain palace has an ideal situation . We were told that it is now the summer home of an aunt of the present king , one of the daughters of Queen Isabella . Both chateau and gardens are French in style and remind one of Versailles , although there are more fountains and cascades here ? there being twenty-six in all ? than at Versailles . It is said to be the finest garden in Europe . The gardens , fountains , and cascades were mostly made by Isabella Farnese , wife of Philip V , during the absence of the king , her husband , on a long journey , and are said to have cost over three millions . It is also said that his Majesty was not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed of his treasury during his absence . We were disappointed , however , to find that the place was , more properly speaking , a grand old park , rather than a garden . Carriage drives and bridle-paths , and shady walks in and out through groves and glades , ran everywhere in all directions , bringing one unexpectedly upon wonderful fountains or cascades tumbling down from great heights . The water supplying these fountains comes from a lake high up on the mountain , and descends with such force and volume that one fountain sends a jet of water 125 feet into  | the air , and another zio feet . These fountains , which were constructed of material supposed to be bronze or marble , represented allegorical figures , nymphs and fawns , or animals of various kinds . Everything was so artificial , so formal , so French in style , as to be thoroughly disappointing , particularly after the chateau garden at Escorial . Of flowers there were but few . Stiff parterres near the house were filled with bedding-out plants and standard Roses . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was but meagrely supplied with flowers . Fine trees and beautiful turf ( so seldom seen in Spain ) and the delicious sound of running waters were the charms of the place . At Toledo the Gothic cloisters of the Cathedral , dating from the fourteenth century , enclose a lovely garden where Carnations and Heliotrope seemed to be growing wild . Here a vine-covered shelter in the centre replaced the usual fountain or well . There were two gardeners pretending to work , but the place showed little signs of care . The Court of Oranges at Cordova , sur- rounded on three sides by a colonnade and on the fourth by the walls of the Cathedral , with its ancient orange trees , feathery palms , and five fountains , was another garden spot under the shadow of a sacred building , and with the Cathedral itself is also the work of the Moors , to whom Spain owes so much that is beautiful . At Granada , in the Carthusian Convent , we again saw one of these cloister gardens . The lay brother who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few flowers and offered them to the young woman of the party , who gave effusive thanks and tucked them into her belt . We never visited a garden in Spain without receiving a handful of flowers , often as many as we could convenientlv carry . It seemed as if the kindly gardeners , appreciating our admiration for their flowers , wanted us to have a share in them : One cynical person ventured the remark that they were given with an eye to the probable tip . But I am certain it was not so , for the roses and other flowers they gave us were in every case of the handsomest in the garden , which would not have been done merely for a tip ; if mercenary , they would never have given their best . Granada , that most interesting city of Spain , watched over by the snow-crowned Sierra Nevada , is full of gardens . Wandering through the maze of the Alhambra , one comes unexpectedly upon them at almost every turn . Always quite small , and generally surrounded by clipped hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other flowers . Often great cypresses , old as the historic ruins , cast their dark shadows over the bright gardens . I remember one garden in the Alhambra , about thirty by forty feet , with one of these great trees in each corner , while in the centre a fountain splashed , and around the fountain Phlox and Poppies flung their brilliant petals . Another , known as the garden of the Little Mosque , is a most adorable little place , with old stone lions at the entrance .  | Within is a blaze of flowers , with a rustic pergola covered with grape-vines , and an arbor formed of six cypress trees planted in a circle , their tops bent over so as to meet , making an inviting resting place . Box hedges , evidently edges in the beginning , but now nearly four feet high , have grown so thick that the walks between have become narrowed to mere foot-paths . While the care-takers of this garden and of the tiny Mosque , and the villa which it surrounded , a withered old Spaniard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flowers we had almost come to expect as a matter of course , we stood by the kitchen door and , peering into the dim room , gazed with longing eyes at the beautiful old brass and copper utensils and fine faience plates , some hanging up , some on shelves , and would have been glad to transport the entire room , including the floor , paved with Moorish tiles , to distant New York . Up a flight of steps covered by a dense grape-arbor , through which the sunlight only peeped in places , we came upon one of the most beautiful of the Alhambra gardens . It was somewhat long and narrow , like a terrace . At one side was a great wall of the Alhambra draped with ivy and climbing roses , and on the other a low parapet , which formed the only protection from a precipice hundreds of feet in height , over which we looked down at the city of Granada and across the great plains to the purple mountains capped with snow . Near the entrance was a small pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trimmed hedge of box about three feet high , and at intervals along the Alhambra walls from the open mouths of grotesque faces carved in marble , clear water gushed forth into basins . In the centre of the garden was a marble table with carved seats , tempting one to sit and gaze at the great panorama spread out like a painted scene , or with the murmur of falling waters in one 's ears , to read a tale of Irving 's " Alhambra , " and dream of the great race of Moors who built the wonderful place . Then there are the gardens of the Palace of the Generalife , high on the hill above the Alhambra , where the Moorish kings came to spend the summer months . The approach to this beautiful place is by an alley bordered with cypress trees of great size , that , with the afternoon sun casting dark shadows across it , is like a walk through a fairy story . The garden itself is the only one I saw in Spain resembling an Italian garden , being built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another . One of these Moorish flights of steps has runlets for water on the top of the balustrades . Water is everywhere ? in fountains , in pools , and rushing down the sides of walks . Robbed of her gushing waters , Granada would lose half her charm . To the industrious Moors who constructed the reservoirs and many of the fountains , she owes this great source of her beauty . In the Generalife garden were the largest rose trees and climbing roses I have ever seen . Here also were more of the fine cypress trees , all of them from four to five hundred years old , one said to be over six hundred . We found a charming public garden or Alameda at Ronda , an old and picturesque city of Southern Spain . One end of this garden reached the edge of a great cliff , where we looked over the high wall protecting it , down into the gorge , 550 feet below , where the river Guadalevin , tossing its spray high into the air , tore its way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hill-sides covered with olive orchards , while above these towered the mountains encircling the valley as an amphitheatre . The garden was surrounded by a close hedge five feet high , of double pink roses . It was a lovely sight . Here were catalpas covered with their orchid-like blossoms ; Iocusts trimmed like bay trees ; beech and horse-chestnuts shading the pleasant alleys . The entire front of the keeper 's or gardener 's house at one side of the garden was covered with pink Ivy Geranium , which was a mass of blossoms . The flower garden surrounded this house , and here we saw a flower unknown to us : something like a Foxglove , three feet high , with perhaps twenty spikes of bloom to each plant , the flowers a beautiful shaded pink . We saw the same plant in the public gardens at Venice marked " Penstemon Gentianoides . " Our quest for gardens ended at Ronda . We found the gardens in Spain much alike , in that ( except those of La Granja and the Generaliffe ) their beauty was derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was an entire absence of the architectural features upon which the Italian gardens so largely depend . We saw scarcely one well-kept garden in Spain . Weeds and flowers grew together , the paths were never very neat ; hedges alone were carefully clipped , and yet the perfection of the flowers and the wonderful hedges of box , laurel , and myrtle , the ancient cypress and magnolia trees , and the fountains and pools in a land so dry and treeless , made these gardens of Spain beautiful beyond words .
