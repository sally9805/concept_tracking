THAT Washington was not wholly possessed of such excessive virtue of truthfulness is proved in a letter to Governor Clinton . ( August 16 , 1777 ) , wherein we find refutation of that tradition of superhuman honesty which the cherry-tree legend has served to foster . The italicized lines in the following excerpt prove that for the sake of his country Washington could tell , or at least countenance , a lie . Ticonderoga had in the previous month fallen before General Burgoyne , who then made his advance , confident that the loyalists would flock to his victorious banner . In this he was disappointed , and by the middle of August he and his Indian allies were threatened on all sides . The day before the date of this letter his German mercenaries were defeated at the battle of Bennington . Washington had not yet heard the good tidings when he wrote . This letter , overlooked by most historians , though not entirely unknown , contains the following paragraph : " In addition to the two regiments , which are gone from Peekskill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern army , Colonel Morgan 's corps of riflemen , amounting to about five hundred . These are all chosen men , selected from the army at large , well acquainted with the use of rifles , and with that mode of fighting which is necessary to make them a good counterpoise to the Indians ; and they have distinguished themselves on a variety of occasions , since the formation of the corps , in skirmishes with the enemy . I expect the most eminent services from them ; and I shall he mistaken if their presence does not go far towards producing a general desertion among the savages . I should think it would be well , even before their arrival , to begin , to circulate these ideas , with proper embellishments , throughout the country and in the army , - and to take pains to communicate them to the enemy . II would not be amiss , among other things , to magnify their numbers . " A little over half a century has elapsed since the Legislature of the State of New York purchased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , from these papers were the letters of George Washington , end it is now that nearly all of these , after a hidden existence of five decades , rest , together with numerous letters of Washington to General James Clinton , in dignified succession before the writer 's gaze . A portion of a chanter in the never-ending volume dedicated to human liberty , these mute letters evoke memories of fateful days , and depict upon the canvas of the mind the shifting scenes of New York during the Revolution . Here is another letter , never before published , in which Washington sought Governor Clinton 's advice touching the possible capture of the British forces who had taken refuge in New York city after the disgraceful action of General Lee at the battle of Monmouth ( partially retrieved by Washington 's swift brilliancy ) had made possible the retreat of the British from New Jersey . This letter , written on July 11 , 1778 , is one of those interesting missives whose absence from the Clinton Papers the editor specially regretted . The postscript , quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French fleet , gave the first information to the Governor of New York of news that sent a thrill of new hope to the American people . The letter of Henry Laurens , President of Congress ( dated the next day , July 12 ) , to Governor Clinton , confirming the news , is printed in the Clinton Papers ; but Washington 's letter , here given in part and never before published , is missing : " DEAR Sire ? The first division of the Army moved from hence this morning , about four miles , to give room to the second . They will reach Kokiate tomorrow evening , and the North River the next day . I shall halt the remainder hereabouts a few days , to refresh the men . I am yet undetermined as to the expediency of throwing the Army immediately over the North River . I will state my reasons for hesitating , and shall beg to hear your sentiments upon the matter . " Upon conversing with the Q. M. and Commissary-General and Commissary of Forage , upon the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more easily subsisted upon the West than upon the East side of the River . The country on this side is more plentiful in regard to forage : and flour , which is the article for which we shall be most likely to be distressed , coming from the Southward , will have a shorter transportation , and consequently the supply more easily kept up . We arc beside in a country devoted to the Enemy , and gleaning it , takes so much from them . Was this the only point to be determined , there would not remain a moment 's doubt ; but the principal matter to be considered is ( upon a supposition that the enemy mean to operate up the North River ) whether the Army , being all or part upon this side the river , can afford a sufficient and timely support to the posts , should they put such a design in execution . " Upon this point then , Sir , I request your full and candid opinion . You are well acquainted with the condition of the posts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when sufficiently manned , which ought in my opinion to be immediately done . After that , you will please take into consideration whether any , and what advantages may be derived from the Army 's being upon the East side of the River , and if there , what position would be most eligible . The neighborhood of the White Plains after leaving sufficient garrisons in our rear , strikes me at present . We have the strength of the ground . and we cover a considerable extent of Country , and draw forage which would otherwise fall into the hands of the Enemy . . . . " We have this day a rumor that a French Fleet has been seen off the Coast , and that the English is preparing to sail from New York in pursuit of them . But it is but a rumor . " P.S. ? I have just rcc 'd a letter from General Arnold at Philad'a. in which is the following . ' An express is arrived to Congress from France by the way of Boston with intelligence that on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 72 sail of the line , 7 frigates and " 4xbecks " ? which we may hourly expect to arrive in this or Claespeak Bay. ? Admiral Keppel sailed the 24th April from St. Helens with 11 sail of the line . ' " The above fully corroborates the account from New York , but I do not know that it ought to be made public yet , I mean as to numbers . " This letter , as lies been said , was written shortly after the battle of Monmouth . With it there lies before me the very map which Washington used throughout his campaigns in the Jerseys in 1777 and 1778 . This map , a section of which is here exactly reproduced for the first time , including a portion of New York as well as of the neighboring State , was not alone specially drawn for the commander-in-chief from surveys made by Lord Stirling , but contains numerous notes in Washington 's autograph . That portion bounded on the north by the Shawangualt Mountains , on the west by the Delaware River , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many names in the handwriting of George Washington . ( Fig. 1 . ) On July 31 , 1778 , from his headquarters at White Plains , Washington sent the following communication of instructions to General James Clinton , who was operating around New- York city . It is noteworthy not alone as one of those epistles in which Washington laid down general laws of the science of war regarding reconnoitring and manoeuvring , but also because the entire letter , excepting of course Washington 's own signature , is in the autograph of Alexander Hamilton , who was then aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief . It is published here for the first time : " Sue , ? With the detachment under your command , which is to comprehend the Corps now advanced with Coll Morgrin , you ore to move towards Kings Bridge and the Enemy 's lines there-shouts , - " The principal objects in view are , to cover the Engineers and Surveyors , while they reconnoiter and as far as time will permit , survey the ground &; roads in your rear , and in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion which seems so prevalent at present ? to discover , if possible , those unfriendly and ill disposed inhabitants who make a practice of apprehending , and conveying within the Enemy 's line such deserters from their Army as happen to fall into their hands and with such witnesses as arc necessary to elucidate the facts send them to the Head Quarters of this Army ? and lastly to try what effect the detachments approach may have upon the Enemy . " I do not mean , or wish , that you should encamp very near the Enemy of nights , but whenever you do Incamp , that you do it in proper order of battle , so that your offieers and men may rise at once upon the ground they are to defend . Your flanks and front sufficiently advanced upon every possible approach ; always remembering how disgraceful a thing it is for an officer to he surprised , and believing , that if the enemy are in force at the Bridge , they will certainly attempt it . " When I speak of your flanks , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy can with facility move with both secrecy &; dispatch by water , if they are provided with boats at , or near the Bridge , or even at the City , so as to be upon your right flank &; even rear , without much difficulty , or notice . " Have your Evening 's position well reconnoitred before hand , and unless there are good reasons to the contrary , I would advise against kindling fires at night , as the weather is warm , &; your position would he discovered , &; advantages taken from the knowledge of it . " The conclusion of this letter may be read in facsimile on a succeeding page . ( See Fig. 2 . ) The following letters of Washington to James Clinton form an entirely unpublished series having to do with the Sullivan-Clinton campaign against the Indians . From the letter of December 21 , 1773 , with special instructions regarding General Schuyler , the gallant New York soldier whose trial before Congress was mainly due to the petty jealousy of General Gates , Washington 's compassionate nature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital executions with concern " : " As the impediments which suspended General Schuyler from command are now removed by an honorable acquittal I have written hint a line upon the subject of his resuming it , in the Department where he now is for the present . If this event takes place , you will till some new arrangement or disposition is made consider yourself under his directions and receive orders from him accordingly ... . " I always hear of capital executions with concern , and regret that there should occur so many instances in which they are necessary. ? Aaron Williams appears to have deserved the fate he met with ? and the service , from the number of desertions you mention in the York line , to have pointed to his early punishment . " The succeeding letter sent by Washington a fortnight later to Governor Clinton was missing from the manuscripts purchased by the State of New York , but the enclosure which was sent with it and referred to in this letter was preserved and is printed in the Clinton volumes . " Dn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works at West Point , I removed my quarters to this place on Monday last . I have only to add upon this subject that I shall be happy to see your Excellency here , as often as your leisure will permit . " There has been no official account received from Charles Town as yet that T know of ; but I have no doubt but that here has been an action there , and that the ? issue has been in our favour . The inclosed is a copy of a letter I just received from General Greene , in which the affair is so particularly related that it is hardly possible it can be destitute of foundation . T trust we shall have in a few days the fullest confirmation . " The next is a rare avis ? a six-page entirely unpublished war letter from Washington to Governor Clinton . This lengthy missive from West Point was written during one of the most depressing periods of what John Fiske calls " a year of disasters . " Washington 's appeal to New York State for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Count d'Estaing , with the French fleet , was off the coast of Georgia preparing to combine with General Lincoln in the attempt to recapture Savannah . The attempt failed disastrously ( October 9 ) , and Washington had to give up his idea of attacking New York with the aid of D'Estaing . Washington 's communication to Governor Clinton of his plan to attack New York ( occupied by Sir Henry Clinton ) is interesting in connection with the special regret expressed by the editor of the Clinton Papers concerning " the absence of one or two letters in which it seems he ( Washington ) must have stated some grand movement against the enemy , but which is not disclosed in George Clinton 's answers assuring him of hearty and strong cooperation . " Clinton 's reply to this very letter is in the Clinton volumes , but this letter is missing . " Sire ? I have the honor to enclose your Excellency the Copy of a resolution of Congress of the 26th of September , by which you will perceive they expect the arrival of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue measures for cooperating with him , and to call upon the several States for such aid as shall appear to me necessary for this important purpose . In compliance with these directions , have made an estimate of the force of Militia which will be indispensable , in conjunction with the Continental Troops and have apportioned this force to the neighboring States according to the best judgment I am able to form of their respective circumstances and abilities . " The number I have to request of the State of New York is two thousand five hundred . In forming this estimate , I assure your Excellency I have fixed upon the smallest number which appeared to me adequate to the exigency , on account of the scantiness of our supplies , and VOL. extv ? -N .. 080. - 35I think it my duty explicitly to declare that the cooperation will altogether depend on a full compliance with these requisitions . " If I am so happy as to attain the whole number demanded a decisive stroke may be attempted against New York with a reasonable prospect of success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure in the undertaking . In this case , Congress and my Country must excuse a want of enterprise and success of which the want of means will have been the unfortunate cause . If the honor and interest of the States suffer from thence , the blame must not be imputed to me . " These difficulties were sufficient to deter me from the plan I mean to pursue , were I not convinced that the magnitude of the object will call forth all the vigor of the States and inspire the people with a disposition to second the plans of the Governors , and give efficacy to the measures they adopt . I doubt not our resources will be found fully adequate to the undertaking if they are properly exerted ? and when I consider the delicacy of the Crisis ? and the importance of the object to be attained ? I can not doubt . that this will be the case . On one side ? the reputation of our Councils &; our Arms and an immediate removal of the War present themselves , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credit with our allies and the world loss of confidence in ourselves ? the exhausting our magazines and resources ? the precipitated decay of our Currency and the continuance of the War . Nor will these evils be confined to ourselves : our allies must share in them , and suffer the mortification of having accomplished nothing to compensate for withdrawing their operations from a quarter where they had a. right to expect success and for exposing their own possessions to hazard in a fruitless attempt to rescue ours . " From the accounts received we are hourly to look for the appearance of the French Squadron on this Coast ? the emergency is pressing ? and all our measures ought to be attended with suitable expedition . Every moment is of infinite value . " etc.
