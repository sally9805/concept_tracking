txt It is curious that railway reform and insurance reform should have produced such opposite results regarding discrimination . About the most obnoxious evil of railway administration , and the one most thoroughly cured , was that of discrimination , or favoritism . But the insurance reform in New York State enacted discrimination , and the Supreme Court confirms the enactment of discrimination as between industrial and life insurance companies .. We remarked the other day upon the effect of the law limiting life companies to an increase of-$150,000,000 , or not enough to make good losses from natural causes . Industrial companies are exempt from this limitation , because they have not succeeded in reaching the proportions named , and the court confirms the discrimination . Yet a conspicuous company , which certainly was not exempt from the disclosures affecting life companies , made a growth for the last reported year of $376,171 , - 576 . If we are not mistaken , that is the largest ? increase . for any company in any year , surpassing the figures which were the motive of the enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life companies were told what amount of money they could expend In soliciting new business , and were then limited . in the amount of businest they could acquire with the amount they were allowed to expend . The resclt.was that  --  a growth of insut ; - ance by $0g.,433,4384 was converted into a loss of ? bneiness which is now diminishing , but ** for  --  the last reported year was $107,194,515 . For-the venue year companies outside the State made a gain of $230,271,184 ; York ' policy seekers are diverted into companies which are inferior to New York companies at their worst , and whose comparison with the purged companies of this State is humiliating to them . The increase in these mushroom if not wildcat companies since the enactment of this legislation is larger than their total before the legislation . Their birth is as much an effect of the New York legislation as is the crippling of . the New York companies . In 1905 , the disclosures having had full effect , new insurance issued in New York ex-exceeded foreign companies ' issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York companies ' by $113,000,000 . It has been announced that one New York company has discharged 1,000 agents because they were too efficient . They were producing more business than the company could accept , under the limitation which the court has sustained . The loss of their employment signifies the loss of the opportunity by their " prospects " to take the sort of insurance which they prefer , and which is preferable to much of the insurance which will be taken instead . If there is any precedent for such a condition of affairs , it is not known to us . Admittedly the motive of the law was good , but good motives do not make good laws . A bad law is bad , even if passed with the motives of angels . The law is upon its defense . The motives of the gentlemen who enacted it are irreproachable , but what shall be said of their foresight and capacity to adjust r , ? , Inedies to diseases ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
