txt The followers of William Randolph Hearst to-day were completely snowed under by the conservative Democrats who ran the State Convention . ' These selected a delegation which will be favorable to the candidacy of Judge Alton B. Parker of New York .. Though this delegation was not instructed , the conservative forces succeeded in putting through a resolution adopting the unit rule . They have the majority of delegates , so , , that this delegation may PF0Perly be called a complete Parker one . Moreover , a resolution binding the delegation to vote under the unit rule at St .. Louis was adopted without opposition . Some of the leaders were not pleased at an uninstructed delegation , and when the convention adjourned there was pending ' two resolutions , one to Instruct for Grover Cleveland and the other for Parker . The majority favoring adherence to the unit rule forced adjournment before any action could be taken on either the Cleveland or Parker resolution . The convention chose the following delegates-at-large : ex-United States Senator James Smith , Jr .. Robert Davis of Hudson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Camden . About 100 Hearst followers , when they saw their men beaten , left the regular convention , went to Masonic Mall , and , organizing a convention , with Col. J. R. Buchanan presiding , declared they had been robbed , and elected as a contesting delegation at large Mayor Joseph E. Nowry of Camden , Edward Livingston Price of Essex , J. R. Buchanan of Essex , and J. Clark Andrews of Sussex . These four men say they will contest for seats at the St. Louis Convention . The Hearst bolters also adopted a resolution protesting " against the unjust , unDemocratic , and outrageous action of the convention , representing trusts , railroads , and corporate interests that rammed and jammed through the regular Democratic Convention a set of delegates who are , and have been , actuated for the interest opposed to the party of Jefferson , and have been in the past , and are now , acting as agents of the Republican Party .

" We charge , however , that the President of the United States , in his conduct relating to the Panama Canal , has been unmindful of the duties of this great office .

" The doctrine advocates the election of United States Senators directly by the people , and declares for a revision of the lax laws . Corporations should pay taxes at the same rate as individuals . William B. Gourley , Chairman of the State Committee , said after the convention : " The sentiment of the State at the present is undoubtedly for Parker , and New Jersey 's vote will be cast for him , unless it should later be deemed in the best interest of the party to support some other conservative Democrat .
