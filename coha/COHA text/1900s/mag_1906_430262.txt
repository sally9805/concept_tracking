 | THE apparent disposition of the American press and people to regard the making of peace between Russia and Japan as having considerably advanced the Far Eastern question toward a satisfactory settlement must have impressed even the casual observer . This is the tone of a great majority of the serious journals , while that numerous class of publications whose practice is promptly to drop all subjects the moment they cease to be the sensation of the hour has usually , in committing the war and its issues to the dust-heap , adopted a tone of finality in speaking of its results . One needs , then , a strong conviction and a fairly well fortified opinion to advance the suggestion that , far from settling the Far Eastern question , the peace leaves it in almost as unsettled a state as before hostilities began . This should not be construed as meaning that nothing has been accomplished by the war . Much has been accomplished . A new and potent element has been injected into the situation ; an element by many long deemed visionary in prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orient . All the old elements , with all the old cross-purposes and hostilities , still remain , and are now confronted with the problem of assimilating or being assimilated by this new force . The settlement is still a matter for the future . It is clear that the practical details of the settlement that is to come must be worked out mainly in the future of the Chinese Empire and , incidentally , of Korea ; and there are indications that the existing situation in these countries is not fully understood in America . Korea has not consented to be transferred to Japan ; on the contrary , she objects as strenuously as she dares . Besides Russia , none of the great powers that are interested , politically and commercially , in the future of Korea have recognized Japan 's preponderating influence except England . In the new agreement between the English and @# @# @# Japanese governments there is a clause in which England recognizes that Japan has paramount interests in Korea , and engages to not interfere with any measures Japan may undertake there so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal commercial opportunity for all nations . Theoretically , the status of Korea remains unchanged . Instead of Russia being in Manchuria , both Russia and Japan are there . Both have agreed to evacuate , it is true , but then Russia has always agreed to evacuate . Taking the situation as it is to-day , there is not the slightest alteration of the political status of Manchuria as a result of the war , and the general interests there remain the same as they were before . Manchuria is to be given back to China " as soon as is practicable " ; but the same has been said ever since Russia took advantage of the " boxer " trouble to occupy the country . If diplomatic assurances could have settled these important issues , they would have been settled before the war began , for the terms of the treaty might have been copied , in so far as they apply to Russia , from past official announcements of her intention . Is it not clear that , while great changes have taken place , nothing vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war have been a decided shifting of the balance of power in the Far East and the establishment of Japanese military authority in Korea and the substitution of it for Russian authority in the southern part of Manchuria . The various policies of the various powers , generally suspended or only surreptitiously urged during the progress of the war , are now seeking to adjust themselves to the altered situation , with the object , as always , of devising ways and means to gain their several ends . Thus the future is full of uncertainty , for desires differ , and in the counterpressure of complex and opposing forces there is almost infinite opportunity for international friction . The Far Eastern question , in its present political shape , dates from the war between @#  | China and Japan . That war demonstrated two things : China was helpless , Japan ambitious . At that time England 's position in that part of the world was decidedly superior to that of any other Western power , and there existed little if any doubt in the minds of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position against any competition lacking the assistance of special political pressure . It is probable that British statesmen regarded Japan 's decisive victory over China with mixed emotions . They certainly must have been surprised , in common with the rest of the world ; but they do not seem to have been at all sure as to the immediate or probable effects . England refused to join with Russia , Germany , and France in shooing Japan off the continent . Scrutinizing her attitude at this time , its astuteness is obvious . By refusing to take sides she was in a position to retain the friendship of both China and Japan ; and , besides , her refusal did not affect matters one way or the other . But significant events followed fast . It soon became clear that , in invoking a concert to suppress Japan in the interest of Western civilization , Russia had in mind to herself reap the material benefits of the transaction . Before Russia secured Port Arthur England cared little for a coaling station in north China . But now she at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then came Germany 's rapacious seizure of Liao-chou Bay . England was not exactly alarmed , but she realized that these moves meant new forces in the Far East , which might limit her progress or even threaten her existing advantage . So British statesmen set to work to devise a policy that might be used to safeguard her interests . Presently this policy made its bow to the world in the shape of the " open door " doctrine . Later came England 's war in South Africa , and it seemed for a time that her Far Eastern policy would expire of inanition and uncertainty . She was not in a position to adopt an aggressive attitude , and it was clear that the forces working for dismemberment were getting the upper hand . England still leaned toward the " open door , " but if it came to a general split-up she was exceedingly well provided for , with the best part of China as her recognized " sphere of influence " and with a strong power like Germany as a buffer between her Far Eastern frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water on both shoulders and contend for the " open door " while at the same time looking out for her interests if , perchance , the " sphere of influence " doctrine should gain ascendency . The " boxer " trouble , which came at this time , created a diversion . There was a great rush among the powers to send troops to China . Except the United States and Italy , they all sent many more soldiers than were needed to suppress the disorder , and many of them are still there . The events of the " boxer " war need not be reviewed . It had one significant demonstration . This was the readiness and military efficiency of Japan . England was quick to observe and act . Events were moving rapidly ? events which she alone was powerless to check . So came about the first alliance between Great Britain and Japan . The " sphere of influence " doctrine temporarily dropped out of sight , and the " open door " was again hoisted to the peak . Then came the war , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now comes the new alliance with Japan . If the war failed , in the making of peace between Russia and Japan , to result in any decisive advance toward a solution of the Far Eastern question , it at least produced in this new alliance something which will have a tremendous effect upon the settlement . The general intention and scope of the instrument is declared in the preamble , which follows : " A ? The consolidation and maintenance of general peace in the regions of eastern Asia and India . " B The preservation of the common interests of all the powers in China by insuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese Empire and the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations in China . " C ? The maintenance of the territorial rights of the high contracting parties in the regions of eastern Asia and of India and the defence of their special interests in the said regions . " Let us strip this preamble down a little to get at what it really means . The first clause is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second clause is an intelligible declaration for the open door , but  | its meaning would have been clearer had the characteristic bit of diplomatic humbug been omitted . Instead of its object being " the preservation of the common interests of all the powers in China , " it is , of course , the preservation in China and the far and middle East of the interests of Great Britain and Japan . The phrasing almost amounts to an impertinence , since none of the other powers have asked England and Japan to take care of their interests in that part of the world , and none of them would be at all disposed to admit greater competence on the part of these two powers to look after other national interests than is possessed by the other nations themselves . The third clause appears to be intentionally ambiguous . Its declared object is the maintenance of the " territorial rights " of Great Britain and Japan " in the regions of eastern Asia and of India and the defence of their special interests in said regions . " The ambiguity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are to be defended lie . If Japan had any territorial rights in eastern Asia or India at the time this alliance was signed it is not generally known . However , the third clause is the kernel of the nut , and probably holds all of sincerity and real purpose that the whole preamble contains . There is no humbug in this clause . It declares its object flatly to be purely selfish , and has , therefore , a ring of genuineness . It will endeavor to maintain the territorial rights of not all the nations interested , but of Great Britain and Japan . It will defend in the regions affected not the " common interests of all the powers , " but the " special interests " of the contracting parties . Here is something the mind can lay hold of ; and it only remains to determine what are the territorial rights and special interests of England and Japan in those regions to get fairly at the real intent of the treaty , and how it may affect the interests of other nations . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of its scope . While , in the wording of all the articles , there is an evident attempt to give an impression that the alliance is conceived in a defensive spirit , this impression vanishes upon close scrutiny . On the whole , it stands revealed as an offensive and defensive alliance , in the broadest meaning of these terms . This intent has been cloaked as far as phraseology could accomplish it . Article II provides that should either power be involved in war " in defence of its territorial rights or special interests " the other shall at once come to the assistance of its ally and wage war in common with it . It will be noticed that the word " defence " is used , but " special interests " may be made to stretch a long way . Undoubtedly the most significant thing about the new alliance is the recognition on the part of England of Japan 's paramountcy in Korea . This is a distinct advance over the former treaty , and is the price England pays for Japan 's promised assistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition and directly affects the interests in Korea of other nations . While Japan has completely usurped political authority in Korea , and fully intends to retain it , the kingdom is still presumptively independent . Other nations , particularly America , have large commercial and industrial interests there . It may be that some or all of these nations will prefer that Korea remain independent , fearing that under Japanese control their interests will suffer . Yet the kingdom has been coolly disposed of without a pretence of consulting their wishes . England has formally recognized the right of Japan to do practically as she pleases in Korea , and under the terms of the alliance will be bound to come to Japan 's assistance should any other nation dispute Japan 's ascendency . There is no denying that , in so far as it affects Korea , the alliance hands it over to Japan and binds England to assist Japan in holding it . This looks very much like forcibly depriving other nations of their rights there , and that their interests may be small or problematical does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this new treaty was signed August 12 , 1905 , or before the war between Russia and Japan was ended . The fact that this clause binds Japan to undertake no measures in Korea contrary to the " open door " principle is designed to deprive it of its sting , but it will be poor consolation to the other powers , with Japan 's authority absolute , should they find their interests suffering . Let us examine England 's situation in respect to Korea . At one period of the country 's history British trade was paramount  | in Korea , but within the last decade this condition has changed , until now she is rapidly losing ground . The greater part of British goods sold in Korea to-day first go to Japan , and are carried into Korea through the channels of Japanese commerce . So England , finding herself in a position to profit by Japanese friendship , and realizing that in direct competition with America and Germany she is steadily falling behind , has a good business reason for looking favorably upon a Japanese occupation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same degree , to other nations . But even if turning Korea over to Japan should adversely affect British commerce there , England would still have an excellent reason for making the concession , and this lies in the added security given to her Indian frontier and other interests by the alliance . Something had to be done to make the alliance reciprocal , and British statesmen probably thought they could well afford to take chances in Korea under Japanese control to secure a positive gain elsewhere . That in making this deal the interests of other nations , in so far as they could be affected , might suffer by the change , could not have been expected to deter them . How the other powers will feel about this remains to be seen . The prominence given in the preamble of the new alliance to a declaration in favor of the " open door " in China has led many commentators to regard this doctrine as the fundamental principle upon which the alliance rests . This view is not without plausibility , but it is weakened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safeguarding of the " common interests of all the powers , " which implies the right to determine what those common interests are . It is profitless to twist phrases in an attempt to show that this is not the intention of this clause . Since any infringement of the interests of either England or Japan will call both nations to arms , the clause can work out in no other practical way ; for I suppose no one thinks that England and Japan will permit other powers to decide when their , or to adopt the wording of the second clause , the " common interests " are threatened or violated . Under any such construction the alliance would have no utility to the contracting powers . The essence of the sec- ond clause of the preamble is that any other nation which may dissent from what England and Japan regard as best for the " common interests " in China will either have to submit to their decision or fight both of them combined . And however " defensive " it may be in theory , such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to working out the details as tested by the course of events . It seems clear , then , that the intent of the alliance is that England and Japan shall have the power , if not the right , to construe the " open door " doctrine in the light of their own needs and advantage . To say this is not necessarily to attack the good faith or intentions of these two powers . They certainly have the right to make a treaty for such a purpose if they see fit , just as some of the other powers might make an alliance to counteract its influence . One of the questions which may be seen looming up is whether it will provoke such an opposing alliance . This depends , naturally , upon what construction the two powers eventually place on the term " common interests " ; and the antecedents for that construction lie in a determination of their own special interests . I have already indicated the reasons underlying England 's action in originally promulgating the " open door " doctrine . But her position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies the first position commercially and industrially , but her Western competitors are gaining upon her so rapidly that already she sees her supremacy threatened . The former confidence that , with equal opportunity , British interests can more than hold their own has vanished . How this may affect England 's attitude toward the " open door " is evident . It is conceivable that in time the " open door " may be positively disadvantageous to British interests in China . In fact , this presumption is not without probability . There are at present practical difficulties in the way of a complete abandonment of the " open door " by England other than the obligation entailed by diplomatic assurances ; but anyone who has studied the course of her advancement in the Orient can scarcely doubt that should it become a thorn in her side a means to evade it will be found . British policy is for British interests first , last , and all the time ,  | which is true of most national policies nowadays . To have dropped the " open door " doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time giving her ally a free hand in Korea at the possible expense of other Western nations , would have been a diplomatic faux pas of the first magnitude , and might have been disastrous to the successful launching of the treaty , by provoking action designed to thwart it . And I have no doubt that the " open door " will be insistently talked about should a disposition to criticize the alliance grow in America . What I wish to point out is that it is by no means certain , or even probable , that the special interests of England in China will for long be best served by strict adherence to this policy . And even if England should desire to adhere to a modified " open door " doctrine , as a means of preventing the formation of a formidable opposition to the alliance , it is clear that her wishes must conform in a measure to those of her ally . So , in reason , the special interests mentioned in the third clause of the preamble to the treaty must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brings us to a consideration of the special interests in China and Korea of Japan . In behalf of Japan the alliance engages to defend her territorial rights and special interests in eastern Asia . Taking first the matter of territorial rights , let us see what these rights are . The fact that such rights are mentioned specifically in the treaty establishes their existence at least in the minds of the contracting parties , who mutually bind themselves to fight , if necessary , to preserve them . This treaty was signed , it appears , on August 12 , 1905 ; so it can not possibly be presumed to refer to anything which may have occurred since that date . What , then , were the territorial rights of japan in eastern Asia on August 12th last ? Port Arthur and the Kwangtung peninsula could not well have been meant , although then occupied by Japanese troops . But the war was still going on , and such an act on the part of England would have been directly hostile to Russia , since it bound her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Russia has agreed by the peace terms to transfer to Japan her limited leasehold of this peninsula , China has not yet agreed to the transfer , and while there is small prob-@# ability of her wishes being considered , it is reasonably certain that she will resist it as well as she is able . Yet in attempting to get at the meaning , in so far as it refers to Japan , of this clause we are driven to assume that it must allude to territories on the continent then occupied by Japanese troops ; for on the day the alliance was signed Japan did not possess on the continent of Asia , either by sovereignty or leasehold , a foot of territory . Then , to thus give it its obvious meaning , since otherwise it has no intelligible meaning at all , the territorial rights in Asia of Japan referred to in the treaty must have been Korea and that part of Manchuria then held by the Japanese armies . Turning to the special interests in eastern Asia of Japan , it seems better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim territorial rights , since it is clear that such rights , if recognized , will place her on a better footing than other nations . It is true that she is engaged by oftiterated declarations , the latest being embodied in the peace treaty with Russia , to evacuate Manchuria and restore the administration of that region to China . But the same assurances were given about the independence and integrity of Korea , and have now been almost openly thrown aside . I do not suppose there is a single person who has kept touch with recent events in the hermit kingdom who expects Japan to ever voluntarily relinquish her present absolute control of Korea , and if one such exists he should come to the fore , to add to the gayety of nations . And , in the abstract , I consider Japan 's diplomatic utterances concerning her intended course in Manchuria to be worth just as much as her declarations regarding Korea have already proved to be , although circumstances may compel a different course in the two territories . However , it is well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in Manchuria . Article III of the peace treaty follows : " First ? To evacuate completely and simultaneously Manchuria , except the territory affected by the lease of the Liao-tung peninsula , in accordance with the provisions of additional article one annexed to this treaty , and " Second ? To restore entirely and completely to the exclusive administration of China all the portions of Manchuria now in  | occupation or under the control of Russian or Japanese troops , with the exception of the territory above mentioned . " Russia further declares that she will not in the future claim in Manchuria any territorial advantages or preferential or exclusive concessions , but Japan makes no such declaration , which is significant in view of the fact that it was considered wise to put Russia on record . Why , in a mutual agreement as to the future of Manchuria , did Russia alone renounce exclusive rights and privileges ? The supplementary article referred to deals with the details of the military evacuation and future policing of the property interests of each . Eighteen months is fixed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their military forces , except railway guards to the number of fifteen per kilometer of line . It is stipulated that the removal of troops should begin as soon as the treaty was ratified . Plain as these clauses seem to be in assuring , should they be carried out in good faith , the restoration of Manchuria to China , some loopholes for equivocation may be noticed by one familiar with conditions in the country . In describing the territory covered by the Russian leasehold the term " Liao-tung peninsula " is used , instead of " Kwang-tung peninsula , " which correctly describes the locality affected . I pointed out the significance of this substitution in a previous article . But the chief reason for uneasiness rests in the limit placed upon the final consummation of the military evacuation , and the declaration of an intention on the part of both powers to indefinitely keep troops in the territory under the name of railway guards . On the part of Russia , she merely once more obligates herself , for about the fourth time I believe , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railway . The only difference between this and former promises of a like nature is in the limitation of the number of " guards . " At fifteen men to a kilometer , the two powers reserve to themselves the right to keep in Manchuria from 30,000 to 35,000 soldiers indefinitely , or permanently as may be . It is interesting and suggestive to recall here that at the time the peace conference was held China expressed a desire to be represented in so far as the negotiations affected her territory , and that she was promptly sat upon by Japan , the victorious belligerent . And since the peace treaty has been published China has ventured a feeble protest against certain of its terms regarding Manchuria . She has pointed out that eighteen months is a longer time than is needed to get the two armies away from Manchuria , that there is nothing in the state of the country to warrant so large a railway guard , and that while the contracting powers obligate themselves to restore the administration of Manchuria to China , no date for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly right , but no one expects that she will be attended to . Russia and Japan have , in so far as they have noticed China 's protests at all , let it be known that it is for them to decide these matters , and the tone of these statements convey the impression that China is , or will be , lucky in getting Manchuria back under any terms . I can not resist the desire to call attention to the wording of the second clause above quoted , in which Japan and Russia agree to restore to the administration of China the whole of Manchuria . Since we all know , through repeated diplomatic asservations of both powers , that Chinese administrative autonomy in Manchuria has never been interfered with , this clause somewhat illuminates the unreliability of diplomatic assurances . Having been in Manchuria at different times during the Russian occupation before the war , during the Russian occupation after hostilities began , and then during Japanese occupation of the region from which they had dislodged the Russians and which they now control , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying circumstances . That the Russian occupation to a considerable extent usurped Chinese authority in the administration of the country , to the detriment of other interests there , will , in the present state of feeling in the United States , be accepted without proof . My observation convinces me that during the comparatively short time the Japanese have occupied the southern half of the country they have gone farther in destroying Chinese autonomy than ever the Russians did . I am amply supplied with the details to support this statement , but the character of this article forbids their introduction here .  | Nor are they , I may say , of a purely military character . What concerns us at the present moment is how the situation resulting from the peace terms is going to work out . Its most striking immediate effect is the establishment in the centre of Manchuria of a military frontier between Russia and Japan . This is now generally regarded as a temporary condition , soon to be done away with by the removal of the two great armies now assembled . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Financial considerations , if other reasons were lacking , will probably compel the return of the vast Japanese army to Japan as soon as circumstances will permit . But the ultimate withdrawal to the limit fixed is dependable upon certain possibilities . Russia has agreed to evacuate Manchuria , and there is every probability that she will at last do so , since to fail would be to invite a resumption of hostilities . But the terms do not obligate her to take her army back to Russia . In fact , as I write this to do so would seem to entail a danger , owing to the state of Russia and the existence of revolutionary sentiments among the troops , and there are difficulties about transportation to be overcome . So it is highly probable that the Russian army will for the time be withdrawn only to Russian soil , at places adjacent to the borders of Manchuria and Mongolia . It is reasonably certain that Japan will not consider it prudent to reduce her forces to a total below those of Russia ; so the rate of withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate established by Russia . Without entering further into details , it is probable that the military evacuation of Manchuria will take several years . Assuming , however , that this period is successfully got over without serious friction , under the peace terms the two powers are entitled to keep inside the borders of Manchuria railway guards aggregating some thirty thousand men , which , under the agreed division of the railroads , will be about equally divided between them . In other words , Japan and Russia are each to be permitted to keep about fifteen thousand troops in Manchuria , even after the transitory period is passed , and the administration of the country has been restored to China . Nothing is said in the treaty as to how these troops are to be distributed , or how they are to be employed . Naturally , they will be kept where they are more apt to be needed , and that means near the borders of the line of delineation between Russia and Japan . Where this line is to be is already tentatively established by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways south of a certain point to Japan . Apparently the point of contact on the railway is to be at or near Chang-tu , where it crosses the old palisade , or barrier . This is about where the front was at the time hostilities terminated , and it is reasonable to expect that the new frontier will extend east and west along the line of the then existing military front , although this may later be more accurately determined by explicit agreement between Russia and Japan . Vast fortifications already extend along this frontier , which could be easily made permanent . Here , in the immediate future , at any rate , Japan and Russia will continue to watch each other just as distrustfully and carefully as nations in Europe do under similar circumstances . In the light of the uses to which so-called railway guards have been put of late years in various parts of the Orient , particularly in Manchuria , it requires an incorruptible optimism to see in these conditions any great promise for the genuine restoration of Chinese administration in Manchuria . No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-worn subterfuges will be kept up . China is not deceived . This is getting to be an old story with her , and her protest that she is willing to maintain order in Manchuria and protect the railroad contains a note of pathos . The fact is that , notwithstanding pretences to the contrary , she now has both the power and disposition to govern her formerly turbulent provinces , but the chances of her being permitted to do so are slight if they depend solely upon the assurances of Japan and Russia ; which in my opinion are worth collectively just what they are worth separately , and we have only to go to the very recent course of events in Korea and Manchuria to compare promises to fulfilment in the case of both nations . Before the war Russia 's " railway guards " in Manchuria were the bete noire of other chancelleries , and many were the epithets levelled at them ; but now they seem suddenly to have acquired international respectability . Russia 's reason for having such " guards " in Manchuria is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , now , are Japan 's reasons for copying Russian methods , to which she formerly objected ? This is worth probing a little , for it also illuminates the purpose behind Japan 's determination to seize and retain Port Arthur . Had Japan no other interest in the future of Korea and China than a commercial and industrial opportunity there equal to those enjoyed by other nations , why should she want a military and naval base in north China ? The answer is that she needs one to protect her " territorial rights " and " special interests . " She is undoubtedly preparing for the time when she may have to defend her position in Manchuria . Port Arthur is not needed to enable Japan to defend Korea so long as it is not under the control of an adversary . But Port Arthur is essential to the defence of Manchuria by Japan . It secures the sea terminus of the railway and overlooks the mouth of the Yalu , which will soon be connected by rail with central Manchuria . There is much significance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion rather than to permit Port Arthur to be again wrested from her . A brief reference , in passing , to the " common interests " of Japan in China , in contradistinction to her " special interests " in eastern Asia , so sharply outlined in the preamble to the alliance with England , serves to emphasize the meaning of the two terms . Japan 's " common interests " are the same as those of , for example , the United States ; and will amount to whatever of commercial and industrial development the energy of her subjects , supported by the political and financial energy of their government , can wring from conditions within the empire . No other nation has a moral right to object to any progress of this nature Japan may be able to make , provided the gain is not made at the expense of , or does not grow out of invidious detriment to that other nation 's legitimate interests . But evidence that forces of invidious detriment , set in motion and stimulated by Japan , are already at work against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the last few months and may be expected to gain force as time passes unless promptly checked . I dislike to make this assertion here , unsupported by the details upon which I rest it , but the limitation of space compels me to indicate only a few of their significant manifestations . A study of the origin and progress of the so-called boycott of American goods by the Chinese , of some of the methods adopted to extend Japanese influence throughout China , and the incentive underlying the present recrudescence of the antiforeign agitation , should afford food for reflection to all Westerners . And as to purely commercial matters , I know of an instance which occurred very recently , wherein the principle of a Japanese " sphere of influence " in Fukien , Chekiang , and Kiangsi was diplomatically invoked at Peking to obstruct an important American business enterprise in those provinces . This statement rests upon something more than circumstantial evidence . In fact , a conclusion forced upon one by a study of the AngloJapanese alliance is that , while declaring for the " open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion of a hitherto nebulous position of Japan in Korea and Manchuria into a de facto condition of territorial appropriation supported , in effect , by the military and naval forces of England . In other words , the " sphere of influence " doctrine , to give a moderate interpretation to the present situation , has been revived in a more concrete form than it ever had before . A consideration of the " sphere of influence " doctrine and its possible effects upon Far Eastern politics leads , naturally , to examination of the policies of the powers which have in the past seemed to favor it . Prominent among them is Germany . Of all the foreign powers which have or claim interests in China , the course of Germany has been in some respects the most remarkable . Less versed in such methods than some of her competitors , she has cut her path with such broad strokes that a novice can follow it in all its main turns . It is doubtful if contemporaneous history affords a parallel , in sheer unprincipled rapacity , to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble to stalk her prey through the usual processes of evasive diplomacy , but sprang abruptly upon it without warning and established possession by pure audacity almost before other powers realized what was happening . Nor , her so-called lease once secured , did she hesitate to go forward along the same lines .  | What was possibly a misstep in respect to some matter of mining machinery which she proposed to compel the Chinese in Shantung to purchase from German rather than American bidders , aroused Mr. Hay and brought about what is known as the Hay agreement respecting the principle of the " open door . " But , although compelled by circumstances outwardly to lower the colors of the " sphere of influence " doctrine , she never swerved from her purpose , which was undoubtedly shaped in expectation of , if not in deliberate effort to bring about the dismemberment of China . The " boxer " troubles gave her a new opportunity . North China will not soon forget the punitive expeditions undertaken by the Kaiser 's picked regiments . In the readjustment of interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ensuing haste of most of the powers to grab what they could while unsettled conditions lasted , the German-Russian entente had its origin . This entente , denied by both Russia and Germany in the days of its influence and now reduced by recent events to inanition , had undoubtedly at one time a tangible existence . Its traces may be found in all the windings of Far Eastern diplomacy in the years between the " boxer " trouble and the war between Russia and Japan , but I can not follow their intricacies here . Its fundamental basis rested upon a mutual understanding as to the division between the two powers of that part of the Chinese Empire lying north of the Yiang-tse Valley . During this period German diplomacy at Peking was characterized by an unparalidled aggressiveness and insolence . The unfortunate death of the German minister just prior to the " boxer " outbreak , now generally considered to have been largely the result of his own imprudence , to give his conduct a mild name , was made the excuse for numerous exactions to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile as a corollary to political and military energy , and calculated to give some apparently adequate foundation for both , extraordinary measures to advance German " interests " in China were inaugurated . A minute elucidation of the details of this attempt to " create interests to protect , " which I have gathered in the course of two visits to Shan-tung province since the German oc-@# cupation , and elsewhere throughout the empire , would be very interesting and illuminative of what is getting to be a common method of indirect political aggression upon weaker nations ; but an indication or two must suffice . One can not fail to be impressed with the material demonstrations of German " interests " in China . At Tsingtau she has built a modern city scarcely inferior to the one Russia constructed at Dalny ' ; and so close is the relation between German and Russian method in the Far East that there is little doubt that the one is the replica , in political purpose , of the other . From Tsing-tau she has built a railway which already penetrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be connected with the Peking-Hankow road , and by a branch to the north will reach Tien-tsin . German subsidized steamships ply along the China coast and on the Yiangtse , creating by a clever method of port registration a most exaggerated impression of the extent of German shipping interests . At every important treaty port within the empire impressive and commodious consulates have been or are being built , while an elaborate commercial bureau , fully supplied with clerical aid , supplements the ordinary consular work . At Shanghai a magnificent post-office has been built to handle a comparatively small amount of German mail matter , while the Kaiser is said to have provided from his personal funds part of the money to build the splendid Concordia Club now being erected on the Shanghai bund , and which , with a small membership to support it , will eclipse any similar building in the Orient . A press news service and a number of publications are maintained , and no means neglected to supply obvious indication of great and varied German " interests " throughout the Far East . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reveal that they are to a great extent fictitious , and really exist upon government subsidies ; which conveys definite assurance that , in their present state , they were instituted and , are maintained for political rather than commercial purposes . And here we touch the heart of the matter . Are we to assume that a power like Germany , after ten years of energetic striving and enormous expenditure of life and money , will see her prospects blighted and abandon her purpose  | without an effort to protect them ? Whatever may be the possibilities of German commercial and industrial interests in the Far East under the " open door , " the opinion in Berlin seems to be , and I am inclined also to think that they will be better served by absolute predominance in a certain " sphere " than by equal opportunity throughout the whole of China . At any rate , there is no doubt that Germany 's policy has up to now been shaped on this theory , be it mistaken or not . While there is no sound reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the policy of Germany , there is no doubt that it has undergone an outward change within the last few months , or since it became certain that Japan was to be victorious in the struggle with Russia . I have it direct from a member of the Wai-wu-pu that , beginning soon after the battle of the Japan Sea , German diplomatic method at Peking underwent a transition which amounted to revolution . At that time Germany was pressing upon China a number of minor , though not unimportant , concessions in Shan-tung , which , if granted , would have almost certainly caused dissatisfaction to other powers , as well as being a relinquishment of Chinese autonomy . The Wai-wu-pu was resisting this pressure as well as it could , but might have been compelled to yield in the end had not the now famous naval battle completely demolished Russia 's chances . The German change of front was so sudden as to be almost laughable ; in fact , the Chinese official who gave me the details did laugh exceedingly in their narration . He had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time in his heart deploring the state of affairs which made China the shuttlecock of fate . But , while outwardly acquiescing in the existing status quo , until she is able to determine upon what shall be the next move , Germany undoubtedly regards the AngloJapanese alliance with suspicion and alarm , and only bides her time until conditions make the formulation of an opposition policy feasible . The other great powers who may be presumed from the logic of their situation to favor the " sphere of influence " doctrine are , of course , Russia and France . France is not active in the advancement of any special policy , but her inclination will be to support Russia under ordinary circumstances , in order to prevent Russia from flying to the arms of Germany . However , she will probably not take a decided stand either way , having at stake neither so much to win or lose as to warrant it . But with Russia it is different . Although defeated , and for the time distracted by internal problems , she is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the powers . While , owing to her defeat at the hands of Japan , her prestige in the Orient must temporarily suffer , her position on the borders of China will always make her felt at Peking , and she can never be left out of any reasonable estimation of political probabilities in connection with the Far Eastern question . In a few years she will have her present Siberian Railway double-tracked , and the new line via Tashkent and Kokand finished , which will vastly increase her military potency in Asia . Besides , it is idle to assume that she will abandon what is to her a permanent purpose , and her still great material interests on the Pacific . That England and Japan fully recognize this is indicated by their alliance . Why , unless she still fears Russia , does England apparently sacrifice desires in other directions to assure the assistance of Japan should the Indian frontier be attacked ? There is a logical foundation for the belief , entertained by some statesmen in Europe , that England was practically forced into the present alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And does not this assumption imply the existence of a certain harmony between the designs and intentions of Russia and Japan in eastern Asia , or , to speak more exactly , a disposition to compromise in advance a possible future collision ? This leads , inevitably , when the whole situation is considered , to the question : Has England sacrificed the " open door , " with its now doubtful advantages to her , to the more certain and definite benefit of the security of her Indian frontier and her " sphere of influence " in China ? Since it seems probable , indeed almost certain , that out of the existing situation will come a realignment of policies in which the " sphere of influence " doctrine will be revived in a more specific and formidable form , perhaps to the extent of eventually reducing the " open door " to a meaningless  | phrase , the position of the United States demands attention . Our national aims in the Far East are pretty well understood by Americans to be confined to commercial and industrial matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no doubt that American statesmanship , skilfully directed by Mr. Hay , has pursued this course consistently and with asbolute sincerity . I advance no claim that we are more disinterested than other nations . Our policy is based upon the belief that the " open door " will be best for our interests , just as some other powers consider the " sphere of influence " doctrine as best calculated to advance theirs . All are purely selfish , in the sense that each nation is concerned most about its own advantage . In the case of America , there exists a sincere desire to advance our national interests as far as possible without injuring other nations ; indeed , we would like to see them prosper as well as ourselves . Unfortunately , all national policies are not built on this plan , but many are conceived in a school of statesmanship which seeks comparative advancement through detriment to competitors . And this is the guiding spirit of most of the policies now exerted in the Far East . With them all competition implies a fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to meet the new conditions , this should not be lost sight of . I have already pointed out how the peace terms and the alliance with England definitely concede to Japan what are practically spheres of influence in Korea and Manchuria never before claimed by her . In fact , " sphere of influence " is too weak a phrase to describe this new condition . " Territorial rights " is the term used in the alliance treaty . Now " sphere of influence " is somewhat intangible , and requires caution in manipulation ; but " territorial right " is absolute , and carries with it the power to control and regulate a country . " Territorial rights " imply sovereignty . Does anyone suppose that the French , German , and Russian foreign offices are deceived as to the real meaning of this term ? And are we to expect that these powers will quietly consent to have their own special interests and privileges in their tentative " spheres " curtailed by the declaration of the alliance in favor of the " open door , " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely to Japan a very large " sphere " where she is to have a practically free hand ? European chancelleries have no delusions about the assurance that japan will respect the " open door " in Korea and Manchuria . Will they not insist upon retaining special privileges in those regions where their influence predominates ? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander . And under any revival and application of the " sphere of influence " doctrine , where will the United States land ? Our commerce will be compelled to fight for a foothold in the Far East under any handicaps which other competitive nations may choose to impose upon it . And it should be remembered that the logical outcome of the " sphere of influence " doctrine is dismemberment . China will herself exert an influence upon the eventual settlement , but the foreign powers now hold the balance of power . This , then , is the situation American diplomacy is facing . It begins to look as if the United States , having once before rescued the " open door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save it again . I can not help feeling that there is something rather humiliating to this nation , whether intended or not , in the wording and spirit of the Anglo-Japanese alliance . Americans certainly are capable of determining what are their interests in the Far East , and if they are not capable of defending them it is pretty sure that no other nation will defend them for us . Can Americans afford to intrust the care of their interests in the present and future of the Orient to what seem destined to be our most energetic and formidable competitors ? It is clear that at present we could not protect those interests in an extreme issue with any hope of success , owing to our military and naval weakness in the Pacific . But besides taking steps to alter this situation by maintaining a strength in the Pacific which , while threatening no one , will induce consideration of our reasonable wishes , the government should lose no time in instituting more efficient measures to preserve and extend our interests by peaceful means . The United States should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all means a commercial and industrial bureau provided with a clerical force and funds to keep abreast of our competitors . Our position now , in respect to such matters , is almost ridiculous .  | Just a word to those Americans who may sincerely hold the opinion that the United States should abandon its position in the Pacific and abstain from any positive or aggressive policy in the Far East . The possibilities of the Orient , in a commercial and industrial sense , have not yet been scratched , and that the present century will witness a tremendous evolution there can not be doubted . That the tendency of material discovery and its application to the wants and needs of mankind is to eliminate those conditions which for so long kept large segments of the human race in comparative isolation from each other , and to bring into direct contact and a more common channel what have , in man 's narrow view of his own possibilities and destiny , appeared to be widely divergent forces is now generally recognized . To assume a future for civilization in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly , perhaps decisively influential , seems not only to contradict probability , but to nega- tive political principles now widely accepted as the guiding and predominating force in human progress . It is roughly estimated that two-thirds of the human beings who now inhabit the earth live in that part of the world usually spoken of as the Orient . This constitutes , in sheer weight of human mind and matter , a decided , almost overwhelming majority , and sh uld it eventually succeed in making its desires felt in the councils of the nations it can not fail to seriously affect the course of civilization . What will be the effect upon the Western world of the introduction of modern material progress into an element largely homogeneous and which holds , in physical preponderance , should means to apply it be found , the ultimate balance of power ? This is the Far Eastern question . Can we conceive a future for our country in which it will not be brought seriously into contact with this question ? I can not . America must , whether she wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @#
