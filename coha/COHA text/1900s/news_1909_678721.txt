txt KNOX NOTE ALARMS ENVOYS FROM SOUTH Diplomats from All Latin America Fear Policy of Protectorates for Other Countries . NEXT MOVE KEPT SECRET State Department Will Not Divulge Its Plans in Nicaragua  --  Marines and Ships Ordered to Caribbean . Sprcial to The New York Times . WASBINGTON . Dec. ** dismissal of Se/or Rodriguez , Charge d'Affaires of The Niearagna Legation , by Secretary lines yesterday he s thrown the Latin American diplomats in Washingten into a flutter of excitement and apprehension . For the time being , at least , it seems to have put an end to the differences that bad kept some of the Central American republics from maintaining a perfectly friendly intercourse , and to-day they were all together in apparently the utmost amicability . So far as the State Department was informed , the letter had been received with good feeling by the representatives of the other four Central Amer ! can republics , but in private conversation with friends to whom they spoke confidentially several of these diplomats did not hesitate to express their anxiety over the situation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so soon after the equally blunt letter to Senor Cruse , the Chilean Minister , in which he demanded the settlement of the Alsop claim within tan days , has given the diplomatic representatives of the Latin American republics a shaking-up such as they have not had in a very long time . It is not the fact of the dismkssal of Zelaya 's representative here that excites the apprehension of these diplomats . It Is rather the manner in which the dismissal was acaomplished . They were practically agreed that Alaya was a menace to the peace , not only of his own country . but of all Central America , and they will be rejoiced to see him definitely overthrown and his possibility for misahief destroyed . But to have it done in - 41 shirt-sleeve " fashion excites in every iine of them the fear that there may be other rods in pickle in the State Departaisent and that the next blow to fall may be on himself or one of his friends . Diplomats Show Uneasiness . . There has been a vast amount of diseusidon of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heeii " tunable to conceal their uneasiness over it . It was declared by one expertenaed Latin American diplomat that if : the purpose of the State Department was tOtatfilte terror to all Central America by ' the character of its note to Senor Rodriguez it had succeeded admirably . The diplomat expressed regret , however , that the State Department had seen fit to employ such language as it had , because it seemed to him calculated rather to solidify opposition on the part of the central Americans than to establish confitience and secure co-operation . One feature of Secretary Knox 's letter attracted especial attention from the Central American diplomats . That was the paragraph dealing with the intention of this Government to secure some sort ' of a ? guarantee by convention that hereafter Nicaragua will abide by her treaty obligations . It was suggested that this pointed ' straight toward an arrangement which in effect would be pretty close to a protectorate over Nicaragua , as no other circumstances would render such a guarantee on Nicaragua 's part of any more value than the conventions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a . Nothing is more terrifying to the Central Americans than the suggestion of such . a course on the part of the United States , because each one of them promptly applies it to his own country and force sees the time when the tTnited States will make a similar move against it . There le-no question that the events of the last few weeks have done a great deal to renew the old distrust of the United States among the Latin-Americans and to bring about a critical situation in our relations ' with practically all the countries to the south of us. - : The territory held by Estrada is confined to the swampy strip along the Atlantic Coast , where conditions of warfare ' would very closely resemble some of the Went that were met by our troops in the . rhilippines during the insurrection there . Gen. Estrada was Governor at Bluefields , the most important and populous town of the Atlantic Coast , which has about 1,500 ' inhabitants . When his insurrection against Zelaya started he was able to take pos.session of Greytown. the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most northerly port . This gave him control of practically all the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua , but Zelaya managed to retake Greytown , which . Estrada is now in turn besieging . The Estrada forces range through a strip running but a comparatively few miles back from the coast , including most of the new province of Zelaya . The engagements recently fought at Rama were at the westernmost line of their advance . - s- DiffienItiest We Would Meet .

The State Department maintains absolute reticence as to the possibilities of our future course , and there is no indicaAim of an intenton on the part of Prestdent Taft to use force against Zelaya except such as is furnished by the sending of additional ships and of marines to Colon , where they will be ready for service if called upon . Easy to Bring on War . It takes action by Congress to declare I ever , but if the Administration is determined to bring on a conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress will have to act . The first step would probably be the sending of a guard to our legation at Managua . Under the present strained circumstances ' such action would be very likely to pro- , duce an outburst on the part of some Nicaraguans which would lead to fighting , and then Congress would be compelled to support our men even at the cost of declaring war . It has been suggested that the State Department has already consulted the Navy Department with reference ' , to the ' sending of a guard to Managua . but no official information on the sub- : ject can be obtained at either the State , or Navy Department or at the White House . The Nicaraguan situation was discussed this afternoon at a special meeting of the Cabinet , called for the reading of the final draft of the President 's message . The message itself will touch briefly on the Government 's policy toward Nicaragua , though it is said that President Taft will not indulge in scathing criticism of the tottering Nicaraguan regime . No Marines Landed Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Marine Corps , stated to-night that no marines had yet been /ended in Nicaragua , despite reports to the contrary . " There are no marines on board any of the United States war vessels now in Nicaraguan waters , " said Gen. Elliott . " The marines nearest Nicaragua to-night are at Panama . " " Have they been ordered to Nicaragua ? " Gen. Elliott was asked . " Not yet , " he replied . The first step in the direction of sending marines to Nicaragua was the sailing from Philadelphia to-day of the Prairie with 703 men and officers . It is expected that the troopship will . be but little delayed by her mishap in running aground ? in the Delaware River , and that she will be under way again to-morrow . Officials of the Navy Department had no advices to-night of the grounding of the Prairie and of the gunboat Princeton off Astoria , Oregon , yesterday . " It Is believed highly improbable that either vessel is injured , " said Beekman Winthrop , Assistant Secretary of the Navy , to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another high navy official laughingly declared that he supposed the Nicaraguans would regard the two accidents as glorious victories for the Nicaraguan arms . " Kimball to Command Ships . It is still asserted that the marines on the Prairie are not going direct to any Nicaraguan port , but no secret is made Of the fact that the force is far larger than is needed to relieve the marines in the Canal Zone . With them is Rear Admiral W. W. Kimball , a member of the Board of Construction , and he will assume command of the little flotilla of cruisers and gunboats in Nicatsiguan waters . Besides the 703 marines on board the Prairie there are about 400 on the Isthmus , most of whom could be used in an emergency , and several hundred more at Guantanamo , Cuba . While Admiral Kimball 's immediate strength will consist only of ? the Des Moines. the Tacoma , the Marietta , and the Prairie , the naval force across the Isthmus will be considerably augmented . The Albany and Yorktown have been ordered to Corinto from Magdalena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The transport Buffalo , it is expected . will sail from Panama for Corinto. with probably as many as 1,100 marines aboard , soon after the Prairie arrives at Colon . The concentration of the four warships , together with the Buffalo with all her marines , at Corinto is taken to indicate the determination of the officials here to be able to meet any call upon them for the protection of American citizens . On the Albany are about 280 bluejackets , and on the Vicksburg , Yorktown , and Prince-1 ton about 150 each . These , together with the marines , would make an army equal to any organization reported to be serving under Zelaya . Questions at the State Department as to what circumstances would justify in the department 's eyes a landing of marines failed to elicit any reply . No statement was made as to whether the landing would be indefinitely postponed in case it should develop that both the " Governments de facto " were scrupulously guarding American interests . Consuls Likely to Stay . At the State Department it was said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his conferees in Nicaragua as to whether or not President Zelaya had retaliated for the repudiation of his envoys by canceling Mel exequaturs of the American representatires , but as a Consul 's office is almost ! purely commercial it is considered unlikely that lie will sever the slender thread still connecting his Government with the United States . Nor is it likely that ' this I Government will send away the Nica-1 raguan consuls in this country . They ' I will probably remain on the same footing as Estrada. ' s Consuls and act chiefly as Purchasing agents for their faction . No answer has been received from Mr. Rodriguez to Secretary Knox 's note and none is expected . Mr. Rodriguez said this afternoon that he was awaiting instructions from President Zelaya , though lie supposed that his orders , when they came , would only be to come home at once . Though Mr. Rodriguez professes the ' kindest feelings toward air . Knox and Assistant Secretary Wilson he does not deny that lie was much surprised at his abrupt dismissal . On Nov. 17 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for informa- , tion concerning the killing of Cannon and ? Uroce . This request he had forwarded at once and he soon received a cablegram telling him that under the military code of his country their execution was justified . Of this explanation , he said , he at once notified the State Department . On leaving , he said , he informed the department that he was waiting for a ' more detailed account of the trial and shooting of the prisoners , and he was still waiting for this information when he got Mr. Knox 's letter . " I was still waiting , " he said , with a resigned wave of his hand . " But now , I am not waiting  --  except for orders to go home , maybe . ' Mr. Rodriguez does not expect to be allowed to avail himself of Mr. Knox 's invitation to represent his faction unofficially before the department , though on account of the pleasant personal relations ? that have existed between himself and the American officials , he would not object to obeying orders to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . no , " he said . " Mr. Knox is a bright man , a great lawyer , and has held many big positions . He is all right to I me personally . He has always been a perfect gentleman to me ? so has Mr. Wilson . You probably think me a hot-blooded Southerner , " he went on with a deprecating smile , " but not so at all . 1 have lived long in America and my blood is cold , very , very cold , and my mind is , too . " Mr. Rodriguez said that Pedro Gonzales would soon return to Europe , as he had no ! official business here . Mr. Hazera will leave soon for Nicaragua . as lie has never been received by this Government . If Zelaya decides to maintain any diplomatic ? relations at all with this country he 10111 either leave Mr. Rodriguez here in his ! analogous position or trust entirely to his Consuls . No communication has been received by the State ' Department from Senor Castrillo , the Estrada envoy , following bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received on the same footing as Mr. Rodriguez  --  unofficially as the agent of his faction . Senor Castrillo , the Estradist envoy , made no attempt to-day to see any of the State Department officials , and from his attitude and his manner in answering questions , it appears that he will not force matters in that direction until further developments In the ' Nicaraguan situation take place . Since he is in almost constant communication with Estrada , his policy is doubtless the result of his observation of the situation here , combined with the counsel of Estrada . Senor Castrillo says : " It is better for the present that the revolutionists should be recognized simply as belligerents , as the United States can exert influence under such an arrange-. ment which would be impossible if the ' provisional government were officially recognized as the Government of Nicaragua . " Confers With Other Diplomats . Part of the day was spent by Senor Castrillo in the company of the diplomatic representatives in this country of other Central and South American republics ? Senor Calvo , Minister from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senor Herrarte , Minister from Guatemala . and Seno Mejia . Minister from Salvador . His association with them is taken as further proof that the Central American republics are ready to follow the lead of the ' United States in considering the rule of Zelaya. at an end for all diplomatic ' . purpoecs . One Interesting development to-day came in a telegram to Senor Castrillo from a friend in New York named J. J. Livingston . Mr. Livingston declared that Zelaya was having bank bills to the amount of ** printed in New York , with his name and photograph on them , and that he was paying $75.000 for the printing . The bills were about ready for shipment to Nicaragua , said Mr. Livingston . In discussing the telegram Senor Castrillo said it . was not the first time Zelaya had shown such financial proclivities and that , his method of turning $75,000 into $4,000,000 was right in line with the way he was throwing dust into the eyes of his followers , and creating a false Impression as to his resources . " That is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Senor Castrillo . " Estrada has been unwilling to issue notes on improper security , while Zelaya has been printing money as fast as he needs It . The result has been that we have been made to appear without funds . " Zelaya is entirely under the influence of his advisers . who have flattered him with their obsequiousness and then taken advantage of his ignorance . He is so illiterate that his Important documents have to be prepared for his signature . It ; seems evident from Secretary Knox 's letter to Senor Rodriguez that this Government will not countenance any effort by Zelaya to place one of his followers in his place , and that is one of the most encouraging features of the statement .
