 |p645  I. ROBERT-HOUDIN 'S father was a watchmaker in moderate circumstances . At the age of eleven Jean-Eugene Robert ( for such was the necromancer 's real name ) was sent to college at Orleans On the completion of his studies , lie entered a notary 's office at Blois , at the earnest solicitation of his father , but soon abandoned the uncongenial pursuit of en - grossing musty parch ments for watchmaking . One evening till young apprentice entered a bookseller 's shop in Blois and asked for a treatise on clockmaking Berthoud . By mistake the shopman. who was busy attend rug to more important customers , handed him a couple of odd volumes of the Encyclopedie , which in appearance closely resembled Berthoud 's famous work . Home went Jean-Eugene to his little attic , au sixieme in the mansard of an ancient house . Judge of his surprise to find one of the books labeled " Scientific Amusements , " containing explanations of various feats of legerdemain Overpowered with astonishment and fascinated beyond measure , Houdin devoured the mystic volume until far into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This trivial incident was provocative of great changes in his future career . IIe vowed to become a famous prestidigitator . Living at Blois was a mountebank , who. for a consideration , initiated the young aspirant for magical skill into the multiform mysteries of juggling , enabling him in a short while to keep four balls going in the air at once and read a book at the same moment . From juggling he passed on to sleight-of-hand proper , in which the art of palming plays the principal part . Though his passion for prestidigitation was so intense , Houdin had sufficient command over himself not to displease his master . He never neglected his trade of watchmaking . At length the apprenticeship was over , and lean-Eugene went to Tours as a journeyman . He faithfully served his new employer , M. Noriet , who subsequently became a sculptor of distinction . In after-years the conjurer and the sculptor met on equal ground , both masters in their particular professions , in which delicacy of touch and real sleight-of-hand enter . After remaining in Blois for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife for he had not only taken unto himself a spouse , but had adopted her name , Houdin , as part of his own cognomen . II . In shop , over the door of which was displayed the following modest  |p646  sign : ' M. Robert-Houdin . Pendules de Precision .... This sign indicated that the proprietor was a watchmaker. and that his wares were noted for precise running . Outwardly it was not an attractive shop , but its windows possessed a fascination for curious quid-nuncs . There were watches displayed for sale , and there were some peculiar-looking clocks of clearest crystal that ran apparently without works . the invention of M. Robert-Houdin . One day there sauntered by a certain wealthy scion of the Old Regime , the Count de l'Escalopier , who was a great lover of curios . He saw the magic clock in the watchmaker 's window , and purchased it . Being an ardent devotee of science amusante , or science wedded to recreation , the Count became a frequent visitor to Houdin 's shop , to watch the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edification of Ins patron , and confessed his burning desire to become a public performer . The Count urged him continually to abandon the watchmaking and mechanical-toy trade and go on the boards as a prestidigitateur . Finally Houdin confessed his inability to do so , owing to lack of means . whereupon the kindhearted nobleman exclaimed : " Mon cher ami , I have at home , at this very moment . ten thousand francs or so , which 1 really do n't know what to do with . Do me the favor to borrow- them for an indefinite period ; you will be doing me an actual service . " But Houdin would not accept the oiler , for he was loath to risk a friend 's money in a theatrical speculation . The Coma in a state of pique left the shop , and did not return for many clays . Then he rushed excitedly into the workroom , sank upon a chair , and exclaimed " My dear neighbor , since you are determined not to accept a favor from me , I have now come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . For the last year my desk has been robbed from time to time of very considerable sums of money . I have adopted all possible safeguards and precautions ? having the place watched , changing the locks , secret fastenings to the door , et cetera -- but none of these has foiled the villainous ingenuity of the thief . This very morning . I have discovered that a couple of thousand-franc notes have disappeared . ' ' The upshot of it all was that Houdin invented a clever device for apprehending the criminal . It consisted of an apparatus fastened to the inside of the desk in the Count 's house . When the desk was unlocked , and the lid raised ever so little , a pistol was discharged ; at the same time a clawlike arrangement , attached to a light rod and impelled by a spring , came sharply down on the back of the hand which held the key , inflicting a superficial flesh-wound . With this clever machine the robber was successfully apprehended . He proved to be the Count 's valet and factotum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thief to disgorge over fifteen thousand francs , which lie had invested in government stock . M. de l'Escalopier took the money thus recovered to Houdin , saying : " Take it , return it to me just when you like , with the understanding that it is to be repaid only out of the profits of your theater . " With this money . Houdin built a little theater in the Palais Royal . One day the following modest handbill appeared on the theatrical bulletin-boards ? " Aujourd'hui Jeudi , 3 Juillet 1845 . " Premiere Representation " des " SOIREES FANTASTIQUES " de " ROBERT-HOUDIN . " These fantastic evenings became wonderfully popular . The little theater would seat only two hundred , but the prices of admission were rather high . During the Revolution of 1848 when the poor " pear-headed " Louis Philippe was driven from his throne . most of the theaters of Paris went to smash financially . Houdin simply closed up his hall , put the key in his pocket . and went to inventing new tricks . His loss was very slight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was restored he resumed his soirees . To Robert-Houdin we are indebted for a complete revolution in the art . of conjuring . Prior to his time magicians draped all of their tables to the floor , thereby mak-  |p647  ing them little else than huge confederateboxes . Conjuring under such circumstances was child 's play , as compared with the difficulties to be encountered with the apparatus of the new school . In addition , Houdin discarded the long , flowing robes of his predecessors , as savoring too much of charlatanism , and appeared in evening dress . Since his time no first-class prestidigitateur has dared to offend good taste by presenting his illusions in any other costume than that of a gentleman habited a la mode , nor has he dared to give a performance with draped tables . Houdin 's center-table was a marvel of mechanical skill and ingenuity . Concealed in the body were " vertical rods , each arranged to rise and fall in a tube . according as it was drawn down by a spiral spring or pulled up by a whip-cord which passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so down the table-leg to the hidingplace of the confederate . " There were " ten of these pistons. and ten cords passing under the floor of the stage , terminated at a keyboard . Various ingenious automata were actuated by this means of transmitting motion . " Houdin 's stage was very handsome . It was a reproduction in miniature of a salon of the Louis XV . period ? all in white alai gold ? illuminated by elegant candelabra and a chandelier . The magic table occupied the center of the room This piece ' HOR AND AMBASSADOR . 647 of furniture was flanked by little gueridons . At the sides were consoles , with about five inches of gold fringe hanging from them , and across the back of the apartment ran a broad shelf , upon which was displayed the various apparatus to be used in the seances . " The consoles were nothing more than shallow wooden boxes with openings through the side-scenes . The tops of the consoles were perforated with traps . Any object which the wizard desired to work off secretly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps and covered with a sheet of paper , pasteboard cover or a handkerchief . Touching a spring caused the article to fall noiselessly through the trap upon cotton batting , and roll into the hand of the conjurer 's concealed assistant . " Now for some of the tricks of this classic prestidigitator . His greatest invention was the " light and heavy chest . " Speaking of this remarkable experiment he wrote : " I do not think , modesty apart , that I ever invented anything so daringly ingenious . " The magician came forward with a little wooden box , to the top of which was attached a metal handle . He addressed the audience as follows : " Ladies and gentlemen , I have a cash-box which possesses some strange properties . It becomes heavy or light at will . I place in  |p648  it some banknotes for safekeeping and deposit it here on the ' run-down ' in sight of all . Will some gentleman test the lightness of the box ? " When the volunteer had satisfied the audience that the box could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesmeric passes over it , and bade the gentleman lift it a second time . But try as he might , the volunteer would prove unequal to the task . At a sign from Houdin the box would be restored to its pristine lightness . This trick was performed with a powerful electro-magnet with conducting wires reaching behind the scenes to a battery . At a signal from the performer an operator turned on the electric current , and the box , which had an iron plate let into its bottom , covered with mahogany-colored paper , clung to the magnet with supernatural attraction . In the year 1845 , the phenomena of electromagnetism were unknown to the general public , hence the trick of the spirit cash-box created the most extraordinary sensation . When the subject of electricity became better known , Houdin made an addition to the trick which threw his spectators off the scent . After first having shown the trick on the " run-down , " he hooked the box to one end of a cord which passed over a pulley attached to the ceiling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end of the cord and keep the chest suspended . " Just at present , " remarked the conjurer , " the chest is extremely light ; but as it is about to become , at my command , very heavy , I must ask five or six other persons to help this gentleman , for fear the chest should lift him off his feet . " " No sooner was this done than the chest came heavily to the ground , dragging along and sometimes lifting off their feet all the spectators who were holding the cord . The explanation is this : On a casual inspection of the pulley and block everything appears to indicate that , as us ual in such cases , the cord passes straight over the pulley , in on one side and out on the other ; but such is not really the fact , as will be seen upon tracing the course of the dotted lines ( Fig. 3 ) , which , passing through the block and through the ceiling , are attached on either side to a double pulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the most elementary acquaintance with the laws of mechanics , it will be obvious that the strength of the person who holds the handle of the windlass above is multiplied tenfold , and that he can easily overcome even the combined resistance of five or six spectators . ' ' The " bust of Socrates " was another favorite experiment with Houdin . In this illusion a living bust with the features of Socrates was suspended in the middle of the stage without visible support . The performer , habited as an Athenian noble . addressed questions to the mutilated philosopher and received replies in stanzas of elegiac verse . The miseen-scene is represented in Fig. 1 . Houdin explains the illu sion as follows : " A , B , C , D , ( Fig. 2 ) represents a section of the stage on which the trick is exhibited . A sheet of silvered glass , G. G , occupying the whole width of the stage , is placed in a diagonal position , extending from the upper part of the stage at the rear , down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five degrees with the floor . In the center of the glass is an opening through which the actor passes his head and shoulders , as shown in the figure . It should be further mentioned that the ceiling and the two sides of the stage are hung with wall-paper of the same pattern , and are brilliantly illuminated , either by means of footlights at C , or by gas-jets placed behind the border A. Such being the condition of things , the effect is as follows : The ceiling A is reflected in the mirror , and its reflection appears to the spectators to be the paper of the wall B. D , which in reality is hidden by the glass .  |p649  " By means of this reflection , of which he is of course unaware , the spectator is led to believe that he sees three sides of the stage ; and there being nothing to suggest to his mind the presence of the glass , is led to believe that the bust is suspended in mid-air , and without any support . " - " Aerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been a favorite trick since Houdin 's time . In the original illusion Houdin had one of his young sons , who was dressed as a page , stand on a small stool . The performer then placed a walking-stick under the extended right arm of the boy , near the elbow , and one under the left arm . First the stool was knocked away and the youthful assistant was suspended in the air , held up only by the two frail sticks , which were in themselves inadequate to support such a weight . Then the left stick was removed , but the boy did not fall . To the astonishment of every one , the youth was placed in a horizontal position . He remained in a perfectly rigid attitude with his head leaning on his arm , the top of the cane under his elbow . This very ingenious trick was suggested to Houdin on reading stories about the alleged levitation of Hindoo fakirs . The walking-stick that supported the right arm of the assistant was of iron , painted to resemble wood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with a bar concealed in the sleeve of the boy . This bar formed part of a strong steel framework worn under the assistant 's clothing . Thus was the page suspended in the air . Houdin 's trick of the " orange-tree " was a capital one . The tree blossomed and bore fruit at the command of the conjurer . All the oranges were distributed among the spectators except one on the topmost branch of the tree . In this orange the magician caused a handkerchief to appear , which had been previously borrowed . The handkerchief was made to vanish from the hands of the performer . " Hey , presto ! " the orange fell apart in four sections , whereupon two butterflies sprang out and fluttered upward with the handkerchief . The explanation of this beautiful trick is as follows : The tree was a clever piece of mechanism , so closely fashioned to resemble a plant that it was impossible to detect the difference . The blossoms , constructed of white silk , were pushed up through the hollow branches by pistons rising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . When these pedals were relaxed the blossoms disappeared , and the fruit was slowly developed . Beal oranges were stuck on iron spikes protruding from the branches of the tree , and were concealed from the spectators by hemispherical wire screens painted green . The screens were also partly hidden by the artificial  |p650  foliage . By means of cords running down through the branches of the tree and off behind the scenes . an assistant caused the screens to make a half-turn. thereby developing the fruit . The burrowed handkerchief was exchanged for a dummy belonging to the conjurer , and passed to an assistant who placed it in the mechanical orange . The tree NY as now brought forward . After the real fruit had been distributed , the magician called attention to the orange on the top ( the mechanical one ) . By means of sleight-of-hand the hand - kerchief was made to vanish , to be discovered in the orange . The butterflies , which were fastened by wires to the stalk and fixed on delicate spiral springs , invisible at . a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord , carrying with them the handkerchief , as soon as the fruit fell apart . IV . The crowning event . of Houdin 's career was his embassy to Algeria to overcome the influence of the Marabout priests over the ignorant , Arabs . The Marabouts. or Mohammedan miracle-workers , were continually fanning the flames of discontent and rebellion against French domination . The French government asked Houdin to go to Algeria and perform before the Arabs in order to show their that a French wizard using only sleight-of-hand and the resources of science . was greater than the Marabouts , who pretended to occult powers and accomplished but simple feats His success was most gratifying . The mission over , he returned to France and settled down at St. Gervais , near Blois. having ceded his theater to his brother-in-law- , M. Hamilton . Ile had amassed a handsome fortune as a magician . In his retirement he was ever at work . Houdin 's magic villa at St. Gervais was full of surprises for visitors . The simple peasantry of the neighborhood regarded the place with awe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of darkness . The villa was called the " Pri ory " by Houdin , but his friends jokingly named it " La Trappe Abbey . " Electrical devices played a prominent part at " Catch ' em Abbey . " Says Manning : ' ' Robert-Houdin 's employment of electricity , not . only as a moving power for the performance of his illusions , but for domestic purposes , was long in advance of his time . The electric bell , so common to us now , was in every-day use for years in his own house . before its value was recognized by the public . " He had a favorite horse , named Fanny. for which he entertained great affection . and christened her ' the friend of the family . ' She was of gentle disposition and was growing old in his service ; so he was anxious to allow her every indulgence , especially punctuality at meals , and full allowance of fodder . Such being the case , it was a matter of great surprise that Fanny grew daily thinner and thinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy for the art formerly practised by her master , and converted her hay into five-franc pieces ! So Houdin dismissed the groom and secured a more holiest lad , but to provide against further contingencies and neglect of duty . he had a clock placed in his study , which with the aid of all electrical wire , worked it food supply in the staple a distance of fifty yards from the house . The distributing apparatus was a square funnelshaped box , which discharged the provender in prearranged quantities . No one could steal the oats from the horse after they had fallen , as the electric trigger could not act unless the stable floor was locked . The lock was outside , and if any one entered before the horse had finished eating his oats , a hell would immediately ring in the louse . " This same clock in his study also transmitted the time to two large clock-faces , placed one on the foot of the house , the other on the gardener 's lodge , the former for the benefit of the villagers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to lift the hammer at the proper moment . The daily winding of the clock was performed automatically by communication with a swingdoor in his kitchen , and the winding-up apparatus of the clock in the clock-tower  |p651  was so arranged that the servants in passing backward and forward on their domestic duties , unconsciously wound up the striking movement of the clock . " The Priory is now a ruin ' Nothing whatever is left of the wonderful work which existed at the time of Houdin 's death . There was some dispute concerning the title of the property , so that no one seems to have inherited it . Owls and bats are now the sole inhabitants of the magic villa . Houdin 's personal appearance is thus described by a writer in Larousse 's " Encyclopedie " : " He was a man of small stature . His manners were exceedingly engaging and and vivacious . His clean-cut profile resembled one of those medallion portraits of the noblesse of the eighteenth century . His face was clean-shaven , showing a large and eloquent mouth . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his ryes up to the last retained the tire and brilliancy of a man of twenty years . " Houdin died June 13 , 1811 , at St. Gervais , his age being sixty-six years . Not a very long life , but one crowded with strange incidents . Not only was Houdin the progenitor of the modern school of conjuring . but he was a man of science and a remarkable mechanical genius , having received several medals from the French government fen his successful application of electricity to the running of clocks . If he had accomplished nothing more during his life than his electrical inventions , his name would have been heralded down to posterity . Besides this , he wrote several books , there by distinguishing himself in the world of letters . Houdin was a master in all that related to the psychology of deception . His treatises on the art of legerdemain are really psychological studies of very great interest to students . Houdin placed sleight-of-hand on a scientific basis , showing that it depended not only upon digital dexterity but upon the careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He laid down the axiom that it is easier to deceive an intelligent person than an ignorant one . This sounds like a paradox . but it is a fact . The ignorant man who witnesses a conjuring exhibition has determined beforehand not to be deceived by the artifices of the performer In the case of educated persons , the conjurer 's appeal to the imagination is eagerly responded to . People who have read about clair-voyance , psychornetry , telepathy , hypnotism , and the like , are ever ready to attribute the feats of the necromancer to anything save mere conjuring ; especially is this the case in mental magic , i.e. , second-sight experiments , et cetera . A magician , said Houdin. should always assign some plausible explanation to all his illusions. other than mere nimbleness of fingers . The public loves to be mystified . He remarks : " Although all one says during the course of a performance , is ? not to mince the matter ? a tissue of falsehoods. the performer must sufficiently enter into the part he plays , to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief on his own part will infallibly carry a like conviction to the minds of the spectators . "
