txt An amicable adjustment of existing differences between the members ' of the Car Repairers ' Association employes of . the New York Central and Superintendent Waitt of the motive power department , who represented the company , was concluded at 6:50 o'clock tonight , after a conference which was nearly continuous from 11 o'clock this morning until that hour . The agreement reached was ratified at a joint meeting of the strikers to-night , so far as it relates to their own grievance The reservation made by the Central men was that they would not return to work until the car repairers on the other lines who struck either in sympathy or 0n independent grievances , shall have arranged with their employers to resume their former positions . The roads on which the repairers , Inspectors , &c.,; have struck out of sympathy for the Central 's men are the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western , Lehigh Valley and Nickel Plate . On the Western New York and Pennsylvania and Erie the men have made demands for an increase of wages . The grievance of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie was only presented to-day shortly ' before the men went out . The men of the Western New York and Pennsylvania struck on Monday . The session between the Joint Executive Committee of the Car Repairers and Superintendent Waitt was a dignified discussion of issues , in which it appears the best of temper prevailed . The railway company , according te'Superintendent Waitt , carried out its declared policy to deal not only justly but liberally with its employes , but strongly emphasized its determination to sustain its officers in the exercise of discretion in the employment of men and the reduction of forces when the demands shall so require . The men claim that the wage question was adjusted substantially according to their demands , which were 22 cents per hour for carpenters and painters , 221/2 cents for machinists , 21 cents for pipe fitters , 20 cents for tinsmiths , 17 cents for blacksmiths , and $65 per month for air brake inspectors . The company , the strikers declare , conceded these rates with the exception of that to the carpenters , who will receive 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents , and the air brake inspectors , who will receive $62.50 per month . At the conclusion of the conference , Superintendent Waitt made a statement touching the points argued during the discussion and the attitude of the company toward its employes . " We have had an all-day session with-out words or feeling , " said . Mr. Waitt . " I met the men on behalf of the company with the idea of frankly going over the entire situation in detail , and prepared to carry out our previously outlined policy . " Superintendent Waitt here quoted from the statement given out in New York on Monday . which was in effect that the New York Central intended not to deal not only justly but liberally with its employes on the subject of wages , and , notwithstanding that it had increased the standard of pay within the past sixty days , it was willing to take up the question of wages . He continued as follows : " That question was taken up , and everything was discussed , and mutual concessions were made , the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being more liberal than that of any company in this part of the country . In some cases the rate of increase over the original pay previous to March 16 being in the vicinity of 40 per cent . in other cakes it is only or 12 per cent . " /t was clearly understood between myself and the committee that the company would always be ready to give a hearing to any . committee of its employes that the men might select on any grievance that may arise . If at such meeting they wish to have an adviser who is not an em . ploye , there will be no objection to that , but the company will deal with its employes directly . " It was also understood that the officers of the company alone must decide as to the men that are employed and the methods that must be used in reducing expenses . That could not be delegated to any outside party . - I think the men will return to work within the next forty-eight hours . " DEPUTIES FIRE A VOLLEY . Sheriff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a deal of strike excitement at Constable Hook , Bayonne , N. J. , yesterday . At the Orford copper works 450 men refused to work the previous night , and yesterday they gathered , bout the yards and stoned the few men who went to work . Sixteen of the Bayonne policemen were called upon to afford protection , and this left the city practically without police . Sheriff Ruempler of Hudson County arrived last night with sixty deputies and relieved the police , a portion of whom had been withdrawn . The strikers had virtual possession of the yards when the deputies came , and they proceeded to stone them . The deputies drew their revolvczs and some of them fired into the air while others covered the strikers with their undischarged weapons . The volley caused the strikers to flee precipitately , and later the workmen within were able to leave the works without molestation . The strike was due to dissatisfaction with the hours of day and night shifts . Day shifts work from nine to ten hours , while the night shifts work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The wages , day and night , are 171/2 cents an hour . The men want the shifts to be of equal length . The officials say that they raised wages 10 per cent . voluntarily the first of the year , and the men quit without any notice . Superintendent Moffett said he was sure matters would be adjusted satisfactorily if the men sent a committee to confer with the officers of the company . About 120 non-unon boilermakers , Slays and Poles , struck at the Standard Oil yards Tuesday . They demand an Increase from $1.50 to $2.50 a day . They also want to join the union . They have engaged ' Recorder Lazarus to represent them and seek satisfactory terms from the company - officials.
