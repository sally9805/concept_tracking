txt Goy . Odell , in a spirited and loudly applauded speech last night at the sixth annual dinner of the Twenty-seventh Assembly District Republican Club , held in the Concert Hall of Madison Square Garden , declared himself openly and forcibly for Theodore Roosevelt as the next President of the United States , and called upon Republicans in every part of the country to assist in nominating and electing him . The Governor also presented his views on home rule for this city , and told of the present situation as regards the Civil Service law , franchises , and excise . He had , he said , been surprised to find how perfectly the State constitution and the laws permit home rule in every locality throughout the State . There were between 500 and GOO people assembled in the hall , including Aldermen , . Assemblymen , Assembly District leaders , Judges , and other men conspicuous in politics in the city and State . At one and of the hail were banked four long tables , at which twenty covers were laid for the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these tables were the speakers . On the right of George W. Wickersham , President of the club , sat the Governor , while on President Wickersham 's left was Amos Parker Wilder of Wisconsin . Others at this table were President Cromwell of the Borough of Richmond , Immigration Commissioner Williams , State Senator Elsberg , Assemblymen Perham , J. H. Adams , Bostwick , Willis A. Reeve , Ezra P. Prentice . and George Agnew . Charles H. Murray , President of the Republican County Committee , and M. Linn Bruce . THE GOVERNOR INTRODUCED . In introducing Gov . Odell , President Wickersham said that the club believed in the continuance of the Republican Party in power . The Republican Party , he declared , was the true democracy . " New problems . " he added , " have arisen since 1901 , which President could not foresee . and to their solution President Roosevelt has brought an honesty of judgment , fearlessness of action , and singleness of purpose which demand the respect of every true American We believe that the Republican Party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great projects formulated under President and continued under President Roosevelt . and that no mistake will be made if President Roosevelt is kept in office . " . In prefacing his speech , GOV . Odell. whose toast was " The State Executive . " said that never before had he been called on to re &pond; to a toast of that character , and that if he were to follow his own Inclinations he , might " trespass on the field of egotists . " He suspected . he said , that the subject assignest to him had been selected more be- ; cause or the-office he filled than for any I other reason . In looking tor some striking utterances of 1 former Governors that he might know what to say , he said he had been able to find ( nly two of sach utterances which had en- I ( lured . One is that which he had been in the habit of hearing at Democratic gatherings . " I am a Democrat . ' and the other was the speech of the Governor of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Governor is supposed to govern . " he continued . " I know that it is the general I impression that his power is vast and with- I out limit , but those who study the history , of the Empire State will readily understand that this is not the fact . I have known of I instances where even the Governor 's identity is unknown . " Coming down on the car to-day one of the distinguished members of the Assembly i had the effrontery to tell me of a joke . He thought it was a joke , which had been played upon me in the Fort Orange Club in I Albany . There was a kind reader there , a I man that you would write something for on a paper and put your fingers on his I temple and press for the letters and he ; would tell you the name that you were thinking . of . so they wrote my name and he pressed and pressed and pressed , and finally the man said I do n't know this man . he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not dead he said , well he is no 1 good any way . Laughter . " The Governor is charged with grave duties . responsibility . however , much beyond i the ken of his constituency . Upon him devolves the execution of the taw , and when we read the papers of this great metropolitan district I am sometimes led to believe 1 that there has been great unfairhess shown I by the State of New York to the greatest municipality upon this continent . You all know perhaps by reading the history of our State . though a great many of you may ! not know from actual experience , yet that it is a fact that there are men to-day who I serve in the Legislature of this State that ; absolutely fix the tax rate of the City of New York , without any voice from the peopie of the City of New York . " We bear that the franchises of the ; City of New York have been dissipated , and yet when we study the history and study the methods that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cityof New York are alone responsible and not the Legislature and the so-called up-State man . Applause . " We have given to you power to manage your own finance . We have given you power to grant franchises and to exact adequate compensation therefor . We have given you control over your streets . and by the charter which was adopted three years ago we have enabled you to absolutely fix the compensation and the wages and the hours of labor of your employes . So that you see in every direction the State is gradually surrendering the powers over the municipalities , and that more and more upon you must rest the responsibility . HOME RULE AGITATION . . " There has been a recent agitation for more power by the localities , and the Legislature is besought for a surrender , a full surrender , of all the power they now posseas in this direction . This agitation has brought forth a bill of particulars , princi- I pally from the enemy ; and I have been I somewhat surprised as well as gratified to j @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of the State have per- 1 mitted home rule in every locality throughout the State . The bill , which was present- I ed by a distinguished Senator from the Borough of Manhattan . sets forth in full and in detail everything that is asked for by the Democratic Party in order that they may have full sway and full power over the affairs of this great municipality . And what are they ? " In the first place , they demand that there shall be no supervision of the civil I service list by the State Board of Civil Service Commissioners . In the second place , they demand that there shall be a surrender by the State of all authority and // GOY . ODELL DECLARES ? FOR ' MB-. - ROOSEYELT // all power over excise matters within the City of New York , and within other municipalities ; both as to the rate of compensation , the'hours the days upon which liquor shall be sold . They ask that there shalt be a full surrender of all the franchise privileges , which they claim are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be a withdrawal or rather a. repeal of . the metropolitan election law . " And in addition to that , that there'sliall be no bill passed over the Mayor 's veto except by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature . This Is necessary in order to guard those privileges which they ask . We must recollect that there is no law which governs the City of New York upon these matters which does not govern equally and with the same force every other community in the State . " I ask you to stop and consider a moment what would become of the civil service laws which were placed upon the statute books largely through the efforts and instrumentality of our President , Theodore Roosevelt , applause , if we were to sur , render to Tammany Hall all the power in the selection in both the competitive and non-competitive classes of the- civil service list of the city . " I ask you what would become of the indegrity Of the ballot if we were to surrender to the City of New York under its present regime allthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , the conditions are different here from what they are in other sections of the State . There have been well-substantiated charges of fraud against the integrity of the ballot , and if there is in any other community of the State where the same condition exists it would be the duty of the State Government to furnish such protection as has been furnished . here . " These are State matters , because the integrity of the civil service laws depends upon an honest administration and not in rewarding followers simply because they can produce- votes . And the honesty of our elections is safeguarded simply because we have in this great metropolitan district non-partisan boards to manage and govern elections that occur in this great city . Applause.y " They are not city matters , they are State matters . The 165,000 or 265,0 ( k , or whatever we may be privileged to secure here in Republican votes , we demand shall be honestly counted , simply because upon that fair count may depend the result of not only the election within our great Commonwealth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Applause . There is one matters however , which we should take into consideration , and we are foolish to blind our eyes to the situation . That is the question of excise . It is claimed that by taking away from the City of New York the revenues which are paid for licenses we deplete your Treasury . Those who make that statement are , not well informed , because the records will show that under the law which Tammany Hall now seeks to have re-enacted , the City of New York received nearly $4,000,000 less than it does to-day , and that there are 2,200 fewer , saloons in the City of New York than there were under the old regime . " When possibly I make mention of that you may see that we are endeavoring to curb and to govern these powers which are I granted by the State for the- sale of liquor . This is a question which I trust will be settled before the present Legislature adjourns . " Whether it will be settled to the liking of Tammany Hall or not I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of every community in the State it should be the aim and object of the Republican Legislature to secure such legislation in the interest of morality , in the interest of good government , and in the interest of the City of I New York . Applause and cheers . PLEA FOR ROOSEVELT . " We are approaching a great National contest ; we all recollect the terrible catastrophe and the terrible condition of affairs which followed the assassin 's bullet at Buffalo . We remember the manful , American , inspiring words which were uttered by President Roosevelt when he assumed those arduous duties . We all : felt that it was our duty , not only as good Republicans , but as citizens ' of this Republic , to aid him in every way that it was possible for us to do . 1:7rom all over this great country there have &time; demands for his nomination . Applause .

Loud and prolonged applause . He may have made mistakes . Every man does . But when he discovers them no one is quicker to rectify them than the man who now occupies the White House . " We owe it to him , therefore , in every election district in this city and this State to begin now to organize for victory , to show by our own actions that we disbelieve many of these things which are charged against him by selfish interests , to prove to the people by our own acts and by our own efforts that we shave confidence in him and believe that in his re-election our country will pass through another four years of safety . Applause . " Let us then here to-night resolve to do our part . Let us resolve to uphold the standard of Republicanism , and to use every effort for his renomination and for his re-election , and to bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it'has been our good fortune to secure in Presidential contests for a great number of years . " I thank you for the privilege of meeting with you to-night . It is always a pleasure to meet sterling Republicans . I sometimes look forward like a boy hoping for his vacation days to the time when I can take my place again in the ranks and be one of the workers . I can promise you that wherever you go I will follow and do everything in my power to aid in the solution of a glorious victory next November . Prolonged applause . Amos Parker Wilder responded to the toast , " The Republican Party and the Plain People , " and after referring to conditions , politically and socially , as he had found them in the West , said in part : " We are the spiritual sons of Garrison and of Charles Sumner . of Lincoln , Grant . Garfield , Harrison , .

" In this new era when the dollar which the Republican Party has made so plentiful , and which lurks behind every issue in every convention , demands of us when wrong tempts and threatens us , God grant that we may be men . When age covers over us the mantle of years and our locks are as white as the snow , when the paths for justice and dignity and freedom are regained that you and I may say as Zach Chandler was wont to say when treason and disunion threatened , his eye flashing , towering in his strength , ' I was there .

To-day what do we seeS  --  the machinery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of newspapers which have done more to lower the American tone than any other agency . Applause . The speaker denounced Bryan , who , he said , had been forced to go abroad in order to procure material with which to carry on his political warfare in America . THE PRESIDENT 'S LETTER . The following letter was read from President Roosevelt : I beg to extend to you my warm regards to the members of your club . The Twenty-seventh Assembly District includes within its borders most of- what made the district which for three years I represented In the New York Legislature . Naturally , I take a peculiar interest in its fortunes . It is upon the efforts of such men as those who make up your association that we must largely depend in the effort to achieve good government . I know many of your number well . I believe in you . I am genuinely sorry that I can not be with you at the dinner . and I extend to you my heartiest good wishes for your success in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , " and said that " the very threat of a Democratic victory this Fall would be enough to destroy the confidence of tile people , upon which all prosneritv res .. There may be combinations of capital , he said , that are opposed to the poosit. election of Theodore Roosevelt . but they think too much of their checkbooks , too much of their dividends and undigested securities to take the chance of financial depression and commercial disaster in this country . The last speaker of the evening was Senator Elsberg , who , in speaking on the subject of " The State Legislature , " voiced the sentiment expressed by those preceding him . It was noticeable that Alexander T. Mason was among the district leaders present , as leader of the Twenty-fifth Assembly District in preference to Alderman Franklin B. Ware , the disputed leader , Mr. Mason 's leadership thus being recognized .
