Living room in the house of Philip Phillimore . Five P. M. of an afternoon of May . The general air and appearance of the room is that of an old-fashioned , decorous , comfortable interior . There are no electric lights and no electric bells . Two bell ropes as in old-fashioned houses . The room is in dark tones inclining to sombre and of old-fashioned elegance . ( At rise , discovered Miss Heneage , Mrs. Phillimore and Thomas . Miss Heneage is a solidly built , narrow-minded woman in her sixties . She makes no effort to look younger than she is , and is expensively but quietly dressed , with heavy elegance . She commands her household and her family connection , and on the strength of a large and steady income feels that her opinion has its value . Mrs. Phillimore is a semi-professional invalid , refined and unintelligent . Her movements are weak and fatigued . Her voice is habitually plaintive and she is entirely a lady without a trace of being a woman of fashion . Thomas is an easy-mannered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appearance . He has no deportment worthy of being so called , and takes an evident interest in the affairs of the family he serves . Miss Heneage , seated at the tea-table , faces footlights .

Large old-fashioned tea urn . Guard for flame . " Evening Post " on tea-table . Miss Heneage and Mrs. Phillimore both have cups of tea . Miss Heneage sits up very straight , and pours tea for Grace , who enters from door L. She is a pretty and fashionably dressed girl of twenty . She speaks superciliously , coolly , and not too fast . She sits on the sofa , L. , and does not lounge . She wears a gown suitable for spring visiting , hat , parasol , gloves , etc . GRACE Crosses and sitsI never in my life walked so far and found so few people at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth of May is ridiculously late to be in town . Pause .

THOMAS Same business . Pointing to " Evening Post " on tea-tableThe Post , ma'am . MISS HENEAGE Indicates cupMiss Phillimore . Thomas takes cup of tea to Grace . Silence . They all sip tea . Thomas goes back , fills sherry glass , remaining round and about the tea-table . They all drink tea during the following scene GRACE The Dudleys were at home . They wished to know when my brother Philip was to be married , and where and how ? MISS HENEAGE If the Dudleys were persons of breeding , they 'd not intrude their curiosity upon you . GRACE I like Lena Dudley . MRS . PHILLIMORE Speaks slowly and gentlyDo I know Miss Dudley ? GRACE She knows Philip . She expects an announcement of the wedding . MRS . PHILLIMORE I trust you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all of the opinion that those who have been divorced should remarry with modesty and without parade . p. 4 GRACE I told the Dudleys Philip 's wedding was here , to-morrow . Thomas at back of table ready to be of use MISS HENEAGE To Mrs. Phillimore , picking up a sheet of paper which has lain on the table I have spent the afternoon , Mary , in arranging and listing the wedding gifts , and in writing out the announcements of the wedding . I think I have attained a proper form of announcement . She takes the sheet of note paper and gives it to ThomasOf course , the announcement Philip himself made was quite out of the question . Grace smilesHowever , there is mine . Points to paper . Thomas gives list to Mrs. Phillimore and moves up stage GRACE I hope you 'll send an announcement to the Dudleys . MRS . PHILLIMORE Reads plaintively , ready to make the best of things " Mr. Philip Phillimore and Mrs. Cynthia Dean Karslake announce their marriage , May twentieth , at three o'clock , Nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on Thomas 's salverIt sounds very nice . Thomas hands paper to Miss Heneage MISS HENEAGE Thomas up stageIn my opinion it barely escapes sounding nasty . However , it is correct . The only remaining question is - to whom the announcement should not be sent . Exit ThomasI consider an announcement of the wedding of two divorced persons to be in the nature of an intimate communication . It not only announces the wedding  --  it also announces the divorce . She returns to her teacupThe person I shall ask counsel of is cousin William Sudley . He promised to drop in this afternoon . p. 5 GRACE Oh ; We shall hear all about Cairo . MRS . PHILLIMORE William is judicious . Reenter Thomas MISS HENEAGE With finalityCousin William will disapprove of the match unless a winter in Cairo has altered his moral tone . THOMAS AnnouncesMr .

GRACE Comes to himDear Cousin William ! MISS HENEAGE Was n't it warm in Cairo when you left ? She will have the strict truth , or nothing ; still , on account of Sudley 's impeccable respectability , she treats him with more than usual leniency p. 6 SUDLEY Sits L.We left Cairo six weeks ago , Grace , so I 've had no news since you wrote in February that Philip was engaged . PauseI need not to say I consider Philip 's engagement excessively regrettable . He is a judge upon the Supreme Court bench with a divorced wife  --  and such a divorced wife ! GRACE Oh , but Philip has succeeded in keeping everything as quiet as possible . SUDLEY AcidlyNo , my dear ! He has not succeeded in keeping his former wife as quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week when who should turn up but Vida Phillimore . She went everywhere and did everything no woman should !

She 'll be down in a minute . SUDLEY ShockedYou do n't mean to tell me  --  ?  --  ! To armchair , L. MISS HENEAGE Yes , William , Cynthia is Mrs. Karslake  --  Mrs. Karslake has no New York house . I disliked the publicity of a hotel in the circumstances , and accordingly when she became engaged to Philip , I invited her here . SUDLEY Suspicious and distrustfulAnd may I ask who Mrs. Karslake is ? p. 8 MISS HENEAGE With confidenceShe was a Deane . SUDLEY Crosses up back of table R. , sorry to be obliged to concede good birth to any but his own bloodOh , oh  --  well the Deanes are extremely nice people . Goes to tableWas her father J.

Surely he left a very considerable  --  MISS HENEAGE Oh , fifteen or twenty millions . SUDLEY Determined not to be dazzledIf I remember rightly she was brought up abroad . MISS HENEAGE In France and England  --  and I fancy brought up with a very gay set in very gay places . In fact she is what is called a " sporty " woman . SUDLEY Always ready to think the worstWe might put up with that . But you do n't mean to tell me Philip has the  --  the  --  the  --  assurance to marry a woman who has been divorced by  --  MISS HENEAGE Not at all . Cynthia Karslake divorced her husband . p. 9 SUDLEY Gloomily , since he has less fault to find than he expectedShe divorced him ! Ah ! Sips his tea MISS HENEAGE The suit went by default . And , my dear William , there are many palliating circumstances . Cynthia was married to Karslake only seven months . There are no  --  glances at Graceno hostages to Fortune ! Ahem ! SUDLEY Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is she ? Goes to C. GRACE With the superiority of one who is not too popularMen admire her . MISS HENEAGE She 's not conventional . MRS .

MISS HENEAGE Yes , Mary  --  but I sometimes suspect that she exercises a degree of self-control  --  SUDLEY Glad to have something against some oneShe claps on the lid , eh ? And you think that perhaps some day she 'll boil over ? Well , of course fifteen or twenty millions  --  but who 's Karslake ? p. 10 GRACE Very superciliouslyHe owns Cynthia K. She 's the famous mare . MISS HENEAGE He 's Henry Karslake 's son . SUDLEY Beginning to make the best of fifteen millions-in-lawOh !  --  Henry !  --  Very respectable family .

SUDLEY Bored , and his respectability to the front when he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear Sarah , a respectable family with some means . We must accept her . But on the whole , I think it will be best for me not to see the young woman . My disapprobation would make itself apparent . GRACE Whispering to SudleyCynthia 's coming He does n't hear . Enter Cynthia , absorbed in reading a newspaper . She is a young creature in her twenties , small and high-bred , full of the love of excitement and sport . Her manner is wide awake and keen and she is evidently in no fear of the opinion of others . Her dress is exceedingly elegant , but with the elegance of a woman whose chief interests lie in life out of doors . There is nothing horsey in her style , and her expression is youthful and ingenuous p. 11 SUDLEY Sententious and determinately epigrammaticThe uncouth modern young woman , eight feet high , with a skin like a rhinoceros and manners like a cave dweller  --  an habitu of the race-track and the divorce court  --  GRACE Aside to SudleyCousin William !

SUDLEY My dear Mrs. Karslake , I think it might be wiser  --  CYNTHIA Still with cordial good temperOh , but you must come ! I mean to be a perfect wife to Philip and all his relations ! That sounds rather miscellaneous , but you know what I mean . SUDLEY Very sententiousI am afraid  --  CYNTHIA Gay and still covering her embarrassmentIf you do n't come , it 'll look as if you were not standing by Philip when he 's in trouble ! You 'll come , wo n't you  --  but of course you will . SUDLEY After a self-important pause I will come , Mrs. Karslake . PauseGood-afternoon . In a tone of sorrow and compassionGoodbye , Mary .

PHILIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILFRID There you are ! JOHN Pretending easeOh , call it friendship  --  Thomas exits , L. PHILIP Puts bouquet on table . IronicallyI suppose Mrs. Karslake  --  JOHN She wagered me I would n't give her away , and of course  --  Throughout this scene John hides the emotions he will not show behind a daring irony .

Why should n't I give the lady away ? SIR WILFRID Hear ! Hear ! Oh , I beg your pardon ! JOHN And why should n't we both be here ? American marriage is a new thing . We 've got to strike the pace , and the only trouble is , Judge , that the judiciary have so messed the thing up that a man ca n't be sure he is married until he 's divorced .

Sir , you can not trifle with monogamy ! JOHN Now , now , Judge , monogamy is just as extinct as knee-breeches .

Our idea is one woman , a hundred husbands and one child . PHILIP Sir , this polyandry . JOHN Polyandry ? A hundred to one it 's polyandry ; and that 's it , Judge ! Uncle Sam has established consecutive polyandry ,  --  but there 's got to be an interval between husbands ! The fact is , Judge , the modern American marriage is like a wire fence .

Cynthia recoils and looks away . Her own feelings are revealed to her clearly for the first timeI begin to understand our American women now . Fire-flies  --  and the fire they gleam with is so cold that a midge could n't warm his heart at it , let alone a man . You 're not of the same race as a man !

There are three very low easy-chairs . The general appearance of the room is extremely gay and garish in color . It has the easy confusion of a man 's room . A small table R. On this table is a woman 's sewing-basket . The sewing-basket is open . A piece of rich fancy work lies on the table , as if a lady had just risen from sewing . On the corner are a lady 's gloves .

SIR WILFRID In an aside to Vida , as they move right to appear to be out of Nogam 's hearingDeucedly odd , ye know  --  for the Reverend Matthew declared she left Phillimore 's house before he did ,  --  and she told them she was coming here ! Nogam evidently takes this in p. 147 VIDA Oh , she 'll turn up . SIR WILFRID Yes , but I do n't see how the Reverend Phillimore had the time to get here and make us man and wife , do n't y ' know  --  VIDA Oh , Matthew had a fast horse and Cynthia a slow one  --  or she 's a woman and changed her mind ! Perhaps she 's gone back and married Phillimore .

She comes down with key to the work-tableIf I 'm too late , I 'm too late ! and that 's the end of it ! She lays key on table L. ; remains standing near itI 've come , and now I 'll go ! Long pause .

FIDDLER No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYNTHIA Same business ; absent-mindedlyHorses  --  how are the horses ?

Oh , yes , ma'am , we 're all changed since you give us the go-by ,  --  even the guv'nor . CYNTHIA L. C.How 's he changed ? FIDDLER Lost his sharp for horses , and ladies , ma'am  --  gives ' em both the boiled eye . CYNTHIA L. C. down I ca n't say I see any change ; there 's my portrait  --  I suppose he sits and pulls faces at me . FIDDLER Yes , ma'am , I think I 'd better tell him of your bein ' here .

CYNTHIA Against orders ? FIDDLER You kicked it over , ma'am , the day you left us . CYNTHIA No wonder he hates me with the chair in that state ! He nurses his wrath to keep it warm . So , after all , Fiddler , everything is changed , and that chair is the proof of it . I suppose Cynthia K is the only thing in the world that cares a whinney whether I 'm alive or dead . She breaks down and sobsHow is she , Fiddler ? FIDDLER Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her oats ! Well , she loves me , so I suppose she will die , or change , or  --  or something .

VIDA Oh , Cynthia , I 've just been through it again , and I feel as if I were eighteen . There 's no use talking about it , my dear , with a woman it 's never the second time ! And how nice you were , Jack ,  --  he never even laughed at us ! Enter Sir Wilfrid , with hat and cane . Vida kisses JohnThat 's the wages of virtue !

But I know that you imagined I was . Pause CYNTHIA I suppose you think a woman has no right to divorce a man  --  and still continue to feel a keen interest in his affairs ? JOHN Well , I 'm not so sure about that , but I do n't quite see how  --  CYNTHIA A woman can be divorced  --  and still  --  John assents ; she hides her embarrassmentWell , my dear Karslake , you 've a long life before you , in which to learn how such a state of mind is possible ! So I wo n't stop to explain . Will you be kind enough to get me a cab ? She moves to the door p. 159 JOHN Certainly . I was going to say I am not surprised at your feeling an interest in me . I 'm only astonished that , having actually married Phillimore , you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pause JOHN I left you on the brink  --  made me feel a little uncertain .

He places the armchair more comfortably for herThis is a more comfortable chair ! p. 160 CYNTHIA ShamefacedlyYou never liked me to sit in that one ! JOHN Oh , well  --  it 's different now .

John smokes pipe and remains seated CYNTHIA Suddenly and quicklyIt 's just simply a fact , Karslake , and that 's all there is to it  --  if a woman has once been married  --  that is , the first man she marries  --  then  --  she may quarrel , she may hate him  --  she may despise him  --  but she 'll always be jealous of him with other women . Always ! John takes this as if he were simply glad to have the information JOHN Oh  --  Hm ! ah  --  yes  --  yes . A pause CYNTHIA You probably felt jealous of Phillimore. p. 161 JOHN Reasonably , sweetly , and in doubtN-o ! ApologeticallyI felt simply : Let him take his medicine . CYNTHIA Oh !

It 's the entire situation . Suppose by any chance I do n't marry Phillimore ! And suppose I were seen at two or three in the morning leaving my former husband 's house ! It 's all wrong . I have no business to be here ! I 'm going ! You 're perfectly horrid to me , you know  --  and  --  the whole place  --  it 's so familiar , and so  --  so associated with  --  with  --  JOHN Discord and misery  --  I know  --  CYNTHIA Not at all with discord and misery ! With harmony and happiness  --  with  --  with first love , and infinite hope  --  and  --  and  --  Jack Karslake ,  --  if you do n't set that chair on its legs , I think I 'll explode .

Time 's passed since you and I were together  --  and  --  eh  --  CYNTHIA And you 've forgotten what a vile temper I had ! JOHN ReflectivelyWell , you did kick the stuffing out of the matrimonial buggy  --  CYNTHIA Pointedly but with good temperIt was n't a buggy ; it was a break cart  --  She stands back of the armchairIt 's all very well to blame me ! But when you married me , I 'd never had a bit in my mouth ! JOHN Well , I guess I had a pretty hard hand . Do you remember the time you threw both your slippers out of the window ? CYNTHIA Yes , and do you remember the time you took my fan from me by force ? JOHN After you slapped my face with it ! CYNTHIA Oh , Oh ! I hardly touched your face ! And do you remember the day you held my wrists ? JOHN You were going to bite me ! CYNTHIA Jack ! I never ! I showed my teeth at you ! And I said I would bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break your word !

I 'll make it a commandment : thou shalt not Cyn ! ! Cynthia laughs and wipes her eyes CYNTHIA How can you , Jack ? How can you ? JOHN Well , hang it , my dear child , I  --  I 'm sorry , but you know I always got foolish with you . Your laugh 'd make a horse laugh . Why , do n't you remember that morning in the park before breakfast  --  when you laughed so hard your horse ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Both laugh . The door opens , R.
