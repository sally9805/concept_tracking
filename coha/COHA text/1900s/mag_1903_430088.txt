THE results of archaeological investigations are rarely brought to the attention of those who take only a general interest in the subject , except when some more remarkable discovery justifies the prominent headlines of the daily paper . The narrative of steady progress or the resume of the various achievements in this field is generally assigned to the periodi cal of the specialist , and remains his possession alone . Because of the unusual importance of the results of the excavations in the Roman Forum during the last five years , there is reason for a review of what has been accomplished , adapted to the needs of the general reader . The excavations in Italy are conducted under the direction of the Government , and the discoveries are jealously guarded in the interests of Italian scholars . This governmental control often works to the dis advantage of archaeological study , because of the appointment of men of little energy or scientific accuracy . That great results have followed the work in the Roman Forum is due , therefore , in no small degree to Signor Giacomo Boni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn of 1898 attention had been directed to the various fragments of an archi tectural character which were scattered throughout the Forum area without assignment to the original structures . The Minister of Public Instruction appointed a commission consisting of Signor Boni , Signori Gatti and Lanciani , and Professor Huelsen , whose duty it was to under- ' take the restoration of those monuments , the relative completeness of whose remains justified such an undertaking . This commission , for tunately composed of men of scholarly judgment , determined upon a most thorough investigation , resolving to make excavations , if it was necessary , even to the lowest stratum . Little did these scholars realize the results of this praiseworthy determination . In November , 1898 , two of the seven colossal pillars which had adorned the north side of the Sacra Via opposite the Basilica Julia had been replaced on their bases , and the shrine at the entrance of the House of the Vestals was restored . What proved to be of greater importance was the digging of " tasti , " or experimental trenches , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1899 , the now famous " lapis niger " was found , which many at once accepted as the stone tradition had described as marking the tomb of Romulus . This discovery was a great incentive to further excavations . Money was provided by the state , and even private individuals contributed toward the purchase of houses which blocked the path of the excavator . In the spring of 1900 , a shrine and stele with archaic inscription were discovered under the " lapis niger " ; and in the summer months the ascent of the Sacra Via , that portion in front of the Basilica of Constantine , and a part of the Basilica AEmilia , were cleared . Finally , it was proposed to yield to the archaeologist the modern street , along which ran an electric tramway . In the enthusiasm of the time this was done , and excavations uncovered the area of the Comitium and the western portion of the Basilica AEmilia . The early months of 1900 witnessed the purchase and demolition of the Church of Santa Maria Liberatrice , which stood in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There the shrine of Juturna and the Basilica of Santa Maria Antiqua of the eighth century of our era were brought into view . In the fall of 1900 and in the spring of 1901 , excavations were made at the rear of the Temple of Castor near the Rostra and the House of the Vestals , and in the latter part of 1901 " tasti " were dug in the Sacra Via from the Arch of Titus to the entrance of the Palace of the Csars . In 1902 , near the Church of SS . Cosma and Damiano , remains of private houses of republican days , and near the southeast corner of the Temple of Faustina graves of a very archaic period , were found . The Temple of Divus Augustus to the south of the Temple of Castor received considerable attention during last year and is even now in the hands of the excavators . This is a summary of the operations of the last five years . It will be useful for us now to consider more in detail some of the most important of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the southwest of the Arch of Septimius Severus , there are remains of three structures of which we have obtained most valuable information . The location of the Arch of Tiberius has been finally determined as near to the Rostra and close to the street which led upward from the Forum to the Capitol . It was an arch with a single gateway , which must have been on a slope , as the rear of the arch abutted on the street . Near the foundations of the arch is a pavement of white marble , evidently belonging to a room of the shape of a trapezoid . The wall of this room was pierced by a doorway leading by steps to the Capitoline street , and a bench ran along the rear and side walls . Professor Huelsen has conjectured that this little building was the so-called Schola Xantha , the local office of subordinates associated with the Curule AEdiles . In the rear were eight low arches of tufa reticulate work , which Signor Boni supposed to be the Rostra , finding certain resemblances to the representation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Huelsen , who regards these arches as a part of the viaduct of the Capitoline street , which was widened on the Forum side by Munatius Plancus , in 42 B.C. , in connection with the restoration of the Temple of Saturn . Nevertheless there are remains here of the Rostra , but further to the east , and marked by a brick wall which limits in the rear the pavement of a sort of hall . The bricks of this pavement are marked with a stamp of the days of Severus and Caracalla . From such facts as these , Professor Huelsen outlines the history of the Rostra as follows : Soon after 42 B.C. it was moved to the western end of the Forum , and thus shut in the arches forming the substructure of theCapitoline street . In the time of Septimius Severus , when the arch was built , the entire north side of the Rostra was rebuilt ; the Umbilicus Urbis Roma , i.e. , the central point of the city , was erected as the counterpart of the older Milliarium Aureum , the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined by a semicircular structure , originally supposed to be the Graecostasis or platform for foreign ambassadors , on which stood a colonnade serving as the ornamental background of the Rostra . In the fifth century the front of the Rostra was extended on the north by the addition of another structure . The prefect of the city , Julius Valentinus , replaced the earlier cornice of the facade by a row of marble blocks with an honorary inscription , probably referring to the Augusti Leo and Anthemius . In the area directly in front of the Arch of Severus , or , as we may say , in a portion of the Comitium which extended before the Curia ( the Church of S. Adriano ) were found the " lapis niger , " and beneath it the grave of Romulus and the archaic stele . A slightly raised surface of white marble had been noticed for many years alongside of the paved street which in the Middle Ages led up to the middle gateway of the arch . Beneath this white marble there was discovered a rectangular area covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been injured greatly by fire and by rough treatment . This area , twelve feet by nine , had the same orientation as the Curia , a fact which proves that it did not exist before the extensive alteration in the Forum and Comitium of the days of Ceesar and Augustus . Beneath this black marble were two platforms parallel to one another , at a distance of a little over three feet . These , being joined in front and rear by a layer of tufa blocks , formed a cavity in which was a single block of the same stone . ) n the platform to the west rested a pedestal moulded in a very archaic form , and on that to the east a portion of a similar pedestal . In the rear of these pedestals was a symmetrical platform of tufa . The objects which once rested on these pedestals were carried away in ancient times . To the west of the pedestals there were found a stump of a pillar and a pyramidal-shaped stele of brown tufa engraved with an archaic inscription . The entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of victims , pieces of pottery , also a Chalcidian potsherd with Vulcan on a donkey , and a terra-cotta relief with a warrior on a horse , both dating probably in the sixth or seventh century n.c. , besides little articles of bone and terra cotta and pieces of bronze utensils . When this pavement was discovered , scholars immediately recalled statements of Roman grammarians ( e.g. , Festus ) which can be traced to the learned Varro of the Ciceronian period , mentioning a black stone in the Comitium near the Rostra , which , with two lions , marks the place where the founder of the city was buried . Because this shrine beneath the stone has the same orientation as the Forum , and not that of the Comitium and Curia , which are built on east and west lines , there is great probability that these discoveries have some connection with the monument described by Dionysius and Festus , although the presentday conditions both of the upper and lower part may not be the same as those of their day . Professor Huelsen has propounded three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone originally appear ? Again , when was it destroyed ? Finally , to what period does the black pavement belong ? 1 . Scholars are generally agreed that the platforms held the two lions . It is possible that the black stone was a horizontal tablet formed of one or several slabs of marble or a baetylus of basalt placed in an upright position between the two platforms . The platform behind the lions may have held the black stone , and may have represented the grave of Romulus which the lions thus guarded . The inscription on the stele is certainly very archaic , both in the forms of the letters and in the words . The letters are similar to those found in the earliest Latin inscription , that on the Praenestine brooch , which has been dated in the sixth century , so that this inscription may be considered at least as early , if not earlier . Unfortunately , the words do not make any corntern were found sixty-eight styli of bone , and the remains of an oak writing tablet . Here also was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustan age " ( r ) EGIA . " On the southwest corner of the building was an architrave with this inscription in large fine letters : " ( Kalat ) ORES PONTIFICUM ET FLAMINUM , " which is similar to one found in the same place in 1546 : " In honorem domus Augusta ; kalatores pontificum et flaminum . " ' The attendants of the pontiffs and flamers set this up in honor of the house of Augustus . ) The architrave covered the entrance to the meeting hall of the " kalatores pontificum , " or attendants of the priests , which must have been located near by . One of the most interesting discoveries followed the demolition of the Church of S. Maria Liberatrice . It had long been known that in this locality was the Fountain of Juturna ( lacus Iuturna ) , where the Dioscuri were said to have watered their horses ; and this was one of the main objects of search . It was also believed that in the garden of the church some old Christian wall paintings might be found . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juturna was a triangle between the east side of the Temple of Castor and the steps which led from the Temple of Vesta to the northern corner of the Palatine . Here was the fountain of Juturna , here the " puteal , " or well curb , and the chapel and rooms and halls to the east and north of the fountain which once formed part of the shrine . The " lacus " or pool is a basin seven feet deep , which is supplied by two springs . In the middle of it is a pedestal of tufa reticulate work nearly six feet high . A beautiful marble altar was found therein , on the side of which are carved figures of Jupiter with a sceptre and lightning , of Leda with her swans , and of the Dioscuri . Here were also found fragments of marble statues , in life size , of the Dioscuri with their horses , Greek work of the fifth century with later restoration , a life-sized head of Juppiter Serapis , many fragments of marble reliefs and inscriptions , and also pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the springs many centuries after the shrine was neglected . To the south of the lacus were found a puteal or well curb with a shrine for the image of the divinity . The well curb bore the inscription : " M. Barbatius Pollio aed(ilis) cur(ulis) , Iuturnae sacrum , " repeated on the front with " res(tituit) puteal Marcus . " ( Marcus Barbatius Pollio , curule aedile , has rebuilt this puteal , which is sacred to Juturna . ) This Barbatius is the partisan of Antony mentioned in Cicero 's Philippics . ' In front of the puteal were found a marble pedestal and altar with sculpture of the second or third century , figures representing a man and woman , perhaps Juturna and Turnus . The epistyle of the little shrine was engraved with the inscription : " Iuturnte s(acrum) . " In a third group of rooms between the fountain and the Palatine were found just in front of a niche a statue of AEsculapius , with that of a boy attendant holding a cock for sacrifice , also a headless figure of Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for the reception of those seeking health , hut in the fourth century they were occupied by officials , " cura tores aquarum , " of the bureau of water supply , " statio aquarum . " One of the most important inscriptions declares that the curator Elavius Miesius Egnatius Lollianus and his colleagues dedicated a pedestal and a statue on March 1 , 328 . Behind the Temple of Castor is a street which runs in front of a portico of pillars of brickwork . At the east end is an entrance to a building of monumental size . Through a large door we enter into an enclosure , the right and left sides of which show niches of colossal size . On the left a large door opens into a corridor and so leads to the Clivus Victoria ; and the Palace of Tiberius . At the further end is a broad doorway with side passages leading into a sort of hall , resembling the atrium of a Roman house , in which four rectangular walls of brickwork and four granite pillars with marble capitals separate the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure and turning to the right , we pass through a small doorway into a large building known in the Renaissance as the Curia Hostilia , but now designated by Lanciani , and probably correctly , the Temple of the Deified Augustus . This hypothe sis is supported by the inscriptions on the bricks , which show ' a period at the close of the first century A.D. We know that this temple was destroyed by fire after 64 A.D. and was rebuilt by Domitian . ' So starting with this hypothesis , Professor Huelsen suggests that the adjoining enclosure through which we entered was the Temple of Minerva ( ad Minervam ) mentioned in the docu ments which refer most frequently to such a temple , namely , the tablets giving citizenship to the soldiers honorably discharged . The words are : " Descriptum et recognitum ex tabula ahenea qu e fixa est Rome post templum divi Augusti ad Minervam , " i.e. , " copied and compared with the bronze tablet which is set up at Rome behind the Temple of Augus tus in the Temple of Minerva . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records on the west wall of which were set the bronze tablets just mentioned . To the rear of this , in the room resembling an atrium , may have been located the library of the Temple of Divus Augustus . All this is in accord with the plan of Vitruvius and analogous to the plans of other libraries , for it lies toward the northeast and is closed on the south and southwest . Professor Huelsen points out that here are halls for study and for storage of books . Here also was found the statue of a man with a case for papyrus rolls beside him , perhaps an author , and here the stone was of a color restful to the eyes of the reader ! On the Sacra Via , near the corner of the Temple of Faustina , there has been discovered a large clay jar ( dolium ) in which were concealed cinerary urns of various shapes , some with covers resembling those of the hut urns . All are of red-brown clay made by hand , with no trace of metal about them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period of change from the bronze to the iron age , which may date in the seventh or eighth century B.C. Near by was a tomb containing a hut urn of familiar pattern ; and it is believed that we have here a part of the necropolis of Palatine Rome on the Sacra Via , a fact which is interesting because of the tradition of a burial-place of the Valerii in Velia . It has been necessary in this paper to pass over many most interesting matters , such as the traces of a shrine of Bacchus mentioned by Martial , ' and especially the account of the mediaeval church of S. Maria Antiqua , the excavation of which has added much to the history of early Christian art . In view of what has been accomplished it is gratifying to know that the commission intends to continue the excavations on the site of the Basilica jEmilia , which will require the tearing down of houses on the south side of the Via dells . Salaria Vecchia , the street to the north of the Church of S. Adriano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be continued with the intention of clearing the entire northern side of the Palatine up to the Lupercal . Excavations on the ascent of the Sacra Via from the Arch of Titus to the front of the Palace of the Comers will be carried on so as to form a junction with the work just mentioned by restoring the ancient road running from the Church of S. Maria Antique to the north front of the Palatine , certainly a very comprehensive plan .
