The history of a panic is the history of a confused conflict of many causes ; and unless you know what sort of effect each cause is likely to produce , you can not explain any part of what happens  --  it is like trying to explain the bursting of a boiler without " knowing the theory of steam . That sentence of Walter Bagehot 's might well be set as a copybook model for ' many of our rough and ready expounders of the financal trouble- ' ? these men with their glib " Morse did it , " " The currency system did it , " " Roosevelt did it . " We have to distinguish , of course , between the real and the political expla-nation . Politically , Mr. Roosevelt will be held responsible . By an inexorable political law , the President who " created " prosperity must also preserve it , or he becomes unworthy of idolatry . To trace the larger causes is work for the financial historian and the social philosopher . But we are too close to the upheaval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought it . At the same time , we can perceive , for example , that what has - been called the " cosmopolitan loan fund " of the world had not only become larger than ever before , but was more fluid than ever , and had been more exhaustively drawn upon . Under the pressure , we have seen it running here and there like drbps of quicksilver . That financial trouble in New York should close the Stock Exchange of Rome , as the dispatches tell us , betrays in a striking way not only the international character of surplus capital , but the long and severe strain it has undergone . Part of the trouble runs back to the state of mind of the people generally . The habit of extravagance has become fixed during these seven fat years . Luxuries have been bought as never beforeluxuries of the kind that perish with the using , that not only lock up capital , but destroy it . - Unproductive expenditure has been large , in contrast with reproductive outlays . It has been true , too , that profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put into speculative securities . This meant that hundreds of thousands of people had not their customary margin in cash savings , upon which they could readily put their hand in a crisis . Beneath this luxurious temper lies the belief that prosperity will go on without a break ' We may keep spending freely and without a tremor . But the same credulity easily translates itself into panic . From ' believing that there is no end to our riches , people pass to the other extreme and believe . that all riches are about to take wings . Easy-going and unwinking luxury be- G Much attention has been paid to the somewhat startling figures of last Saturday 's weekly New York bank . statement ; especially to the $51,924,000 deficiency below the 25 per cent . ratio of reserve to deposits required by the National Bank law . A little examination will prove , however , that the showing is by no means so sensational , or disquieting as might at first glance be supposed . It is true that this deficit of last Saturday is the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic of 1893 was $16,545,000 , on Augusl 12 , and , although ' the banks ceased publishing their weekly statements in the panic of 1873 , it is wholly improbable that there was any such deficit then . But the test of present conditions is not obtained by comparison of actual deficit figures , but by comparison of the ratio still maintained between reserve and deposits . The $16,545,000 deficit of August , 1893 , left actual cash in hand amounting to 20% per cent . of deposits ; last Saturday 's $51,924,000 deficit left a reserve ratio of my , . In other words , . the New York banks are substantially no worse off than they were fourteen years ago . The reason why the present deficiency is so much larger than that of 1893 is that all other items in the bank statement are to-day much larger . I art Saturday , the New York banks held $219,794,000 in actual cash ; when the deficit of 1893 was greatest , these same cash holdings were ' only $76,505,000 . But , naturally , in the legitimate expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had increased in a similar ratio . Where deposits , in that earlier panic , amounted to $372,200,000 , , last Saturday they footed up to $1,086,878,000 . The conclusion to be drawn is that the New York banks , being nearly three times as strong'in actual resources as in 1893 , can report a deficiency in reserves three times as great and still retain fully as sound a position as in that year . Within four weeks of the heaviest deficit of 1893 , a surplus over the 25 per cent reserve had been re- stored , and the same thing is likely this year . As for the mere fact that reserves were so far invaded as to reduce their ratio to deposits from 25 per cent . to 201/4 , every one knows that such use of the stipulated reserve , in a panic time , is precisely the reason why that reserve was prescribed by the banking law . The sound principle of banking , recognized ever since the celebrated " Bullion Re-. port " to Parliament in 1810 , has been that , in times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solvent customers , but at high rates , and should use their reserve fund for that purpose . Vast programmes of legislation are being marked out for the coming Congress . It is to repeal the Sherman Anti-Trust law ; it is to reform the currency ; it is to vote $1,000,000,000 in appropriations ; it is to get ten thousand recommendations from the President , and act upon all of them instanter . People who blithely make such predictions leave too many things out of their reckoning . They forget that politics will swallow up everything else at ' Washington this winter . The shadow of the Presidential election will rest upon the Capitol from the first day of the session . Everything that is . proposed , debated , or enacted will be thought of primarily in relation to the political fortunes or some man or party . ' Under such circumstances , the actual work done  --  if we do not count intriguing as work  --  is pretty certain to be small . Congress is proverbial for finding its strength in sitting still . And if business depresSion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , under that master of how not to do it , Speaker Cannon , will be likely to sit stiller than ever . When the Service Pension act was passed , - many-  people - who had opposed it tried to console themselves by the thought that , even if the pension-grabbers had triumphed , they would at least not be heard from again . This theory has already been proved ' baseless . Your pension-hunter 's appetite can never be satiated . Hardly had the bill pensioning every one of ninety days ' service become a law when there wag a movement to obtain State pensions in addition to the Federal . Now , a more serious undertaking is announced . As soon as Congress reassembles , Senator Burrows and Rep-resentative Dawes are to introduce a bill for a retired list for all volunteer officers who served at least one year in the field prior to Lee 's surrender . According to their ages , the beneficiaries are to receive one-half or three-quarters of the pay of regular officers of the ranks they held when mustered out  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is to be no back pay , and every pension now held by an officer is to be surrendered It is estimated that 9,000 officers still survive who Would benefit by this law ; of these only two are major-generals and twenty-eight brigadier-generals , out of 680 of both grades . Precedent for the proposal is a law approved May 15 , 1828 , giving to each of the surviving officers of the Continental Line the amount of his pay in the line up to the full pay of a captain . There were 12,500 who profited by this law , and they were at that time nearly all of the age of seventy or above . We fear that when Secretary Taft returns he will have to provide for his carriage some other motive power than the arms and legs of his enthusiastic fellow-countrymen . As if the defeat of Burton in Cleveland were not enough , Samuel Gompers now says unkind things about the Secretary . Has the Republican Administration , then , created , the highest wages on the face of the globe for nothing ? Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , only to have an official spokesman of organized labor decline to give complete and unqualified support to the heir-apparent ? The sentiments of Mr Gompers , like those of Dick Deadeye , " disgrace our common natur ' . " Mr. Taft and his friends may draw some satisfaction from the fact that the candidates on ? Mr. Gomperz 's blacklist last year did conspicuously well in the elections . But , unfortunately , there are others who treat the plans for the Presidential succession with courtesy equally scant . Mr. Taft is popular now , and he always has been popular in this country ; but it is becoming increasingly plain that his standing as a Presidential candidate would be actually better to-day without Administration support . For the year ending June 30 , a bulletin of the Interstate Commerce Commission shows that our railroads took more than their customary toll of deaths and . injuries The killed number 5.000 , an ' increase of 775 over 1905 , and the injured 76,286 , an increase of 9,577 . This is an old story , and it constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unavoidable on the best-regulated railroads , Must be admitted The English roads have had at least three terrible disasters within a twelvemonth . But defective equipment , negligence , and recklessness are not accidental , and to them must ' be attributed a painfully large share of our annual railway slaughter The bulletin speaks of the extraordinary number of derailments during the twelvemonth . Many of these were due to broken rails . That fact should certainly stiffen the railroad officials in their demand that the steel manufacturers make a better quality of rail . The result in actual votes of the Hearst-Parsons deal in New York County deserves special study , because the whole fusion movement was frankly put upon a numerical basis . Herbert Parsons made no other defence , or pretence , from the first . It was all a question of figures and percentages . To every Republican who protested on the score of principle or consistency , Mr. Parsons had but one answer . He took out his pad-and jotted down the election returns of 1905 . In that year , the vote for Ivins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for McClellan 140,264 . Hence it was as plain as addition that the way to beat Tammany was to fuse the Republican vote with the Hearst vote In actual result , however , Mr Parsons 's little sum figures out as follows : 64,289+123,292=117,000 . The reverse of this mathematical puzzle is displayed in Brooklyn . In Kings County , the Republican vote in 1905 was 61,192 ; that for Hearst , 84,835 , and for McClellan 68,728 . In Brooklyn , however , there was no fusion with Hearst . His tremendous vote was deliberately ! ignored , but with the result , in the returns for County Clerk , that the problem in subtraction contrasts in this way with Mr Parsons 's in addition : 61,192-84,835=-79,969 . Such figures may lie , but they point an unmistakable political moral . Any politician who sits down with the election returns and proceeds to make his combinations purely on the basis of votes cast  --  ignoring the past , hazarding the future , leaving out convictions , making a jest of conscience  --  is certain to be confronted with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will always find an unknown quantity vitiating his nicely prepared equation . That unknown quantity is the moral element . People whose votes are to be " delivered " have a way of obstinately refusing to be counted as so many cattle . They will insist upon exercising their own judgment ; and indignation at political chicanery and cynicism will always powerfully influence them . This is the consideration which never entered into Mr Parsons 's reckoning . His crushing defeat has writ large a moral which the most hardened politicians must hereafter take to heart . You can not denounce a man one year as a dangerous incendiary , the deadly enemy of law and order , and then the next year embrace him as a brother , without having the people repudiate you and all your works A mixture of good and bad  --  as in most human things  --  appears in the reports on the condition of the civil service , read last week at the annual meeting of the Civil-Service Reform League in Buffalo . President Roosevelt and Gov . Hughes came in for praise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation . Gov . Hughes 's address was the valuable testimon3 of an executive who , in actual practice , and with a large amount of patronage , has iound the best interest-a of the State conserved by adhering to the principles of the reformed service . Particularly effective was the Governor 's quiet disposal of the time-worn flings at civil-service examinations . He would attach no undue importance to examination papers , but , " as compared with the system of making public office a partisan encampment , the system of competitive examination is so far in advance that theie is no debate among reasonable men upon the question . " The Supreme Court- of the District of Columbia heard arguments last week in an important boycott case The Buck 's Stove and Range " Company is applying for a temporary injunction to restrain Samuel Gompers and others and the American Federation of Labor from boycotting it and its products The company has already brought suit against Gompers and his associates on the ground that their interference with its business has constituted restraint of trade within the meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the allegation that members of the Brotherhood of Foundry Employees had been compelled to return to a ten-hour day after having once worked for nine hours . The affidavits in support of the company 's application make a book of 312 pages and show how far-reaching is the terrorism exercised by the Federation of Labor The company was notified by . agents the country aver that they could not sell its products without incurring the enmity of local unions , and risking their entire business . A boycott of a firm of manufacturers has been 6omething heretofoi'e thought of as merely a local affair , applying , say , to Bridgeport only . But this amazing exhibit shows that the Federation followed up the products of the Buck 's Company into State after State , and through its local branches did its best to destroy utterly the business of the company .

It publishes in facsimile a letter from the officers of the Memphis branch of the International Union of Steam Engineers , " consisting of more than one hundred of the leading and most intelligent engineers of the city of Memphis , " to the effect that its members will patronize only ' those dealers in engineering supplies who advertise in the International Steam Engineer , an " official paper " printed in Boston . Obviously , if the same tactics are employed in other cities , the International Steam Engineer will shortly have the finest advertising display the country , ' and its manager can retire in luxury , since ' he . can ask any rate he chooses , If anything were still necessary to convince fair-minded men of the empti-ness of the Japanese war scare , so persistently fostered by the Jingo press , Foreign Minister Hayashi 's declaration of policy through the medium of the Associated Press should be sufficient .

It is , of course , open to those who gaze eagle-eyed on the Pacific and discern thereon Japanese armadas bearing hosts of invasion , to believe that all this elaborate explanation of the Japanese Foreign Minister is guile and deception . As a matter of fact , we have gone far enough in our recoil from the Japanomania of two years ago . No admirable quality that - the mind of man could devise was wanting to the gallant little nation then ; no sinister motive or capacity that the mind of editor can devise ? 5 wanting to the Mikado 's people at present . They are dishonest , immoral , . cruel , ambitious , and superhuman only in their ability to work mischief . The one quality of intense though shrewd patriotism , we do not deny them . Yet if people would only stop to think on present conditions in Japan and in international politics , how clearly it would appear that a shrewd and limitless patriotism itself counsels Japan to peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German Emperor often do the wrong thing ; but sometimes , too , they hit upon the night acticn at the critical moment . The Kaiser 's visit to Edward VII. , which is said to have been suddenly decided upon , is very timely . It can not but prove a contribution to the cause of European peace , and it loses nothing of its ; significance , in coming so dramatically close upon the dissolution of the Hague Conference , with its disappointed hopes . The meeting of the German and British monarchs completes the circle of rapprochements and ententes which has been drawn about the Eur " opean Powers in the course of the last three years . First , Great Britain and France entered into the now celebrated " understanding " which removed the colonial pos ; sessions of both Powers outside the scope of possible future ' contention . Spain , through her close relations with France in the matter of Mediterranean Policy , came under the influence of the dual agreement . Since England has al-ways been the friend of Italy in the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entente , a de-aided relaxation in the chronically jealous relatiOns between France and Italy . The very integrity of the Triple Alliance seemed threatened when Italy joined with Framee against Germany in the Algeciras Conference of last year . France , a mediator in turn , has no doubt hastened the recently concluded . agreement between Great Britain and Russia . And now it is not improbable that Russian influence has helped to bring about the interview between Edward VII . and William IL It is true that where everybody is everybody else 's friend , the chances for quarrelling are not removed . Nevertheless , the peace of Europe must profit when Germany abandons her attitude of suspicion . No one expected any other outcome of the suit brought by Chancellor von Billow than the punishment of the journalist who libelled him in such a criminal way . Von Dubow is by no means a generally popular man , but he has the respect of all intelligent political observers . Indeed , even the cartoonists of the Opposition give him a kindly appearance , at the moment of ridiculing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position has been shaken somewhat by the revelations in regard to the court camarilla is undeniable . The way in which the Foreign Office is now seen to have handled the Moroccan affair is also bound to injure him ; for the former Under-Secretary of State confessed profound ignorance of some of the actions brought to light by the Harden revelations . Meanwhile , the Chancellor 's efforts to carry on his " block-policy " of uniting Conservatives and Liberals are meeting with greater ' and greater opposition . The Radical Liberals are doing their best to break it up , and to enter into a working agreement with the Socialists . The Centre , too , is no less antagonistic than it was a year ago . Hence , the coming session is likely to witness some vigorous onslaughts upon the Chancellor , whose long summer absence from Berlin has increased the anxiety of the public about his health . An agitation in favor of restoring the death penalty , which has been virtually abolished in France by the commutation of death sentences to life imprisonment and by the suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Department of the Seine , is reported to be rapidly growing . Crimes of violence in the large towns have been increasing to what the greater part of the French press describes as ? an alarming extent ; the apache , or thug , has become a prominent character , in contemporary journalistic art ; and the pleasant life that awaits the convicted murderer in the perpetual care of a kind-hearted government has been contrasted by the Opposition press with the mode of life of the average laborer or peasant . The government , indeed , is about to introduce into the Chamber a bill for the abolition of capital punishment . That it does not overlook the seriousness of the present situation , however ; is shown by the initiation of measures looking towards the reorganization of the police system all over the country . Such twofold action is wise , for it proceeds on the principle that if punishment is really a deterrent of crime , its efficacy depends , not on the degree of severity , but on the certainty of its application . The history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often that of a spasmodic abandonment of the death penalty , with its equally spasmodic reestablishment under the influence of temporary panic . That the French government is bent upon putting the issue to a fair trial is evident from the recent action of President Fallidres in commuting the death sentence of the perpetrator of a peculiarly atrocious crime , in the face of public indignation . France has not yet got over her alarm at the discovery of an international syndicate of church-looters , when she is confronted by the much more serious.danger of a " syndicate of traitors , " or an " association of international spies , " five of whose leaders were arrested this week at Toulon . From a rapid examination of documents taken in the raid , the police are inclined to believe that " the gang has for a long time been carrying on an extensive traffic in military and naval secrets . " Popular imagination likes to conceive the Mafia and the Black Hand as world-wide societies with a highly perfected organization , which allows some mysterious grand chief to press a button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the seven seas . At the present moment , the editor of a New York Yiddish newspaper is reported to be awaiting calmly the fulfilment of the sentence of death passed on him by the Russian Black Hundred But the idea of an international syndicate of traitors is incomparably fascinating . Nations will no longer be forced to maintain expensive secret service systems , or to cling to antiquated small-producer methods by bribing a captain or a lieutenant here and there . An application , in a printed envelope , addressed " Iscariot , P. 0 . Box 23 , Zurich , " will bring Germany all-the information she desires about the fortifications on the northeastern French frontier , or acquaint the American government with the exact disposition of the Japanese army , now secretly encamped in Hawaii .
