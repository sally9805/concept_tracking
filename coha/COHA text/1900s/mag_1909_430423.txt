 | AFRICA is a land of surprises at every turn , so one is not in the least astonished to find lying alongside of the quay at Port Florence , the end of the Uganda Railway , a perfect little ocean steamship . The white paint and the glistening brass-work , the electric light , and the Indian cook made me think that this was a P. and O. liner eastward-bound rather than a little steamer on a remote lake which fifty years ago no white man had even seen . After the grime of the Deutsch Ost A f rika and the discomfort of the Uganda Railway , this was luxury indeed . The voyage across the lake to Entebbe is not in any way interesting . For a short time the ship is out of sight of land , but generally the north shore is in sight , or some of the innumerable islands that lie along the coast . A few seagulls and cormorants , the only birds that I saw , made it hard to believe that this was not the sea . RAVAGES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen in Entebbe at that time was the laboratory of the Royal Commission on Sleeping Sickness , under the charge of Lieutenants Gray and Tulloch , R. A. M. C. , where the disease was being studied with a view to discovering its nature and , if possible , some means of treatment . Close at hand was the native hospital , filled with miserable wretches in various stages of the disease . It is sad to have to record that , though a great  | deal has been done towards checking the spread of sleeping sickness , no means of successfully treating it after infection has taken place has yet been discovered ; it is invariably fatal . The destruction that has been caused in Central Africa by the terrible scourge of sleeping sickness is almost incalculable ; enormous areas of the lake-shore and whole archipelagos , where there was a swarming population only a few years ago , have been rendered absolutely desolate by sleeping sickness . I visited a few islands and a strip of shore not far from Entebbe and walked through large grass-grown villages where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . It has been computed that more than 200,000 people have died of the disease in Uganda alone during the last seven years , and this is probably well within the mark . Apart from the appalling waste of human life , it involves a very serious loss to the state , which can not afford to lose a large and thriving population living along its main waterway . One of the effects was to be seen in the increasing difficulty of inducing porters and laborers to remain at Entebbe , where they are afraid of catching the disease . There is also the not inconceivable possibility of its being turned into an anti-European weapon . An unscrupulous agitator could easily persuade a half-educated people that the white men were responsible for the disease , and that the obvious remedy was to turn them out of the country . Happily only four Europeans have been attacked by sleeping sickness in Uganda , though the number in the Congo Free State is probably a good deal greater . ( See also page 273 . ) As one travels westward from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less populated . The rich elephant-grass country of the Kingdom of Uganda is left behind and the road traverses rocky highlands . The latter are more picturesque , there are more flowers , and occasionally one can see a distant view of hills and valleys ; but one day 's march is very like another , uphill and down dale yesterday and today and tomorrow . After 15 days ' marching the character of the country changed more rapidly ; undulations became steep hills , and valleys and swamps became clear mountain streams . The delight of drinking and washing in pure water instead of in the boiled mud , to which one was beginning to get accustomed , is a thing of which it is difficult to speak calmly . At a beautiful torrent with steep wooded banks I came unexpectedly upon a family bathing-party of yellow baboons , of all sizes from that of a mastiff to a small terrier ; they ran about on the rocks and barked in the most alarming manner , and I was not at all sorry that the river was between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world where one can walk in a couple of days from hot plains grilling under the Equator to a land of Alpine frosts and snows , where sun-helmets and mosquitonets give way to furs and blankets , and the campfire serves no longer to scare away the lions , but to warm the shivering traveler . I have seen snow-capped peaks in New Guinea within too miles of the Line , but dense forests and the cannibalistic propensities of the natives make their exploration impossible without an armed escort . But it can be done in Ruwenzori , and , it seemed to me , after the many weary miles left behind , one of the most enchanting walks of my life . The path wound slowly up a wide valley through woods and fields and large gardens of bananas , crossing here and there a small tributary stream . It is common to speak of Ruwenzori as a mountain , but it is in reality a range of mountains , with at least five distinct groups of snow-peaks . It has been described as the highest mountain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extent of thirty miles of glaciers ; its height , as determined by the Duke of the Abruzzi , is slightly less than 17,000 feet , so that both Kilimanjaro and Kenia are  | higher than Ruwenzori , and ten miles would more than cover the extent of its glaciers . The first European to see Ruwenzori was probably Sir Samuel Baker , who saw what he called the " Blue Mountains to the south " during his exploration of Lake Albert in 1864 ; but it was not until 1887 , when Stanley came from the Congo on the Emin Relief Expedition , that the mountains were definitely recognized as a snow range , and for very nearly twenty years more they remained as little known and as mysterious as ever . CLIMBS IN THE RUWENZORI One of the most remarkable features of Ruwenzori is the abrupt change that is often seen from one kind of vegetation to another . Above the tropical forest , which extends to about 8.000 feet , is a more or less constant zone of bracken and giant heath-trees , and above this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begins the zone of bamboos which are found growing up to 11,000 feet , though their denser growth occurs between 9,000 and 10,000 feet . The bamboos were so thick that we could not force a way through them , and cutting was too slow a process , so the natives adopted the plan of bending the bamboos down and walking over the top of them , which rather unusual method of procedure we followed for some time . After struggling for miles through the dense jungle of bamboo , where all sense of direction was quickly lost , it was a relief beyond measure to come out occasionally onto tolerably level ground , where one could at all events get a glimpse here and there through the fog and rain , even though it meant exchanging the slippery slopes for swamps and sloughs , where the easiest path was kneedeep in mud and water . The end of our day 's journey was a steep black precipice , 400 or 500 feet high , called Kichuchu . At the foot of the precipice , which in one place was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few yards only in extent , of comparatively dry ground . It quaked ominously , like thin ice , at a heavy tread , but one does not employ the ordinary standards of wet and dry in such places . There was not room enough to pitch a tent , so we unfurled our beds and laid them close to the foot of the cliff , and as far as might be from the constant cascade of water , which splashed into pools from the overhanging rock . The most notable feature of the camp at Kichuchu was the nocturnal chorus of the Ruwenzori ghosts . It was always said by the natives that there were devils high up in the mountains , and any one of a superstitious turn of mind who hag slept or has tried to sleep at Kichuchu could well believe it . So soon as it became dark , first one and then another shrill cry broke the stillness ; then the burden was taken up by one high up on the cliff overhead , then by others on the other side , until the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for it ; frogs , owls , and devils were among the suggestions , but the natives declared that the noises were made by hyraxes , and we discovered afterwards that they were right . It is possible that each actual cry was not very loud , but the steep hillsides and the bare wall of the cliff acted as sounding-boards , which intensified the noise to an incredible extent . It was one of the most mournful and blood-curdling sounds I have ever heard , and it caused an uncomfortable thrill , even after we had been assured that it had not a supernatural origin . The upper Mubuku Valley ? that is to say , from Kichuchu ( 9,833 feet ) to the foot of the Mubuku glacier ( 13,682 feet ) ? is built in a series of gigantic steps of from Soo to toot ) feet in height , between which lie tolerably level terraces of from one to two miles in length . The first of these steps is made by the cliff at the foot of which lies the rock-shelter of Kichuchu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , in some places so well sheltered that the dust of ages lies thick upon the ground , but more generally it is nothing but the bed of a stream , and is exposed to the drippings from the rocks above . A climb of about an hour brings one to the first great ter-  | race . There is a small area of swamp , but this terrace is chiefly remarkable for the wonderful luxuriance of the heathtrees , which here attain their greatest growth . STRANGE LOOKING HEATH-TREES A heath-tree is a thing entirely unlike any of the trees of England ; the reader must imagine a stem of the common " ling " magnified to a height of 6o or 70 or even 8o feet , but bearing leaves and flowers hardly larger than those of the " ling " as it grows in England . Huge cushions of many-colored mosses , often a foot or more deep , encircle the trunks and larger branches , while the finer twigs are festooned with long beards of gray lichen , which give to the trees an unspeakably dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most difficult and tiring part of the whole ascent , for not only did the heath-trees grow very close together , but the ground beneath them was strewn with the dead and decaying trunks of fallen trees , some of them hard as bog oak , and others ready to crumble at a touch , but all of them covered with a dense carpet of thick moss , which necessitated a careful probing before any step forward could be taken . The way in which our porters , encumbered as they were with awkward loads , hopped nimbly from one trunk to another made one feel thoroughly ashamed . As we ascended the steep slope the heath-trees became rather less dense , and in the intervals between them appeared a few helichrysums , tall senecios with clusters of yellow flowers , and a beautiful little blue violet ( Viola abyssinica ) very similar to the English dog-violet . At the top of this slope , about 11,800 feet , the climber enters upon a new world , or , to speak more truly , it is a tract that seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be in the least surprised to see pterodactyls flying screaming overhead ( they must have been noisy creatures , I think ) or iguanodons floundering through the morasses and browsCS OF THE EQUATOR 261 ing on the tree-tops . But there are no living creatures to be seen or heard ; it is a place of awful silence and solitude . It is an almost level meadow or " swampy garden , " as Sir H. H. Johnston called it , a mile or more long and several hundred yards wide . GIANT LOBELIAS AND GROUNDSELS Out of the moss , which everywhere forms a dense and soaking carpet , grow thick clumps of helichrysum with white and pink flowers , and standing up like attenuated tombstones are the tall spikes of giant lobelias ( Lobelia deckenii ) . Groundsels ( Senecio adnivalis ) grow here into trees 20 feet high , Saint Johns wort ( Hypericuin ) is a tree even higher , and brambles ( Rubus doggetti ) bear flowers two inches across and fruit as big as walnuts . Through the middle of the meadow the Mubuku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream in appearance as one could wish to see . On either side are steep rocks and slopes covered with heath-trees looming like ghosts upward into the everlasting fog . At its upper end the meadow is bounded by an almost precipitous wall , over which the Mubuku stream falls in a splendid cascade . Our next camp was pitched under the shelter of another overhanging cliff , and surrounded by huge blocks that had fallen therefrom . Our porters found refuge in all sorts of queer holes and crannies among the rocks . There was not space enough to pitch a tent , and we were a miserable little party as we sat huddled round a fire of sodden heath logs , which produced only an acrid and blinding smoke . The cliff overhead is the haunt by day of large fruit-eating bats ( Roussettus lanosus ) , which measure about two feet across the wings . At sunset they come flapping out , and for a second or two afford a chance of a difficult shot before they disappear through the heath-trees towards the valley below . To judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the camp and far up the mountain sides almost to the snow level ,  | leopards and another smaller cat were fairly common , but we never chanced to see one . Our first night at Bujongolo I shall never forget by reason of an earthquake , the most severe I have ever felt , which awoke me from a troubled sleep . Every moment ? it seemed to last for minutes instead of , probably , for a few seconds only ? I expected to see the cliff , which made our roof , come crashing down to put an untimely end to our travels . A short distance above Bujongolo , where it flows through a deep and narnow gorge , the Mubuku takes a sharp bend to the right ( north ) , and at the same time the valley widens out into the third and last of the great swampy terraces , at an altitude of rather less than 13,000 feet . As one comes out from the last of the heath forest at the bend of the valley , there is suddenly unfolded a glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view towers up the beautiful peak Kiyanja ( King Edward Peak ) with two glaciers on its flanks to the right at the head of the valley , the great Mubuku glacier thrusts its long nose almost down to the valley floor , and on either side are jagged peaks with steep black precipices and gentler slopes of snow . During all the eight or nine days that our two expeditions to Bujongolo together counted , I do not suppose that the mountains were visible for half as many hours ; but the place was so grim and solemn , and so almost unearthly in its setting , that the scene is far more firmly impressed upon my memory than many that I have seen a hundred times more often . The lower slopes were covered with lobelias and senecios and helichrysums and the inevitable moss . NEW BIRD DISCOVERED Here was found one of the most striking , and not the least interesting , of the many new birds that were discovered by the expedition . This was a sunbird ( Nectarinia dartniouthi ) of a dark metallic green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers of its tail were prolonged several inches beyond the others , and upon its breast , almost hidden by the wings , were two tufts of short crimson plumes . To see one of these little birds perched upon a tall blue spike of lobelia , fluttering his wings and flirting his long tail , was one of the prettiest sights imaginable . Sunbirds and large Swifts , which live in the steep rocks like the Alpine Swifts in Europe , were almost the only living things to be seen . The first expedition that we made from Bujongolo was to the head of the Mubuku glacier . A mile or more of ploughing through swamp took us to the end of the level terrace , beyond which we mounted at first over an old moraine covered with a forest of senecios , and then over smooth , glacier-worn rocks coated with moss and oozing with water , and up through a curious tunnel , formed by a huge block jammed across a gully , to the foot of the glacier ( 13,682 feet ) . We had often noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great difference in the volume of the Mubuku from morning to evening , as there is in the glacierfed streams of Europe , and the reason was apparent when we came to the Mubuku glacier . Both early and late there was never more than the merest trickle of water flowing from this glacier . The reason , which has been pointed out by Mr. F'reshfield , is that in Africa , as in other tropical and subtropical regions , notably the Sikkim Himalayas , the glaciers lose most of their substance by evaporation . It was pleasant to think that a part of that tiny stream would perhaps find its way into the great river , which goes swirling past the temple of Abu Simbel and carries fatness to the fields of Egypt . We scrambled up a few hundred feet of loose and rotten rocks , more dangerous than difficult , and then took to the glacier near the top of the ice-fall , where it was necessary to cut a few steps among the seracs . From the top of the ice-fall we made a wide detour across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little hanging glacier on our right ? the  | remains of recent avalanches were scattered all about us ? and thence an hour 's walk up an easy snow-slope took us to the top of the ridge and the rock . THE ASCENT OP KING EDWARD PEAK On the following day , soon after sunrise , we set out for Kiyanja ( King Edward Peak ) . Instead of following the Mubuku valley up the wide terrace to the glacier , we turned off towards the west , up a small tributary stream , and soon found ourselves in difficulties . Slopes which from a little distance looked smooth and easy enough were found on closer acquaintance to be cut up with gullies and water-courses and clothed in the most disheartening vegetation that ever resisted the footsteps of a climber . We could not complain much about sinking at every step almost to the knees in moss and black slime ; but through the moss grew , as high as one 's head , a tangle of " everlasting " bushes , as stiff and wiry as broom , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . The tall , upright spikes of the lobelias seemed to offer a sure support , but they generally crumbled away at a touch and sent one sliding down the slope again , while the stems of the senecios were too slippery with moss and moisture to be of any use in hauling oneself up the hillside . It would have been hard work enough anywhere to make much headway over ground of that sort , but at an altitude of about 14,000 feet , where we had not been long enough to have become acclimatized and where the slightest exertion was a labor , it only needed a word from one to the other of us and we had beaten a retreat . Luckily the word was not spoken , and , after we had lightened our burdens by leaving behind us cameras and all but the most necessary food , we struggled on with less difficulty . At a height of about 14,500 feet all our difficulties were practically at an end ; we had passed beyond the limit of the lobelias and the bushy " everlasting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 15,000 feet , and the senecios were getting fewer , until at 14,800 feet they ceased altogether . Rocks , partly moraine and partly blocks that had fallen from a high cliff on our left , began to replace the moss and mud ? a most welcome change . Very fortunately we had had a clear view of the mountain earlier in the day , and had mapped out the course that we proposed to take , noting certain prominent landmarks . Had we not done so , there would have been nothing for us to do but to stay where we were or retrace our steps , as the clouds were low down on the mountains when we came to the foot of the rocks . However , we groped our way blindly forward , and luckily recognized a big wall of granite rock , which had shown up conspicuously pink from below . Here , in order to make certain , if possible , of finding our way back through the fog , we filled our pockets with " everlasting " flowers , which we scattered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went along . Often as I had maligned the " everlastings " before , I blessed them that day ; they undoubtedly saved us from a night out on the mountainside , if not from worse things . After climbing up a few hundred feet of steep but easy rocks , we came on to a small glacier , bare and dry in its lower part , but covered with an increasing depth of snow as we went higher . A black mass before us loomed huge through the fog , and seven hours after leaving camp we stood on the peak , which seemed from below to be the summit of Kiyanja ( King Edward Peak ) . We built a small cairn , and , to keep ourselves warm , hurled huge boulders down the steep eastern face of the mountain into the Mubuku valley . It is an attractive amusement , but not one to be recommended in regions more populous than Ruwenzori . We waited as long as it was safe to do , if we were to get back to camp that night , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced the fog , the clouds boiled tip from below , and we looked right down the Mubuku Valley and saw the river winding away over the yellow plain of Ruisamba and the blue hills beyond . It was one of the rare glimpses that one gets from the Alps of  | the Lombard Plain , but it lasted only for a moment before it was blotted out again . Then there came a clearing on the other side towards the north and west , and we saw that we had missed the real top of our mountain , King Edward Peak ( 15,988 feet ) , which rose perhaps 150 feet higher than the point that we had reached and was connected with ours by an arete of snow . It was disappointing to have missed it , but it was too late then to go further . Towards the northwest was a big snow-peak about 400 feet higher than ours , forming a big western buttress of the range ; and further away , apparently three or four miles to the northwest , appeared two beautiful sharppointed snow-peaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak and must be unquestionably the highest peaks in the range . Our estimate of their heights proved to be approximately correct . The Duke of Abruzzi found their heights to be 16,815 feet ( Margherita Peak ) and 16,749 feet ( Queen Alexandra Peak ) . The peaks were seen rising out of a dense bank of clouds which lay between us and them , so that it was impossible to tell in what way they were connected with the other peaks of the range . All too soon the clouds enveloped us again more densely than before , and it was fully time to start back towards Bujongolo . Thanks to our trail of " everlasting " flowers , we lost no time in the descent , and we staggered into camp just as darkness set in , after one of the most tiring days I have ever experienced . The attempts that we made to penetrate into the heart of the range were hopelessly handicapped by lack of means and equipment . We were not in any sense a climbing party , and our excursions were made during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glaciers of Ruwenzori have been explored and named ( some of them for the third and fourth time ) by the Duke of Abruzzi and others , it is unlikely that the range will often be visited . Tourists who go to Lake Victoria will think twice before they venture on a three weeks ' march across country ; and , if that be not enough , the atrocious climate and the chance of seeing nothing when you get there because of the fog and rain will keep away all but the most enthusiastic and determined mountaineers . COLLECTING SPECIMENS Our party camped for four months on the east slope of Ruwenzori , making natural history collections for the British Museum . The natives soon discovered that they could make an appreciable addition to their incomes by hunting and bringing in beasts of various Sorts . Hyraxes , gigantic rats , bats , mice , worms , beetles , chameleons , and snakes came pouring in when once it was found that there were people mad enough to pay for such follies . The care with which they secured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they produced them were always a source of amusement . If it could by any means be avoided , they would never hold a beast in their hands , but always bind a string of banana fiber round its neck and attach that to a stick , or else they wrapped the creature in elaborate parcels of banana leaves , which they opened with a great display of caution and pretense of fear . The moment of unpacking the parcel was always an exciting one , as you never could tell what might be produced ; a mouse might make a sudden dash for liberty , or a swarm of beetles or crabs come scurrying out , or a few chameleons would come strolling out , looking fearfully bored , or half a dozen bats would flap out into the sunshine . THE CHIMPANZEES There were a great many chimpanzees in the forest ; their " nests , " light platforms of sticks built in the forks of high trees , were frequently found , and often at night one would hear their cries near the camp ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in distress . They are shy animals and are not very often seen , but on one occasion we had an excellent view of a small family party , a baby with its two pa-  | rents , feeding on the fruit of a tree below the camp . With the help of fieldglasses it was easy to see the almost painfully human gestures of the old ones , as they helped the little one to move from branch to branch and fed it with berries . Although they are most commonly found in the tropical forests at a lower level , chimpanzees wander about a great deal and go far up the mountains in search of food ; we found traces of them at a height of nearly 10,000 feet in Ruwenzori , where they had been feeding on the berries of a podocarpus . GAMBOLING HIPPOS A few miles from Albert Edward Nyanza we came to a circular lake , once a crater , about half a mile wide . The water is slightly salt and is greatly al ) , preciated by the hippos , who come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few yards only , and then deepens rapidly , so the hippos , who do not like deep water , never go very far from the shore . On a still day it is an amusing pastime to sit by the lake and watch the great brutes enjoying themselves . Eor a moment nothing is to be seen , then suddenly a score or more of huge heads burst through the surface with loud snorts and squirting jets of water through their nostrils . They stare round with their ugly little piglike eyes , yawn prodigiously , showing a fearful array of tusks and a cavernous throat , and sink with a satisfied gurgle out of sight , to repeat the performance a minute or two afterwards . Sometimes one stands almost upright in the water , then he rolls over with a sounding splash , showing a broad expanse of back like a huge porpoise ; or a too venturesome young bachelor approaches a select circle of veterans , who resent his intrusion and drive him away with roars and grunts . There is something irresistibly suggestive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the picture . POWERFUL BIRDS There are two birds which will live in my memory long after I have forgotten everything else about this region . One is the Bateleur eagle , which may be called the first-class cruiser among birds ; for power and swiftness of flight there is none that can compare with it . With its long wings and curious stunted tail , it looks more like a huge bat than a bird , as it sails high overhead , never flapping its wings , but giving just an occasional tilt from one side to the other . One moment it is here , and the next it is a speck almost out of sight across the plain . The other is a very remarkable species of Nightjar , in which some of the feathers of the wing , particularly the second primary , are enormously lengthened ; the longest that was measured had a length of 21 inches . These birds sleep during the day in warm places on the hillsides until sunset , when they fly down to the low ground about the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , give the birds a most unnatural appearance , as if they had four , wings ; but though one would expect the long feathers to be rather an encumbrance than otherwise when the bird is chasing insects , it can turn and twist in flight as quickly as a peewit . ACROSS THE BORDER IN THE CONGO STATE After coming from Uganda , where the natives are not allowed to carry weapons , it was strange to us to see all the people going about armed across the border in the Congo State . The majority of them carried spears , while a good many carried a short bamboo bow and a quiver full of arrows made of reeds pointed with curiously fashioned tips of metal . Our stay was enlivened ( if it may be said without disrespect to the departed ) by the death of Kilongozi , the big chief of the district . Many of his vassals had assembled several days before in anticipation of his death , and as soon as the event was announced it was greeted with a chorus of shrieks and wails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals for several days . The chief was buried beneath the floor of his house , about which his subjects ,  | to the number of more than a thousand , congregated in a dense throng . During the first day they were fairly quiet , and contented themselves with dancing slowly to the tune of the inevitable drums and with firing off guns at intervals . On the following days , inspired by the " pombe , " which they drank in immense quantities , they were rather more boisterous in their grief . The women , and some of the men , attired themselves in a sort of very short ballet-dancer 's skirt made of banana leaves , in which they performed some very quaint and intricate dances . Sometimes the women would stand aside , and the crowd of men , dividing into two opposite parties , would perform a wardance or mimic battle , shrieking and howling like lunatics . Fortunately etiquette forbids the wearing of spears and knives at a funeral , and harmless reeds are carried instead , or there might have been accidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antelopes ' horns and whistles of various sorts in the crowd , and the deafening din which they produced was still in progress when we left Beni . There was formerly a fairly good road through the Congo forest north from the foot of Mount Ruwenzori , but now , owing to the attitude of the " revoltes " natives , it has gone out of use , and owing to the action of elephants and buffaloes , which swarm in this part of the forest , it has gone sadly out of repair . The beasts were there in such numbers that in some places the air was full of the strong and bitter odor , which one associates with the elephants ' house at the zoo . The path was pounded and churned into a sort of red cream by the feet of the monsters , and every tree-stump was polished bright and smooth , where they had scratched their huge sides , or , nearer the ground , there the buffaloes had rubbed their horns . Although there are so many ? you see the bushes swaying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and hear them trumpeting at night ? the beasts themselves are very seldom seen . It was in this part of the forest that the okapi was first discovered a few years ago , and it is probable that they are more plentiful , or , to be more accurate , less scarce , in the Semliki and Ituri forests than elsewhere . Any one who is anxious to procure a specimen of this strange creature must obtain first a special permission from the Congo government , and , secondly , the friendship of a tribe of Pygmies ; the latter can best be managed by a liberal offering of salt , their most valued necessary . With reasonable luck and the exercise of patience , he might be expected to get an okapi within a few months ' time . THE PYGMIES The Pygmies live almost exclusively by hunting ; they grow no crops and they do not manufacture their bows and spears ; these they obtain in exchange for game from the other inhabitants of the forest , who also supply them with bananas and other produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or family seems to have a definite hunting district , whose bounds they never transgress ; they sleep wherever they happen to be , and we were constantly coming across their tracks and their little shelters , the flimsiest structures of sticks thatched with leaves . The first Pygmy that I met greeted me with a shout of " Bonzoo , Bwana ( sir ) " ; he had been for a time in a Congo post , and " Bonzoo " was his version of " Bon jour . " He was a cheerful little person , about four feet high , and he shook hands effusively ; his was one of the most perfectly shaped hands I have seen , but cold and clammy , as the hands of most black men are . Now that some of his cousins brothers , perhaps ? have toured about England and have exhibited in musichalls , the appearance of Pygmies is doubtless familiar to every one , and it need hardly be remarked that even in the Congo they have not all yet learned to speak French .  | The path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is nothing but a succession of fallen trees and muddy elephant-baths ; but there is a subtle fascination about walking through the forest , which increases as the days go by . The best way to feel the forest is to walk far ahead or , as I lazily preferred to do , miles behind the caravan , far beyond the sound of a disturbing gunshot or of the unceasing chatter of the porters . Sometimes there is a sound of crashing through the trees , where a herd of elephants have been disturbed in their siesta ; sometimes a troop of monkeys dash twittering through the tree-tops , or huge topheavy-looking hornbills fly overhead screaming uncouth discords ; but more often the silence of the forest is unbroken and complete , and you may walk for miles at a time and not hear a sound or see a sign of living creature . It may be only a result of the half gloom and one 's sense of smallness amid the vast surroundings , or it may be an instinct inherited from prehistoric forestdwelling ancestors ; but , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwonted care and ever on the alert for an unknown something . It was only in the infrequent clearings , - where we camped , that we realized how immense , compared with our insignificant tents , the trees of the forest are ; as a rule , their height is greater in proportion to their girth than is the case with an ash or an elm . The forest is seldom - level ; it is always gently rising or falling , - as much one way as another , and it was not until we found one day that the streams were no longer flowing to our - right into the Semliki that we realized that we had crossed the watershed into the basin of the Congo . Wandering on , day after day , through the forest , one began to wonder , " Shall we come out of it all some day , as one does from a tunnel ? " and our coming out of it was almost as sudden as that . Without any warning , except that for a mile or so the trees had become perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found ourselves on the edge of an open , hilly , grass country that stretched as far as we could see to east and north . LIONS ARE NOT USUALLY DANGEROUS The few inhabitants of the district about Albert Edward Nyanza , on the Uganda side , seem to be almost wholly a water-side people , who live entirely by fishing . At the southeast corner of the lake are some curious colonies of-lakedwellers , whose huts are built several yards from the shore , with the object , presumably , of escaping the attack of the lions , which are always in attendance on large herds of game . At a small village at the extreme south end of the lake our camp was surrounded by a high reedfence for the same purpose , and only a few days before we arrived there a man , who incautiously went outside the fence after dark , had been carried off and eaten . They are chiefly nocturnal in their habits , and the country where they live is usually so densely clothed with grass or scrub that , unless you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are very much against catching a glimpse of a lion at all . In cultivated districts , so far from being a source of public danger , lions may be looked upon as the friend of the agriculturist . Like the tigers in some parts of India , their favorite food is the wild pigs and small antelopes which play such havoc among the crops , and their complete extermination would not prove to be by any means an unmixed blessing . It is only very rarely that men are attacked by them . Of course , if a man is foolish enough to walk about after dark , he offers a tempting meal which no hungry lion would be likely to refuse ; but instances of lions , like the famous man-eaters of Tsavo , acquiring a preference for human flesh and breaking into huts and tents to seize men are quite exceptional . VIRULENT EVER CAUSED BY TICKS We had intended to stop for a few days to visit the villages of the lakedwellers , but in that we had reckoned without the spirillum . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequenter of native houses and old camping places , which carries in its blood a micro-organism called Spirochceta duttoni . When it is introduced into the blood of a man by the bite of one of these ticks , the spirochceta is the cause of a particularly unpleasant relapsing fever . An ordinary attack lasts for two or three days , and recurs again after an interval of a week or more ; in severe cases the attacks may be continued for months . Hitherto no satisfactory remedy has been discovered for the fever , and all that can be done is to take steps to avoid being bitten by the tick . There are some districts in which the fever is so prevalent that it is difficult to induce porters to travel through them . It is useless to tell them that if they sleep in the old shelters they will get fever ; they smile indulgently but incredulously at the crazy European , and unless they are turned out of the old shelters and compelled to make new ones , tick-bites and spirillum fever are the speedy results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters along the roads in the worst infected districts , and it is hoped that in this way the disease will be kept with bounds . In spite of all our precautions , my friend and I fell victims to it . PRIMITIVE METHODS OF ' CARRYING EIRE The people of the Kivu region still retain the primitive method of obtaining fire from wood . The apparatus is simple enough and consists of a slender stick of hard wood , a flat piece of soft and partly charred wood ( often a segment of a bamboo ) , and a scrap of inflammable material , such as rag or bark . The slender stick is placed upright upon the soft wood and is rotated very rapidly between the palms of the hands ; the tinder , placed close to the point of contact , smoulders in a few seconds and can easily be blown into a flame . Many of them were glad enough to sell their fire-machines for a small box of Swedish matches . In districts where this method of obtaining fire is not employed the natives have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If he is a person who wears a rag of some sort , he probably has a fragment of smouldering wool or fiber tied up in a corner of his garment . If he is very scantily attired , his fire will be carefully folded up in a piece of banana leaf and attached to his spear or stick , as the case may be . In the old days of African travel no doubt any kind of cloth and beads of any size or color were welcomed everywhere ; but the old order has changed . It is true that our beads went like hot cakes round the shores of Lake Albert Edward , but when we came to the volcanoes and southward , the natives turned up their noses ( or made an equivalent grimace ) at our beautiful blue-glass beads and would have nothing of them . They said they must have red beads ? small red beads ? or none at all . In other places they wanted small blue beads or large red beads , and so on . It was the same with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another for white , and another for spotted cloth . There are as many different fashions in beads and cloth in Central Africa as there are in ladies ' hats and gowns in more civilized countries . THOUSANDS DESTROYED BY SI , EEPING-SIcKNESS IN CONGO STATE The country around the west coast of Lake Tanganyika , in the Congo Free State , has been almost entirely depopulated by sleeping-sickness , which was unknown on the shores of the lake until the year 1903 . Whole villages have been wiped out and huge tracts of fertile land along the lake which were formerly cultivated have become impenetrable jungle . One day we passed the deserted relics of a mission station which had been the center of a large settlement ; the people had all died or had migrated to a less cursed country , and there were no pupils left to be taught by the Fathers , who had , therefore , gone elsewhere . Almost daily , as we walked westward from Tanganyika , we passed corpses by the roadside , dead of the terrible sickness ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide detour to avoid some unspeakable horror . The people are brutally inhuman to the victims of the disease . So soon as a man becomes incapable of supporting himself he is turned out of the village to subsist for a short time on loathsome garbage and soon to starve like a dog . So long as I live I shall be haunted by the recollection of one of these miserable creatures who came crawling about our camp not far from Tanganyika . The porters ? " our black brothers , " as some people would call them ? were stuffing themselves on the fat of the land at the time , and though he was one of their own tribe , they jeered at his infirmities ? he could not walk , but dragged himself along the ground with his hands ? and refused to give him a scrap of the food for which he begged . Heartrending spectacles of this sort can be seen on the outskirts of almost every village between the Congo and Tanganyika . The Congo State is making strenuous efforts , by the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of the disease ; but it is a task beset with innumerable difficulties , and the medical staff of the State is hopelessly inadequate in numbers . Thus , for the whole of the RussiKivu District , which is about as large as England without Wales , there are two doctors ; for another district , which is roughly the size of Ireland , there is one doctor . So it frequently happens that an unfortunate official who falls ill in a remote station is twelve or fourteen days ' journey from the nearest doctor , who arrives only in time to find him either recovered or in his grave . CIVILIZATION IS RESPONSIBLE EOR SPREAD Or DISEASE It is only fair to say that the doctors , who are mostly Italians , work most nobly and perform wonderful feats of traveling by day and night ; but it is manifestly impossible for them to devote much time to the study of native diseases or to take very active steps towards preventing the spread of sleeping sickness . On our way down the Congo I vis- ited three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception ) were well conducted ; but with such a splendid highway as the river itself forms , it is excessively difficult to check the movements of infected but unrecognized individuals , who are a constant source of danger wherever they go . It is a lamentable fact , but one which can not be gainsaid , that civilization must be held responsible in no small degree for the spread of sleeping sickness during the last few years . In the old days , when every tribe and almost every village was self-sufficient and had no intercourse with its neighbors , except in the way of warfare , it might very well happen that the disease became localized in a few districts , where its virulence became diminished . Nowadays , with the rapid opening-up of the country , the constant passage of Europeans traveling from one district to another , and the suppression of native warfare , it is becoming increasingly easy for natives to move beyond the limits of their own countries , and by their means sleeping sickness is spread from one end of the country to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious problem which confronts Europeans in Africa , and the outlook at the present time is at the best a gloomy one . ( See also page 257 . ) Sleeping sickness , properly so called , is the name applied to the terminal stages of trypanosoma infection , or trypanosomiasis . Trypanosomes belong to the Hemoproteido , a group of the Hoemoprotozoa , organisms which inhabit the blood of many vertebrates , fishes , birds , reptiles , and mammals . The disease has been known in Africa for more than a century , but its connection with the trypanosome was not recognized until 1902 . In that year Dutton , in the Gambia Colony , found a trypanosoma , which he called Trypanosoma gainbiense , in the blood of a native suffering from a fever of nonmalarial character . In the same year Castellani , in Uganda , discovered trypanosomes in the blood and in the cerebro-spinal fluid of cases of sleeping sickness . He suggested that the parasite is  | the cause of sleeping sickness , and this has been fully proved by the researches of Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is transmitted by the tsetse-fly . IT IS CARRIED BY THE TSETSE-FLY Trypallosoina gantbiense has ' been found in West Africa from about 15 ? north to 15 ? south latitude ; it is widely spread in the Congo basin , reaching a point about 11 ? south in the L , ualaba River ; it is found in the Tanganyika region and in Uganda and along the Nile as far as 6 ? north latitude . But its distribution is not uniform over this vast area ; it corresponds with the distribution of a tsetse-fly , and is thus confined to the banks of rivers and lakes . Nothing is known of the life history of the trypanosome , and it is impossible at present to make a dogmatic statement as to the relations which exist between it and the tsetse-fly . It seems probable that the tsetse-fly serves as an alternative host in a truly biological sense and not as a simple mechanical transmitter . It has been proved beyond question that the infection is transmitted by a species of tsetse-fly ( Glossina palpalis ) , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species as well . It has been stated that a species of mosquito ( Stegonivia sp. ) is also capable of transmitting trypanosomiasis . The disease affects individuals of all ages and of both sexes . Males , perhaps , more often contract the disease than females , because they are more constantly exposed to the attacks of tsetse-flies during the course of their occupations as paddlers , fishermen , etc.  | In the advanced stages of the disease , the sufferer lies about in the corner of his hut , indifferent to everything going on about him , but still able to speak and take food if brought to him . He never spontaneously engages in conversation or even asks for food . As torpor deepens , he forgets even to chew such food as is brought to him , falling asleep , perhaps , in the act of conveying it to his mouth or with the half-masticated bolus still in his cheek . As the lethargy becomes more continuous , he wastes quickly from lack of nourishment , and the end is brought about either by coma or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reckoned as Too per cent . It is possible , but there is no definite knowledge on this point , that recovery may take place in the very early stages of trypanosomiasis , but when once the sleeping-sickness stage of the disease has been reached it is probably invariably fatal . INVESTIGATIONS BY DR KOCH Not longer ago than September , 1907 , Professor Koch , in reporting on his investigations made in Lake Victoria , added yet another terror to the already gloomy outlook on sleeping-sickness . He found a large number of cases in districts where the tsetse-fly was absent . The majority of the cases were undoubtedly imported , occurring in people who worked in the rubber industry in forests along the lake shore , where tsetse-flies abounded . But fifteen of the cases could not by any possibility have been imported . All were women and all were wives of men employed in the rubber industry in a tsetse-fly area . Assuming that no other biting insects than tsetseflies are capable of transmitting the disease , the only tenable hypothesis is that these women contracted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct , the prospect of eradicating sleeping-sickness is a sufficiently remote one , as not only can the disease be transmitted by a widely-distributed fly , but it also belongs to the category of venereal diseases , and experience of many centuries has shown the difficulty of stamping out diseases of this class . If the natives could be induced to wear some sort of light garment , they would obtain a certain measure of protection ; but water-side populations in Africa usually go even more naked than others . The most recent recommendation is that of Professor Koch , who asserts that in the neighborhood of the Victoria Nyanza the tsetse-flies subsist almost entirely on the blood of crocodiles ; he therefore suggests the extermination of these reptiles by the destruction of their eggs . It is difficult to take this suggestion really seriously , because the numbers of crocodiles are so immense , their distribution is so wide , and their powers of reproduction so great . THE TSETSE-ELY The tsetse-flies ( Glossince ) comprise ten species , which are confined to Africa . They are sombre-colored , narrow-bodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick proboscis projecting horizontally in the front of the head . When the fly is at rest the wings overlap each other , crossing like the blades of a pair of scissors . Glossina palpalis has been found from Senegal to Angola on the west , through the Congo and Lualaba to Tanganyika and the Victoria Nyanza , and northward along the Nile to the Uganda-Sudan border . The flies are seldom , if ever , found above 4,000 feet and always near water . A swampy shore is not much to their taste ; they are most commonly found along those stretches of river bank or lake shore where there is a beach of mud or sand overhung by trees or bushes . Tsetse-flies do not lay eggs , like most diptera , but larvae , which turn into the pupa condition almost immediately after extrusion . The perfect flies , both male and female , are blood-suckers . They feed during the day , and by reason of their exceedingly rapid flight and the extraordinary softness with which they alight on their victims , it is very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
