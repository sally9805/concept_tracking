I HAVE been honored by the National Geographic Society in being asked to make an address , under its auspices , on the subject of Bolivia , my country . I accepted the invitation with pleasure , coming , as it did , at the time when the recent historic visit of the Secretary of State , Mr Root , to South America has awakened special interest toward the republics situated south of the Isthmus of Panama . It may be said that the foresightedness and wisdom of this great statesman has torn the veil that obscured the vision of those republics and revealed to this country the young nations striving for progress and peaceful development . I was fortunate in hearing the addresses of the honorable Secretary of State , delivered in Kansas City* and in Cincinnati , and I earnestly recommend to all of those who are interested in the prosperity of the sister republics , and in fostering our mutual relations , to study them with careful attention . You are aware of the spontaneous ovations with which Mr Root was received by the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , he gained the esteem and the confidence of the southern republics . With feeling and eloquent words he interpreted the sentiments of this great nation and the message of peace , of fraternity , and of respect for their sovereignty was proclaimed to the world by one of the highest officials as well as one of the most eminent citizens of this country . The reception of Mr Root in South America , besides being a personal tribute offered to his merits , was the sincerest expression of good will with which they accepted the proffer of friendship sent by the government and the people of North America . In his last message sent to Congress , the great American who so brilliantly guides the destiny of this Republic has confirmed in clear and forcible words the friendly declarations of the Secretary of State , thus giving them governmental sanction and dispelling the mistrust created under the wrong impression that the United States had designs on establishing its supremacy and dominion over all the continent . The words of President Roosevelt reveal the high spirit of justice that guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square deal " to international relations . If the progress and stability that prevail in the South American republics had not been known by Mr Root and he had gone on his visit expecting to see some of the insurrections which are supposed to be occurring constantly , he would have been greatly disappointed . In place of military chiefs arrayed against each other , of cities given over to disorder and war , he would have found , as he did find , peoples filled with life and anxious to put themselves on a level with the most advanced of the globe . OUR PAST DID NOT TRAIN US FOR THE EXERCISE OF LIBERTY We have inherited from our ancestors traditions little suited for the exercise of liberty and the respect for human personality . Our education was not like that of the English colonies in North America ; the political life of the Spanish colonies was controlled by the delegates of the crown , and the people had nothing to do but to blindly obey . In honor of the good intentions of the  |p573  mother country , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very paternal dispositions in favor of the distant American dominions and of the aborigines whose fate is and has been so cruel . In practice it was another thing ; the Hispano-Americans were excluded from all the most important posts and lived in a depressive condition as compared with that of the men from the Spanish peninsula . In regard to the great mass of aborigines , their position was much sadder than that of slaves . Condemned and forced to work in the mines by drafts , called mitas ; excluded from the benefits of instruction and deprived of all their rights , they acquired the vices of the conquerors and lost the virtues of their ancestors . In order that we may form an idea of the despotism to which the descendants of the Inca Empire were subjected , it may be mentioned that they , a race of beardless men , were compelled to buy shaving razors , and for an Indian to appear on horseback was considered a misdemeanor punishable by whipping . The Spanish possessions in America were closed to all contact with the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . The fundamental principle of government was to exact absolute obedience to the king and his representatives , and in religious matters , under the withering hand of the Inquisition , freedom of conscience was condemned . Such conditions were not the best preparation for beginning the life of independent republics and to proceed without stumbling . The people of the United States of North America not only imbibed from their English ancestors the love of order and habits of liberty , but had a vast territory free from obstacles , fruitful and watered by great rivers , and placed opposite Europe , from whence came a constant current of immigration that has greatly contributed to its advancement . The Latin republics of South America , although occupying a territory more than double the size of the United States , encounter the great barrier of the Andes through the continent , from north to south , preventing the communication of the peoples . The distance separating them from Europe is almost twice as great and much more difficult to travel . The immigrant arrives in this country in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage to South America is so long and so costly as to prevent him from going there . In order to correctly judge the conditions and the development of the English colonies after their emancipation , as compared with the progress made by the Spanish colonies , it is well not to forget these circumstances . The Spanish conquerors have left behind them a legend unrivaled in the world 's annals for audacity and perseverance . If they had displayed less cruelty toward the vanquished and greater respect for human rights and less thirst for gold , the pages of their history would be the most brilliant of mankind . We , their descendants , if we inherit many of their defects , have also the noble qualities that make the Spanish people the most chivalrous of Europe , with a history filled with great examples of patriotism and heroic achievement . THE VAST INCA EMPIRE WHICH FLOURISHED FOR 500 YEARS AND IN WHICH PROPERTY IN LAND DID NOT EXIST Before I begin to speak of the actual conditions in Bolivia , permit me to draw a sketch of the historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altitude of 12,500 feet above the level of the sea and secluded between two great branches of the Andes , lies the mysterious Lake Titicaca , whose waters form the boundary between Peru and Bolivia . There , on the Bolivian side , is found , among others , the Island of the Sun , from whence pro/ ceeded , according to tradition , Manco Capac , his wife and sister , Mama Ocllo , tfounders of the Inca Empire . They claimed to be direct descendants of the sun and came to the world to civilize it and to establish the reign of peace and good will . Manco Capac taught the men to cultivate the soil , while his wife instructed the women in the art of spinning and weaving . And thus , under a theocratic and paternal government was developed a vast empire ? the grandest experiment of an organized communism recorded by history . Gareilazo de la Vega , in a work entitled " Royal Commentaries , " has left us an attractive and simple picture of this admirable social organization , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general wellbeing . Property in land did not exist ; the fields were allotted periodically and the harvests were divided into three parts , destined to the Inca , to the maintenance of worship , and to the public in general . The paternalism of the Incas went as far as to exercise a permanent vigilance over the private life , as their subjects were not permitted to have their doors closed ; so that all their acts might be subject to inspection by the authorities . The Inca Empire , during the five centuries of its existence , extended in the north to the present confines of the Republic of Colombia , and south as far as Chile and the northern part of Argentina , embracing a great portion of the Pacific coast , and all of the territory of the present republics of Ecuador , Peru , Bolivia , and northern Chile . Attesting the advanced degree of its civilization are the monuments remaining on the Island of the Sun and those of Cozco , as well as the ruins of the magnificent system of roads throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or twenty millions of inhabitants , it fell as a statue of clay before a few score of adventurous Spaniards , who in a few years made themselves masters of the country and submitted the inhabitants to servitude , almost without resistance . Educated in the religious respect of the sacred power of the descendants of the Sun , they had lost the strength and manhood of nations invigorated by individual freedom . The power under whose shadow they had lived being broken and destroyed and being suddenly left to themselves , the subjects of the Incas fell easily under the dominion of the conquerors , whose arrival confirmed the popular tradition that some day men with beards would come from over the seas and take their homes . CITIES OE GOLD AND SILVER Once possessed of the country , the Spanish extended rapidly their search for gold and silver throughout the territory . In 1548 Alonzo de Mendoza founded La Paz , today one of the principal cities of Bolivia , attracted thither by the rich gold ore of the rivers of that section . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced great quantities of gold and nuggets of considerable value . In 1718 the Marquis de Castel Fuerte sent to Madrid a nugget weighing 76o ounces of gold , and recently the German company that works these mines sold , among other nuggets , one encrusted in quartz weighing 52% ounces , of which 47 ounces were gold . It may be affirmed that all of the rivers in the vicinity of La Paz flowing from the Cordilleras carry gold . The city of Potosi was founded in 1545 , and fifty years later it had reached a population of 16o,000 because of the enormous richness of the mountain at whose foothills stand the city . The quantity of silver produced by the mines of Potosi for more than three centuries is fabulous and has made its name a synonym of wealth . The city became a goal for all classes of adventurers , bankrupt Spanish nobles , merchants anxious to make fortunes , and all kinds of men contributed to make Potosi a center of prodigality , of romantic adventure and disorder . p 575 The chronicles of Potosi are interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those ages , with all their preoccupations and fanaticism as well as the spirit of chivalry and love of adventure . Spanish hidalgoes prided themselves on squandering great fortunes in feasts and revelry , which often caused strife among the bands in which the city was often divided . ANECDOTES OT THE MINERS The anecdotes of those times that have reached us are really curious and amusing , and as samples I will relate some of them : A miner named Quiroz was one of the most fortunate of his day ? a man of generous spirit , who by his liberality won the affection of his fellow-men . It is related that he caused to be made a series of drawers in an immense wardrobe in his home , and in each drawer . he would put a sum of money , varying from one to thousands of dollar : Then , as today , there was no lack of men anxious to secure a living without work , and when any one presented himself to ask for help he was ordered to open one of the drawers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proverb ; it was said , " After . God , Quiros " ( Despues de Dios , Quiroz ) . On a certain feast day the butlers of two great houses met in the public market , and both wished to purchase a certain delicacy , very rare in such a place as Potosi . The competition was started between the two , who tried to outbid each other . One of the butlers , believing that the price had gone too high , and that he had done enough to uphold the name of his master , left the other with the coveted prize , and when he reachedhome and related what had occurred he was promptly discharged for not having sustained the honor of the house and allowed the other fellow to get the best of him . One of the characteristics of those times was the religious fanaticism ; and the miners , in order to insure their salvation or pardon for their sins , donated enormous sums of money for the building of churches and convents , and this explains why so many churches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those days did not possess the broad and high mind of our own Carnegie , who has once more shown his noble ambition by his recent magnificent gift of $750,000 toward the building of the palace for the use of the Bureau of the American Republics , which will be a lasting monument to their friendship and the cosmopolitan sentiments of its promoters . If in political and administrative affairs the sovereign will of the king and his representatives was the law , so in domestic life the father , as chief of the family , was equally the supreme ruler , the wife and children being his subjects . It may surprise the young ladies to hear that in many cases the contracting parties , whose marriages were always arranged by the respective fathers , did not know each other until the time of the ceremony which was to link them together for life as man and wife . For fear that the girls would employ their time in writing love letters , many fathers prohibited their daughters from learning to write , and the . only books to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of the saints . Despotism feared light , and books not approved and selected by the ecclesiastical authorities were strictly forbidden . It is easy to see that public instruction was very limited and little encouraged . The city of Sucre , capital of , Bolivia , known in colonial times as Charcas , had an university and was the residence of the Royal Audiencia , whose jurisdiction extended over all the territory that today constitutes Bolivia , and it was at the same time the highest tribunal of justice and the delegated authority of the king in administrative affairs . THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE Thus , under the reign of absolute submission to the crown of Spain and its representatives , the colonies of South  |p576  America lived condemned to inaction and outside of the march of progress of the world , until the social upheaval known as the French revolution changed the basis of modern society and made its influence felt in the far-off Spanish colonies . Contemporaneously the English colonies of North America had won their independence and organized a federal republic , destined to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life-giving influence of democracy . These great historic events encouraged the Hispano-American colonies to fight for their freedom , which they had longed to attain . The invasion of Spain by Napoleon and the capture of Ferdinando VII offered a favorable opportunity for a general uprising . The city of La Paz was among the first to openly proclaim independence , and on the 16th of July , 1809 , organized a Junta Fuitiva , called to advance the noble work of political redemption of all the continent . Spain tried to drown the revolution in blood . and committed the most atrocious deeds . The chiefs of the revolution were condemned to death , and , as a lesson and warning , their bodies were quartered and placed on poles along the public roads . The hour of regeneration , however , had arrived , and nothing could stop the efforts of a people determined to secure their freedom . The stubborn fight continued for fifteen years . The territory of Alto Peru , now Bolivia , was the theater of daily combats , and there was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generous blood of her sons fighting for liberty . As illustrating cruelties perpetrated by the Spaniards . it is stated that once they entered the city of Tarifa carrying on their lances the heads of the patriots killed on the - field of battle . The victory of Ayacucho , on the 9th of December , 1824 , won by the Venezuelan General Antonio Jose de Sucre . terminated the war , and thus the South American countries secured their emancipation . The provinces of Upper Peru held the first national congress in Sucre , and on the 6th of August , 1825 , was proclaimed and established the Republic of Bolivia . UNHAPPY BECAUSE OF ' MILITARY PRESIDENTS The independent life of Bolivia began under auspicious circumstances . Under the enlightened guidance of Sucre , the victor of Ayacucho , a hero illustrious for his virtues , his love of progress , as well as his deep respect for the law , the Republic without doubt might have advanced rapidly toward the path of freedom and order ; but unfortunately a military insurrection , prompted by intrigues of neighbors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the resignation of the presidency of Sucre . He was succeeded by General Santa Cruz , who , called by one of the factions in which Peru was divided , invaded that republic and organized the Peru-Bolivian Confederation . With the title of Supreme Protector , he occupied with Bolivian troops the capital of Lima , where he fixed his residence ; but , owing to the opposition of the contrary bands , aided by Chile , fearful of the increased power that the Peru-Bolivian Confederation might develop , put an end to it in a few years . With Santa Cruz began the sad period of military chiefs and the efforts of the people to free themselves by the disastrous remedy of revolution , whose fatal influence was shown when , weakened and divided by our internal dissensions , we were worsted in the war with Chile . The disasters and losses resulting from this war awakened the patriotic sentiment of the nation , and then the Bolivians undertook to repair by peace and work the losses caused by anarchy . Today the country is peaceful , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of her energies to develop the riches with which Providence has endowed her soil . If I have not tired your kind attention I will draw a rapid sketch of the present conditions of my country , her government , and the work being done to make productive the mineral and vegetable wealth of her territory . THE GEOGRAPHY OF BOLIVIA The great geological disturbances that in remote ages transformed the continent of South America and produced the wonderful upliftings of the Andes are very marked in Bolivia . This mountain chain , traversing the whole length of the continent , divides itself in Bolivia into two principal branches ? the one of the west , forming a kind of wall between the sea and the interior , closely follows the coast ; the other , extending toward the east and known as the Cordillera Real , presents a series of majestic peaks eternally resplendent in crowns of snow and lifting their heads to heights of more than 21,000 feet , as the Illimani , and the Illampu , with 21,700 , and others equally imposing . The high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square miles , with a mean altitude of from 10,000 to 13,000 feet above sea-level . It is difficult to say whether the obstacles offered by the vast mountain walls to free traffic and the communication of the people is not more than compensated by the prodigious quantity of minerals they contain , and that make Bolivia one of the richest countries of the globe . The forests and vast plains extending eastward , with about 7,000 miles of navigable rivers , comprise a fertile agricultural territory embracing more than 300.000 square miles . The total area of Bolivia is more or less 709,000 square miles , and it is therefore the third nation of South America , as regards size ; but unfortunately the population does . not yet correspond to its extensive territory , amounting only to a little more than 2% millions . As the Spaniards settled first in the mining regions , the section of Bolivia situated east of the Cordillera Real , which includes the extensive territories watered by the tributaries of the Amazon and the Plata , is the least populated . There are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial purposes , such as railway ties , building and cabinet-making . Some of these woods are as hard as iron . Rubber , Peruvian bark , and a multitude of useful and medicinal plants abound in this soil , whose wonderful fertility could easily support many millions of inhabitants . The coffee and cocoa are conceded to be of the finest quality , and fruits and all tropical products are abundant . The climate is generally healthful and suitable for settlement by European races . The mean temperature of the lowlands of the Amazon to an altitude of 2,000 feet above sea-level is 74 ? ; to an altitude of 8,000 , it is 66 ? ; and in the central plain , where the altitude varies from Io , 000 to 12,000 feet , it is 5o ? . It is calculated . that to every 181 meters of ascent in the mountains there is a drop of one degree in the temperature . It may be said that in Bolivia there are only two seasons ? the rainy season , which . corresponds to summer , and extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , season , lasting from May to December . In the latter months it seldom , rains and the sky is clear and bright . The rains are more copious in the east , . and at times the rivers overflow and rise as high as ten meters above their ordinary level . Almost all of the navigable rivers of Bolivia flow into the Amazon , the most important being the Beni , which receives the Madre de Dios , the Orton , and others before reaching its confluence with the Mamore , when it takes the name of Madeira , one of the most powerful tributaries of the Amazon . Unfortunately the navigation of this great river is obstructed by a series of very dangerous rapids . The government of Brazil has agreed by treaty to construct a railroad  |p578  : around these rapids and thus expedite the Amazon route . The Pilcomayo and the Bernejo are also rivers of importance that flow toward the southeast and empty into the Paraguay . The eastern region of Bolivia is also rich in grazing lands , where the stock industry promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds of wild cattle roaming over the lands . Lake Titicaca , on the boundary line " between Peru and Bolivia , is notable for its great altitude , for its romantic traditions , and for the monuments of that distant epoch yet standing on the Island of the Sun . The lake 's surface extends over an area of more than 5,200 square miles . If the natural exuberance and richness of the eastern section of Bolivia is remarkable for its products , the region of the Cordilleras is , I will say , the great storehouse of mineral wealth . The silver mines of Potosi , Oruro , Colquechaca , Huanchaca , and many others have contributed hundreds of millions to the richness of the world . No less abundant are the deposits of copper , bismuth , zinc , co " bait , gold , and tin . On speaking of the commerce of Bolivia I will mention the quantities of these minerals exported today . THIS COMMERCE OF BOLIVIA The main causes that hinder the development of Bolivia 's wealth are : The diffi=culty and cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population . To what an extent the high rate of freight hinders the growth of industries in Bolivia , it is enough to state that coal at the seacoast is worth from 18 to 25 shillings , or , say , $4 to $6 , more or less , per ton ; taken to the mines in the interior of Bolivia , according to the distance , yet this may not exceed five hundred miles , and the price will be from $4o to $80 . A large number of mining enterprises , as well as the eight banking institutions , are financed with national funds . Recently two German banks have been established in ha Paz . The constitution of Bolivia is very liberal and is based on the unitarian system of central government . The President is elected every four years by direct popular vote . The legislative power is exercised by a senate and house of deputies , and the judiciary by a supreme court appointed by the senate , and by inferior courts and other judges . Foreigners enjoy the same franchises as the natives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all in conformity with the laws . Bolivia is the only country in South America that has not suffered from earthquakes , and when felt they were almost imperceptible and of no consequence . Within the last few years the international commerce of Bolivia has increased considerably . In 1905 it reached 69,665 , - 000 in Bolivian money ? an increase of thirty per cent over the figures of the previous year ? and according to the statement of President Montes in his last message to Congress , in 1906 it will reach 8o millions , and when the railroads now in course of construction are completed these figures could be easily doubled in a short time . The commerce with the United States has also grown in recent years , and the construction of the railways will greatly augment the present movement . The importations into Bolivia in 1905 amounted to $I , 720,000 ; and yet this small sum is a large increase compared with previous years . On the other hand , the importations of Bolivian products into the United States hardly reached-$6o,000 , while Bolivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peruvian bark , and many other articles of great consumption in the United States , and which are purchased in Europe to be brought here . The exportation of silver averages 13,000,000 ounces a year ; of copper , 5,000 tons , more or less ; the production of tin grows from year to year , so that from 1897 , or ten years ago , when the production was about 3,000 tons , it had reached 17,000 in 1905 , and during the  |p579  past year it is probable that the exportations exceeded 20,000 tons of pure tin . It is impossible to foresee the marvelous development that railway facilities will offer to this industry , as well as to the general progress of the country . Bismuth , zinc , and gold represent quantities no less important . In spite of all the obstacles that the Bolivian industrials have encountered on passing through the Amazon , the exportation of rubber in 1905 amounted to 1,700,000 kilos . This is a product whose output could be easily increased when the railroads are completed . Sir Martin Conway calculates as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees in the region of the Upper Beni alone . Each tree is supposed to yield annually from three to seven pounds of rubber . Bolivia also exports considerable quantities of alpaca wool , the finest chinchilla and vicuna skins , and other national products . The position Bolivia occupies in the heart of South America gives to her commercial and international importance , and , although deprived of her coast on the Pacific , she is in immediate contact with five of the most advanced republics ; and it is to their interest to encourage mutual trade for the benefits that will naturally result . And this is not all . The main railway line under construction in Bolivia has a continental bearing , for the connection that it will establish between the Argentine system , that is now being extended to the interior of Bolivia , with the Peruvian railroads coming from the north and the Pacific coast . Then Lima in Peru , La Paz in Bolivia , and Buenos Aires in Argentina will be united within a few years by a continuous railway spanning the 2,500 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru , on the Pacific , from the capital of Argentina , on the Atlantic , and will form an important section of the Pan-American Railway . For the first time United States capitalists are taking an interest in the construction of railways in that section of South America . The Argentine roads were built with English capital , and the same is the case with those of Brazil and Chile , where the majority of the roads are government property . Peru constructed her railways with national funds , but had to cede them for a term of years to her English creditors . Bolivia , then , is the first country where , in cooperation with the Bolivian national resources , American capital is being invested . NEARLY I , 000 MILLS OF ' RAILROADS TO BE BUILT BY AMERICAN CAPITAL It has been my aim and I had the good fortune to succeed in interesting representative New York bankers in the great work of giving life to my country by means of roads through rich deposits of minerals and open to the world her virgin forests . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is today being executed . The lines to be constructed by the American syndicate are from La Paz to Tupiza , 530 miles ; Oruro to Cochabamba , 133 miles , and La Paz to Puerto Pando , 200 miles ; in all , 863 miles . Of these railroads the one from La Paz , passing by Oruro and Potosi to Tupiza , will form the chain uniting the republics of the Pacific with those of the Atlantic , besides traversing the richest metallic zone that exists , perhaps , in the world . The line from Oruro to Cochabamba will open to commerce the fertile valleys of the interior of that section , the most thickly populated of Bolivia , and make that part of the country accessible to the navigable branches of the Mamore . The railroad from La Paz to Puerto Pando , a port situated at the headwaters of the Beni , will open the territories of the Beni , where rubber grows in such abundance , coffee , and all the most precious tropical products , as well as the various classes of woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours from the frigid zone of the high plains ; where there is practically no vegetation , to the tropical region of the orange and the sugarcane . In a distance  |p580  of less than thirty miles the traveler will be transported , as if by magic , from a temperature of perhaps 400 or less to one of 7o ? or more , as he descends through wonderful scenery to the other side of the great eastern chain of the Andes . But these railroads are not the only ones called to transform in some years the economic life of Bolivia and give to her rank and importance to which her size and position entitle her . By a treaty of peace recently celebrated with Chile , that republic agrees to build , and work has already commenced , a railroad from Arica to La Paz , a distance of some 309 miles . That line will unite Bolivia with the Pacific by a road much more direct than that at present afforded by the Antofagasta line , which is 575 miles long , or that from Mollendo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . The Arica road will bring the city of La Paz within 8 or lo hours ' time of the coast . The Bolivian Congress authorized more than a year ago the building of a railway from the borders of the Paraguay River to Santa Cruz , one of the most mediterranean cities , but destined to become one of great importance . The projectors have deposited the sum of 100,000 pesos as a guarantee for the execution of the contract , and the construction materials have begun to be transported by way of the Plata and Paraguay Rivers . The length of this line will be 497 miles . This route will offer free communication to the rich oriental zone by way of the Plata and the Paraguay , and open to immigration and progress a territory of more than 242,000 square miles , watered by large rivers and of remarkable fertility . There are on foot other projects of railway construction of no less importance . Progress is like oil , which spreads itself wherever it touches . Some years more of work and effort in preparing transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity , and immigration , the future greatness of Bolivia is assured . THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF SOUTH AMERICAM Before concluding this already too long address , permit me to call your attention to the fact that what is being done in Bolivia is also in progress in the majority of the South American republics . Argentina , for instance , by receiving an increasing current of immigration , is rapidly developing her wonderful resources . If some of them have not yet succeeded in getting over the fatal disease of internal turmoil , it will not be long before they enter the road of order , and Mr Root 's prophecy that the twentieth century will be South America 's century will be fulfilled . Slowly but surely the onward march of progress brings closer and closer the South American republics , guided by the eternal force of liberty and the broadest sentiments of universal fellowship , common origin , and interests . I venture the hope that in no distant future a confederation of Peru , Bolivia , Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , and Paraguay , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Ecuador , Venezuela , and Colombia , reunited , and Brazil will form a trinity of nations that , with their sisters of the North , will be the beacon light of the world , shining with the undimmed brightness of human rights , peace , and happiness . Asia is already populated with many hundreds of millions of people whose races , civilization , and traditions will never , perhaps , ' assimilate with those of Europe ; Africa has been carved among the powers of Europe ; this New World , then , remains , where the political traditions of the Old World are broken and democracy will be supreme . Never was there proclaimed a more vital , lasting , or grander principle than the Monroe Doctrine , which , in its purest interpretation , is the consecration of all America to republican life ; that is to say ,  |p583  the dignification of man and the empire of justice and the right to work out his own destiny without the tutelage of kings or classes or any other sovereignty than that of citizen and ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the history and civilization of Europe ; we study the books of her thinkers ; enjoy the magnificent works of her artists , of her poets , and of all those who have so highly elevated the intellectual level of mankind . We desire and solicit the concourse of her noble races ; but in the political order the whole America is destined to be the throne of liberty and right , where mankind will advance to the highest ideals of his divine mission in the world . And when the barrier separating this grand Republic from her sisters of the South is removed by the completion of the Panama Canal , the two great oceans made one , it is necessary that the bonds of union and of mutual interest and respect be already established on the firm basis of peace and justice . The Panama Canal will open a new horizon to commerce , and it might be said that it will be the material consecration of the Monroe Doctrine , which excludes conquest from America , where , under the inspiration of democracy , freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  |p586
