 |p777  LORD ROSEBERY is at the present moment the man in English political life upon whom the eyes of expectation are turned . He is a younger man than most of his political colleagues and rivals , but it is not because of his comparative youth that the eyes of expectation are turned upon him . Not one of those who stand in the front ranks of Parliamentary life to-day could be called old , as we reckon age in our modern estimate . Palmerston , Gladstone , and Disraeli won their highest ' political triumphs after they had passed the age which Lord Salisbury and Sir William Harcourt have now reached ; Mr. Balfour is still regarded in politics as quite a young man , and Sir Henry CampbellBannerman has but lately been elected leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons . Lord Rosebery 's star is again rising and at the present moment it is the only star that seems to be mounting in the political sky . He has already held the highest political offices . He has been Foreign Secretary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the Liberal party . No other public man in England has so many and so varied mental gifts , and no other public man has won success in so many distinct fields . We live in days when , for the time at least , the great political orator seems to have passed out of existence . The last great English orator died at Hawarden less than two years ago . We have , however , several brilliant and powerful Parliamenttary debaters , and among these Lord Rosebery stands with the foremost , if he is not , indeed , absolutely the foremost . As . in orator on what I may call great ceremonial occasions he is , according to my judgment , the very foremost we now have . As an after-dinner speaker ? and after dinner speaking counts for a great deal in the success of an English public man ? he has never had an equal in England during my time . Then Lord Rosebery has delivered lectures or addresses in commemoration of great poets and philosophers and statesmen which may even already be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosebery is a literary man , an author as well as a statesman and an orator ; he has written a life of Pitt which is already becoming a sort of classic in our libraries . There are profounder students , men more deeply read , than he , but I doubt if there are many men living who have so wide an acquaintance with general literature . He is a lover of art , a student and a connoisseur of art , he is an accomplished yachtsman , has a thorough knowledge of horses , is famous on the turf , and the owner of a horse that won the Derby . The legendary fairy godmother seems to have showered upon him at his birth all her richest and most various gifts , and no malign and jealous sprite seems to have come in , as in the nursery stories , to spoil any of the gifts by a counteracting spell . He was born of great family and born to high estate ; he married a daughter of the house of Rothschild ; he has a lordly home near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West End square of London , and , a delightful residence in one of our most beautiful English counties . Lord Rosebery is one of the most delightful talkers whom it has ever been my good fortune to meet . He has a keen sense of humor , a happy art of light and delicate satire , and , in private conversation as well as in Parliamentary debate , he has a singular facility for the invention of expressive and successful phrases which tell their whole story in a flash . One might well be inclined to ask what the kindly fates could have done for Lord Rosebery that they have left undone . Nevertheless , the truth has to be told , that tip to this time Lord Rosebery has not accomplished as much of greatness as most of us confidently expected that he would achieve . Let it be said at once , on the other hand , that the public , so far from having lost faith in him , are even now turning their eyes to him as to the one man who can be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home as well as abroad . Lord Rosebery is now in very much the same position as Lord Palmerston was at a great crisis during the Crimean War , when everybody saw that somehow or other things were all going wrong , and everybody looked to Lord Palmerston as the one man who must be called upon to take his chance of putting them right again . I have been , perhaps , somewhat too hasty when I said that no counteracting spell had in any way marred the influence of the gifts which the fairies had so lavishly bestowed on Lord Rosebery . One stroke of ill fortune ill fortune , that is , for an English political leader ? was certainly directed against him . Nature must have meant him to be a successful Prime Minister , and yet fortune denied him a seat in the House of Commons . He succeeded to his grandfather 's peerage at an early period of his life , and he had to begin his political career as a member of the House of Lords . He therefore missed all that splendid training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons . It would not , perhaps , be quite easy for an American reader to understand how little the House of Lords counts for in the education of fighting statesmen . When Charles James Fox was told in his declining years that the King , as a mark of royal favor , intended to make him a peer and thus remove him from the House of Commons into the House of Lords , he struck his forehead and exclaimed : " Good Heaven 1 he does not think it has come to that with me , does he ? " Fox had had all the training that his genius needed in the House of Commons , and he was not condemned to pass into the House of Lords . Nothing but the inborn consciousness of a genius for political debate can stimulate a man to great effort in the House of Lords . Nothing turns upon a debate in that House . If a majority in the House of Lords were to pass a vote of censure three times a week on the existing Government , that Government would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public in general would hardly know that the Lords had been expressing any opinion on the subject . An ordinary sitting of the House of Lords is not expected to last for more than an hour or so , and the whole assembly often consists of some half a dozen peers Now and again , during the course of a session , there is got up what may be called a full-dress debate , when some great question is disturbing the country , and the peers think that they ought to put on the appearance of being deeply concerned about it , and some noble lord who has a repute for wisdom or for eloquence gives notice of a formal motion , and then there is a lengthened discussion , and perhaps , on soma extraordinary occasion , the peers may sit to a late hour and even take a division . But on such remarkable occasions the peer who induces the House to come together and listen to his oration is almost sure to be one who has had his training in the House of Commons and has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but regard it as a striking evidence of Lord Rosebery 's inborn fitness to be an English political leader that he should have got over the dreary discouragement of such a training-school , and should have practiced the art of political oratory under conditions that might have filled Demosthenes himself with a sense of the futility of trying to make a great speech where nothing whatever was likely to come of it . Lord Rosebery , however , did succeed in proving to the House of Lords that they had among them a brilliant and powerful debater who had qualified himself for success without any help from the school in which Lord Brougham and the brilliant Lord Derby , L rd Cairns , and Lord Salisbury had studied and mastered the art of Parliamentary eloquence . But , indeed , Lord Rosebery seems to have had a natural inclination to seek and find a training-school for his abilities in places and pursuits that might have seemed very much out of the ordinary British aristocrat 's way . Until a comparatively recent period , we had nothing that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of London . We had , of course , the Lord Mayor and the municipality of the City of London , but then the City of London is only a very small patch in the great metropolis that holds more than five millions of people . London , outside the City , was governed by the old-fashioned parish vestries , and to some extent by a more recent institution which was called the  |p780  Metropolitan Board of Works . Now , the Metropolitan Board of Works did not manage its affairs very well . There were disagreeable rumors and stories about contracts and jobbing and that sort of thing , and although matters were never supposed to have been quite so bad as they were in New York during days which I can remember well , the days of Boss Tweed , there was enough of public complaint to induce Parliament , at the instigation of Lord Randolph Churchill , to abolish the Board of Works altogether and set up the London County Council , a thoroughly representative body elected by popular suffrage and responsible to its constituents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , into the promotion of this better system of London municipal government . He became a member of the London County Council , was elected its first Chairman . and later on was re-elected to the same office . Now , I think it would be hardly possible for a man of Lord Rosebery 's rank and culture and tastes to give a more genuine proof of patriotic public spirit than he did when he threw himself heart and soul into the business of a municipal council . Up to that time the business of a London municipality had been regarded as something belonging entirely to the middle class or the lower middle class , something with which peers and nobles could not possibly be expected to have anything to do . A London Alderman had been from time out of mind a sort of figure of fun , a vulgar , fussy kind of person , who bedizened himself in gaudy robes on festive occasions , and was noted for his love of the turtle in quite a different sense from that which Byron gives to the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal government at a most critical period in its history , and his example was followed by men of rank and culture , and some of the most intellectual men of our day have been elected Aldermen of the London County Council . Only think of Frederic Harrison , the celebrated Positivist philosopher , the man of exquisite culture and refinement , the man of almost fastidious ways , the scholar and the writer , becoming an Alderman of the London County Council , and devoting himself to the work of his position I Lord Rosebery undoubtedly has the honor of having done more than any other Englishman to raise the municipal government of London to that position which it ought to have in the public life of the State . All that time Lord Rosebery was not neglecting any of the other functions and occupations which had been imposed upon him , or which he had voluntarily taken upon himself . He held the office of first Commissioner of Works in one of Mr. Gladstone 's administrations , an office which involves the care of all the State buildings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen at the private views of the Royal Academy and the other great picture galleries of the London season . He was always starting some new movement for the improvement of the breed of horses and , indeed , there is a certain section of our community among whom Lord Rosebery was regarded , not as a statesman , or a London County Councilor , or a lover of literature , but simply and altogether as a patron of the turf . Meanwhile we were hearing of him every now and then as an adventurous yachtsman , and as the orator of some great commemoration day when a statue was unveiled to a Burke or a Burns . A more delightful host than Lord Rosebery it would not be possible to meet or even to imagine . I have had the honor of enjoying his hospitality at Dalmeny and in his London home , and I shall only say that those were occasions which I may describe , in the words which Carlyle employed with a less gladsome significance , . as not easily to be forgotten in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics of conversation . Politics , travel , art , letters , the life of great cities , the growth of commerce , the tendencies of civilizations , the art of living , the philosophy of life , the way to enjoy life , the various characteristics of foreign capitals ? on all such topics Lord Rosebery can speak with the clearness of one who knows his subject and with the vivacity of one who can put his thoughts into the most expressive words . I suppose there must be some authors in modern literature with whose works Lord Rosebery is not familear , but I can only say that if there be any such , I have not yet discovered who they are ? and I have spent a good deal  |p781  of my time in the reading of books . I have seen Lord Rosebery in companies where painters and sculptors and the writers of books and the writers of plays formed the majority , where political subjects were not touched upon , and I have observeded that Lord Rosebery could hold his own with each practitioner of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not profess to be a bookworm or a great scholar , but I do not know any man better acquainted with general literature . Such a man must surely have got ou of life all the best that it has to give . Yet it is certain , as I said in the beginning of this article , that the eyes of expectation are still turned upon Lord Rosebery . There is a general conviction that he has something yet to do ? that , in fact , he has not yet given his measure . He has been Prime Minister , and he has been leader of the English Liberal party , but in neither case had he a chance of proving his strength . When Mr. Gladstone made up his mind to retire finally from political life , the Queen sent for Lord Rosebery and invited him to form an administration . Now , it is no secret that at that time there were men in the Liberal party whose friends and admirers believed that their length of service gave them a precedence of claims over the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harcourt had won for himself a right to be chosen as the successor to Mr. Gladstone . On the other side -- for there was grumbling on both sides -- there were members of the Liberal administration who positively declined to continue in office if Sir William Harcourt were made Prime Minister . These men did not object to serve under Sir William Harcourt as leader of the House of Commons , but they objected to his elevation to the supreme place of Prime Minister . Moreover , there were Liberals of great influence who , while they had the fullest confidence in Lord Rosebery and were not fanatically devoted to Sir William Harcourt , objected to the idea of having a Prime Minister in the I-louse of Lords , and a Prime Minister , too , who had never sat in the House of Commons . Now , it would be idle to deny that there was some practical reason for this objection . The House of Commons is the field on which political battles are fought and won . The commander-in-chief ought always to be within reach . A whole plan of campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour 's notice . It must obviously often be highly inconvenient to have a Prime Minister who can not cross the threshold of the House of Commons in order to get into instant communication with the leading men of his own party who are fighting the battle . At all events , I am now only concerned to say that these doubts and difficulties and private disputations did arise , and that , although Lord Rosebery did accept the position of Prime Minister , he must have clone so with some knowledge of the fact that certain of his colleagues were not quite satisfied with the new conditions . Lord Rosebery had been most successful as Foreign Secretary during each term when he held the office , but it was well known before Mr. Gladstone 's retirement that there were some questions of foreign policy on which the old leader and the new were not quite of one opinion . In English political life , and I suppose in the political life of every self-governing country , there are seasons of inevitable action and reaction which must be observed and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant observer the policy of the Liberal party might have seemed just the same after Mr. Gladstone had retired from politics as it was when he was in the front of political life . But just as the policy which sustained him in his early days as Prime Minister was helped by the reaction which had set in against the aggressive policy of Lord Palmerston , so there came , with the close of Gladstone 's Parliamentary career , a kind of reaction against his counsel of peace and moderation . Lord Rosebery was believed to have more of what is called the Imperialist spirit in him than had ever guided the policy of his great leader . Certainly some of Mr. Gladstone 's former colleagues in the House of Commons appear to have thought so , and there began to be signs of a growing division in the party . Lord Rosebery 's Prime Ministership lasted but a short time . The Government sustained one or two Parliamentary discomfitures , and there followed upon these a positive defeat in the nature of a sort of vote of censure carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground of an alleged insufficiency in some of the supplies of ammunition for military service . Many a Government would have professed to think little of such a defeat , would have treated it only as a mere question of departmental detail , and would have gone on as if nothing had happened . But Lord Rosebery refused to take things so coolly and so carelessly . Probably he was growing tired of his position under the peculiar circumstances . Perhaps he thought the most manly course he could take was to give the constituencies the opportunity of saying whether they were satisfied with his administration or were not . The Government appealed to the country . Parliament was dissolved , and a general election followed . Then was seen the full force of the reaction which had begun to set in against the Gladstone policy of peace , moderation , and justice . The Conservatives came into power by a large majority . Lord Rosebery was now merely the leader of the Liberal party in opposition . Even this position he did not long retain . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Lords were made during this time , but somehow people began to think that his heart was not in the leadership , and before long it was made known to the public that he had ceased to be the Liberal commander-inchief . Everybody , of course , was ready with an explanation as to this sudden act , and perhaps , as sometimes happens in such cases , the less a man really knew about the matter the more prompt he was with his explanation . Two reasons , however , were given by observers who appeared likely to know something of the real facts . One was that Lord Rosebery did not see his way to go as far as some of his colleagues would have gone in arousing the country to decided action against the Ottoman Government because of the manner in which it was allowing its Christian subjects to be treated . The other was that Lord Rosebery was too Imperialistic in spirit for such men as Sir William Harcourt and Mr. John Morley . No one could impurn Lord Rosebery 's motives in either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement against Turkey might only bring on a great European war or leave England isolated to carry out her policy at her own risk , and in the other case he may have thought that the policy bequeathed by Mr. Gladstone was tending to weaken the supremacy of England in South Africa . Lord Rosebery then ceased to lead government or a party , and became for the time merely a member of the House of Lords . I do not suppose his leisure hung very heavy on his hands . I can not imagine Lord Rosebery finding any difficulty in passing his day . The only difficulty I should think such a man must have is how to find time to give a fair chance to all the pursuits that are dear to him . Lord Rosebery spent some part of his leisure in yachting , and gave his usual attention to the turf , and was to be seen at picture galleries , and occasionally addressed great public meetings on important questions , and was a frequent visitor to the House of Commons during each session of Parliament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons set apart for their own convenience , and , although that space can hold but a small number of the peers , yet on ordinary nights its benches are seldom fully occupied . But when some great debate is coming on , then the peers make a rush for the gallery space in the House of Commons , and those who do not arrive in time to get a seat have to wait and take their chance , each in his turn , of any vacancy which may possibly occur . I am not a great admirer of the House of Lords as a legislative institution , and I must say that it has sometimes soothed the rancor of my jealous feelings as a humbler Com moner to see a string of peers extending across the lobby of the House of Commons , each waiting for his chance of filling some sudden vacancy in the peers ' gallery . Lord Rosebery continued to attend the debates when he had ceased to be Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal party just as he had done before . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features that a lady novelist of a past age would have called chiseled , and the eyes lighted with an animation that seemed to have perpetual youth in it , were often objects of deep interest to the members of the House , and to the visitors in the stranger galleries , and no doubt in the ladies ' gallery as well . The appearance  |p783  of Lord Rosebery in the peers ' gallery was sure to excite some talk among the members of the House of Commons on the green benches below . We were always ready to indulge in expectation and conjecturere as to what Lord Rosebery was likely to do next , for there t eemed to be a general consent of opinion that he was the last man in the world who could sit down and do nothing . But what was there left for him to do ? He had held various administrative offices ; he had twice been Foreign Secretary ; he had twice been Chairman of the London County Council ; he had been Prime Minister ; he had been leader of the Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great institutions ; he had been President of the Social Science Congress ; he had been Lord Rector of two great Universities ; he had twice won the Derby . What was there left for him to do which human ambition in our times and in the dominions of Queen Victoria couId care to accomplish ? Yet the general impression seemed to be that Lord Rosebery had not yet accomplished his appointed work , and that impression has grown deeper and stronger with recent events . Since the day when Lord Rosebery withdrew from the leadership of the Liberal party the division in that party has been growing wider and deeper . The war in South Africa has done much to broaden the gulf of separation . Lord Rosebery is an Imperialist , Sir W'illiam Harcourt and Mr. John Morley are not Imperialists . The opponents of Sir William Harcourt and Mr. Morley call them Little Englanders . The opponents of Lord Rosebery and those who think with him would no doubt call them Jingoes . The Imperialist , or , as his opponents prefer to call him , the Jingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and the duty of England to spread her civilization and her supremacy as far as she can over all those parts of the world which are still lying in disorganization and in darkness . The Little Englander , as his opponents delight to describe him , believes that England 's noblest work for a long time to come will be found in the endeavor to spread peace , education , and happiness among the peoples who already acknowledge her supremacy . I am not going to enter into any argument as to the relative claims of the two political schools . It has been said that a man is born either of the school of Aristotle or of the school of Plato . Perhaps an Englishman of modern times is born a Jingo or a Little Englander . I am not an Englishman , and therefore am not called upon to rank myself on either side of the controversy , but I know full well which way my instincts and sympathies would lead me if I were called upon . to choose . I could not , therefore , account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , on the one great question which concerns me most as a member of the House of Commons , that of Irish Home Rule , Lord Rosebery is not quite so emphatic as I should wish him to be . I am therefore writing the eulogy , not of Lord Rosebery the politician , but of Lord Rosebery the orator , the scholar , the man of letters and arts and varied culture , the man who has done so much for public life in so many ways , the helpful , kindly , generous friend . The common impression everywhere is that the Government of Lord Salisbury , as it is now constituted , can not last very long . The sands of the present Parliament are running out ; the next general election may be postponed for some time yet , but it can not be very far off . Are the Liberals to come back to power with Lord Rosebery at their head ? Can the Liberal party become so thoroughly reunited again , Jingoes and Little Englanders , as to make the formation of a Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , as many observers believe , that Lord Rosebery may find himself at the head of an administration composed of Imperialist Liberals and the more enlightened and generally respected members of the present Government ? I shall not venture upon any prediction , having seen the unexpected too often happen in politics to have much faith in political prophecy . I note it as an evidence of the position Lord Rosebery has won for himself that , although he became Prime Minister only to be defeated , and leader of the Liberal party only to resign , he is at this moment the one public man in England about whom people are asking one another whether the time for him to take his real position has not come at last .
