txt A NEW USE FOR THE CARNEGIE SURPLUS . A Denver clergyman , the Rev. C. M. COBERN , has an idea which merits consideration . As he regrets his inability to present it in person to Mr. ANDREW CARNEGIE , we will contribute what we can in our feeble way , in the hope that it may thus reach the eye of the gentleman who is looked to as the one best fitted to carry it out . Mr. COBERN believes that the crying need of our wicked cities is saloons , with free lunch , music , vaudeville , and everything attractive and agreeable except alcohol . Just what would take the place li of alcohol is not stated . That potent fluid seems to have a function of its own in the social economy , and attempts to find a substitute for it have not been wholly successful . The- man who can invent a drink which shall be equally satisfactory to the teetotaler and the convivial imbiber , leaving the one in the condition he prefers , putting the other into the condition he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public benefactor of the most remarkable character . This , however , is a detail . The plan contemplates that Mr. CARNEGIE shall establish saloons of such r magnificence and furnish therein such entertainment in the musical and variety line that saloons depending for their attractiveness upon alcohol in its various combinations would have to go out of business because of lack of custom . The theory is a good one , and appeals to the imagination somewhat powerfully ; but we are not sure that we are at the moment prepared to accept the conclusion that saloons of this character " would do more good than all the Carnegie libraries , " although we can give more cordial and immediate assent to the confident statement of the Rev. Mr. COBERN that if he had access to the philanthropist 's ear he " could tell him how to make a reputation which would last for all eternity . " As his promptings would be along the lines of his public utterance , and would take the shape of the first-class saloon with musical and vaudeville accessories , we are confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . As many such saloons in New York as we are to have libraries would add greatly to thte pleasure of living in this favored metropolis .
