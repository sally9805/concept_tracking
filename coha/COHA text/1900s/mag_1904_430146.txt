 | A REZZO , with its old , gray streets and walls , can not have changed very materially since on that twentieth of July , 1304 , was born the baby whose mind and heart in after years revolutionized the literary world . Here , in the same city which once sheltered Dante , was offered a home to the father of Petrarch , another exile from Florence ; and here , on a night when this same father was joining in an unsuccessful attempt to re-enter the city which had expelled him , the little Francesco began his earthly pilgrimage . It is unfortunate that the very house in which Petrarch was born can not be determined , owing to changes and restorations in the neighborhood , and to the fact that all the archives of the city prior to the year 1384 are missing . But the street and neighborhood are known certainly , and so , when we assisted in putting up a tablet on the wall of the supposed house , we could be sure that it was nearly the right one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , after all , those which sheltered the famous baby . It is doubtful whether the Petrarch Congress held during three mornings of  | this memorable week arrived at any really new interpretation of the poet 's works , or threw any fresh light on what was already known about him , but it served to call forth a number of interesting speeches , in many languages , and to increase the friendly feeling between the visitors and their hosts of Arezzo . On the first morning the Count of Turin was present , representing with dignity and grace the House of Savoy . Seated on the stage were the delegates from various places , several college professors from America , two or three from England , representatives from Hungary , Austria and France , as well as from Sardinia in the south of Italy to Piedmont in the north . Behind them hung the French tricolor , the Union Jack , the Stars and Stripes , intertwined with the red , white and green of " this young free land of Italy . " The house rang with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'Italia , " " Evviva Savoia . " Then the Count of Turin bowed and smiled , the band broke out into the " Marcia Reale , " and the school boys waved their banners until the colors danced and confused themselves in a brave bewilderment . For beauty and interest the " festa storica " easily carried off the prize of the week 's doings . This represented the fete given in honor of Petrarch when , in 1350 , he came in triumph to his native city . The real performance could scarcely have been more picturesque than its present revival . It was held in the great " prato , " or field at the edge of the town , and began toward seven o'clock , when t h e shadows were growing long , and the moon shone clear in the fair evening sky . Every costume had been carefully copied from o 1 d pictures , and the long  | procession as it wound around the field might have stepped from the frescoes of Benozzo Gozzoli . First came the heralds , followed by trumpeters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his family , then other dignitaries in robes of office , pages , judges , captains , priors and scholars in long , flowing mantles and scarlet caps like that of Dante in the Bargello portrait . Finally came Messer Francesco Petrarca himself , on a white horse led by pages , bowing and smiling , and looking extremely pleased with everything . Following him came " noble Romans , " soldiers and a crowd of the people , finished off by a mob of little boys , regular street urchins of the Middle Ages , who. in spite of their antique dress , ran and shouted as boys of all ages always do . The whole company , having made a detour of the field , seated itself at one side , and the soldiers in armor came on at full gallop , to give an exhibition of their skill in an old game , very popular in medieval times . This was the " Joust of the Saracen , " and consisted in tilting with wooden lances at a huge figure of a Moor , planted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Italian writer says , " because the Moors were the enemies of all Christian and of knights particularly . " These modern knights of Arezzo were picked cavalry soldiers from Florence , and the exhibition they gave of riding and keeping rather restive horses under control was something of which to be proud . But the dusk was increasing , and the moonlight was growing bright , and night would soon shut down over everything . So now a chorus , selected from the quaintly dressed throng , began to sing the words and music which had been composed in praise of the genius of Petrarch . This music , changing abruptly from a minor strain to one of joyous gayety , which again rose and fell to die out softly and almost sadly on the quiet evening air , had an indescribable and enchanting effect . As the light grew more dim , the whole scene , with its strange colors and accessories , and sounds of music , was like a dream , and seems so to me now as I recall it . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carriage to the ancient town of Poppi , where , in the ruined but now  | partially restored castle of the Guidi , we were entertained and welcomed where Dante was once a guest . We were taken to the remarkable library of Poppi , which , in this town so small and so old , is a wonderful thing to find , were it not that the whole of Tuscany is so full of treasures of long ago learning and art that nothing seems very surprising . This is , of course , all Dante country , and we drove on , full of memories of his exile years , to the historic castle of Romena , where he passed many days of waiting and longing , gazing out over the Casentino , the valley through which runs the Arno down to Florence , whose closed gates will never open to let him in . Our host , Count Goretti , the owner of the castle , offered its hospitality to us ; and in the long unused courtyard at one side of the great , ruined towers we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ate and drank and listened to speeches . Behind and beneath stretched the wonderful prospect of this beautiful Tuscan country , and we turned from the present Italy back to the memories of the great men and the great past which hung over the scene . Then a fresh toast brought us back again to the liberty and patriotism of united Italy , and to the pleasant friendships formed during the days in Arezzo.
