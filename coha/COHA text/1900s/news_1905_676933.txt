txt Instead of disembodied spirits turning up in the First Spiritual Church in Brooklyn . where Mrs. May Pepper , a mediuk , was conducting her tests last night , Several up-to-date New York pickpockets materialized and made trouble in the congregation . It was only when the police arrived that anything like order was restored . The spirits evidently were frightened badly by the turmoil , for they did not appear , and the s  --  ance ended in a panic . The Aurora Grata Temple , at Bedford Avenue and Madison Street , was crowded to the doors when the black-robed Mrs. Pepper appeared on the platform and announced that she intended to make tests of her wonderful powers for the last time in public . Hereafter , she declared , she woulp. simply pay attention to religion and &it; out  --  a letter-reading tests . She then called for sealed letters , declaring that she intended to blindfold herself by tying a handkerchief over her eyes and read any sealed letter . When she had tied the handkerchief across her eyes the ushers ran up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEN INTERRUPT . Several members of the Anti-Fraud Society who were in the audience hooted at the ushers and jeered at Mrs. Pepper . They repeated many of the things which appeared in the anonymous letters written to the medium denouncing tor fee ' what , they said was duping Isaac Funk . David Goldberger , who occupied a seat far up in front , frequently interrupted Mrs. Pepper by asking if she would make this or that test . She declared that she did not intend to try to convince any One in the future except through religion . Then Goldberger arose and declared : " You 're a fraud , and the Anti-Fraud Society of Brooklyn has posted $250 as a wager to prove it ! " An elderly man with flowing white locks jumped up and ran to Goldberger , shaking a finger at his face . This man was ex-Justice Abraham H. Daily , who for twenty years has been interested in Spiritualism . Judge Daily pulled a roll of hank notes from his pocket , and , waving them at Goldberger , shouted : " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society is a fraud . " HOOTS AND YELLS FROM PEWS . At this point the members of the congregation began to hoot and yell . Some sided with Goldberger , while others took sides with . Judge Daily . Both men and women stood up and shouted . " Cover that bet , Goldberger ! " shouted one man . " Cover the money and we 'll prove she 's a fraud ! " " Make them prove it , Judge ! " yelled a woman medium near the door . " Talk 's cheap ! Talk 's cheap ! " shouted a chorus of women . Then came the cries : " Put him out ! " " Put her out ! " " Expose the frauds ! " By this time men and women had left their seats and were swarming into the aisles in an effort to reach Judge Daily and the man with whom he was arguing . ENTER THE PICKPOCKET . Just then a man far up in front shouted : " I 've been robbed ! ' ? " Pickpockets ! Pickpockets ! Thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the door . A man near the door shut it and induced three others to help him prevent the crowd from getting out . Some one summoned the police , and several officers who appeared in uniform proceeded to round up the crowd in an effort to pick out the thieves . Two men pointed to a man who described himself as John Jones , and said he had robbed them . One of the complainants , Joseph Hubbard of 114 Jefferson Avenue , said Ms wallet had been stolen . It contained a check for $1,000 with some cash and many valuable papers . The other complainant , Charles Hobal , of 515 Throop Avenue , Brooklyn , said that 20 cents had been taken from his pocket when the cry of thief went up . Jones was taken to the police station where he gave his address as 1,038 Third Avenue , Manhattan . Then the crowd was permitted to leave the Temple and Mrs. Pepper 's seance was brought to a sudden end . Many in the crowd declared that the entrance fee which they had paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillars refused to return any money , declaring . that it had been voluntarily contributed to the regular Sunday night collection .
