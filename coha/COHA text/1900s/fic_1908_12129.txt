( Enter Spaniards ) ATUALPA Ho ! thou white and gleaming host , Help me to kill this false and lying thing That dares blaspheme an Inca of Peru ! PIZZARO Right graciously O King ! ( The old man leads the princess away . As she turns she sees Francesco and he spies her . ) FRANCESCO Ximene ! XIMENE Francesco ! ( He rushes madly forward , but the whirl of renewed battle bears him back . She disappears. ) @x SCENE : A crag surmounted by a fortified Indian Palace closely guarded by silent warriors . The princess enters and sadly looks into Valley and Sea . XIMENE There sits an awful silence On the Sea , and o'er the mighty mountains The hushed air doth creep with weak And trembling footsteps The rivers smell of blood And yonder carrion condor Drunk on human hearts Shrieks and wheels up and homeward To his babes . O fated land ! O vale of Death , O Mother of red murder And of war  --  hark ! What roars from out the glen With human accents ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The muttered mouthings Of their barrelled thunder knells From out the dells and echoes and re-echoes On the vast Andean shoulders of the hills . They come , ye gods , they come ! As sweeps the throttled Bursting anger in the Devil 's breast ; As whirls the maddened Torrent of the Spring Around that silvery gleaming central core , Dark , terrible ; the soldiering of my great father 's realm Do swarm and sting . Fond Heaven ! How they reel , their death cries Shake the cliffs and send the eagles Screaming to the air . Accursed be the sight  --  I will not see  --  And yet I must , since country , life and hope itself Hang in the awful scale . How hateful , harsh , and hideous Gleam the bloodless masks On that inhuman host . Gleam the bloodless masks On that inhuman host .

Francesco ! His spear points towards my heart ; His eyes do glisten as the serpent 's Horrid gaze ! ( The battle rages close to the palace gates . ) What Ho , Moluchi : Fend me  --  here , there , stand , fight ! Thy princess calls  --  Father , Brother , Cousin  --  Round me ! On thy dead souls That monster dare not woo . ( A fierce and bitter struggle at the gates . ) Hush . Eyes , see not ! Ears , hear not ! Heart , lift up thy prayer to God ! Spirit of wonder Daughter of Thunder Fire that lurks in the cavernous Sea ! Mist of the mountain Song of the fountain Mingle thy might to the guarding of me !

( She rises from her knees and looks ; the main battle has swept onward leaving but Francesco fighting his way to Ximene . ) What new and creeping silence is this now ? I hear the ring of silver  --  ringing , ringing , ringing ! Far off the echoes of the battle die As it sweeps past . But here ! Father of mercies  --  Here and alone ! All silent Bloody , wounded , Torn and terrible : comes  --  Francesco ! p. 5 FRANCESCO Ximene ! ( The princess ' family attack him . ) XIMENE My older brother dies ; his hands Claw the red earth . ( What eyes this white-faced monster hath . ) The head of my great cousin grins A yard from his vast shoulders . ( Oh the dread strength of that long slim white arm ; How thrills and throbs his thin thrust Through the air ! ) My ; little brother sinks and sighs As he did sign in sleep . Oh , Oh ! ( What wondrous courage this white warrior hath ! ) My uncle yells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the white spirit sways and falls . God pity him  --  no  --  no , yes , O fate , he dies ! Wonder ! He staggers up again , his Great green eyes on me . What  --  love must nerve his iron will ! On , on he reels . My father cuts the silver from his head . Ah ! Ah ! Softly  --  ah softly , Father  --  Was that my father once , That drabbled bloody thing That spurts its slime on my cold breast ? The gates do yield ! ( She steps within the palace doors . ) He comes , nearer , nearer , near  --  here  --  Hear ! Hark !

( The Old Man appears in the door , Ximene lying stark and bloody across his arms with streaming hair . ) I  --  Ximene ! Ha ! Who art thou That stands above my wedded wife ? I know thee  --  ha !
