txt The Hoboken authorities are mystified over a man who made a fifteen-day trip across the ocean in a case in the hold of the Hamburg-American liner Palatia , v-hieh arrived on Sunday . He was discovered yesterday and lies unconscious in St. Mary 's Hospital . Whether he will recover the physicians are unable to say . He was shipped as freight and would have been dead within a short time but for the opening of the hatch . The case in which he was confined was buried under eight or ten feet of salt in sacks and packed about with cases of gcneral merchandise . For food the man must have , %ad at the start some loaves of bread ' and a bottle of whisky . He is a German about thirty years of age . The - need of air and water appears to have ' caused him at last to break open the case and try to get on deck . He must have been possessed of great strength , which , it is surmised , was probably made greater by frenzy . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon . Hatch 4 had just been opened . Roder dropped down into the hold , landing on the salt sacks . He was preparing to send the sacks out when the tackle was lowered to him . He says lie first heard a muffled voice utter the word " water . " Then several moans , and again the word " water " was distinguishable . He called to those above , and Frank Kdebier , the foreman , and Adolph Johnansen , a timekeeper , responded . While they were lowering themselves through the hatch Roder began an investigation . As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness he made out the form of a man lying upon the salt sacks some little distance aft of the hatchway . He worked himself between the sacks of salt and the deck beams until he could reach the man . The others took hold of Roder 's legs and drew him nut , he dragging the man after him . The man , who then was unconscious , was carried to the ship 's hospital . Ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend him . They administered warm milk and stimulants . The heart action was foNind very weak and the man 's body was greatly emaciated . The stomach appeared to be in a very bad condition . It was decided to remove him to St. Mary 's Hospital . - Meanwhile an investigation in the hold was in progress . The ship 's carpenter crawled along the sacks of salt and traced the man to his original position . The case was located , but will , not be gotten out before morning , as many tons of freight will have to be lifted out before it can be dislodged . The case was a heavy , one . It had apparently- been packed into the rest of the cargo without those handling it having the slightest idea what it contained . It is about 8 feet long , 4 feet wide ; and 6 feet high . The mark on it is " J. B. 71 . " The ship 's manifest in recording the case makes it ? Model , J. B. 71 . " On the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oben " and " Forsicht , " meaning " This Aide up , " and " Handle with care . " The inside ' of the case as examined through the broken board on the side was in a most filthy condition . A bottle , which contained some whisky , was found , together with scraps of bread . , So far as could he seen there were no air openings , the caged man having to depend upon the air which worked through the joinings of the boards . This must have made his supply scant indeed , owing to the limited air in the hold and the fact that the ' salt was packed solidly above the case .. The hatch had been closed before sailing , and over it a tarpaulin was placed , and neither was raised between the time of departure and yesterday . His situation in the case mute have been frightful . and at last became unbearable , causing him to break out on the only side against which other freight was not solidly packed , the conformation of an adjoining case leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board he had to crawl between the pieces of cargo . Some of the spaces were so small that the ship 's carpenter in going in and coming out , although carrying with him a portable electric light , had difficulty in making his way . When he finally emerged from the midst of the cargo he was about eighteen fec t below the decking . He then had to climb 1113 . This was easy for the first six or seven feet , but to work his way over the eight feet of salt sacks must have beer , a most difficult task . He ... did it , however , and then crawled about looking for the hatch which in . the darkness he evidently missed several times . Exhausted . he ' then lay down on the sacks and lapsed into unconsciousness . Whzn the man 's pockets were - searched some German marks to the value of less than $1 and a slip cf paper on which was written the name " John Beck " were ( found . There was no address on the paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two pairs of trousers . In the case were foundtan umbrella and two hats . The police immediate y began an effort to trace the case . The steamship line could not furnish the names of either the consignor nor consignee . It was learned . however , that on Sunday a well-dressed man made inquiries about the case . and that a wagon belonging to the American Express Company later called at the pier and the driver asked for the case , describing it bythe mark " J. B. , 71 . " The same or another wagon and driver called at the pier yesterday seeking ' the case , but departed when it was found the case had not yet been taken out . The American Express Company has no office in Hoboken . The wagon must therefore have come from Manhattan .
