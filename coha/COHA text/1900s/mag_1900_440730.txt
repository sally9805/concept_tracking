Our consular service is more completely commercial , with fewer diplomatic functions , than that of any other important country . It deals with gain , property , and public revenue , and has only a slight relation to the rights or the protection of persons . It concerns both buying and selling , and the consul who does not recognize that one can not go on without the other does not know the alphabet of the business intrusted to his care . In promoting the interchange of products , he will find that he must advise a merchant or manufacturer at his post as freely and frankly as one from his own country . An industrious mechanic or farmer seeking to emigrate may be just as important to his country as a home workman who goes out to set up American machinery . A working woman may need consular advice when she enters the port of New York to take up domestic service quite as much as a woman from home who is in search of a truant husband . The claim is commonly made that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows of foreign countries . This is of the slightest importance . He needs rather to know the institutions , laws , history , people , geography , politics , and public men of his own country . That given , he will soon absorb the necessary information about the country to which he is accredited , even if the treaty of Westphalia is strange to him , or he does not know how many soldiers fell in some Napoleonic battle . This comprehensive knowledge , it may be admitted , is not always found in petty ward politicians , professional labor agitators , or rural newspaper editors , who are nothing more ; or in reporters , whose lives have been devoted to accounts of fires and murders ; or in petty business men , who do not understand their own callings ; or in those prosperous foreigners , sometimesfound , whose loftiest ambition is to air their new-made importance in their birthplaces . According to the register of the Department of State , the consular service of the United States is made up as follows : consuls general and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ; minor salaried consuls , 10 ; consuls , paid by fees , 48 ; commercial agents , paid by fees , 20 : total 322 . The last three classes may engage in business , as their fees and allowances amount to less than $1000 a year . Vice consuls , consular agents , and clerks are not included . Although an occasional vice consul is sent from home , as a rule they are residents of the foreign district . The remuneration of the higher grades in salaries and unofficial fees ? as nearly as they may be estimated owing to defects in the returns ? is as follows : consuls receiving over $5000 per annum , 16 ; over $4000 , 14 ; over $3000 , 54 ; over $2500 , 18 . This gives a total of 102 among whom there is no great difference in rank , work , responsibility , or qualities demanded , and whose average pay is something like $3500 a year . As comparison is constantly made with the British service , I have compiled from the Foreign Office list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : consuls receiving over $10,000 per annum , 10 ; over $5000 , 28 ; over 000 , 56 ; over $3500 , 13 ; over $3000 , 35 ; over $2000 , 25 : total , 167 . The $10-000 class itre mainly diplomatic agencies ; so I exclude these from comparison . This done , the average of the classes fairly correspondent with our own works out at about $3750 . It is impossible to attain absolute accuracy , because retired army officers retain certain allowances , the pay being thereby reduced . According to this comparison , the United States government is not so niggardly as is sometimes charged , so far as its principal places are concerned . Once at his post , the consul soon learns // its merely routine duties : how to examine and sign invoices ; to verify legal documents ; to read , even though he may not understand , department circulars , ? as well as what he must do for himself , and what he may trust to subordinates . He very soon discovers that most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be wise to recognize that he represents all the commercial interests of his country ; that his politics were shed at Sandy Hook ; and that he is not a specialist in metals , chemicals , or textiles . If wise , he will not turn detective at the bidding of the departments or any manufacturing interest . In social matters his position depends entirely upon himself . He can enter the circle for which he is fitted . He can come into close personal relations with the best public , professional , business , educational , and religious elements in his district . In order to do this , he needs only the same tact , intelligence , and dignity of character demanded or used at home . He must keep clear of sects , whether in politics or religion . If he can make a prudent speech , it will be still easier and pleasanter for him ; if he has literary or musical tastes , his path will be made smoother . If he is inclined to sports or games , from cockfighting to golf , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes a game of poker , or racing , or has fast tastes of any kind ; if he revels in sectarianism , whatever its form , he can always find congenial company and win a place in it . I have known an important consulate where , for several successive administrations , the incumbent was never seen in good houses or in association with good causes . I have known of another where , during a ten years ' residence , the incumbent preached for a fee of two or three guineas when he could get an engagement , on Sunday or any other day . In the one case as in the other , the office was as much vacant as if no man had been sent to it . I have known other consulates where , for three or four successive administrations , the incumbents made it their business to screw out as much money as they could , to accept no attentions requiring a return of courtesies , ? a miserliness characteristic of those who never had a chance before , and expect never to have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? outside such prize places as London , Liverpool , Paris , Hamburg , and Bremen ? is viewed with suspicion by his colleagues . On an average , about two out of the twentyfive consuls whom each administration sends to England take back money with them , by such parsimony as I have described . Consuls general in London , and consuls in other large cities , have lived during all their term in very shabby lodgings , but they are the exceptions ; plain , sensible living , without display , being the rule . Out of a hundred and fifty consuls I have known , during or after their service in fifteen or twenty countries , there have probably been ten or fifteen of the miserly type . Of rogues and adventurers , who have gone home leaving debts to tradesmen and acquaintances , or overdrafts at banks , I have perhaps heard of fifteen during more than twenty years ' acquaintance with the service . However , I have not set out to write a history of black sheep . Now and then a consul resents his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such an one is opposed to any other country than America , and is usually of foreign birth . He has merely sought the office to show the people of his native country how to do things . Such a man looks upon every invoice he signs as the robbery of somebody at home , and goes through his term lecturing the foreign manufacturer upon his effrontery in sending across the water articles that could be made by American labor . Much useful information is furnished to home manufacturers , and I regret to say that it is not always appreciated ; in many cases , not even acknowledged . 458 The Consular Service of the United States . No one would think of making a charge for it ; but many persons at home have yet to learn that there is such a thing as good manners in business . The secretaries of public bodies and debating clubs , the managers of college publication societies , newspaper editors , college professors , and students of comparative politics , are continually and properly asking for information . It would be impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small favors thus rendered . Chiefs of police and other officials of cities and towns are most considerate , when the consul , desirous of helping some poor person who is in search of a lost relative , or an inheritance , or a runaway husband , must , in his turn , seek assistance . So , while , as a business representative , he finds bad manners and want of appreciation , his extra-official duties reveal other and better qualities . The official work is comparatively simple , exacting enough to fill the ordinary office hours , while the indefinite unofficial duties require industry . The man who does all these cheerfully and lives with modesty and dignity , who is neither neglectful nor self-seeking , will become a sort of ambassador to his district , and may even be favorably known outside of it , in literary , religious , or social life . II . THE PRESIDENT 'S RELATION TO THE SERVICE . When a President is elected he finds more than three hundred consuls already in office . If his party comes newly to power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to him in politics . If he succeeds a President of his own opinions , they represent , in a large measure , his predecessor 's plans , schemes , and political debts . There are no rules to hamper him , and for each place there are probably a hundred candidates . Owing to the exaggerated idea about its pay and dignity and the cheapness of living abroad , foreign service has a peculiar fascination for the average Americanand his wife , to which must be added social and business aspirations , mainly delusive . The manager who succeeded to the control of a concern with branches all over the world , would probably have little more personal knowledge of the men under him than a President has of consuls . His first work , however , this being the business of his life , would be to obtain the most complete information about the length of service and the fitness of each man on his staff ; but no President , however willing or anxious he might be , could do this . The appointment of consuls is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is an unbroken tradition that their places are political or personal , and he can not change this in a single branch of the public service , even if time and inclination both permitted . So he follows the fashion , and treats the consulates as party spoils . The efficiency or inefficiency of one or a hundred incumbents is nothing to him . In some cases , the most important places are promised , provisionally , before his election , and more ? probably the majority of those worth having ? weeks before his inauguration , before even his Secretary of State has been selected . f-A certain proportion of the best places are filled from his own knowledge or upon the advice of his personal or political associates , though never without reference to party services , rendered or expected . When he enters the Executive Mansion removals go on mechanically , and successors are appointed as rapidly as possible . He must carry the work through with little help from any department , because , like the making of broth , there is a certain unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand in plenty . Senators , Representatives , chairmen and members of a succession of party committees , influential and ambitious public men , are there , ready to send a rival into exile deleted material 460 Phe Consular Service of the United States . appointment . His arrival , with commission and order for possession , was the first notice to an incumbent whose retention had been promised . The new official had probably not thought of France since he recited his geography lesson thirty years before in some district school , while his manner gave the impression that he had first heard the name of the town to which he had come , when appointed as its consul . The result is best when the President sends men known to himself and his inner circle ? personal appointments socalled . This means that some one has a knowledge of the character and attainments of the candidate as well as some regard for his own reputation . Most of the really useful and able men who get into the foreign service , either in the diplomatic or the consular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators , Representatives , or managers have no direct reference to fitness ; perhaps not more than one in seven turns out fairly well , so that nobody concerned can be credited with even the most ordinary business prudence . This kind of appointment is a lottery , with a half dozen blanks to each prize . It is easy to assume that a service thus filled must he wholly corrupt and inefficient . Perhaps it ought to be so . But , taken as a whole , considering the incongruous elements in the services of other countries , our service , so filled , reaches a good average of efficiency , higher than that of most countries . The adaptability of the American to new , strange work is a quality upon which too much emphasis is sometimes laid ; still , it must be taken into account . It is well to remember that the method of selection herein described runs through every branch of public life ; that practically we know no other method . Besides , ninety-five out of every hundred of the responsible places in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a proneness to forget that whilesuch methods are as universal as they are natural , they are also human and illustrative of unselfishness and kindliness , and that it is the abuse of them which brings reprobation . With all these drawbacks , two thirds of the consulates of dignity and fair pay , and say one tenth of the remainder , ? about a hundred all told , ? are filled by lawyers , physicians , editors , professors , bankers , and business men , of ability and unquestioAttl standing . Far from home or effective supervision , these pass through their term with dignity and with credit to themselves and the country , without assertiveness or loss of character , and spend a larger proportion of their pay , whatever this may be , for the public benefit than officials at home or their colleagues from other countries . Occasionally , one seeks to attract attention in society , or has himself and his wife presented at court ; but fools are not confined to this service , nor do they all live in or come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and removal are so essentially vicious as to be beyond defense . They send abroad during every four-year period more bad , useless , and inefficient men than ought to find admission into the whole foreign service in half a century of wise , , prudent , and centralized selection . That the result is not so bad as it might be is a striking illustration of the American luck which has so long been proverbial . No description of these methods should leave the impression , even by implication , that any recent President has used the foreign service for personal ends . Such an implication would be unjust and without warrant . In filling consular places there is thrown upon the Executive a responsibility which does not belong to home offices , where the public hold Senators and Representatives to account . In message after message , beginning in 1885 , and continuing until deleted material 462 The Consular Service of the United States . the usual vicious plan of leaving all details to the department is adopted . The bills do not reduce the number of consulates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made for admission by examinations so simple that not even the merest spoilsman could be kept out . The President is thus left free to appoint and promote his own partisans out of those who pass , ? just as he does under the sham system now in operation for certain grades of consuls under the order of September 30 , 1895 . He is free to remove incumbents , no period of tenure being fixed . The minimum age for admission is twenty-one years , ? which , under our laws , seems to be a somewhat useless definition . These bills have been introduced without special knowledge or intelligent department assistance , nor are there any indications that public sentiment was or is behind them , and they have produced no alternative suggestions of value . More attention has been given to imitations of other countries than to a careful and comprehensive study of the needs of our own . The method of appointment , being the obvious abuse , one that anybody can see , is the only feature that has proved equally attractive to all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary before a law can be passed which would change a bad system into a good one . IV . TREATMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT . In theory , the Secretary of State appoints consuls and supervises their work ; in practice , he does neither . Even when the head of the department was chosen wholly for ability and political experience the office was usually a consolation prize , given to the candidate for President who had failed . He had little occasion to know anything about the consular work , assigned to his department . He was seldom an expert in commercial matters , a politician of such qualifications finding his way to the head of the Treesury Department . Of late , many of the , traditions about the Department of State have been broken down . Its head , like his Cabinet associates , has become a sort of chief clerk to the President , assigned to the control of a department . A public man of the old , high type sometimes gets into the office , though he seldom stays long . In the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there some strange figures , whose description in detail would be superfluous , and might be thought rude . It is not unfair to say that they had no knowledge of a branch of the public service which sends , every four years , more than three hundred officials into all parts of the world . As the direction of the consular service does not rest with the head of the Department of State , it may be well to try to locate it . For the first twelve or fifteen months of each administration the assistant secretary devotes most of his time to the sharpening of the official guillotine for the President 's use . He has little leisure for learning his business , and even if he lead , the consular branch belongs to him only in form . For many years the second-assistant secretaryship has been in the hands of two thoroughly efficient and useful men , who have coached successive presidents , secretaries , and assistants . Custodians of manners , past masters in that remarkable system of etiquette inseparable from diplomatic functions , they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so inclined , and if it were their business to give attention to the consular service , other duties would not permit . This brings us to the third-assistant secretaryship ? a mysterious office , of which it is never possible to know , week by week , who is the incumbent . Three Secretaries of State and as many assistants are generally required to carry an average administration through its term ; About four third assistants are disposed deleted material 464 The Consular Service official life . Since 1878 , a monthly number of Consular Reports , ranging from 160 to 280 pages , has been issued . It has been supplemented , from time to time , by a special issue , sometimes in one large volume , occasionally running to two or three volumes , and there are now daily advance sheets , to supply printers with what is known as " dummy copy . " Besides the Consular Reports , there is Commercial Relations , two massive volumes from 750 to 1000 pages each , made up by consuls and consular agents eked out by solemn ambassadors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most distant or obscure consul may be tardy or delinquent , and the second or third circulars calling for them would furnish models of " urgent " literature . The consul gathers the material for these annual summaries from the local or trade newspapers , the gossip of local manufacturers , and the garrulity of representatives of American firms . The district may be remote or unimportant , ? a fly on the wagon wheel of commerce . It may have no port , no distinct personality , nothing to give it importance except its modest contribution to the totals in the Monthly Summary of Finance and Commerce . Nevertheless , it must yield up its nothingness . In theory , reports are made under the direction of the department . Circulars are sent out peppered lavishly with interrogation points . Most of them relate to subjects upon which there is no lack of information . Many of them could be worked out by an ordinary statistician , or even by a department clerk , with the aid of a late encyclopwdia and a few handbooks . However or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small number of persons engaged in some special trade , and would be useless even to these unless prepared by an expert . Still , the questions give the consul ample opportunity to write and to see his name in print . It would be unfair to suppose that of the United States . these marvelous queries are evolved by the bureau officials met together in their high-ceilinged , solemn offices in Washington . Far from it . The following example will illustrate the process : A young lumberman in the state of Washington , amid the stillness of his pines , wants to know the price of logs and boards in the grand duchy of Finland and the interior of Persia . He takes down his office handbooks , only to find that neither Finland nor Persia is mentioned . For the moment his thirst for knowledge is slaked ; but the question comes back to him as one of great human interest . Logs and lumber take hold upon his imagination by day , and haunt his dreams by night . He congratulates himself that he learned in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he assumes that they have people , he also wonders whether they have trees . At the club his inquiries are not answered to his satisfaction , when , finally , a friend , perhaps weary of persistent interruption , suggests that , if such places really do exist , the United States may have consuls in them . The local exchange takes the matter up . In its name the eager questioner writes to the department , inquiring timidly about those mysterious officials called consuls , and asks furtively about logs and lumber in Finland and Persia . Thus far , little has been done to satisfy a curiosity commendable in a young man remote from reference libraries ; but the Foreign Department of a great government is ready , and his idea finds itself housed in a government palace . The letter is answered , and a request made that interrogatories shall be prepared for submission to the consular representatives of the United States at Helsingf ors and Teheran . The talent of many logging camps toils over the task , not without result . No one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transferred , without impairment , to the shores of the The Consular Service Pacific . Nothing relating to varieties , sizes , and qualities of trees ; to the dimensions and shapes of logs ; to the breadth , thickness , or polishing qualities of boards ; to the kinds of sawmills and the power used ; to makes of axes and saws , and their care ; to the wages , nativity , and hours of work of woodmen ; to the marketing of products and their prices ; or to the architecture of houses , the furniture in and the fences about them , is missed from the list . When the reports are received at the Consular Bureau , the most exact writer is assigned to correct any slips they may contain in grammar , while an antiquarian is probably called in to frame questions as to the folk lore of trees , logs , and lumber . Completed , made into fair copies , distributed over the bureau for general inspection , carried to the third-assistant secretary for approval , the report is another striking illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds , seine clerk suggests that it seems a pity to limit the information to Finland and Persia . Why not lay the whole world under tribute for all that it can reveal about logs and lumber ? Another wiseacre thinks it next to criminal to limit all this information to a Pacific coast logging camp . Why not publish it , so that even the humblest American woodman may know what a great , benevolent , and intelligent government tries to do for him ? When all this has been done the special report On Logs and Lumber in all the Countries of the World : how they are Made , Sold , Paid for , and Used , in an unwieldy volume , will be pointed out with pride by generations of officials . This formula shows how the department collects five or six thousand pages , for the most part the essence of nothingness . It may as well be borne in mind that the interest or trade which asks for this information , for its own exclusive benefit , is not required to pay a // deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no allowance for expenses , not even to buy a handbook or a newspaper ; and that there are in his district no boards of trade or other bodies which make it their business to compile local information . But this is not all . The consul has but newly come to his post , and may find himself lonesome . He has been impressed at the department with the importance of reports . Nearly everything in his new Old-World surroundings seems strange to him ; so , as he writes or dictates with ease , he sets out on his own account , and devises new torments for those who have learned to read . During the twenty-two years that this process has been going on , it would be difficult to recall one report of really undoubted economic value . Beyond this , it is doubtful whether there has been a notable one of the second or informing order each year ; that is , twenty-two really influential in directing the course of trade . The reason for this is clear . There is no room for this flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortieth part of it . Even if the consular service had half a hundred President Hadleys , Edward Atkinsons , and Richard Mayo Smiths , this would be equally true . For the past ten years many consuls , in every part of the world , have been writing about American machinery and tools . In spite of this , not even one report furnished real and new information on the outlook , ? a result clue less to lack of knowledge than to the narrowness and shortness of view incident to the man who writes from the observation and experience of a district with perhaps a single industry . On the other hand , the editor of the American Machinist made a business tour of Europe , and wrote for his paper a series of articles on the use and prospects of American machinery abroad . The y were written with a perfect knowledge 466 Autobiography of W. J. Stillman. of the business itself as well as of what needed to be told . As he went from one manufacturing centre to another , he was able to contrast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical development or demand , and why another was weak . He could see how effective the workmen were in one place , and how inefficient in another . When his tour was finished he had told the best that was known , said the last word , so far as he had . gone , and given more real information within a few weeks than all the consular corps of the United States could possibly have gathered together in years . It is one of the curiosities of literature that , although our consuls have not produced reports of either economic or informing value , many of them have done conspicuous literary work , before and during service , and after retirement . W. D. Howells wrote some delightful books on Italy . Besides his Life of Peter the Great , Eugene Schuyler wrote an acceptable short history of American diplomacy , and translated some of Tourgeniev 's novels . Hawthorne , Elihu Burritt , Underwood , Bret Harte , Penfield , Richman , ? to mention only a few , ? have done notable work in literature , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case there was something to say , united with freedom of view and opinion ; in the other there was nothing to say , and red tape was too strong for them . The fault is in the system , not in the men .
