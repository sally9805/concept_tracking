The condition of the steamer 's bows , disclosed as she lies at the dock , shows she had a very narrow escape from meeting the same fate as the Gladiator . The St. Paul is more seriously damaged than at first supposed . She shipeed a great quantity of water through her broken plates , and from the moment she backed away from the wrecked cruiser until she reached her wharf in this port all her pumps were kept going to their full capacity . The damaged bows of the St. Paul indicate that she forced her nose at least twenty feet through the cruiser 's side . but fortunately the greatest damage she received is above the water line . The bow post is buckled , while the plates on both the ' port and starboard bows are crushed in andgaping cracks extend along the , side . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , but from that point downward there is no apparent damage , although the bolts must have started , which would account for the water pouring Into he , hold . Capt . Passow and the first , third , and , fourth officers were on the bridge with ' Pilot George Bowyer. the American Company 's regular pilot , at the time of I the accident , and the closest lookout was I being kept , two men being stationed in the bow and two in the crow 's nest . Both a Channel and a French pilot also were aboard , but , of course , they were not on duty . Neither Capt . Passow nor any of his officers will discuss the accident , preferring to wait until they can submit their reports to the proper orricials . It 14 learned , however , that Capt . Passow is sorely grieved at the disaster , this being his first serious mishap .

The snow was falling so tmckly that it was impossible to see a yard ahead ; it was far worse than the thickest fog . The weather had cleared before the St. Paul left her dock , but snow began to fall again as soon as the Solent was reached . ' It was then impossible to stop , as a very strong tide was running , which might have carried the steamer on the rocks . The only alternative was to go ahead and keep the closest lookout , am : this was done . Had the cruiser been painted any other color than slate she might have been seen earlier and the collision avoided . An officer of the St. Paul who did not wish to be named said the slight delay in getting out the liner 's boats , of which some have complained , was due to some extent to the fact that more than two feet of snow fell in Southampton during Friday night and Saturday morning , and continued intermittently up to the time of the accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be manned , but it took a very little time , every member of the crew , even including the cooks , lending a hand . The boats when lowered were manned partly by stewards , as it was necessary to keep many of the able seamen aboard to assist in repairing the damaged bows . Referring to this same matter , J. T. Hillis of London , who was a passenger on the St. Paul , said : ' In response to our offer of assist ? ante , the Captain of the Gladiator replied ' that it was not needed . That accounts for the fact that some time ? it seemed to me about twenty minutes ? elapsed after the collision before the St. Paul boats were put into the water . " The discipline on the Gladiator was magnificent . We could see every man at his post . There was no excitement on either ship . One would have thought it was a moving picture instead of a real disaster .
