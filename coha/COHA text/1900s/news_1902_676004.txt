txt BUSINESS MEN AND CUBA . It was not creditable to the Chamber of Commerce that prompt action was not taken at its meeting on Thursday in support of real and substantial fairness to Cuba . We do not believe that the delay Is in accord with the feeling and conviction of the majority or even of a respectable minority of the Chamber . The members of the Chamber are too representative of the intelligent and honorable business class throughout the country not to share the resentment and humiliation of that class at the mean meas- I tire now pending in Congress . But the opponents of an enlightened and fair Policy toward Cuba are animated by intense and cruel greed , and they are always ready to use all their energies and all their influence to promote their narrow selfish ends . In view of the renewed efforts of the conscienceless beet-sugar lobby at Washington to hold up even the insufficient measure devised by the Ways and Means Committee when it shall reach the Senate . the appeal of , Mr. PALMA , the President-elect of Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and espedaily those of this city , to secure righteous action . It is on the business men that the consequences of the protectionist scheme of starving the Cubans will fall . They will suffer the loss of that extended trade which fair treatment is sure to bring about . They will suffer also the greater loss that will accrue from a state of disorder that must follow impoverishment . And the shameful stupidity of the whole wretched plot must be plainer to business men than to others . Think of it for a moment . We are asked to refuse to the Cubans the privilege of access to our markets and to refuse for ourselves the profitable commerce that would inevitably ensue from their access to our markets . We have rescued the island from the rule of Spain . We have forced its people to surrender into our keeping some of the most important attributes of independence and sovereignty . We have forbidden them to treat with other nations except with our approval . We have asserted the right to intervene by force in their internal affairs when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have exacted the right to naval stations on the shores of the island which give us absolute control of its harbors . We have made of the island practically a dependency of the ' United States . And when the people offer to us a rich trade if we will only not take down , but lower by one-half the barriers we have erected against their chief products , we refuse . And for what ? In order that a favored interest , insignificant in itself , already largely aided by our laws , may reap from American consumers a higher rate of profit . There has never in our history been a more shamefully greedy scheme , or one more plainly opposed to the real and lasting interests of the mass of the people . It is precisely such an organization as the Chamber of Commerce that should fight this scheme with all its might . We trust that next week the Chamber will undertake to do so .                    @
