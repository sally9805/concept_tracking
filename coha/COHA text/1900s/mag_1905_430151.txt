Anyone who reads , with due attention , the Editor 's Introduction to the Series ' prefixed to the first volume of The American Nation , ' will agree that therein these truths are held to be self-evident : that a new history of the United States , extending from the discovery down to the present time , is needed ; that no such comprehensive work by a competent writer is now in existence ; that , for an intelligent summarizing of the present knowledge of American history by trained specialists , and for a complete work written in untechnical style which shall serve for the instruction and entertainment of the general reader , there is but one method , the cooperative ; that previous efforts of this sort have not been altogether happy ; that this series is to avoid such unfortunate difficulties as were evident in previous ventures ; that every volume in this series must stand the double test of accuracy and readableness ; and that it is the editor 's function to see that the links of the chain are adjusted to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are omitted . All these bold statements of fact and intention we find in the editor 's introduction . Elsewhere we learn that assistance has been received from various historical societies , notably those of Massachusetts , Wisconsin , Virginia , and Texas . The selection of the authors of the individual volumes ( of which there are to be twenty-six in all , with one volume of index and one of maps ) seems to have been entirely the editor 's function , and most of the choices made are happy . The whole series is divided into five groups , each of which deals with an important epoch in American history . The division into groups , volumes , and chapters makes in itself a topical analysis of no small value . As would be expected , each volume contains an author 's preface ; besides this , however , to each volume the editor contributes another introduction . Here in a pleasant manner Professor Hart tells the reader what he will find in the volume , how important this is , how the author has emphasized this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume are to be linked ' to those treated elsewhere . This part of the work may be serviceable to many readers who share the prevailing hunger for predigested food ; the same idea is followed out in another cooperative history of America now in course of publication . It does not seem , however , to be a characteristic of the best of those European collaborations which in other respects have been models to the editor of The American Nation . ' From the general plan outlined by the editor we turn to the individual volumes . Somewhat in the nature of a prelude is Professor Cheyney 's European Background of American History , 1300-1600 . ' The author of this volume has had a difficult task , and has done it admirably . It is his part to tell , without too much detail , a story already familiar and covering a number of widely different subjects . This he must do without impairing the accuracy of his work or losing the reader 's interest . Beginning with the later medieval period , he traces the growth of commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Spain , and the political institutions of the great states of Europe that later were the chief colonizers . Then follows a fresh and succinct discussion of the rise and influence of commercial and colonizing companies . After this , the narrative returns to the European centre , and sketches briefly the course of the Reformation on the Continent and in England . The last part of the volume deals with the constitution , and especially with the local government , civil and ecclesiastical , of England , the necessary prolegomena to the constitutional history of the English colonies in America . From the very nature of Professor Chey- ney 's work , it is not to be expected that all parts of it shall be equally the results of personal investigation , or based upon other than secondary materials . The story is told delightfully and with care ; but the necessity for compression causes occasionally a lack of clearness . For example , with reference to the constitution of the London Company under the charter of 1609 , the author states : The form of government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well it might after the failure of the arrangements of the former charter . The membership , quarterly assemblies of the general body of the members , more frequent meetings of a governing council of fifty-three officers , and their duties , were all minutely formulated ' ( pp. 151-2 ) . As a matter of fact , the provision for the quarterly courts was included in the third charter , that of 1612 , which is not mentioned by Professor Cheyney at all . We are now ready for the play to begin ; but must wait , for here follows Professor Farrand 's volume upon The Basis of American History . ' This inevitably breaks the continuity of the narrative . We pass from English history and institutions to the physical features , flora and fauna , prehistoric inhabitants , and Indian tribes of America . The author himself informs us that his task has been one of condensation , and the results are especially evident in the first third of the volume , which is somewhat below the general average of interest . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed out instead of being tabulated in figures . The chief service of this portion of the book will be its suggestiveness and the references in Professor Farrand 's excellent bibliography . As to the much-vexed questions of American anthropology and ethnology , ? the genuineness of human remains in tertiary deposits , the evidences of pre-glacial man , the identity of the mound-builders , and the origin of the ' American Indian , ? Professor Farrand takes a conservative position , and approves the prevailing skepticism . Likewise , in his chapters upon the Indians , he controverts many popular generalizations , such as the exaggerated estimate of the power of the chief , the idea of the complete subjection of the squaw , the misunderstanding of the Indian 's stoicism ' with respect to pain . These are examples of a widespread misinformation ; and in the relations of the whites to the Indians , and especially in the policy of the Federal Government , the mistakes of history are seen to have been due to ignorance and folly rather than to deliberate ill-intent . Having listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , which begins with Professor Bourne 's volume on Spain in America . ' A few pages of prolegomena lead us at once to the life of Columbus . The author holds the recent attack of Vignaud upon the genuineness of Toscanelli 's letters to Columbus to have been unsuccessful , but believes that , if genuine , the letters did not give Columbus much information , ? at most , they only turned his mind to the problem . The story of his long endeavor to gain the support of the Spanish monarchs is abbreviated , and we are soon brought to the eve of the great voyage . ' The son of the humble woollen-weaver of Genoa has gone far in twenty years . He is now a noble , and a high official in an ancient monarchy , and intrusted with a unique mission . Yet all depends upon the chances of the voyage whether these honors shall fade away in the mists of the Sea of Darkness , leaving the mere shadow of a name , like Ugolino de Vivaldi , in some such record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed to pass over to the Indies by way of the west . After he left the Canary Islands , no news was heard of him , " or whether his name shall have eternal celebrity as the discoverer of the New World . No man ever faced chances of fortune so extreme . On the other hand , no sovereign ever secured imperial domain at so slight a sacrifice as Isabella of Castile . Her venture was small ? a few thousand dollars and presumably empty honors to an importunate visionary whose utterances seemed mere " fables " ' ( pp. 18-19 ) . This is a fair sample of the many striking summaries of events and characterizations of individuals which one finds throughout the book . Of similar impressiveness is the author 's final estimate of Columbus ( pp. 82-83 ) , the comparison of Columbus with Magellan ( pp. 127-128 ) , the outline of the new conditions that confronted the explorer in Yucatan ( p. 151 ) , the conclusions as to Amerigo Vespucci ( p. 103 ) , and the resume of the results attained after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative of exploration takes up , roughly , two-thirds of the volume ; the remainder is devoted to an account of Spanish colonial policy , and of its results as worked out in Spanish America , which is even more an original contribution to American history than the first part of the work . Professor Bourne 's discussion of the Race Elements and Social Conditions in Spanish America , and his chapter on Spanish Experience with Negro Slaves , possess , in addition to their value as history , a peculiar usefulness for those citizens of the United States today who wish to gain insight into the psychology of the Spanish-speaking peoples recently added to our territorial population , or into the character of those states with which commercial relations will henceforth bring us more and more into contact .  | Professor Bourne shows that the badly administered justice and the financial corruption found throughout Spanish America were in direct violation of the efforts and intentions of the government . He gives us a keen criticism of the traditional view of Las Casas and the Spanish enslaving of Indians . Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It is as one-sided to depict the Spanish Indian policy primarily from his pages as it would be to write a history of the American negro question exclusively from the files of the " Liberator , " or after a century of American rule in the Philippines to judge it solely from the anti-imperialistic tracts of the last few years ' ( p. 257 ) . Not only did Spain begin negro slavery in the New World ; she also furnished the first abolitionist . Before either the Pennsylvania Quakers or Judge Sewall had made their protests , the Jesuit Alphonso Sandoval in the beginning of the seventeenth century attacked both the institution and the trade in his work De Instauranda Aethiopum Salute . ' The last chapter gives a sketch of the transmission of Spanish culture to the New World , and leads to this conclusion : If we compare Spanish America with the United States a hundred years ago , we must recognize that while in the North there was a sounder party politic , a purer social life , and a more general dissemination of elementary education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and greater poverty , more imposing monuments of civilization , such as public buildings , institutions of learning , and hospitals , more populous and richer cities , a higher attainment in certain branches of science . No one can read Humboldt 's account of the City of Mexico and its establishments for the promotion of science and the fine arts without realizing that , whatever may be the superiority of the United States in these respects , they have been mostly the gains of the age of steam ' ( pp. 315-316 ) . The Spanish American peoples have lacked the inspiration of united action , and their resources and powers have been frittered away in intestine quarrels . If the formidable apparition of the ever extending United States draws them together for mutual defense ; if the construction of railroads sufficiently overcomes the great geographical impediments to unity ; if the Monroe Doctrine shall serve the temporary purpose of protecting . them from foreign attack during this period of mutual approach ? there may yet arise a great SpanishAmerican federal State , the counterpart of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alien lands and peoples to the south , and the home of a great people which with the infusion of new blood will free itself from the evils of its earlier life while preserving the best of the heritage from Spain ' ( pp. 317-318 ) . In the volume on England in America , ' President Lyon G. Tyler has given us a scrupulously fair and a very interesting work . The field is one in which there have been many workers , and this volume does not exhibit the freshness of scholarship that characterizes Professor Bourne 's work . The author gives us no detailed study of institutional growth , but a general narrative . Here one inevitably compares President Tyler 's work with that of the late Mr. Fiske , with results not at all to the disadvantage of President Tyler . Captain John Smith 's deeds are told at some length , and President Tyler finds time to make a plea for the Pocahontas story . The progress of Virginia after 1624 is made more clear than is usually the case . The chapter upon Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . The account of New England shows no lack of appreciation of the sterling qualities of the Puritan society , though the tone is by no means that of the hagiology ' of Massachusetts historians . There is little room for detailed discussions , so we find still The introduction of negro slavery ' in 1619 , with no reference here or in the bibliography to Dr. Ballagh 's strong argument that this was not ' slavery ' in the later sense of the term . Again , to the struggle of Lord Baltimore with the Jesuits is devoted a single sentence , and Professor Dennis 's valuable article on this subject is unnoticed . The account of the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut is the traditional one , with which it is helpful to compare that of Professor Osgood in his book on The American Colonies . ' Into a single chapter entitled ' Colonial Neighbors ' is compressed all that is said by President Tyler about the beginning of New France and of New Netherland . In the case of New France , we are promised a separate volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that just five pages should be devoted to the narrative of Dutch colonization seems to show a lack of proportion . Unfortunately , even this condensation is not very successful , for several omissions and inaccuracies are found . Hudson receives very meagre treatment ; William Usselincx 's name is not mentioned except in connection with Gustavus Adolphus ; the story of the English protest to the States General , in 1621 , and of the answer of the Dutch Government to this protest , is not wholly correct ; the charter to the West India Company did not give only an exclusive right to trade , ' for , as Professor Cheyney points out , it distinctly permitted colonization . Peter Minuit did not in 1626 succeed May , but Verhulst , who held the directorship after May . The charter of privileges and exemptions was granted by the company to the patroons , with the approval of the government : hence it is hardly correct to speak of the company obtaining a new- charter ' ( pp. 291-295 ) . Finally ,  | there is very decided need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Tyler leaves it , and the story where Professor Andrews takes it up . The fifth volume and the last of this group is an account of ' Colonial Self-Government ' by Prof. C. MeL . Andrews , which continues through 1689 the story begun by President Tyler . This is very certainly the best general account of this period that has yet appeared . One feels that the author not only has intimate acquaintance with the old sources , but also has been fortunate enough to reach considerable new material . This appears especially in the clear account of the commercial code of Great Britain and of the organs of administration that were developed ; in the description of the successive councils that led up to the permanent Board of Trade and Plantations established in 1696 , and of the plans for the control of the colonies and for their union for defensive purposes . Professor Andrews is especially to be congratulated upon the catholic view of colonial history that he presents to us . As successful as his descriptions of institutions is the author 's delineation of personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Penn 's own intentions and acts are kept to the front , yet without any suggestion of hero-worship . Penn , we learn , was morally justified in his boundary controversy with the Baltimores , but Professor Andrews 's concession that the technical right lay with Baltimore , and we can not admire Penn 's inclination to ignore it ' ( p. 247 ) evidences his desire to be absolutely impartial . Again , the traditional picture of Andros , drawn largely from New England sources , is subjected , to sharp criticism , and we are told that as compared with many other colonial governors , he was upright , sympathetic and faithful ' ( p. 93 ) . Professor Andrews finishes his narrative with the story of the Revolution of 1689 as it developed in Massachusetts , Maryland , and New York . Of Massachusetts he states , in conclusion : When in 1691 a revised charter was granted , it created a government of the type of New York or New Jersey , instead of the old popular government ' ( p. 279 ) . A discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still less to the present review , but certainly there were very marked differences between the government of Massachusetts under it , and that of New York . The description of the social , economic , and religious conditions within the edlonies is here and there hardly so carefully worked out as the study of governmental institutions . Though he refers to President Tyler 's chapter on the subject , Professor Andrews seems to ignore the thanksgivings over the non-existence of free schools in Virginia . Again the account given of the commercial legislation , which is so helpful in its outline of the purpose of these laws and of their history , is less satisfactory when it comes to telling just how they worked in the different groups of colonies . We have tried thus to sum up briefly the general plan of the work and what we may call the individuality of each volume . For the outward dress of the books we have only praise . The volumes are excellently printed , and serviceably bound . A very few typographical errors have escaped the editor 's watchful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' p. 37 , note , has lost an h ' ; while Wilhelmi ' p. 291 , note 1 , has added a spurious In Volume IV . p. 83 , line 2 , or ' should be to ' ; and on p. 332 , Vestusta ' should be Vetusta . ' In Volume V. , p. 3.53 , F. E. Sharp ' might effectively hide the identity of F. E. Sparks , ' which is the correct name . We must not omit commendation of the bibliographical matter appended to each volume . If we may be permitted a word of criticism of the series as a whole , we feel sure that , by serious students of history , The American Nation ' will be rated not as a whole , but volume by volume according to the worth of each . Some will hardly be relied upon for reference ; but volumes like that of Professor Bourne will take their place as standard works . For the general reader , if he is not deterred by the enormous amount of matter , by the separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy linking , ' the work will prove a mine of information interestingly told , well arranged , and attractively published , Yet even the general reader may be very willing to adopt as his final opinion these words of Professor Jameson , uttered several years ago : Stretched upon the Procrustean bed of uniform requirements in respect to extensiveness and general method of treatment , the authors can present only those things which they have in common ? abundant and correct information and acute historical criticism . Many of the finer qualities of the individual mind are apt to evaporate in the process , much of what is most valuable in - individual views and conceptions of history will find no place for itself . No one who appreciates these will readily assent to the assertion in the prospectus to the " Narrative and Critical History " that , " when the superiority of the cooperative method is fully understood , the individual historian , if he ventures forth at all , will be read for entertainment rather than for profit .
