txt In that assemblage of the equity and the conscience of the nations I which The Hague Tribunal ought to be we are entitled to speak with an authority quite irrelevant to the military force with which we can back up our contentions , and which the very purpose of the tribunal is to supersede by more enlightened means . The sneer of B'REDRRICK the Great at the private critic of his public malefactions ? " How many men can he bring into the field ? " ? Is not likely to be openly echoed at The Hague in relation to any suggestion urged by the United States . Such a suggestion is embodied in the President 's discussion of the propriety of substituting ordinary legal process for the use of public force in the collection of private debts , Making war to distrain a debtor is between nations the equivalent of what , between individuals , is that Imprisonment for debt which has long been abandoned as a relics of barbarism by the nations which still , as nations , continue to employ it in international cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation is weak . Some of us may wish , notwithstanding the President 's explanation , that the principle involved had been more distinctly enunciated by the Pan-American Conference , and more aggressively taken up by the President . But , of course , a stricture on the present President for lack of aggressiveness is a compliment . And of course the reasons against an assemblage of debtor nations assuming to limit methods of collection are at least plausible . .. At any rate , there will be no dissent , among considerate Americans , from the spirit of what the President has to say about the army and navy . We are yet far off from that reign of the Golden Rule in international politics which the most prosperous , pacific , and industrial of all the nations would desire . Until the nations have declined to learn war any more , until selfish or dynastic ambition can no longer reach across the sea , we must be in the position of " the strong man armed keeping his house . " We have an enormous stretch of vulnerable seacoast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be prepared to defend it with an adequate navy . And in case an invader should slip by our naval defense , we must oe prepared with an army adequate to repel any force it is even remotely possible for him to land . It Is a question which may any day become a vital question . On this question the President speaks with authority and ought to be accepted as the spokesman of his people . He emphasizes the importance of a strong navy . Possibly he is led to emphasize this comparatively by reason of his past official connecItion with the navy . At any rate , when he says that the navy need be kept only up to its present tonnage , fighting force , and personnel , his fellow-citizens will be glad to accept the assurance as a reassurance . They ought also to accept his proviso that every ship and every gun and every man must be maintained at the highest known standard of efficiency . - The same with the army . As a fighting icrce our army approved itself in Cuba , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal of the best in the world . As an administrative machine it proved itself an awful failure , threatening National 1 calamity in a more serious case . It is now nearly or quite at the statutory minimum . All the more reason why , unit for unit , it should be equal in efficiency in every respect to the best in the world . The President points with proper pride to the contrast of the late little expedition to Cuba with the expedition to Cuba in 1898 . He ascribes the difference to the creation in the interval of the General Staff . Surely the General Staff , one of the institutions which we owe to Mr. ROOT , has fully vindicated its usefulness . The present head of it Is an officer in the prime of his powers , and not an officer on the eve of his retirement . All that the President has to say about the legislative means for promoting the efficiency of the two services bears evidence of having been said on the authority of the wisest officers of both services . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will avail to prevent the enactment of the spirit of his recommendations into law .
