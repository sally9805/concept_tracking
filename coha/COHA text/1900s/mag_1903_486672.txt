President Roosevelt has now ordered acts of war against Colombia . No other interpretation can be put upon his instructions to our naval commanders to prevent Colombian troops from embarking at Buenaventura , or any other national port . This goes far beyond the preliminary affront to Colombia in recognizing the twenty-minute republic of Panama , as Senator Teller aptly calls it That was bad enough . It was an act which Professor Woolsey of the chair of international law in Yale University declares to be without justification in correct principles . To notify a Government that a seceding State has " accomplished " its independence , almost ' before the central authorities had heard that there was even a revolution , was a step which would , of course , have led to an instant declaration of war if the offended nation had not been as an infant to a prize-fighter . But now the President has outdone even that act of aggression , and has put us technically in a state of war with Colombia Almost more amazing is the reason which he assigns for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch , " holds that this policy is in the interest of the general good . " But the President of the United States is a creature of law . Warrant for his public acts he must seek , - not in his own magnanimous though possibly fallible impulses , but in the law of the land  --  in treaties , in the Constitution , in the statutes of the United States . It is safe to say , however , that in none of these can Mr. Roosevelt find the shred of a sanction for his hostile course towards Colombia . He sends his vessels of war to Colombian waters and asserts jurisdiction there . He threatens to sink any transport which may put to sea with troops of a country with which we are at peace . And when we ask quo warranto ? the answer is " the general good " ? that is , Mr. Roosevelt 's own notion of what the general good requires . It is the stereotyped plea of irresponsible tyrants in all ages . - Financial critics have observed the irony that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of other people 's companies , brought him as widespread condemnation for putting water into his own companies . In some such fashion Secretary Hay seems ready to be the demolisher of the edifice he has laboriously constructed . The Chinese negotiations , broadly speaking , Ars his best title to diplomaticfame . In meeting the tortuous policy of Russia , he has shown an imperturbable patience and an indefatigable resourcefulness . His strength in all these matters has been less that of our fleet and ' army than the moral advantage of speaking for a disinterested nation and against oppression of a weak people . To say that the United States did not desire a foot of Chinese territory was worth a squadron . And now Secretary Hay has treated Colombia far more outrageously than Russia ever treated China . For Russia has at least had the advantage of tolerated possession in Mantchuria , she has formally at least respected Chinese suzerainty , she has always ' alleged colorable excuses for not withdrawing on the promised dates , she has used the delays and decencies of diplomacy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of force . Compare this with Secretary Hay 's treatment of Colombia : he has recognized a rebellion overnight , and forbidden the regular Government to exercise the inalienable right of every nation to protect its own sovereignty ; he has reversed in a day the diplomatic precedents of a half century towards Colombia ; he has punished an independent nation refusing a treaty by filching the territory under negotiation ; where the Russians have had a colorable show of maintaining their own vested rights , he has trampled upon rights assured by many treaties and precedents . With what face can he now conduct any humane or disinterested negotiation for another nation ? One may imagine the open scorn with which St. Petersburg will wave aside virtuous pretensions emanating from Washington . Secretary Hay , in defence of the " justice and equity " of the rash act of the President in ordering Colombia out of Panama , makes citations from his predecessors in office . They prove conclusively that we are under solemn obligations to respect and defend the sovereignty of Colombia over the Isthmus . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for our right to keep transit open , no one has questioned that . It ' has never been interfered with . Hence references to that part of the treaty are irrelevant . Is it not , in fact , adding insult to injury to assure Colombia that we are slapping her in the face solely in obedience to treaty stipulations ? Mr. Hay makes much of the rejection of the canal treaty by the Colombian Congress . Has he never heard of - the Hay-Pauncefote treaty , ' Contumeliously rejected by our Senate ? That was never alleged by England as a grievance . Not even Mr. Hay broke out in revolution in consequence . His whole stateMent is singularly ITIP0i4c13ist1c . Ng oneknows better than he that to find warrant in " the interests of civilization " is to do exactly what Napoleon did in overrunning Europe as a military conqueror . What a pity that Sackville West was British Minister to Washington before the time of the latest diplomacy ! He had been in the service many years when , in 1888 , he received his passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote the Democratic ticket as most favorable to English interests . For this offence his public career came to an abrupt end . Nowadays your telegraphic diplomat of twenty-four hours ' standing , representing a republic not yet out of its first week in the incubator , advises Senators with impunity , and lunches with the Secretary of State in all dignity thereafter . Poor Senator Morgan ! For years he , has resisted the arguments and appeals of the greater portion of the American press , and has bitterly opposed what he has considered the Panama iniquity , only to be told by a fledgling **25;248;TOOLONG diplomat that it is time for him to " call off " his opposition , Could there be a more bitter humiliation than this ? The diplomat 's brother turns out to have been a " heavy stockholder in the old canal company , " a " plunger in the new company , " who is " likely to win a fortune " if the present sordid transactions are concluded We do not wonder that Senator Morgan exclaimed that he had received an offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he escaped an apoplectic shock , particularly when he heard the good news that he was to be replaced as Chairman of the Senate Canal Committee by that eminent canal-builder , M. A. Hanna . Many disappointed partisans of Mayor Low now say that if he had not been so strict in the enforcement of the laws , he could have been reelected . We are told that he ought not to have insisted on licensing all the peddlers and pushcart wagons . This is thought to have cost him the East Side vote . Similarly , he lost the support of the Broad and Wall Street office boys who were accustomed to lunching from pushcarts in the streets and blocking the thoroughfares during the noon hour . Their feeling is similar to the view that the Mayor " failed to take care of those who supported him . " It seems hardly necessary at this late day to say that a public official has no choice but to enforce the laws , and that when he did so Mr. Low won every one 's respect . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is the extrePle oaf 11111141 .. qe , " the Mayor winked at the non-enforcement of the excise law , his Administration steadily lost ground in the popular regard . It did not begin to show signs of strength until Gen. Greene came into office . What the disappointed ought to do now is to cease from grumbling , and join the movement to solve the excise question and " take it out of politics " by some just and satisfactory law . Then they can lend their influence to the repeal of less important statutes if it seems to them wise and proper to do so . This is the manly way . To criticise defeated candidates for having done their sworn duty is the last thing we should hear of In the collapse of Devery 's farcical candidacy , there is at least a crumb of comfort . In his own district the Big Chief managed to poll 1,135 votes out of a total of more than 9,600 ; but it is safe to say that every member of the Independent People 's Party was bought at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Devery 's vote pass 100 . Evidently , his advice to take all that was offered and then vote as you chose , was not unheeded by the beneficiaries of " The Pump . " The case is full of instruction for those who imagined that:in some mysterious fashion , Devery 's candidacy was to promote the fortunes of the Fusion ticket . The result makes these augurs look very foolish . Apparently , nobody voted for Devery except a few who were hopelessly in his debt , and a handful of brainless folk who dearly . love a bad joke We can not hope that there was any moral indignation in the repudiation of Devery by the plain people Whom he so assidubusly blarneyed , there was , however , a deal of common sense in refusing to take the mountebank for a politician . Undoubtedly , the plain people had their reasons , though bad , for voting for Tammany . There never were any reasons for voting for Devery except in the superheated minds of some of the flightier friends of good government . The defeat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican deadlock in the Senate , and carries to fruition the Roosevelt and Platt conspiracy to give back to the latter the complete control of the Legislature , of which he was temporarily deprived last winter by the bolting Republican Senators . Thanks to several up-State and local victories , the Easy Boss has also strengthened his grasp on the Assembly . In this respect Republican success is no more to the advantage of good government than is Tammany success . However much Senator Platt may assure the city of his devotion to civic decency , his flagrant indecency in . State matters makes it ever necessary to watch him as a detective Watches a confidence . man . Gruber 's ob vious willingness to sacrifice Fusion for his pet judge  --  whom , however , he happily lost  --  shows the natural boss instinct of betrayal . The folly of Mr. Roosevelt 's friendliness towards Platt and Quay and men of their stripe becomes more apparent every day . While ostensibly making for the advantage of the Republican party , it really menaces , and menaces seriously , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral ideas can hope to retain the respect of honest voters when it is represented by such men as its present State bosses . The evil results of the McClelland bargain the Republican party will feel more at the next election than this , after a cut-and-dried machine-made session of the Legislature . It will undoubtedly help the Democrats to carry the State for their Presidential electors next fall . Gov . Garvin 's reelection has excited virtuous rage in Rhode Island : The Democrats and the independent Republicans who ' supported Dr. Garvin were very unfeeling in their treatment of the Republican machine . They actually ventured to hire detectives to stop bribery nit the polls . As a committee headed by Bishop MoVickar had already been circulating in pamphlet form the Evening Post articles on corruption in Rhode Island , and had been agitating for an honest election , the employment of detectives was obviously the culmination of a dastardly attack upon the right of a freeman to sell his vote to whom he pleases for whatever price he pleases . The Providence Journal , mouthpiece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown to the defence of Rhode Island liberties . It does not hesitate to print the charge that the pamphlets were " published and distributed by a sect of Christian 's which aspires to call itself the only true and catholic church of America " ; that the enemies of the machine , including the arch-villain , " the bishop of the diocese , " are a " motley throng , " and that the detectives were " Hessians hired to risk their lives for a stated cause . " These banded hosts of evil , led by the clergymen , college professors , philanthropists , and other well-known rascals of the ( State , have won a temporary ? victory ; but , it is gratifying to ' observe , the friends of the machine , though angry , are undismayed . They declare that , in spite of the malevolent activity of the " hireling and ' the zealot , " " we ' are hopeful of the future , because we have faith to believe that those who honestly strive for better things eventually receive abundant reward for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern stuff of which bnoral heroes are made . For years past the educated and refined colored man or woman travelling in the South has had one way of escaping the hateful " Jim Crow " car . By paying . the additional fare he or she could secure a chair or a berth in a Pullman car , without being set apart like an animal to be shunned or a contaminating leper . Now we must record with humiliation an effort to put all colored people out of the Pullman cars , hitherto deemed beyond the reach of race discrimination owing to the Federal Interstate Commerce laws . The movement began , it appears , with Gov . Frazier of Tennessee , who protested to the State Railway Commission , and induced that body to order the Pullman Company to keep the negroes out . Instructions to this effect are said to have been already issued by the Louisville and Nashville , and the Nashville , Chattanooga &; St. Louis Railway ; and W. L. Granbery , a counsel of the Pullman Company , announces that that company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A meeting of the Southern Pullman agents to discuss this issue is also announced . It is to be held in Chicago But why , asks the Charlotte Observer pertinently , is such a gathering necessary if the Pullman Company can be regulated by State boards ? Against the proposed outrage the colored people may be expected to protest at once They should take immediate steps to bring the issue before the courts in order to ascertain if the rights they have always had may be thus taken from them overnight , and they themselves made more than ever a " class apart . " Thursday 's announcement that the Steel Corporation had cut the price of steel four dollars per ton , seemed to be received on Wall Street almost with consternation . There are other quarters , however , where we suspect the news was greeted with complacency . We refer particularly to the railways , whose recent reports have unanimously testified to the enormous increase in the year 's expenditure , caused by the high cost of materials and supplies The building trade has been handicapped by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that steel rails and structural steel were not reduced in price by the cut ; but the general tendency is plain enough . What caused the stock market 's dismay was undoubtedly , in the first place , the old tradition that , as the price of steel and iron moves , so moves general trade , and , in the second , doubt as to how the cut in steel would affect the Steel Corporation 's revenues . The explanation given is , that the cut was to stimulate trade . Clearly , trade needed " stimulating . The company 's statement of October 6 , when the common-stock dividend was reduced , showed that its earnings for September were nearly $2,000 ; 000 under 1902 , and that . orders for steel then in its hands for future manufacture were 1,100,000 tons below last autumn  --  a decrease of 22 per cent . In view of such conditions , lowering of prices seems a reasonable step , it is the Carnegie Company 's historic policy on such occasions . So , we presume , the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reduction also confesses publicly the folly and hollowness of the theories which our great financiers set forth in 1901 . Only make your companies big enough in stock and bonds , and we shall have no more fluctuations in prices of materials . Well , the experiment has been tried , though not yet to the end , and two points are already conclusively established Even a billion-dollar company can not maintain prices for its product if the consuming public cuts down its purchases Furthermore , when such prices do decline , signs of alarm are witnessed , not from the small establishments which were to be abolished by the " new finance , " but from the great combine itself which had to earn $60 , , 000,000 annually to pay its dividends . Mr. Chamberlain was , for him , on the defensive last week at Birmingham He admitted that British trade was not perishing , conceded even that great prosperity had followed the adoption of free trade But he insisted that the country had prospered only in the ratio of its natural increase of population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtake population . England , then , ' though flourishing , has enjoyed only a portion of the well-being that under a protective system would assuredly have been hers At first blush this strikes one as a weak appeal , and as far less cogent than the old wail over declining trade . Yet for an audience of manufacturers the argument did not lack attractiveness Mr. Chamberlain was not appealing to supposititious profits lost in the past ; he was rather promising enhanced profits in the future He was making the straightforward protectionist approach to the cupidity of the manufacturing interests . That argument is always formidable . As usual , Mr. Chamberlain scored off Cobden , asserting that the great free trader had promised , should England adopt free trade , that the United States would abandon its premature manufacturing and send the mill hands back to the fields " to dig and delve and plough for us . " Before condemning Cobden as a foolish prophet on the strength of a scrap torn from context , it may be well to recall what he actually thought of the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1835 . As he passed the Alleghanies and for the first time looked upon the Mississippi basin , he wrote : " Hererwill one day be the headquarters of agricultural and manufacturing industry ; here will one day centre the civilization , the wealth , the power of the entire world . " Again , speculating on the people " which shall surpass and supersede the Yankees , " he says : " They must be a race that will be able to dispense with food and sleep altogether . " A little later he declared " that it is from the west rather than from the east that danger to the supremacy of Great Britain is to be apprehended ; that is , from the silent and peaceful rivalry of American commerce , the growth of its manufactures , its rapid progress in internal improvements , the superior education of its people , and their economical and pacific government " These last advantages we have largely sacrificed since 1835 , but the extracts effectually dispose of Mr Chamberlain 's imputation of a bucolic vision of America to Cobden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity . In fact , the fundamental fallacy of the Chamberlain idea is that it neglects British wealth outside of the two kingdoms . No Little Englander could take a more myopic attitude toward Imperial bookkeeping . The prosperity of the British in colonies and dependencies would be no less real though the political status of the Britains beyond the seas should be changed But Mr. Chamberlain prefers to put the wealth and the population of Great Britain under the glass , and to declare that the ratio of diameters is unsatisfactory . Signor Giolitti has been the political manager of the Italian Ministry for two years past , so that his assumption of the Premier 's title means little real change of policy . The only recruit of real strength in the new Cabinet is the veteran economist Luzzatti , who accepts the Treasury portfolio . Presumably , Giolitti will endeavor to continue the alliance with the Parliamentary Socialists , by virtue of which a coalition Ministry has shown surprising stability . Giolitti is heartily in favor of reduction of the food taxes and of radical reform in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone The scandals of the Banca Romana passed near enough to him to leave him smirched , if not formally implicated In general he bears the reputation of cultivating rather the arts of the politician than of the statesman . It is matter of surprise that he accepts the Prime Ministry , for it seems that the present Government can be only a stop-gap at best . Very likely Signor Giolitti has a very definite programme of fiscal and tax reform in mind  --  one that he may Present to the constituencies with the reasonable hope of being returned to Montecitorio with a genuine majority . The politics of the Dual Empire falls into deeper confusion through the announcement of a new Bohemian nationalist programme . In a sense the new demands merely raise more emphatically than before the old language question . But they have an added weight in view of the partial surrender of the Government to similar demands by the Hungarians . Obvidusly , if the Emperor is to found another Czech University , encourage the use of the langauge in schools , impose it upon certain parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation . If he refuses to do as much for the Bohemians as he has done for the Hungarians , the Bohemian Nationalists threaten to use " the sharpest parliamentary " opposition to the present Government . That means a renewal of obstructive tactics at Vienna by the Czechs , and probably also an increase of the chronic disaffection of the Magyars . Theoretically , separation ought to prevail very soon in the Empire . The situation of a Hapsburg Emperor caught between two alien and hostile races becomes daily more anomalous . But if living together is difficult for the races composing the Empire of Austria , separation seems impracticable . Bohemia certainly would stand aghast if by some sudden turn she were taken at her word , read out of the Empire , and made an independent State . The Sultan , it is reported , stands on his dignity in respect to the new demands of Austria and Russia . He reminds those Powers that he has already promised various reforms which to the best of his ability he has executed . He resents , accordingly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the attitude of one who knows that the insurrection is over for the winter , and is assured that his Christian mentors have no intention - of coercing him . If the new plan were put into effect , however , it would greatly relieve the situation . A grave defect is the retention of Hilmi Pasha as the Governor-General of the four disturbed vilayets . An autonomous Governor directly responsible to the Powers is the indispensable minimum of reform . But there is at least a theoretical gain in the stipulation of Christian inspectors to supervise the administration , and in the provision for officering the Turkish gendarmerie from the armies of the Powers . Similar reforms have failed in practice , but the mere enlargement of the demands upon the Porte is an indication at least of the time when the Near Eastern question will be dealt with seriously . From these demands of Austria and Russia , as from any joint action of these Powers , indeed , rather little is to be hoped . Their immediate stake is too great , their eventual interests too opposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is a case for magnanimity .
