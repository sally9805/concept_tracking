 |p613  ONE winter evening , when the garrison of Port Arthur was still stubbornly holding its own against Nogi 's invincible veterans and the big , sullen army under Kuropatkin was being slowly forced from the peninsula , a slender , seductive creature stepped before the footlights of a certain popular concert-hall in St. Petersburg and was about to begin her song . She was currently known as the protegee of a notorious grand duke and in her hair , about her throat , and on her fingers glistened a fortune in gems . The orchestra had , however , played but a few opening bars when a stalwart workman with shaggy head and flaming eves suddenly sprang to his feet and shaking his fist at the singer cried in a voice burning with indignation , " Take off those jewels ; they are not diamonds , they are drops of Russian blood ! " The audience was electrified , and , quick to appreciate the stinging rebuke which the young artisan had administered to the criminal indifference and profligacy of the aristocracy , they promptly hissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation of the war in the Far East and the stirring and sanguinary events nearer home , the Russian public , like the Parisians of the early seventies , have continuously thronged the theaters and kindred places of amusement . The tragic uncertainty as to what each day might bring forth has been followed , toward evening , by a reaction wholly natural and human . Not only in St. Petersburg and Moscow , but in Riga , Kiev , Odessa and all the larger cities of the empire the fevered intensity and pathetic foreboding of the populace have found both a reflex and an outlet in the playhouse . It has been in the theater that the pulse of this great , convulsed and suffering nation could best be felt , that the temper of the masses could most accurately be gauged . At the present moment many of the leading places of amusement are closed and theatrical interests are virtually paralyzed , but until the recent storm broke , conditions were more than ordinarily encouraging . Numerous characteristic incidents have occurred , none perhaps more dramatic or significant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved typical of some particular phase of popular feeling . To the authorities , one of the most troublesome features of the situation has been the wild demonstrations of enthusiasm aroused by the singing and reciting of revolutionary verses . These , of course , have been introduced as encores since the regular programme is always passed upon by the theatrical censor . Of late , certain wellknown performers have not hesitated to lampoon the imperial family under the thinnest disguises , the result being that rigid instructions have been issued to the police prohibiting all encores unless previously approved by the censor . Some idea of the personal popularity enjoved by the actress in Russia can best be understood when it is recalled that three of them were largely responsible for the successful breaking of the St. Petersburg postal strike in January last . They were Mme. Lahfinskaya , of the ballet , Mme. Markova , of the Imperial Opera , and Mme. Mironova , of Suyorin 's Theater . Snugly wrapped in furs and driving about in smart sleighs , they spent several days delivering letters and parcels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , are the favorites of the stage more ac-  |p615  @# claimed and more beloved than in Russia . The audiences of Paris , Berlin or even Vienna seem stolid and apathetic beside those of the chief Slavic cities . Though a large and concentrated student body is partially responsible for this condition , the rank and file of playgoers are singularly impressionable and enthusiastic . Ovations such as take place among us only on the rarest occasions are of frequent occurrence in the theaters of Russia . Hence it is natural that the social and political , as well as the purely artistic influence of the theater , should be particularly important throughout the empire . Though officialism and bureaucracy have for years been paramount in tsardom , it is refreshing to realize that the stage in Russia is in the hands of no clique nor caste . Managers , actors and singers are alike recruited from every walk of life . A princess is the lessee and star of one of the leading theaters in St. Petersburg , an ex-manufacturer and merchant of Moscow is Russia 's foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world at large that Maxim Gorky is to-day the most popular author and publicist in Russia , it may not be so generally known that the idol of Russian audiences is his most intimate friend , Shalyapin , the basso of the Imperial Opera in Moscow . Years ago , when Gorky was an abused and half-starved baker 's assistant in Kazan , the man who is now hailed as the prince of Russian singers and the Kean of Russian actors was sitting at a cobbler 's bench in that same quaint , semi-Tatar town . Later on , and still unknown to each other , they both drifted to Tiflis , where Gorky was a railway hand , and the future operatic star was singing in the chorus of a second-rate theater . Barely two years later , when they had each become famous , their paths crossed again , and this time they met and became fast friends , both having known anguish and obscurity , both at last sharing universal applause and publicity . Yet it must not be taken for granted that the personal vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic scenes which have been enacted in crowded concerthall , are the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian stage . The real social significance of the theater in Russia is best exemplified and can best be studied in a series of remarkable plays produced , for the most part , during the  |p616  past half-dozen years in Moscow and performed with unprecedented success on every available stage in the empire . It is obvious to any student of Russian affairs that the drama is to-day relatively accomplishing what the novel did during the fifties and sixties . We have Gorky 's own words to the effect that fiction has largely ceased to be a vital form , and it only remains to add that the play is proving its logical successor . Within the decade a new race of prophets has sprung up using the actor as their mouthpiece and the stage as their battleground . While the pages of Turgenev , Dostoevsky and Tolstoy will always palpitate with pity , will always evoke a haunting , troubled beauty , their specific task has been fulfilled ; the serfs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was at least fearlessly outlined . To-day it is no longer these issues , but the struggle for a constitution , the extension of suffrage , common humanity to the Jews , and the modification or even obliteration of autocracy that have burned themselves into popular consciousness . About certain of these themes have been written , with more or less explicit intent , dramas depicting in relentless accents existing social and political conditions . The plays which have lately made so profound an impression on the Russian public , which have awakened Russians to a pathetic consciousness of their weakness and lack of will , or have aroused in them a species of heroic ardor , have in large part been written by Chekhov and by Gorky . Other men such as Chfrikov and Naidvenov are valiantly continuing the work , but it was the gentle , ironical painter of the " Intellectuals " and the indignant champion of the submerged who , more than any of their colleagues , realized the social function of the drama . It is with an acute sense of regret that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of the latter . Regarding , as we comfortably do , the theater as a place of diversion , as a convenient escape from business or from boredom , it is difficult for us to comprehend the vital influence on the Russian public of such productions as Chekhov 's " Sea Gull , " Gorkv 's " At the Bottom , " Naidyenov 's " Vanvushin 's Children " or Chirikov 's " Chosen People . " It should , however , be remembered that the average Russian takes art seriously . He preaches no such insipid cant as " art for art 's sake . " His best novels and his best plays are dedicated to a broader , deeper passion than the mere craving for esthetic stimu/ lus , and not until most of the country 's wrongs are righted or her bleeding wounds are healed , will fiction or the drama settle complacently down to a trivial dilettanteism . It is unnecessary to detail the plot of any of these pieces . For the most part they are transcriptions of that baffling struggle for light and freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cherished champions . The " Sea Gull " full of eager , soaring aims ; wings her way into the gray mists of blighted hope and falls stunned upon the shore . Before the fitful rushlight of " At the Bottom " pass and repass the forlorn or insolent shadows of humanity 's poor outcasts . " Vanyushin 's Children , " deprived of their birthright of parental tenderness and understanding , curse their father and leave him to moral isolation and suicide ; while here at our feet the " Chosen People " fall helpless victims of a ferocious , unreasoning hatred . You will doubtless maintain that all this is revolting , and is even steeped with needless horror , yet the picture is rarely painted in a single , unrelieved tone . Through Plain Folk " rings a manful song of triumph , and often an endearing pity and commiseration illumine the saddest heart or the shabbiest exterior . In essence these plays are a protest against actual conditions , a condemnation of that system which has so long blighted the best endeavor of brain or hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtrusive , for over each effort hangs the menacing ban of the censor keeping propaganda rigorously in the background . Whatever the lesson taught , it must be couched in the broad language of life , not in the narrow terms of a theory or a thesis . Not infrequently a play will slip under the nose of authority and on its production will create such a furore that it has to be immediately suppressed . Such was lately the case with Gorkv 's " Datchniki , " or " Cottagers . " Privately performed in Moscow , it was afterwards given by Mme. Kommissarzhevskava at the Dramatic Theater in St. Petersburg to the accompaniment of such violent demonstrations of approval that the authorities felt impelled to prohibit any further representations . It  |p618  was relatively easy to forego " Datchniki , " which merely shows a swarm of thoughtless flies buzzing on the brink of destruction , but a further order forbidding the production of any subsequent play by Gorky on the Russian stage proved a far more serious matter . His latest dramatic effort , entitled " Children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was hence not produced until the recent manifesto according conditional freedom of speech and of the press became operative . Not less remarkable than the current Russian drama is the manner of its interpretation . Utterly devoid of convention or artifice , sometimes scarcely more than a succession of profoundly realistic scenes transferred direct from life to the stage , these plays have proved a vital source of inspiration alike to actor and producer . The social upheaval which has in part been brought about by the Russian drama , has been accompanied by an almost equally significant artistic revolution . Hand in hand with the playwright has gone the player , both seeking truth with an almost sacred ardor , both striving to place before the public an unflinching lesson in sincerity , an irresistible appeal to sympathy . While the ascendency of the drama has been due to the enthusiasm of a group of men , the consummate achievement of certain Russian actors is largely traceable to one individual . Something over a decade ago , the performances given by the leading amateur dramatic society of Moscow became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of a wealthy man of business who , though an admirable actor , proved to be an altogether exceptional stage manager . A practical man , as well as the possessor of progressive artistic ideals , it was not long before he decided to make professional use of his capacity in this direction . With certain of his former associates , and a few advanced pupils from the Philharmonic Conservatory , this manufacturer - manager founded the Moscow Artistic Theater . Though he began modestly enough the public was quick to recognize the originality of his methods and the high seriousness of his aims . The most ambitious students and some of the best-known actors in Russia were soon eager to play even small parts in his company , and the influence of his theater shortly reached to the farthest corners of the empire . Constantin Stanislaysky looks , and is , the man of genius . Massive in stature , with a shaggy crown of gray hair and a short , dark mustache , he impresses you at @#  |p619  once with an absolute reverence for truth and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' chat with him is sufficient to give you an idea of why he has been able to achieve such radical results , why he has managed within a few short years to revolutionize the interpretation and production of plays in Russia . His methods are the methods of human nature seen through the medium of a clear , discriminating mind . Though an inflexible realist , what he demands is not reality , but the illusion of reality ; not life , but the closest , tensest , most faithful translation of life . One morning , when he was rehearsing a young woman in a role temperamentally suited to her , but for which she lacked the requisite ease and distinction of manner , he wheeled brusquely round and asked her where she lived . " In the ? , " she replied , naming one of the poorer streets of Moscow . " How much do you pay for your rooms ? " " Sixty roubles a month , " was her puzzled response . " And how much do you spend a year on gowns ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; from to-morrow you will occupy an apartment in the Bielygorod the smartest quarter of Moscow ) . You will have your carriage , your maid , manicure , masseuse and modiste , and in another three months I trust you may feel more at home in the part , " Though three months appears a short time in which to perfect a femme du monde , it seems a long while to spend rehearsing a play , yet with Stanislaysky an ordinary modern comedy with the simplest changes of scene is seldom produced under a hundred or more rehearsals . Every detail , even to the very words the characters exchange with each other sotto voce at the back of the Stage , is scrupulously considered . In spite of this tremendous amount of preparation the final impression is invariably one of refreshing naturalness and spontaneity . Above all , the Stanislaysky actor speaks naturally , a thing rare , if not unknown , on the English stage . Any suspicion of affectation , rant or singsong is in fact utterly tabooed in the best theaters of Russia . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanislaysky 's constellation , and while each actor is re-  |p619  lentlessly required to sacrifice individual talent to ensemble effects , the principal players are all famous and all beloved by the public . Among the women , Mme. Olga Knipper , the widow of Chekhov , and an actress of penetrating tenderness and temperamental power , takes perhaps first rank . In " The Sea Gull , " " Three Sisters " and " Uncle Vanya " by her husband and in Gorky 's " Plain Folk " and " At the Bottom , " she interprets with singular plasticity a widely different range of parts . Mme. Knipper possesses a vaguely haunting voice , and while not conventionally beautiful , exercises a far subtler and more enduring appeal . Sharing , at times , equal honor with Mme. Knipper are Mme. Lilina , the wife of Stanislaysky , a dramatic  |p620  ingenue of the richest promise , and Mme. Andreyva , Gorky 's second wife , whose unquestioned scenic gifts will doubtless achieve for her a more secure place than she has thus far attained . The discovery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not strange that there should be several remarkable instances of this faculty in the personnel of his company . Baranov , the unforgettable Teterev in the " Plain Folk , " he took from a church choir , and out of handsome Veshnevsky , who had been an indifferent exponent of the young lover in the provinces , he made an inimitable character actor . Though both of these men stand high , Moskvin , particularly in such roles as Lukka and the Tsar Feodor , would probably be considered their peer in method and in maturity of talent . Apart from the Moscow Artistic Theater it can not be maintained that the Russian stage offers any conspicuous or sustained instance of nationalism . The work accomplished by Mme. Yavorskaya ( the Princess Bariatinsky ) , though brilliant and interesting , it too spasmodic and uneven to merit special attention . A beautiful , ambitious woman , the Princess Bariatinsky deserves the credit of having been the first Russian actress to win the plaudits of Paris , having taken her company there during the summer of 1902 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage through the success in our midst of Paul Orlenev . Mme. Nasimov and their remarkable St. Petersburg Dramatic Company . Both in their choice of plays and in the manner of interpretation this organization clearly represents the most advanced conception of the drama , their radical ideas having , in fact , been partially responsible for their coming to this country . Paul Orlenev is unquestionably one of the finest exponents of tense , concentrated , histrionic emotion who has ever visited our shores . Though his colleagues particularly commend his elaborate pathological portrait of the Tsar Feodor , he seems equally fulfilling as Oswald in " Ghosts , " or as Raskolnikoy in " Crime and Punishment . " So plastic is her personality and so supreme are her powers of identification , that it would be hazardous to say in what part Mme. Nasimov excels . Her accurate transition from the conscious coquetry and pathetic ardor of Zaza to the eerie poetry of Hilda is alone sufficient to prove her an actress of consummate versatility and charm . It is a pleasure to note that something better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accorded the efforts of these visiting players . And that something is , indeed , what they hoped to find when they were told by their countrymen to carry around the world the lesson taught so tragically in the " Chosen People " ? the lesson of universal brotherhood and universal pity .
