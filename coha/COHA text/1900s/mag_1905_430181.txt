 | Five years before his death , to the surprise of many , Sidney Lanier was selected as the poet who should write a cantata for the opening of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition . Before that time two of his longest and most highly finished poems , " Corn " and the " Symphony " had been printed in Lippincott 's Magazine , nevertheless his fame was still so limited that the literary world did not know what to make of his nomination . Why was a confederate soldier preferred to a defender of the Union ? Why should an unknown poet be selected from Baltimore , when other cities had their favorite famous sons , ? New York her Bryant , Philadelphia her Boker , and Boston her famous trio ? If a young man were to be chosen how did it happen that the lot should fall upon Sidney Lanier , not on Stedman , nor Gilder , nor on that gifted man of kindred soul , the California Sill ? The answer was that Bayard Taylor proposed him and Bayard Taylor was a good critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor name him ? " The answer to this query was not obvious even when the Centennial Ode was printed in the newspapers long before the day of celebration . Its publication , says his biographer , Dr. Ward , " was the occasion of an immense amount of ridicule , more or less good humored . " The author was pained by the criticism but his faith in his ideals of art remained unshaken . As a Baltimorean who had just formed the acquaintance of Lanier , ( both of us being strangers at that time in a city which we came to love as a most hospitable and responsive home , ) I was much interested in his appointment . It was then true , though Dr. Holmes had not yet said it , that Baltimore had produced three poems , each of them the best of its kind : " The Star Spangled Banner " of Key , the " Raven " of Poe , and " Maryland , my Maryland , " by Randall . Was it to produce a fourth poem as remarkable as these ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily journals , prematurely . I read it as one reads news- paper articles , with a rapid glance , and could make no sense of it . Rhyme without reason , I would not say , but certainly words without sentences . I heard the comments of other bewildered critics . I read the piece again and again before the meaning began to dawn on me . Soon afterwards , Lanier 's own explanation appeared and the Dawn became Daylight . The ode was not written " to be read . " It was to be sung , ? and sung not by a single voice , with a piano accompaniment , but in the open air , by a chorus of many hundred voices and with the accompaniment of a majestic orchestra , to music especially written for it by a composer of great distinction . The critical test would be its rendition . From this point of view the Cantata must be judged . I remember well the day of trial . The President of the United States , the Emperor of Brazil , the Governors of States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and naval heroes were seated on the platform in the face of an immense assembly . There was no pictorial effect in the way they were grouped . They were a mass of living beings , a crowd of black-coated dignitaries , not arranged in any impressive order . No Cathedral of Canterbury , no Sanders Hall , no episcopal or academic gowns . The oratory was likewise ineffective . There were loud voices and vigorous gestures , but none of the eloquence which enchants a multitude . The devotional exercises awakened no sentiment of reverence . At length came the Cantata . From the overture to the closing cadence it held the attention of the vast throng of listeners , and when it was concluded loud applause rung through the air . A noble conception had been nobly rendered . Words and music , voices and instruments , produced an impression as remarkable as the rendering of the Hallelujah Chorus in the nave of Westminister Abbey . Lanier had triumphed . It was an opportunity of a lifetime to test upon a grand scale his theory of verse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises I received a letter from Lanier inquiring as to the opportunity offered by Johns Hopkins University ? then recently opened ? to " those prosecuting original researches in science . " This led to an interview in which plans for a chair of Music and Poetry at the University were discussed . I was anxious to have him appointed to such a chair , but  | the trustees did not see their way to do so . A year later I received the following letter written just after his failure to secure a clerkship in Washington : WASHINGTON , D. C. , Sept. 26 , 1877 . DEAR MR . GILMAN : ? From a published report of your very interesting address I learn that there is now a vacant Fellowship . Would I be able to discharge the duties of such a position ? My course of study would be : first , constant research in the physics of musical tone ; second , several years ' devotion to the acquirement of a thoroughly scientific general view of Mineralogy , Botany and Comparative Anatomy ; third , French and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even flighty process ; but it makes straight towards this final result of all my present thought , and I am tempted , by your great kindness , to believe that you would have confidence enough in me to await whatever development should come of it . Sincerely yours , SIDNEY LANIER . It was not deemed advisable to award him the Fellowship . During the winter of 1877- ' 78 he became interested in the study of early English literature , delivering a series of lectures thereon at Mrs. Edgeworth Bird 's in Baltimore . The lectures attracted attention as did those delivered the following year at Peabody Institute . On February 3 , 1879 , his thirty-seventh birthday , I notified him of his appointment to a lectureship in English Literature in the University . The letter here given is a full discussion of his plans and ideals with regard to his work : 180 St. Paul Street , BALTIMORE , Md. , July 13 , 1879 . MY DEAR MR . GILMAN : ? I see , from your letter , that I did not clearly explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lectures " is meant for advanced students , and involves the hardest kind of university work on their part . Perhaps you will best understand the scope of the tasks which this course will set before the student by reading the enclosed theses which I should distribute among the members of the class as soon as I should have discovered their mental leanings and capacities sufficiently , and which I should require to be worked out by the end of the scholastic year . I beg you to read these with some care : I send only seven of them but they will he sufficient to show you the nature of the work which I propose to do with the University student . I should like my main efforts to take that direction ; I wish to get some Americans at hard work in pure literature ; and will be glad if the public lectures in Hopkins Hall shall be merely accessory to my main course . With this view , as you look over the accompanying theses please observe :  | ( 1 . ) That each of these involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute a genuine contribution to modern literary scholarship ; ( 2 . ) That they are so arranged as to fall in with various other studies and extend their range , for example , the first one being suitable to a student of philosophy who is pursuing Anglo-Saxon , the second to one who is studying the Transition Period of English , the sixth to one who is studying Elizabethan English , and so on ; ( 3 . ) That each one necessitates diligent study of some great English work , not as a philological collection of words , but as pure literature ; and ( 4 . ) That they keep steadily in view , as their ultimate object , that strengthening of manhood , that enlarging of sympathy , that glorifying of moral purpose , which the student unconsciously gains , not from any direct didacticism , but from this constant association with our finest ideals and loftiest souls . Thus you see that while the course of " Class Lectures " submitted to you nominally centers about the three plays ofShakspere* therein named , it really takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commentary and of thesis the whole range of English poetry . In fact I have designed it as a thorough preparation for the serious study of the poetic art in its whole outcome , hoping that , if I should carry it out successfully , the Trustees might find it wise next year to create either a Chair of Poetry or a permanent lectureship covering the field above indicated . It is my fervent belief that to take classes of young men and to preach them the gospel according-to-Poety is to fill the most serious gap in our system of higher education ; I think one can already perceive a certain narrowing of sympathy and ? what is even worse ? an unsymmetric development of faculty , both intellectual and moral , from a too exclusive devotion to Science which Science itself would be the first to condemn . As to the first six class-lectures on " The Physics and Metaphysics of Poetry : " they unfold my system of English Prosody , in which I should thoroughly drill every student until he should be able to note down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This drilling would continue through the whole course , inasmuch as I regard a mastery of the principles set forth in those lectures as vitally important to all systematic progress in the understanding and enjoyment of poetry . I should have added , apropos of this Class-course , that there ought to be one examination each week , to every two lectures . In the first interview we had , after my appointment , it was your intention to place this study among those required by the University for a Degree . I hope sincerely you have not abandoned this idea ; and the course outlined in " Class-lectures " forwarded to you the other day and in the theses of which I send the first seven herewith seems to me the best to begin with . If it should be made a part of the " Major Course in Eng- page deleted  | 435 N. Calvert Street , BALTIMORE , March 16 , 1880 . MY DEAR SIR : ? It has several times occurred to me to ask if I might not be of further service to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rhetoric , Sentence-building , English Composition , Punctuation , and the like , with practical exercises in Essay-writing . I believe this forms part of the " Course " in every college : and I have recently seen some shrewd strokes at Harvard for turning out graduates who could not write a passable English letter . All the instruction in my special line , so far , has been quite advanced . Perhaps I should report that I gave the last of my first series of ten readings on Monday night ; and that I had a pleasant meeting with the Science-class yesterday afternoon at four , in Professor Morris 's room . Faithfully yours , SIDNEY LANIER . There are other letters which give his suggestions as to courses of study . These are enough , however , to show the conscientiousness and enthusiasm which characterized his work . He was very successful in inspiring and instructing those who came within sound of his voice . The appearance of Lanier was striking . There was nothing eccentric or odd about him , but his looks , manners , ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if he took his place in a crowded horse-car , an exhilarating atmosphere seemed to be introduced by his breezy ways . He was not far from five feet ten inches in height , slight in figure , with jet black hair , pallid complexion , bright restless eyes and a long flowing beard which gracefully fell upon his breast . His motions were alert and nervous , his speech gentle and refined , his dress careful and his gloves of the nicest fit , but there was nothing finical in all this , not even the suspicion of Bohemia , and in the days of his greatest need , he was always a gentleman in appearance and dress . This is an inadequate description for it does not portray that rare combination of gentleness and intellectual brightness or that sunshiny and sympathetic smile which illuminated his face . I have listened to many comments upon his bust , as it stands in the Johns Hopkins University Hall . One said , " He looks like Moses ; " another , " He looks like Christ .

Father Tabb ? who referred to the day when they , two confederate soldiers , ( the Huguenot and the Catholic ) were confined in the union prison , and with tears in his eyes said , his love for Lanier was like that of David for Jonathan . Sweetest of all the testimonials came at the very last moment , unsolicited and unexpected , from that charming poetess , Edith Thomas . She heard of the memorial assembly and on the spur of the moment wrote her well-known lines , suggested by one of Lanier 's own verses .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
