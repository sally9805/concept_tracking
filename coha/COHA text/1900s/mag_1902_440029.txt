May 10 , 1900 . The Lady Mary is the most aggravating , perplexing , distracting paradox that ever drew a breath of spring ; she keeps a man 's heart on the high tension . The game of fire-soap is a mild parable . She sits under the beech tree in her garden , her bands crossed demurely ( they are whiter than the muslin they rest upon , and that is as spotless as cleanliness ) ; modestly her long black Inches sweep her cheek : she looks for all the world like one of the tranquil violets at her feet . She is a creature to guard , to cherish , to protect . In this mood one approaches her . The lashes lift , and there are flashing eyes which know no yielding ; and the hand that grants a welcome has the air of wielding an invisible sceptre . A creature to cherish , to protect , to guard ! 0 all ye heavenly powers , it is as much as any man can do to hold his own ! I love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her since she was five and I was six , and we played together in this very garden . I have loved her since we tvatiked the planting of the avenue of stripling oaks which enlarges the garden on the north side , ? by her respected father , now in glory . Did We not play at housekeeping down in the dell that runs along the south end ? Did we not hide where the winding brook babbles , where tho wild flowers grow ? Did we not spread nuptial feasts of violets and cowslips , of primroses and buttercups , and pledge each other in sparkling water drunk from emerald goblets made of folded leaves ? Does she love me ? It would puzzle the combined lawyers of the United Kingdom to discover . All the mind readers , the sages , and the witches together would be shaken by the task of divining . Even that nocturnal friend of the good King Saul , who seemed to know what was what in the world , and who was who , would have given up the comet drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart is glad as this sun-bright spring day , for Mary smiles , ? turn. : to use with that ineffable sweetness which can mean naught but love . I am caught up into a heaven of delight . And then she says some scornful wont . or laughs that rippling laughter , which is charming as a bit of nature , imi net encouraging to a lover 's heart . ' the few favors she grants me are question . able , open to doubt , debatable points . Take her garden , for example ,  --  her dear , fragrant , incomparable garden . ? to me the most delicious place the world . Is it a hopeful sign or is it a hopeless one that she says to me , with sweet graciousness , " Jack , do n't mile to afternoon tea in the house , when every one is bothering around come see me in the garden , in the morning . 1 am always there from ten to twelve " ? Now I know perfectly well that a crowd of fashionables conies down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary has been resplendent in French gowns and Lundell airs . Is it because she feels inc worthy of better things that she pays me the compliment of receiving me in nature 's own vast corridors , beneath the royal vault of heaven ; or is it because she thinks me just a country recluse , and out of place in drawing-rooms ? Is it because she loves her garden better than any place in all the world , and knows how well I love it , too , and repletebers one of the mathematical axioms we learned together over there in the schoolhouse ; or is it that she catalogue ' me with pinafores and lollipops , and I fit into remembrance , and give the gar- // den a sense of home ? For my lady has very homey side , with all her frills . Well , anyway , I like the garden best ? hut 1 wish I knew . Jinn 1 . G. She really was more beautiful to-day than I have ever seen her ; it is enough to torn a malt 's brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to sae good - morning t this seems but proper : aid neighborly , for the few mouths she is down here , as our families have been friends since childhood . This morning I was late . I became SO interested in mw work I lost count of time , and it was nearly twelve when I reached the garden ; but I felt that would make small difference to my lady , as she seemed to Le especially oblivious of my presence yesterday . Mary always comes into the garden hi the small upper gate that opens from the lawn ; but I of course enter by the lower one , nearer to the carriage drive ; to if she is there before me , and has taken her favorite seat on the green knoll under the beech tree , I can see her lieforc I reach her , as is picture through a vista , ? the long yew walk . This morning she was seated when I Male . The hawthorn ' ledge is out , and made a background for her . It was not fairer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the walk and looked at her . She sat there like a queen upon her throne . She was all in white . Around her bloomed the flowers of spring in riotous abandonment of splendor , ? lilacs and columbines and larkspur and daffodils , the first wild roses and the tall May lilies . Crimson and purple , yellow and blue , scarlet and violet , ? every color seemed to have burst into blossom , to fling its homage at her feet . She did not raise her eyes , though I know she knew I was there . The garden was unusually still . ' Flle birds , even , for a wonder , were silent ; only the plash of the fountain . Surely she must have heard my footsteps , but she did not look up until I stood beside her and said , " Good-morning . " Then she lifted her long lashes ; her eyes flashed dark under her plumed garden hat . " Good-evening , " she responded . " I was just about going in ; it is time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " I retorted . I sass- she did not want to ask me what , but curiosity got the better of lice . " Oh , " I answered , looking at lay watch , " I understand what makes you such a raving beauty . They say the beauty sleep is that which one takes before midnight , and of course if one takes twelve hours and a half " " Do n't lie a goose , Jack , " she interrupted petulantly . " I might lie something worse , " 1 argued . " Do n't you know it was a goose that saved Rome % " " Not at all , " she replied . ( You ca n't catch Mary . ) " Geese saved Rome . Things change their relative value and potentiality when they are collective : that is the reason why I do n't mind geese in society . I see them en . innsse , and perhaps they have a mission , ? like saving Rome , for example ; but if I tun reduced to a tilte-b-tote with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie wisdom itself , or he could not save anything . You know as well as I do that one goose could never have saved Rome . " ' Whereupon , because I am a coward and have n't the courage of my convictions , ? which are that Mary ought not to be humored at every tack and turn , ? I began to talk with her in the most pedantic way about my work of the morning . I told her how intensely interested I was in a passage I had discove ? ed in Herodotus which seemed to confirm my dearly held theory about the Greeks . " Dear me , Jack , how dull you are ! " she exclaimed , after I had talked awhile . She stifled a yawn , rose , and stretched out her beautiful arms . To the sun she stretched them , be it understood , not to me ! Oh , not to me , alas ! There is certainly no pleasing Mary . 620 In 111y Lady 's Garden . May 24 . To-day I was a fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach Mary a lesson . Surely she deserves it . Now I notice that she is always more apt to listen when I appeal to some remembrance of childhood ; so 1 thought up what I felt was a very clever scheme to tell her is plain truth in a taking way , ? a way that would recall the days when we used to sit over there on the old stone seat by the hollyhocks , toy brown curls touching her golden ones ( oh , why are n't we five now : ' ) , my arm around her waist ( oh , why did we ever grow op ? ) , poring over nursery rhymes and nursery lays . Yesterday afternoon I ran into town ; sod made a tour of the toyshops . I bought some little silver bells and some shells that looked like my idea of cockleshells , ? though for the life of me I do n't know what cockleshells are , and neither did the benighted toyman . Then I gathered a big handful of marigolds , and went over early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary 's seat is , a little to one side , I stuck them into the grass , ? the silver bells , the cockleshells , and the " marigolds all in a row . " Then I sat down and waited . By and by she came tripping over the lawn , her garden basket on her arm . I could see her through the iron gate . lIer step is as light as the spring , and it seems to use that , like the spring , it must leave flowers wherever she treads . I know the loots say this of their ladyloves , and with them it is utter nonsense ; but with Mary it is different ; there is a consciousness that it really will happen , ? a practical fact in horticulture . I was at the gate to open it for her , and my lady was all graciousness . " Good-morning . Is n't it a glorious day ? " She threw back her head as though she would breathe in the universe . " Oh , Jack , I am so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not arranged my little scenic effect on the knoll . Mother Goose brought into quick juxtaposition with Robert Browning was rather a grotesque dramatic absurdity . However , the die was cast ; 1 nest the issue . She stood still a moment . like a bird poised for flight ; thee , " Let ' s go down to the fountain , " she said . I drew a breath of relief ; she had postponed the evil ( lay . We alwai s loved the fountain , she and 1 . Ilaw we used to lean over the stone elude and dabble our hands in the clear water , to the peril of our pinafores : what unspeakable fascination the old Triton with his horn used to have for our childish imagination ! By a sudden impulse , ? perhaps O was the day , for who dares say that turn is less intoxicating than wain ? ? we both leaned forward and splashed our hands in the cool , clear water . looked at the white , blue-veined hand near mine ; it took all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is this fortunate difference Is ' tween being drunk with wine and being drunk with May elixir : the latter makes you strong to resist as well as strong to desire . " Your hand is n't so brown as used to be , Mary . " " Nor yours so little , " she said looking at mine . " Would you like to go back to llow. days , Mary ? " " Oh , I do n't know ; that depends , Would you ? " " That depends , " I reiterated . " On what ? " she asked . " On you , " I said . She knew perfectly well what I meant . She has always known that I love her , and she knows also , perfectly well , that I will not make any claim of her nor ask her any question until she has shown me that it will not trouble her . M/-reverence is too great to bring to her the grief of saying " No . " My reverence , ? and is it perhaps my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the court ? 1 , , , y queen than to be a banished exile . But site knows . I have no fear that she does not know . I have told her by every way love can be told except by direct question and appeal . ? ? Yes , it depends on you , " I said again . On me ? Oh , see that darling yellow butterfly ! " she cried . " He looks like a piece of sunshine broken off . " She drew out her hands , dashed off the crystal drops , and started to chase the butterfly , ? even the butterflies can not escape Mary . Ina few minutes she had it under her garden lest ,  - -  a great white straw flat , with long , white plumes . Poor butterfly , " I said . " What are you going to is now ? " " Why , let it goof course . You do n't think I would keep it , do you You cruel thing ! " " Then why did you catch it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she answered . " That is the way you do , is it ? " I ventured , significance in my tone . " Yes , that is the way I do , ? always , " she answered , inconsequence in hers . The unavoidable time drew near . We turned toward the knoll . I thought of my coup d'etat ; all of a sudden it seemed such a stupid thing to have done , so supremely silly . Mary was busy readjusting her hat , and did not see it . She had been seated a few moments , when she turned her head to watch the Hight of a bird . I saw her eyes suddenly caught ; I saw them open wide . I saw laughter brim from their depths and ripple around the corners of her desirable mouth ; for she had marked the silver bells , the cockleshells , and the " marigolds all in a row . " But by the time she had turned her head back to me she had banished every trace of laughter . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pout and a stamp of her foot upon the soft earth . " Not what ? " I inquired . " I am not contasiry . ' " " Oh , then you understood ? " 1 asked . " I am not a dome " ' stamping her foot a second time , and pouting even more adorably . You are not contrary , and you are not a dunce , " I said . " Two negatives make an affirmative ; so what are you ? " She deigned me no answer , but jumped up and ran quickly down to the flower beds . I was about to follow her , when she returned with a bit of flaming snapdragon in her hands . She held it out and made a low curtsy ; her white muslin swept the green grass like an angel 's wing . " That is what you are , " she said , and turned and went into the house . 011 , miserere ! mise ? ere ! What a change there was in the day ! blow ugly and empty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trod my foolish plimsantry into the ground . How amusing and funny it had seemed in the morning ! How stupid and foolish and idiotic it seems now ! Later . Just before getting into bed . I wonder if I ought to have followed Mary to the house 1 When she was halfway up the lawn , she turned and looked back ; she did n't know I saw her . I wish now I lad ; but I hate presuming on old friendships . May 25 . One can never tell about Mary . I went over in fear and trembling to-day , and my lady was graciousness embodied . I had no sooner taken my seat than she said peremptorily , " Stay there . " She ran clown to the carnation bed and picked a white May pink . which site brought to me . Now she knows very well that of all flowers I love the carnation ; it is so firm and strong and delicate , and yet has such It spicy fragrance . She held it out and said : " Take that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will give you this pure , white , fragrant Hower instead , " and she put her hand ruthlessly upon the snapdragon . Then a spirit of contrariness possessed me . No , indeed , " I said . " Thank you for the guerdon of the white Hower , I kiss the hand that grants it , ? but leave me sty snapdragon ; it is well for me to ponder my lessons and keep the parable before me . Perhaps I am snappy and dragonish. 1 hope I am above taking suggestions with a pout . " I was frightened at my temerity ; but she was not displeased , for a wonder . " Ant I contrary , Jack ? " Her eyes were tender , her lips appealing . " Am .1 " Not now- , " I assured her . " Well , I fear I am sometimes ; it is a great fault of mine . Help me to overcome it , wo n't you , my friend ? " She held out her hand ; and then and there I should have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of my heart , which had spread for a daring flight , by saying hurriedly : " I can not stay ; I only ran out for a second . Good-by . Sonic men are coming down to luncheon , " she called back over her slioulder . Melt coming to luncheon ! Why did she not ask me ? She ought to ; am her neighbor . It is quite evident she does not care at all . I am well enough for the garden : Ind the old-time memory , but the line is drawn there . Later . 1 have just thought it may possibly be because , the last time I lunehed there with sonic London men , I told her I did n't see how she could stand such driveling twaddle as they talked . She was very angry . May 30 . There is nothing to record to-day . I had been to the village , and canto in through the west gate , walking up by the lavender walk . I thought it would have its own pleasure to surprise Mary from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to the open space where the sundial is , I waited before going through the lilacs . I let myself wonder if there might be a divine possibility that Mary would he looking expectantly clown the yew walk , but in a moment I was shocked out any hope that was prescient within mei I heard Mary 's treble laugh in duct with a man 's heavier one . A man ? here ! In the morning ! In our garden ! lie /MIA /MVO come down from London on the early train ; for I knew there arc guests staying in the house , and the el , - toe of Tho ? nycroft could never laugh so freely and blithely , on his small stipend , with five buxom lasses and four stalwart boys to provide for . I should have come home at once , ? the garden lied less of interest for me ; but I could not spy upon leer doings and remain unam nounced , so I stepped out from the lilac bushes . Mary seemed startled for a moment ; perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; me into the circle , and sparkled away like a bit of sunshine . The Man had come down from London , and he Will not bad-looking . No , lie was not bad-looking , but I did n't fancy hint ; lie was an obsequious , unnecessary exores. sense in the garden . When Mary presented him , he looked at me with frank curiosity . " Sir John Elwynne of Elwynne ? " he said . " Pleased to meet you , Sir John . Why do we never see you at the clubs in town ? " I presume a limn who has a town house which is usually vacant semis a crank to hint . " I prefer Thornyeroft , " I answered stupidly . I knew perfectly well that this was an unmannerly answer , dull . altogether banal , which was the more irritating because I had a curious sense that Mary expected me to lie brilliant . She threw back her head and laughed . " Oh , Sir John is buried in his musty , dusty , fusty books all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just fancy ! " said the man , looking at Mary with a frank air of freemasonry . It struck time with a pang chat they have a bond in common of which know nothing . ? ' Why leave London such a day as this " said dryly . " Pall Mall ! oust inspiring to-day . " This was nasty ; Iolt if a man has predilections , I do like him to live up to them . - All , when the best of London collies to Thornyeroft it is a different clatter , " he said , waving his hand toward Mary . Pardon me , " I remarked , " but I pot it the other way : Thornycroft keeps its ? Avn best when the Lady Mary does not go to London . " Well , upon my word , you know , " he answered good-naturedly , " I could not fancy her down here ; but the more I look at her , " and he focused Mary with his eyes , which irritated me beyond expression , " the more I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of those marquises in a Watteau picture . " " A Watteau picture ? " cried Mary . " Merci , monsieur ! Why not say a Dolly Varden on a field of chintz ? " She raised lice arch eyes to ' nine , and for a moment I knew that Ice had a bond in common . I stayed only a few minutes , notwithstanding Mary 's " Do n't go . " TWO : ire company ; three a hopeless crowd . As the man from London did n't scent to grasp that fact , I was obliged to . No , there is nothing new to record . I feel strangely alone in the universe to-night , ? as though I were on some frozen planet , where no human life abides . This is quite imbecile , for England alone has twenty-seven million inhabitants ; and even if the Lady Mary May 31 . If I were iron , I should soon become steel . Mary employs a process of plunging me from hot to cold , and from cold to loot . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , omnipresent , in my room , in my dressing room , even in any bath . I certainly could not defy him to his face and go over to-day to the garden , so I ordered Restless for a long ride . Just as 1 was starting off , by good luck , Mary 's messenger caught me , with this note . 1 have so few letters from Mary , in spite of our long friendship , I will copy it here , in case she should ever bid 1110 destroy the original . You never ran tell what Mary will do . Here it is : DEAR JAcio , ? Jabs is an idiot . If he had n't so many qualities besides that were n't idiotic , I should ask mamma to dismiss him . I was so angry at his stupidity yesterday . The , idea of his sending that man down into the garden !

No one is to lie sent into the garden save only the persons I invite . Come to-day . MARY . Of course I went . " Well , " I greeted her , " women puzzle one . I thought that MOWS visit was of all things your heart 's desire , yesterday ; I aura sure you acted so . No one would have imagined for a moment that he was not a dear and much - desired friend . " " Why , Jack , I had to be polite , " she said , opening her eyes demurely . " Do n't you approve of manners ? " " I lived face to face , through all the years of my university course , with the maxim , ' Manners maketh man , ' " I answered her . " And it has been borne in upon me since that they do not spoil women , " I added , under my breath . " I know what you are thinking , Jack . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked into any face . ( She is perfectly irresistible in that position . ) " You are thinking that my manners might be better to you sometimes . " My thought had not shaped itself , but it was along those lines : she shaped it for me . I did n't tell her this , how- ever ; 1 said instead : " Manners have no need to ! flake the Lady Mary . The Lady Mary makes manners . " klIOW I am not as nice to you as I an : to other men , " site reflected , a little ruefully ; " but then , with you it is different , you know . " flow is it different , I wonder ? Why is it different ? When Carlyle talks of man 's wrestle with the Everlasting Why , he is thinking along other lines , I presume , but God knows there is no greater wrestle in the universe than the wrestle with the feminine Why . line 1 . 1 went over to-day armed with a message to my lady 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Herrick and a great fragrant rose . I handed her the rose . " What a gorgeous creature ! " she said . " My poor garden can not vie with the splendid gardens of Elwynne Court . " " What folly ! " I replied . " You know there is nothing lovelier on earth than this tangle of fragrance and beauty , nature 's own expression , which man hiss not impudently meddled with ; situ-ply guided and curbed by a loving hand . The stiff gardens of Elwynne are detestable to me , with their topiary horrors and their ugly formal beds . It is nothing but respect for my ancestors that prevents icy leveling them to the ground . A garden that is stiff is a monstrosity , like an affected woman . " " What heresy ! Level the gardens of Elwynne Court ! Jack , you are a vandal . Think of your famous hedge , planted by Charles the Second ! " " I do n't like to think of it , " I argued . " I believe it was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why it should belong to me , to remind me of him , I do n't know . " " Do n't you like Charles the Second ? " She opened her great eyes with as much surprise as though I had claimed disapprobation of the Magna Charta . " Do you ? " I asked , to hear what she would say . " Why , certainly , " she replied , with her most earnest air ; " he wore saeh good clothes . The clothes a man w. ; , , , , show what he is ! " She was too well bred to glance at mine , but I know 1 stand a poor showing beside those London swells who coin , down to luncheon . I dress well eiliih , and my clothes fit well enough , S , the most part , but I do not give much thought to them ; life seems too fall 4 more important matters . 1 should ! hoe been in despair if I had not a good usu. ory ; but 1 recalled just then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter in London : " Just think , Jack , mamma wants me to marry Lord Exeter . I might as well marry Redfern . I should live in precisely the same atmosphere . Even as far as my quarterings are concerned , I should not lose , " she had : Wed , laughing ; " for if I married Redfern , I could have the royal arms on doorplate . " But if she does n't cure , why does she bother to take her time with these dandies , these fops ? All the while I had been thinking these tlioughts she had been burying her face in the rose and breathing its very heart out . She looked up . " What is that ? " pointing to my book . I told her it was Herrick , and that there was a verse in it that went with the rose . " Herrick is a fraud , " she announced emphatically . " A fraud ? " I reiterated . " Yes , " site went on , " a perfect fraud . He passed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be was one , and he did n't know one thing about love . " This was startling . I asked her why . " Oh , how can a man know anything about love , when he writes a poem lo Julia to-day , to Cloris yesterday , and to Clorinda to-morrow ? " She tossed her head scornfully . I suddenly remembered , as by thought transference , that I haul bad a most ? // age ? able afternoon with the Lady Alice i , ongworth yesterday , and had passed ) 1,11y at the entrance gate just as I was ruling out . I opened my Herrick and I closed the book ; I only wanted to give her the first verse . I read it in a way she could not mistake . Did you hear the message ? " I asked , leaning toward her , my eyes on hem She sat perfectly motionless ; so did 1 . it has been borne in upon me , as sit here alone to-night , that I ought to have besieged her then and there , taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I had sent the courier rose . I know the old tradition that wellies like to be conquered , that you must take them by storm ; but it has always seemed to me grossly irreverent to look upon woman as though she were a fortress , and man a conqueror . Why not stand like a guest at the door , and wait for her to open ? If tier maiden modesty precludes her coming forth to bid you enter , at least should a true knight , chivalrous and reverent , wait at the door until she comes with welcome on her lips . So it has always seemed to me ; hut , as I say , it is borne in upon me tonight , as I sit here all alone , that perhaps a woman waits for something more ; perhaps something of the old traditional idea of mastery , which the chivalrous limn tries to get away from , lingers with her as the thing desirable . Why does this thought come to me now ? Why did it come to inc there at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some need , some demand upon me in Mary 's heart ? Never was I so tempted to contradict my own principles , to woo her , and woo her with masterful persistence that would leave no echo of her own heart 's voice . I looked at her , sitting there before me , the sunlight flickering through the beech-tree branches on her bowed head . I felt for one rapturous moment that surrender and sweet yielding were in every line of her beautiful form , on her lips , in Iner eyes ; but ? I did not even take her hand . No ; it surely ; oust be hers to grant , not mine to seize . " Did you hear the message ? " I asked again , after a while , without moving . A sudden anger fell upon her ; why , the Lord only knows . " No , I did n't hear it , " she said . " Head the last verse . No , not the next , but the last .

I should not have taken it so but for one fact . As I read she tore the rose to pieces , petal by petal . It was as though she tore the fibres of my heartstrings , one by one . The leaves of the rose floated around her , is red shower , lying on her immaculate muslin like bright drops of blood . This was 1/10te than I could bear . I had come to bind my love with a rose , and there were left but fallen petals and the blight of anger . I spoke her name , " Mary I " I know not what my voice betrayed ; she hesitated a moment , took a step toward me , then turned and walked away . I did not walk to the gate with her , as is my habit .

I walked back to AvItere she had sat , and gathered the petals one by one , poor relic of my lovely rose . ' Then I looked for the calyx and the little green hip . I searched the grass , I followed the path ; it was not to be found .

No longer alone , for , though she is not here , she is here , my Lady Mary , and will be here , for evermore ; for she is mine now ,  --  she has been mine so long : Since morning ! How could I doubt , when I awoke to-day , if it were best to go to the garden ? It seems impossible for me to recall the state of mind which could harbor a question of the only thing to do .

Not even in this book , where no mortal eye but mine will ever look . can I write what happened then . The sheltered knoll because to us a hens , . kill . We went down swiftly to ties sloth and there , beside the winding , brook , in our childhood 's hidden place , Love took up the harp of Life , and smote on all the chords with might . " Si reek was of small account . After an hour , or an eternity , or a snosnent , ? I do n't know which , ? nary said " Jack , why slid you keep nos waiting ? Why did n't you tell me long ago that you loved me ? " " Why did you keep me waiting , Mary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure , " she said . " Mary , " ? I made her look into my eyes ,  --  " was there anything on earth your were more really sure of than my love for you ? " " Yes , " she answered , very low . " What ? " I asked . " My love for you , " and sire hid her face . " You know that is not the way it ought to be , Jack , " she added , after a pause . No , I told her , it was not the way it ought to be .

' lire Lady Alice Longworth 's existence had passed out of my mind . She explained . " Alice is your intimate friend , " I said . " But you stayed there two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did she tell you whist We talked of ? " I demanded . " No . " " Well , ask her the next time you see her , " I advised . In a few nsoments she spoke again : " Oh , jack , why slid you let us waste so much time ? Why did n ' t you take me and claim me , and brush aside all Illy caprices ? Bend down your ear , and I will tell you a great secret . " I did as she bade me , and she whispered , " Women never want to have their own way ; they always Want to be mastered . " Her sweet breath seemed to reach into my very brain . Her bewitching lips were near ; I proceeded to follow her suggestion . " Jack , " she cried , " stop ! Let nie alone Listen : I want to talk to you . We have n't talked for hours . " " You have told me It secret , and I mu remembering it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another just . as important to remember , if you will only let me go , : slid bend down your other ear . " I released her . It is sweet to lsear secrets from Mary . " Jack , " she whispered again , ? " Jack , women love to lutve their own way ; they , always want to be obeyed , "
