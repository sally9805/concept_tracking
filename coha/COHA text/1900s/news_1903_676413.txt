txt Almost two-thirds of the territory of East St. Louis is under from two to fifteen feet of water . How many lives have been lost is not yet known . Representative Rodenberg says there have been thirty deaths , while other estimates run up as high as 200 . Eleven are Imown to have been drowned ; one negro was shot dead for trying to break the embankment , and let the flood in , and it is reported that seven other negroes were shot fop looting . The damage to property no man has yet attempted to estimate . Not a wheel of industry is turning in East St. Louisa The smokeless chimneys of manufacturiPM plants stand lifeless while the flood whirril at the foundations . The vast railroad yards are outlined by hundreds of half-submerged cars , and hens and there stand locomotives only half visa= ble . Huge grain elevators stand surrounded by a veritable sea . To the south , beyond the railway yard area , are thousands of homes , mainly humr ble cottages owned by laborers and containing their all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the description is repeated , but not on so large a scale . The business portion of the city and the district containing the better residences is still intact , " But for how long ? " is the question to-night . Broadway , running frond Eads Bridge east to the city limits , a wide street , walled with stone fifteen feet high , divides the city in halves . More than ten feet of water is pressing against BroacIr way from the south , and in some planes is sweeping through in streams as thicit as a man 's body . Along the river front to the west a levee of sand bags from two to six feet higIV and two miles long keeps the river out : BRAVE FIGHT ENDS IN DEFEAT . Probably never before in the history of the country has a , more valiant fight been made by brave men , with defeat staring them in the face , to protect lives and property than has been made by the citizens of East St. Louis . When the rising Mississippi began to threaten the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to work to construct sand bag levees at once . The river rose higher , and more men were employed . Citizens of the best classes worked side by side with the laborers . Since Thursday morning 5,000 men , under the leadership of Mayor Cook , without sleep , with little rest , and food snatched at intervals , have toiled unceasingly to strengthen levees and to do everything possible to save the city . Without warning the river suddesty began to rise . The city was made safe along the river front , but suddenly , late at night , a new danger menaced . Word was received that the Illinois Central embankment skirting the river along the southern boundary of the city was threatening to give way . Couriers were sent on horseback and afoot to shout warnings to the inhabitants of the southern half of the city . Carloads of sand bags were rushed to the place . and work was hurriedly begun . Accustomed to warnings of impending danger , the inhabitants did not leave their homes . While as many men , women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandbags between the rails to prevent the menacing waters from mounting over the top , the resistless current broke through the lower part of the wall of- earth and spurted in rivulets in the faces of those who were carrying sandbags up the bank . Bags thrown into the openings by dozens of men were tossed by the waters like feathers . Thomas Middleton , a volunteer in charge of a gang of men who were working at the point where the embankment gave way , gave a description of the break . He said : The break occurred at 11:40 o'clock last right . My gang was hard at work with the others . The water was pouring over the top of the embankment in a sheet , even after all our work . Suddenly , with a roar , a jet of water shot through the embankment almost at my feet . I was carried away , but seized some firm object and pullet : myself out of the water . D. H. Sherwood , a laborer , standing at my side , was swept away , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a section of the embankment out and a stream twenty-five feet wide was rushing through . I saw another section of the embankment go out a few minutes later , and then that portion between the two torrents went down , and the river poured through in all its fury . I believe many men , especially negroes , were drowned . I know that several negroes , worn out , had been permitted to nap , and ' they were lying asleep right in the path of the break . They certainly were drowned . " Middleton escaped by running along the embankment back to the city . The workers fled from their useless task , and the alarm was given by the ringing of bells and blowing of whistles in every part of the city . A few of the workers on , the embankment remained at their posts until the rushing waters made it necessary /or them to swim for their lives . Then they joined their companions in warning the residents of the thickly settled district of their danger . Every locomotive and factory whistle joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemonium , the majority of the aroused inhabitants did not leave their homes . Within an hour the houses stood in water that reached to the roofs of the one-story cottages . It is known that numbers of peepie fled to the Central Hotel , a four-story brick structure , and to the large brick buildings of the Washington and Franklin High Schools . But none of these buildings to-day contained more than 250 persons , and , although the rescue boats round many people in second stories and on house tops , there are rows upon rows of cottages that early this morning did not show a sign of life . There is grave fear that many bodies of dead will be found in the flooded cottages and in this section of the city . It has been almost impossible to learn of authenticated , deaths , but eleven are known to have- been drowned last night . THE DEAD . JOHN KOOLISH and three children ; drowned on north side . UNKNOWN BABY . E. H. SHERWOODLAWRENCE DAY . TWO UNKNOWN WOMEN . ONE UNKNOWN MAN . ONE UNKNOWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish carpenter , and his three children  --  two boys , aged five and seven respectively , and a girl of twelve years  --  were caused by trying to save three kegs of beer . The bodies were recovered to-day and taken to a livery Ste ' his Mrs. ' Coolish was summoned to idea , ' tify them , and her grief was pitiable in the extreme . Representative William A. Rodenberg , ' who has charge of the patrol along Broadway , which cuts the town into east and west and leads to the Eads Bridge , gives it as his opinion that the number will be about thirty . The only drownings coming under his personal observation were those of two women and a man who lost their lives near his post of duty . While general warnings were given by the police and retreating levee workers with shouts and pistols there was not time to call at every house in the thickly settled district , and it is believed many of the families in one-story cottages awoke only when it was too late to escape . Levee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worn out with hard labor , were E caught by the flood and drowned like rats . It may never be learned how many died in this way . A negro was drowned this morning in the waters which are climbing up the side of the embankment supporting Broadway . William Enloe of East St. Louis reports that he saw an unknown woman drown this morning as she stepped from her house into several feet of water . A Mr. Ray of ' Rest St. Louis is among those reported drowned . CASES OF RUDE JUSTICE . A few hours before the break of the levee Ned Roberts . a negro , employed as a levee builder , was killed by members of the Levee Patrol for attempting to tear down a portion of the dike . His act was caused by anger because he was not allowed to draw his pay at once . It was currently reported to-day that seven negroes caught in the act of looting houses last night were shot to death . While this was not confirmed , it is known that there was heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where these negroes are said to have been killed . A large number of arrests have been made 1:oy the police , who are marching the prisoners across the bridge to St. Louis , as there is no place to keep them in the flooded city . The East St. Louis city jail is also being emptied and the prisoners taken to the Four Courts in St. Louis for safety . The naval militia of St. Louis and Alton are on duty rescuing women and children . Lieut . Gray , commanding the St. Louis naval militia , has his force spread out along the embankments guarding against levee cutting and depredations by hordes of hoodlums that may be seen everywhere . Arms are stacked at Police Headquarters , *where reputable citizens may obtain carbines and ammunition to guard their property . An appeal from Mayor Cook to the Governor of Illinois for State troops to aid in guarding the property was answered by the promise that details of militia would be sent to East St. Louis at once . Riot guns were collete4 by Chief of Police Purdy to-day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where furniture is stacked and to patrol the sand-bag levees . Thieves or levee cutters are to be shot down instantly . Martial law has not been proclaimed officially , but East St. Louis is practically governed under such a condition during the flood . Idle or curious persons will not be allowed in the city . Undismayed by the defeat which had come In their seven days ' battle with the flood . the greater part of the levee builders fell back to Broadway . where it was at first decided to resist the water . A half hour 's work and survey of the prospects convinced those in charge that it was useless to try to keep the water from Broadway . and the flood fighters fell back upon Missouri Avenue , whiten runs east from the Relay Station Here . the scenes of the past week were repeated as the street was rapidly transformed into a dike of sangbags and clay . THE PANIC IN THE NIGHT . As the noise of the approaching flood was heard , the flight of the people , at first a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . Messengers were sent to the main portion of the city telling of the danger from the new point of attack , and the greatest excitement prevailed As the bottoms filled , and the river gained a larger entrance , the terror in the business section of the city grew intense . It was all the greater because of the darkness and the fear that while guard was maintained in one direction the torrent would break through at another point and engulf the luckless inhabitants between two ? floods . They began to desert their homes and run vainly up and down the streets , seeking a place of succor . Thousands of families from the best residence portions of the city , carrying trunks , grips , bundles of clothing , and valuables , began to cross Eads 's Bridge toward St Louis . Most of the refugees were scantily clad . Strong men carried aged women in their arms , followed by women with babies . Barefooted children were in the procession , which continued steadily over the bridge . Hundreds of others sought protection In the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroached about it many dashed through the shallow overflow to find a more secure refuge . In terror of the rising tide of water refugees in hundreds thronged the streets , crowded the cars , and besought public officials for aid . In the City Hall alone 500 homeless persons . with such scant belong:aings as they had been able to seize on - short notice , were assembled . Provisions were supplied them , and they were made - as comfortable as possible in the auditorium on the third floor . The streets were filled with panic-stricken inhabitants of the invaded districts . Women with children in arms , men carrying household furniture , horses , dogs , and other remains of once comfortable domestic establishments , paraded the streets . The common direction or all movement was toward the bridge , over which the refugees are hurrying to St. Louis . As fast as scows could be secured they were launched , and volunteers ? started on rescue missions . A company of Naval Reserves from Alton , which had rowed to the city yesterday in a cutter , rendered splen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as it was light enough to Age . and continued their work far into the i-aght . Word was sent out generally for amore boats , and the Government responded through United States District Attorney Dyer in St. Louis , who issued an order to confiscate temporarily all boats seen in arid around St. Louis . regardless of ownerShip , and rush them to East St. Louis . The St Louis Fire Department at once ten:dered its hose and coal wagons , and the : heats were brought to the desolated ' city . - Volunteer oarsmen promptly manned every : boat furnished , and soon scores of craft ? were rescuing flood sufferers . The first boatloads contained refugees and some furniture . ' The order was issued peremptorily , If any more furniture is brought it will be thrown into the water . If a man thinks - more of his furniture than he does of his ineighbors , he must lose the furniture . " a  --  After that no furniture was transported .

When boats were rowed alongside homes where the occupants were marooned in sec-ond stories and on roofs , . In the great majority of eases the occupants could not be induced to leave . They said to leaveerneant that their belongings would be left to the mercy of river thieves , and they would remain and stand guard . Strangely , the women were those most unwilling to be rescued , although some of them wept in terror . They were assured that a thorough boat patrol would be established , with orders to kill river thieves on sight , and finally the unwilling householders were persuaded to go to land . As wives entered boats that were too full to carry husbands or children and were sent ahead , they wept and clasped each other in abject fear that some further calamity might separate them forever . At the landings weeping women were assisted from the boats , and throughout the day scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The news of the inundation excited the people of St. Louis , and thousands of sightseers attempted to cross Eads Bridge . But the authorities prepared to turn back an influx of curious people . At both ends of the bridge ropes were stretched , and police were stationed with orders to allow no ingress into the city of spectators , who would only hinder the work of rescue . East St. Louis was practically shut off from the world . Even refugees who wanted to go to St. Louis were stopped , and unless they could show that they were sure of being taken care of by friends they were turned back to the relief offered by the city . Persons with cameras were dealt with unceremoniously . As night drew on another fear confronted the inhabitants . The water that had steadily been pouring through the Broadway embankment was believed to be undermining that bulwark , and it was declared that the street could not stand the heavy pressure from the south side long . The belief that the river was rising was confirmed by the St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise of .15 of a foot in twenty-four hours . No attempt is made to explain this rise except that the wind is forcing water from lowlands into the channels of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers , and swelling the torrent which passes St. Louis . Denverside. a suburb of East St. Louis , was completely inundated . and Alta Site , further to the east , was half flooded last night . If the river should rise even a little more the water must swamp Alta SitsIn the eastern extremity of the city at Washington Place and Rock Road , on a vacant area on high ground 200 tents were utilized in erecting Camp Refuge , and a commissary was established . From the Broadway landing to Camp Refuge the flood sufferers were transported in wagons . Each family was given a tent . The City Hall . churches , school buildings , and other structures were thrown open and temporarily turned into relief stations . Attorney T. E. Dempcy , who has charge of Camp Refuge , said to-night : " We must have food . East St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , she had has been largely drawn upon during the past week . Large amounts of food were destroyed by the water last night . and we are in need of additional food to care for the suffering people . The viaduct is unsafe and wagons can not cross to St. Louis . Railroad traffic is cut off and the situation confronting us is growing grave . Food must be secured in some manner , or people already in distress will suffer more . " Representative Rodenberg has issued an appeal for aid for the flood sufferers . Food . he says , is needed most , and means must he had for delivering it to persons who are in tipper stories of their homes or in box cars .
