 | I know of no expenditure of time and work which yields such a return in pleasure as entertaining a party of children . " It blesses him that gives and him that takes , " except in cases where the latter is in danger of being killed by excess of culinary kindness . I have observed , too , that children are just as contented , and far happier as to their insides , if quantity and quality instead of bewildering variety , be kept in mind in providing the table . It is most important that the dishes served be those easily assimilated and easily digested together . An unwise selection of things , each good by itself alone , has sent many a little tot home to have a " pain under his apron " or rather under his nightie ( as I believe all children take darkness and the " wee sma ' hours " to enjoy this common affliction at its best ) . I feel it is such a pity to give rich and conflicting food to children ! Among the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be selected are the following : any form of bouillon or cream soup in cups ; nourishing sandwiches or tiny buttered rolls , with cold meats sliced thin-tongue ( not canned ) and turkey or chicken . As a rule , children prefer the last to all meats , so either creamed or cold it always disappears in astonishing quantities , and when creamed , peas are good with it . Novel and ornamental- small cakes , cookies or kisses ; custards , junkets or a simple homemade ice cream ; and pure candy-the ribbon candies which look so much and amount to so little . For drinks , chocolate is particularly attractive to young people , with its white cap of whipped cream ; lemonade ( sometimes ) , and plenty of water . Ice cream may be molded in forms and enjoyed with the eyes , but is too often so hard that it is no pleasure to eat it , and I think it better to have softer cream served in small fancy cases . Fresh or canned pine- apple is a wholesome accompaniment , as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , do your best , and once in a while one comes across a freaky child who is not satisfied with anything on the table . I well remember our efforts to warm and fill one bashful guest-scarcely more than a babywho after refusing everything , timidly raised his serious brown eyes and asked if we had any cold potatoes in the house ! I give a recipe for a nutritious broth which makes a good beginning for little and big : Three pounds of beef cut from the shin ; three pounds of bone from same , cracked ; four quarts of water , and four teaspoons of salt . Trim off the dried skin and other unusable parts of the meat , cut the remainder into small pieces , place with the other ingredients in a covered earthen jar and let stand one hour before setting in a slow oven to cook from eight to twelve hours . Put through a coarse strainer and when cold remove fat . In serving , add more seasoning if you wish , and never heat above one hundred and seventy-five degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plate of little turtle cakes never fails to call forth squeals of delight . Bake a plain cake mixture in tiny pans in a hot oven ; frost and put a fat raisin in the center of each before the frosting hardens ; pinch the buds out of four small cloves and arrange for feet ; use one , containing the bud , for a head ; and the pointed stem of another for a tail . Plain cookies , cut in shapes of oak or maple leaves and frosted with the green frosting given for watermelon cake ( in Goon HousExEErt:vc for March , i9ot ) are both delicious and wholesome ; and cookies sugared and bearing the initials of the guests in white frosting ; or frosted first and the letters put on with an icing colored with chocolate , are far more tempting than cookies that are less individual . For a birthday , the crowning glory of the table is the cake , resplendent with candles . The candles are lighted and allowed to burn during the eating of the refreshments , each child blowing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is passed round last of all . ' Mothers are few who can refuse this pleasure , but one who had an abnormal fear of fire compromised by allowing a single huge wax candle to burn in the center of the cake , using as a safe holder the cylindrical opening left by the tube pan in the baking . The cake should he of good size and plain in every way save looks . The good old fashion of inserting in the dough when in the pan a silver thimble , a ring , a new ten cent piece and a bean , never loses its charm . When the cake is cut there is always excitement till the one who is to be first married gets the ring ( and I have known young women of four years to be intensely interested in this superstition ) ; whoever gets the bean will be a ruler , nothing less than president , probably ; the thimble denotes an ideal housewife , in embryo ; and she who gets the silver piece will have riches all her days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute , somebody found a clove in the cake , and so proclaimed himself a knave-to-be . Do not use confectioner 's sugar to frost the cake , but white of egg and pulverized sugar or a boiled icing . Sprinkle with grated cocoanut and ornament the top with a border of tiny chocolate drops or candied cherries , or with crystallized fruit cut into bits , or with candied caraway seeds . Dainty candle holders in all colors are for sale at confectioners ' , but a pretty substitute can be made of a fringe of tissue paper wound tightly around each candle  | before setting into the frosting ; spread out the fringe to catch any wax . At the last party at which 1 officiated , the candles were so numerous that we cut a ring of pasteboard-its inside diameter being just that of the cake at the base-covered it with green tissue paper and ornamented it with laurel leaves . On this frame yellow candles were fixed . The table was trimmed with sprays and branches of laurel , with tangerine oranges invisibly tied to them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective showing and precious souvenirs to carry home . If candles are not to be used , a cake which is a favorite with owners of a sweet tooth is one made of an angel cake mixture , baked in two parts and put together with a layer of marshmallows which have been soaked a short time in milk strongly flavored with sherry . The top is to be covered with the same and garnished profusely with whipped cream-also flavored with sherry-and put on with a star pastry tube . The cake and the cream need very little sugar . The making of popcorn balls always pleases little people , the greater part of the corn being popped beforehand , of course ; and a wonderball party , while a more serious undertaking , is sure to make a hit . Bits of presents are bought or made-charms , money , doll 's gear and what-not-and one used as the center of a ball of worsted , which as it is wound , con  | ceals the little gifts wrapped in soft paper and put in from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the yarn is used the little surprises fall out . It is certainly a great incentive to industry to have something nice drop into your lap while you work ; but it needs a very patient mother and assistants to look out for dropped stitches . For girls of a little older growth , the idea of an entertainment designated in the invitation sent my small niece of twelve as " a blissful tea , " deserves to be passed along . After greeting her hostess , each guest is given a menu card , with pencil attached , upon which are numbers , from one to ten or more , with a blank space after each ; and across the top the line , " Where ignorance is bliss , " in gold lettering . A colored reproduction of some dainty dish , cut from advertisements , is pasted neatly on each card , the things in the bill of fare being suggested so far as possible . ( These cards were manufactured by the little girl who gave the party , and that is where part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on the card , puts a check mark against the numbers she selects and the orders are duly served by friends in caps and aprons , who fill them from another room after consulting- a similar card which has the list completed and tacked up over the serving table ; for example : 1 . Glass of child 's punch . 2 . Chicken croquette . 3 . College ice . 4 . Cup of chocolate . $ . Olive . 6 . Box of candy . q . Toothpick. 8 . Rolled sandwiches . g . Glass of water . 10 . Macaroons . The numbers may be increased , or other articles readily substituted for the ones on this list . The first order may be limited to five or six numbers , and a second order to two , to provide for a supposable case when an unfortunate has checked perhaps , one , five , six , seven and nine , and finds that ignorance is neither blissful nor filling . A supply of small tables set in convenient spots is a necessity for a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes one quart of water and one and one-half pounds of sugar ; add grated rind of one lemon and one orange , and when cool , strain . Add juice of two oranges and four lemons . Pour in a pitcher with a lump of ice , add a quarter of a pound each of candied cherries and pineapple cut fine , and a quart of water . Macaroons Crumble together one-half pound of almond paste and the same amount of powdered sugar . Add the whipped whites of three eggs and one-half teaspoon of vanilla . Drop in pans and bake in a slow oven . This amount should make fifty and is no trouble at all . Peanut Cream Three pints of peanuts shelled and put through a chopper adjusted to cut as fine as t possible , two cups of sugar , two-thirds of a cup of milk and a small piece of butter . Stir together till dissolved the sugar , butter and milk ; then cook without disturbing till it spins a thread , or till you can make a soft ball of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fire and while one person stirs , another must pour in the nuts . Beat till thick and creamy , pour into buttered pans and cut in small squares when cold . Wrap in waxed paper and put in pretty boxes holding eight squares . Write in gilt on top of each box , " Bliss 's Best , " or fill the boxes with Fard dates stuffed with chopped peanuts and rolled in sugar . The amusing experiment of a lilliputian naval battle-which is so old that I trust it is newalways entertains a company of boys . Let them model , say , a dozen or more pieces of chalk to resemble ships , making the bottoms even , and using matches ( without tips ) for masts , smokestacks and turrets . Color part of them with black ink and leave the rest white . Put the different colors-the opposing forcesin a row along the sides of a very large platter and draw an imaginary line lengthwise across it . Let each boy choose sides , and then let the lord high admiral ( the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chalk sticks . Instantly there will be an audible seething , like the hissing of shells in actual warfare , while the ships will begin to move forward in slow revolutions , leaving streaks of foam behind . When meeting at the dividing line , they will have attained quite a respectable speed , bumping and hitting in the endeavor to push one another farthest from the line . The engagement often proves an exciting one . Of course the side is victorious which has the greater number of ships in the enemy 's waters after the cruel war is over . But no matter what the other entertainment may be , children anticipate and frankly enjoy the good things to eat . My experience was doubtless not unique at one party , when at the end of a rollicking game , and while preparing for another , I felt a soft hand slip into mine and heard the whisper : " But , auntie , when are we going to have the party ?
