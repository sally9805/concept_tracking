 |p1232  THE remarkable revival of interest in waterways constitutes one of the most striking and significant of recent developments in the United States . Conventions have been held by the score , in every part of the country except the arid regions , to demand the deepening of harbors , the improvement of rivers and the construction of canals . And at the great convention of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress which assembled at Washington in December last ? a convention attended by two thousand delegates coming from thirty-seven States and two Territories ? all the voices which had been raised in behalf of different national policy of waterway improvements . individual projects were blended into one great chorus , demanding the adoption by the Congress of the United States of a broad , comprehensive , progressive , truly The resolutions adopted by this con- . vention call for an annual river and harbor bill , instead of the triennial appropriation which has been the rule in recent years , and an increase in the amount appropriated for the purpose to an average of fifty millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , until the projects which have already been surveyed , examined and approved shall have been completed . This of itself constitutes rather a large program , and other great projects , like that for an inland waterway along the Atlantic Coast , are pressing for recognition . When the nation is asked to adopt a policy which necessarily involves the expenditure of a vast amount of money , it is pertinent to ask  |p1233  what return may be expected therefor . In the terse phrase of everyday business , Will it pay ? " That the experience of the past constitutes the surest and safest guide for the future is a saying as true as it is trite . As the first step , therefore , toward finding an answer to the question , " Will it pay ? " let us ask the further question , " Has it paid ? " It may turn out that the facts which are found in a study of the latter question will furnish an answer not only to that , but to the former one as well . The greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland waterway in the world , is that composed of Lakes Superior , Michigan , Huron and Erie , with their connecting channels , Lake Ontario , for reasons which will appear later , having participated but slightly in the marvelous development which has taken place on the four lakes which lie above Niagara Falls . Up to the close of 1907 there had been expended by the Government of the United States upon the harbors and connecting channels of these lakes $85,000,000 , in round numbers . This is an expenditure worthy of consideration even in this day of large things . What return has been received therefrom ? Has it paid ? And how much ? Proof that it has paid , and paid largely , is abundant , easily found , indisputable , overwhelming . But to ascertain fully and accurately how much it has paid is not so easy . One way of getting at the benefits of waterway improvements is by comparing the relative costs of rail and water transportation . From the records kept at St. Mary 's Falls ? commonly called " The Soo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  |p1234  1907 ( April 22d ? December 15th ) there were carried into and out of Lake Superior 58,217,214 tons of freight . This was carried an average distance of 828.3 miles at a cost of $38,457,345 , which makes the average charge per ton per mile eight-tenths ( 0.8 ) of one mill . Suppose that this tonnage , instead of being shipped by water , had been sent an equal distance by rail , how much more would its transportation have cost ? According to Poor 's Manual the average freight rate received by the railroads of the United States in 1907 was seven and eighty-two one-hundredths ( 7.82 ) mills per ton per mile . 58,217,214 X 828.3 x .00782 = 377,090,709 ; and $377,090,709 ? $38,467,345 = $338 , - 633,364 . That is to say , the direct saving , thru decreased cost of transportation , on the business of one year , amounts to over $338,500,000 , or nearly four times the total governmental expenditure on all the lakes since their improvement was begun . Apparently it has paid ! But the saving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much it has paid . Let us look further . The American canal at " The Soo " past into the control of the National Government in 1881 . From the opening of navigation in that year to its close in 1907 there have been carried into and out of Lake Superior 496.323,813 tons of freight . Calculated by the same method as that used above , the direct saving thereon , due to the lower cost of water transportation , amounts to $2,918,000 , - 000 . But the tale of Lake Superior 's commerce is not yet fully told , for between its opening in 1855 and its transfer to the United States in 1881 there were carried thru the " Soo " canal 12,162,320 tons of freight , making a total , up to the close of 1907 , of 508 , - 486,133 tons . There are no data available from which to calculate the exact saving in the cost of transportation on the tonnage of those earlier years , but it was undoubtedly enough to bring the total up to a round $3,000,000,000 . Thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , it is not possible to ascertain the tonnage of all the lakes with anything like the same accuracy . Most of the port statistics publisht give the net registered tonnage of vessels . Net registered tonnage is purely a matter of measurement , and tells very little as to how much a vessel can carry , and absolutely nothing as to how much it does carry . But it is of interest to note in passing that the registered tonnage of the vessels entered at the ports of the Great Lakes , American and Canadian , which amounted to 115,000,000 tons in 1907 , exceeds the combined entries of the principal ports of Great Britain , Germany , France , Holland , Belgium and all the ocean ports of the United States . Official reports place the domestic shipments from American ports during 1907 at 83,498,171 tons . This is known to be below the truth , for the reason that the law requires no report as to freight carried between ports in the same customs district . When to this we add the freight carried between Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is safe to say that the total amount of freight transported on the lakes in 1907 was at least 100,000,000 tons . It is easy to write down figures , but difficult to comprehend what they mean . If this vast amount of freight were to be carried by rail it would fill 3,333,333 standard 30-ton freight cars , which is nearly a million and a half more than the total number of freight cars in the United States . Allowing a locomotive to every thirty cars , this would make a solid train long enough to reach around the world at the equator , with enough left over to extend from New York to Omaha , and which , moving at an average speed of i6 miles an hour , day and night , without stopping , would take sixty-eight days to pass a given point . While the direct saving on the commerce of all the lakes can not be exactly calculated , the data being incomplete , a very conservative estimate makes the saving for 1907 no less than $550,000,000 , and for the whole period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to satisfy some ultra-conservative mind , $2,500,000,000 would seem to be a fair dividend on an investment of $85,000 , - 000 . Besides , the improvements are still in existence , and , with the further development of commerce , will pay continu/ ally increasing dividends for no one knows how many years to come . For , as Hon. Joseph E. Ransdell , member of Congress from Louisiana and President of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress , said in a recent speech : " Most of the great annual expenditures of our Government are like the rain falling on the parched sands of the desert , only to disappear and leave no trace behind . But waterway improvements are investments which will last forever . " profit from rates which are below the actual cost of railway operation , but they bring about an enormous indirect saving thru the lower rates of railway transportation which the competition of the waterway compels . Before the lock was built at The Cascades , on the Columbia River , the railway rate from Portland on nails and goods of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower cost of transportation , on freight actually carried by water , great as it is , is only the first item of the manifold benefits derived from the improvement of the lakes . Waterways not only carry far more cheaply than railways , deriving a large per ton . On the day the lock was opened , so that steamboats could go thru , the railway rate dropped to $2 per ton . Scores of similar instances could be adduced if they were needed , but we have the testimony of prominent railroad men to prove that the competitive influence of the lakes modifies railway rates over a large part of the continent . Because of the enormous volume of railway traffic  |p1236  thus affected , it follows that the indirect saving , thru the decrease in railway rates produced by the competition of the lake route , is probably as great as the direct saving on the tonnage actually transported by water . Senator Knox , of Pennsylvania , in a recent address at Pittsburg , makes a most interesting and suggestive comparison of the growth of the eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading cities of the Mississippi Basin betwen 1870 and 1900 . In 1870 the combined population of the eight river cities exceeded that of the lake cities by 218,000 ; in 1900 the lake cities exceeded the river cities by 1,334,000 . The increase in the population of the river cities was 824,062 ; that of the lake cities was 2,526,375 . The ratio of growth in the river cities was 89 per cent . ; in the lake cities it was 354 per cent . Since the average per capita contribution of the people of the States in which these cities are located to the revenues of the United States was $8 during the two decades prior to 1900 , " it appears , " said the Senator , " that the gain to national revenue , by reason of the exceptional increase in those eight cities alone , is $13,668,000 . That annual revenue will pay interest and sinking funds to retire in fifty years a bond issue of $389,000 , - 000 , over seven times the cost of the improvements . Putting the whole cost of lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 , and ignoring the fact that a large part of this was for minor ports ? and some of it wasted ? the growth of these cities alone has repaid that cost with interest , and has for years been yielding a clear profit to the Government . " Iron ore constitutes by far the largest single item in the commerce of the lakes , the shipments for last year being 42,243 , - 406 net tons , and the total amount mined and shipped from the Lake Superior region down to the close of 1907 reaching the enormous total of 426,067,135 net tons . The United States holds the undisputed leadership of the world in the manufacture of iron and steel , its production during recent years being greater than that of any other two nations combined , and promising to presently exceed that of all the rest put together . This position of proud pre-eminence in the fundamental industry of modern civilization has been attained primarily because of the quantity and quality of the Lake Superior ores . Let the reader imagine , if he can , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about by the mining , smelting and manufacture of these 426,000,000 tons of ore . Wrought into an endless variety of forms ? ranging from sky-scrapers to road-scrapers , from steel rails to carpet tacks , from the fleet of battleships now carrying our flag around the world to the chain that fastens the watchdog in the back yard ? they have influenced almost every phase of our national life . The difference between present conditions and those which would have resulted if these ores had been out of reach is so vast that it is simply inconceivable . But it is certain that the entire industrial development of the country would have been radically different ; perhaps the very course of history would have been changed . And without the cheap transportation furnished by the lakes these ores could not have been used , for the cost of railway transportation over so great a distance would have been absolutely prohibitive . Improved waterways not only effect a vast saving in the cost of transportation , both directly and indirectly , but also produce a positive and tremendous development of industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inexorable limits of the allotted space forbid , it could be proved beyond dispute that because of the lake route the farmers of the West , both Canadian and American , receive more for every bushel of grain they sell , and consumers in the manufacturing centers of the East and in Europe pay less for every barrel of flour they buy . The change that has taken place in the ships that sail the lakes ? from the wooden schooner carrying Soo tons to the leviathan of steel which carries 15,000 ? and the development of the colossal appliances for the trans-shipment of freight , which enable the ports on the lakes to give quicker despatch than any others on earth , are worthy of an article , but can be  |p1237  given a bare mention . The modern lake fleet , with the docks , terminals and transfer machinery by which it is supplemented , represents an investment of not less than $250,000,000 . Strange as it may seem at first thought , it is none the less true that no other interest has been more largely benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fundamental reason for this paradoxical result is that the essential function of the waterway is the carriage of those commodities in which weight and bulk are large in proportion to value , and which must , therefore , be moved cheaply if moved at all . The development of manufactures which follows an abundant supply of cheap raw materials furnishes to the railway a traffic which demands greater speed of movement , which is of much greater value in proportion to weight , and which , therefore , is able to bear higher charges for its transportation . Out of the 58,000,000 tons of freight carried thru " The Soo " in 1907 , 51,000 , - 000 was made up of iron ore and coal . Nine-tenths of the traffic handled on the lakes consists of raw materials . The value to the nation of the development based upon the raw materials so carried defies both computation and comprehension . It would not be surprising if the reader who has followed the argument thus far should find a question rising in his mind . It has been claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous savings in the cost of transportation , both directly and indirectly ; that it has not only furnished effective competition for the railroads on the one hand , but has increased their traffic and their revenues upon the other ; that it has at one and the same time raised the price of wheat to the farmers of the West and lowered the price of flour to consumers in the East and in Europe ; that it has transformed the lake fleet , promoted the growth of lake cities and increased the revenues of the Government ; and that it has given to the United States the primacy of the world in the manufacture of iron and steel . These are magnificent and far-reaching results , and the reader has a right to ask whether it is claimed that all the credit  |p1237  therefor should be given to the work done by the Government upon the lakes . Nothing of the kind is claimed . The lakes were there to begin with ? placed where they are by the hand of the Creator . But while the shallowest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , or that ever will be , the value of the lakes as a commercial highway is determined not by the greatest depths of their open waters , but by the least depth to be found in their harbors and channels ; and before the work of improvement was started by the Government , navigation was impossible for boats drawing over eight feet ? and was difficult and dangerous for those of that draft . No argument is needed to show that the modern lake fleet , modern facilities for transfer , the present huge volume of lake traffic and the present low cost of lake transportation would all alike have been impossible but for the deepening of lake channels and harbors from eight feet to twenty , which has been done by the Government . Into the developments of fleets and docks , of commerce and industry , of cities and commonwealths , have been put the brain and the brawn , the inventive genius and the executive ability , the capital and the labor of a multitude of men . To each one of these some credit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than the writer can express . But their work has been the building of the superstructure ; the work of the Government was the laying of the foundation without which the superstructure could not have been reared . It is believed that ample proofs have now been submitted to sustain the claim that the expenditures already made upon the lakes have " paid " and to justify the conclusion that further expenditures upon them will " pay . " Evidently the Congress of the United States is of that opinion , for in the River and Harbor Act of 1907 ? the largest one ever passed ? $22,000,000 , nearly one-fourth of the entire amount appropriated , was given to the lakes . But the policy advocated by the National Rivers and Harbors Congress is not limited to the continuation of work on the lakes and on seaboard harbors , but includes the improvement of all the rivers  |p1238  of the country which are navigable , or can reasonably be made navigable , and the ultimate construction of canals which will unite the navigable waters of the United States into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , essential to determine whether the improvement of waterways of this character will make adequate returns for the expenditure involved . Most of the benefits produced by waterways arise from the cheap transportation furnished thereby , and in the matter of cheapness even the lakes must yield the palm to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers . Coal is carried from Buffalo to Duluth-Superior for three-tenths ( 0.3 ) of a mill per ton-mile . But this rate is made in connection with return cargoes of ore or grain , which pay a higher rate , and during the present season vessel owners have tied their boats up rather than carry coal at this rate , returning light . Whenever there is a sufficient stage of water on the rivers mentioned , however , coal is carried from Pittsburg to New Orleans for one-third ( 1/3 ) of a mill per ton-mile , which price includes the return of the empty barges 2,000 miles up stream . Another important advantage of the waterway over the railway is in the volume of freight which can be moved at one time , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the steamer " Sprague " has carried from Cairo to New Orleans a tow of barges containing 57,500 tons of coal ? which is believed to be the greatest cargo ever moved at one time in the history of the world . It may be asked why , if such results can be attained by the rivers in their present condition , the demand for their improvement is so strong . The answer is that these results are attained only when there is a boating stage of water , and boating stages are as uncertain as the winds of heaven . On one occasion , some ten or twelve years ago , the interval from one boating stage on , the Ohio to the next was eleven months . This makes plain the underlying reason for the difference in the relative growth of the lake cities and the river cities mentioned by Senator Knox . The improved lake waterway has a depth which can be depended upon ; on the unimproved rivers Inc only thing certain is ? uncertainty . The approved project for the improvement of the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams , giving slack water navigation over the entire distance from Pittsburg to Cairo , at an estimated cost of $63,713 , - coo in addition to appropriations already made . The project is meant to give a minimum depth of nine feet at low water . As this is only a trifle more than the original depth in the lake channels , and the most of the benefits derived from the lake waterway have been attributed to the increase of available depth from eight to twenty feet , it may be asked why a depth of nine feet in the Ohio River is expected to produce valuable results . The answer is that the conditions are radically different . Vessels which undertake to navigate the Great Lakes must be built practically as strong as ocean craft in order to safely meet the great storms which sometimes sweep over their waters . On the river , wave action is not encountered . On the lakes , as on the ocean , the most economical transportation is effected by single vessels of deep draft . On the quieter waters of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less expense , by lashing together a large number of barges drawing only eight or eight and a half feet . The United States Army engineers estimate that freight can be transported on the Ohio River thus improved at an average rate of one-half ( y2 ) mill per tonmile . This is undoubtedly conservative , for open river navigation would be available as often as it is now , up-stream movement - would be more economical on the slack-watered river , and there would be no interruption of navigation by low water . But this estimate of the army engineers gives an average rate on the improved river which is 38 per cent . below the average rate on the traffic thru the " Soo " Canals in 1907 . There is then no escape from the conclusion that the improvement of the Ohio would result in just such a development of commerce and manufactures , just such a growth of population and prosperity in the valley of the river , as has resulted in the lake region from the improvement of lake channels and harbors . And exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri , the Columbia , and in greater or less degree of every other river in the United States . It is not necessary to assume that such results would follow from an improved river . Germany has several such , of which the Rhine is the most notable example . Germany has literally poured millions of dollars into the improvement of this stream and , as a consequence , the Rhine Valley has been converted into one vast workshop . Mannheim , more than 300 miles from the sea , has a dredged harbor of 55o acres , three miles of docks , and nine miles of improved shore . The equipment includes 129 cranes , 16 grain and 26 coal elevators , 110 storehouses and 17 petroleum tanks . Fifteen million dollars has been spent on this single harbor since 1886 , and similar sums on some twenty other harbors from 100 to 350 miles from the ocean . **25;249;TOOLONG , 100 miles up the Rhine , is one of the great harbors of the world , its tonnage having increased from 2,900,000 tons in 1875 to 13,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch-German frontier , amounted to 21,000,000 tons in 1905 . Does any one doubt that similar results would follow the improvement of American rivers ? Or believe that the river cities of the United States , Pittsburg , for instance , would fail to provide a harbor equipment adequate to handle all the commerce an improved river would create ? This great work of waterway improvement must be done by the National Government , because the nation claims exclusive jurisdiction and exercises supreme control over navigable waterways . But with power goes responsibility . If the river cities have grown more slowly than the lake cities , it is because Congress has improved the lakes and left the rivers unimproved . If the commerce of Lake Ontario has failed to keep pace with that of the other lakes , it is because Congress has failed to furnish it as good a connecting channel as has been given them . If the United States can not cope with Germany in the great battle for world commerce , it is because the Reichstag has developed German rivers and canals and our Congress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbors Congress demands that the policy of inaction be abandoned and a vigorous policy of progress be adopted ; that appropriations for waterways be placed on the same footing as other appropriations and shall be made annually ; that the amount shall be adequate to complete the needed works as rapidly as is consistent with thoro work ; that , if necessary , funds shall be provided by a bond issue similar to that authorized for the Panama Canal ; and that all needed Governmental , agencies shall be provided to carry out the great policy thus briefly outlined . Will it pay ? Would its adoption be wise ? Nay , rather , in the light of the facts which have been presented , failure to adopt it would be stupendous , immeasurable folly .
