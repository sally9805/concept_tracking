txt THINKS BROOKLYN SLIGHTED . Not Given the Full Number of Floats for Parade . I want to register a most emphatic protest against the way Brooklyn was treated by the Hudson-Fulton Commission on Friday last . when only nineteen of the fifty-four floats belonging to the historical parade passed lip Eastern Parkway . From accounts in THE there had apparently been no consideration given to the way the floats were to be gotten from the river to the Park Plaza . where the parade was to start . The sensible way would seem to have been to take them apart sufficiently so that they could pass under the trolley W11-44 and elevated structures , and then to have 1. , ought them over one of the bridges . The Eastern Parkway seemed a peculiar route to choose , as it is a part of the city which is largely vacant lots , though there is some building going on there at the present time . R is also hard to reach , as there are few car lines that lead to it . This is just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slighted , till Brooklynites have come to regard it as a matter of course . Will the carnival parade in Brooklyn be somewhere nearly as good as the carnival parade in New York , or are we to look for a reptition of last Friday 's fiasco on next Saturday night ?
