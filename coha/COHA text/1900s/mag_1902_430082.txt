 | MANKIND has a marvelous facility for self-repetition , as though it was resolved to keep on proving that to-morrow is like unto yesterday . Even history is prone to plagiarize from itself at whatever interval of time , and many an American , reading about General Butler 's obstinate blundering on the Tugela , could not help feeling that Braddock had been defeated once more . The world moves , of course ; and yet we go on saying ditto to our grandfathers in the placid belief that we are declaring new truths . Just at the beginning of the new century the new truth which certain strenuous writers are shrilly declaring is that literature is suffering from a lack of criticism , that there are now none to uphold the final standards of literary art and to apply them inexorably , and that therefore the republic of letters is in a parlous state . with incompetent mediocrity claiming all the rewards of merit and usurping all the places of honor . One of these robust protestants against the prevailing laxity of criticism , the British author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laments that belles lettres are sinking deeper and deeper into degradation , and two American reviewers are in painful accord with him , the first asserting that one grows weary , in these days . of harping persistingly upon the melancholy fact that criticism in the Anglo-Saxon world has become almost extinct and that what public accepts as criticism is almost thing but that , " while the second complacently confesses that " the degradation of literature is one of the facts of the present day impossible to ignore . ' ' And all three of these writers unite in crying aloud for a criticism which shall scourge and scorch the feeble folk now enjoying the favor of the public and which shall drive the moneychangers from out the temple of art . This cry not only finds a prompt response in that gorilla-delight at the prospect of seeing somebody else suffer which still works in not . a few of us , but it also awakens an echo in the breasts of many milder lovers of literature , justly annoyed by the prevalence of flagrant puffery and by the silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving a vogue sadly out of proportion to their actual value . No doubt it must be very irritating to those whose sense of proportion is keener than their sense of humor , to read in the hasty reviews that fill the daily and the weekly papers that this or that callow storyteller has really rivaled Thackeray or Hawthorne , and that one of the minor choir of latter-day songsters combines in his verses the luscious beauty of Keats with the penetrative imagination of Wordsworth . But , however understandable it is that man should be provoked to wrath by absurdities like these , there is no basis for the belief that the present conditions . lamentable as they may seem to some , are in any way new . It is more than fifty years since Poe died : and Poe was as vehement as any of the protestants of to-day in declaring the decadence of contemporary literature and  | in asserting the necessity for a criticism which should be as rigorous as it was vigorous . And it is more than seventy years since Macaulay gave utterance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a novel may be , there is not the least difficulty in procuring favorable notices of it from all sorts of publications , daily , weekly or monthly . " Macaulay went on to maintain that the influence of puffery was most pernicious , since " it is no small evil that the avenues of fame should be blocked up by a swarm of noisy , pushing , elbowing pretenders , who , though they will not be able to make good their own entrance , hinder in the meantime those who have a right to enter . " Now , even if the present state of affairs is most deplorable , there is at least consolation in the knowledge that we have not fallen from the high estate of our ancestors . Indeed , we may even take comfort in the thought that , if the same puffery existed in Poe 's time and in Macaulay 's , perhaps it may not be so fatal to literature as those two incisive writers asserted . We may perhaps go further and surmise that if literature really flourished fifty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , although the book-reviewers were doing their duty no better then than they are doing now , perhaps the vigorous and rigorous criticism of the sort that Macaulay and Poe preached ? and that they both on occasion practised ? is not quite so necessary as they declared it to be . Behind the somewhat exacerbated protest of Macaulay and Poe and of the strenuous writers of our own day who voice the same dissatisfaction , there lies a threefold assumption :  - -  first , that it is the chief duty of the critic to tear the mask from imposters and to rid the earth of the incompetent ; second , that the critics of the past accepted this obligation and were successful in its accomplishments : and third , that there is now at the beginning of the twentieth century a special need for this corrective criticism . Now , these three assumptions are assumptions only ; not one of them is borne out by the history of literature . But , although unsupported by the facts , they are so plausible that they are likely to mislead and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be an obligation upon the critic of science to tear the mask from off the impostor : but this can never be a chief duty for the critic of art . In so far as literature touches science ? in biography , for example , and in the other departments of history ? the utmost exactness of statement must be insisted upon . But in so far as literature is an art , in pure belles lettres , in poetry , in the drama , in prose-fiction , there are no standards of scientific exactness to be applied with scientific rigidity . When the critic is unfortunately seized with the belief that there are such standards and that these standards are in his possession , to be applied at will , the result is Jeffrey 's famous condemnation of Wordsworth and the infamous assault on heats ? two instances without much encouragement for the critic who may feel moved to volunteer for police work . Nor is there any better warrant for the second of these three assumptions ? that the critics of the past accepted the obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present ' are derelict to their duty , preferring rather to close their eyes when they perceive incompetent poets and unworthy romancers picking the pockets of the unsuspecting public . It is true that certain of the selfstyled critics of the past devoted themselves to the exposure of literary malefactors , but the result of their labors was often only a pitiful self-exposure . Jeffrey , of the " Edinburgh " and Wilson , of " Blackwood 's , ' ' abounded in scathing contempt of the books they did not like . When they were wrong , as not infrequently happened , they merely made themselves laughingstocks for all who have come after ; and when they were right , as might be the case now and again , they had plainly wasted their time , since they had done no more than kill what had no real vitality . When we note that no one of the leading critics of the nineteenth century ? Sainte-Beuve , Arnold or Lowell ? cared keenly for the discussion of contemporary literature , we are led to remark that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they practised it , and mere hook-reviewing . Criticism , in their hands and in the hands of those who follow them , is a department of literature . while book-reviewing is a branch of  | journalism . To " get the best " is the aim of literature , while the object of journalism is rather to " get the news . " The critic , concerning himself especially with what is most worthy of his inquiry , is led most often to discuss the picked works bequeathed to us by the past , while the book-reviewer , writing for a periodical , has perforce to deal with the average product of the present . Criticism is the art of " seeing the object as in itself it really is , " so Matthew Arnold told us ; and it " obeys an instinct prompting it to try to know the best that is known and thought in the world . " Book-reviewing , however useful it may be , has a far humbler function ; it may be defined as the art of informing readers just what the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . Criticism can , if it so choose , deal only with the permanent past , while book-reviewing has no option ; it must consider the fleeting present . Book-reviewing has for its staple topic the contemporary ? which is very likely to be little better than temporary ; and it is therefore at liberty to relax its requirements and to apply standards that are immediate rather than permanent ? to contrast one novelist of our time with another novelist of our time rather than to crush both of them under a comparison with the mighty masters of the past . It would be absurd for a bookreviewer to feel forced always to condemn every new volume of short stories because the young writers are obviously inferior in force and in finish to Poe and to Hawthorne , or to banish every one of the novelists who are seeking to set forth the seething life of this huge and sprawling metropolis of America because these ardent novices lack not a little of the genius we are all glad to acknowledge in Balzac and in Thackeray . It is not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word ) that the strenuous writers are dissatisfied , but rather with the present condition of book-reviewing - as revealed in our periodicals . daily , weekly and monthly . They proclaim that contemporary literature is languishing because the book-reviewer has failed to do what in him lies : and they insist that book-reviewing is no longer what it was once . Of course , it is easy enough to find fault with the book-reviewing of to-day as it is visible in the countless periodicals of Great Britain and the United States ; indeed , there are few institutions with which it is not easy to find fault . Both in London and in New York book-reviewing is often careless ; it is often incompetent ; it is frequently casual and hasty , and only very rarely is it venal . It is sometimes careful , competent , thorough and disinterested . It is sometimes merely the medium for the selfish display of what the young writer is pleased to consider as his wit . It is sometimes both intelligent and conscientious . In the daily and weekly periodicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole than is the reviewing in these periodicals of the fine arts , of music , and of the drama ? although this apparent superiority is probably due to the great inherent difficulty of the other tasks . Book-reviewing , again , is rather better on the whole at the beginning of the twentieth century than it ever was before . Whoever has considered the career of Oliver Goldsmith can recall the wretched condition of book-reviewing in England in the middle of the eighteenth century , when it was wholly in the control of the booksellers ; and whoever is familiar with the correspondence of Rufus Griswold will remember what an extraordinary state of affairs seems to have existed in the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century , when an editor was apparently considered churlish if he refused to publish the reviews of their books sent to him by the authors themselves . In fact , only those who are really ignorant : about bookreviewing in the past would venture to pretend that it was in any way superior to book-reviewing in the present . Probably this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that things used to be far better than they are now . We know well enough that this is not true ; but still we often talk as though we thought the world was always running down hill . The deficiencies of book-reviewing are serious enough now ; but there never was a time when they Were any less evident . There never was a time when book-reviewing was all that it ought to be . or even when its average was high . Indeed , we may go further and say that there never  | was a periodical , British or American , French or German , in which the bookreviewing was always satisfactory ? in which it was unfailingly competent . ' courteous and disinterested ? and in which every article was evidently written by a gentleman and a scholar . At least , if there is any such periodical in existence , I should be glad to subscribe for it at once ; and if it is no longer in existence , I should be glad to buy a complete set . Moreover , I should be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its name , since such a periodical is what I have been seeking diligently for now many years . In my leisurely youth , when I had all the time there was , I bought a forty-year file of a London weekly of lofty pretentions and of a certain antiquity , since it has now existed for more than three score years and ten ; and in the course of a twelvemonth I turned every page of those solid tomes , not reading every line , of course , but not neglecting a single number . The bookreviewing was painfully uninspired , with little brilliancy in expression and with little insight in appreciation ; it was disfigured by a certain smug complacency which I find to be still a characteristic of the paper whenever I chance now to glance through its pages . But as I worked through this contemporary record of the unrolling of British literature from 1830 to 1870 , what was most surprising was the fact that only very infrequently indeed did the book-reviewers bestow full praise on the successive publications which we now hold to be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books most lavishly eulogized were very often those that have now sunk into oblivion . Of course , this surprise was a little unreasonable . The high value of the greater books of this period lies partly in their possession of the element of the universal and the permanent and by the very fact of their having this element these books were so much the less in accord with the prevailing taste at the moment of their appearance ; and the book-reviewer , being a journalist and therefore professionally responsive to the immediately contemporary , discovered a closer conformity to this fleeting standard in other books now neglected , largely because taste has changed with the passing of the moment . Morever , there is in the greater books of any era not only this element of universality and permanence , but also an element of individuality often very disconcerting to those in whose hands it first comes . They do not know quite what to make of it or how to take it . They can see that it fails to fit inside any of the accepted formulas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes us distrust anything that seems to savor of freakishness . It is , indeed , a commonplace of criticism that many a great artist has had to create the taste he is to satisfy . and that he had had to educate his public to appreciate him . The more original he is , the more individual his expression of life . the harder the task before him . No wonder is it , therefore , that what is written in accord with the conventions of the present and with the traditions of the past is more likely to call forth paeans of praise from the book-reviewer than what happens to be bristling with an unexpected personality . Even if the book-reviewer himself has enjoyed the reading of the work in which a new thing is said in a new may , when he takes up his pen to comment upon it his conservatism often restrains him from the ample expression of his pleasure . The third assumption of the strenuous writers from whom quotations were made at the beginning of this paper was that there is a special need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearless and trenchant criticism which shall relieve us somehow from the immense increase in the number of inferior books pouring from the presses . It may be asserted at once that this assumption has no firmer foundation than the two others . It is true that there are more books published nowadays than ever before , and that a very large proportion of them are worthless . But then a very large proportion of the books published in any decade of the nineteenth century or of the eighteenth century or of the seventeenth century are also worthless . The worthy books of these centuries are still remembered , while the worthless books were soon forgotten . It is a well known fact that the telegraph-poles seem closer together the more distant they are : and so it is also with the masterpieces of literature . To suppose  | that ours is the only decade that has suffered by the over multiplication of needless books ought not to be possible to a scholar who knows the history of his own literature . Perhaps it is also a little unscientific even to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is perhaps better to admit that the conditions of sound literary development require that there should be abundant and luxuriant productivity . It augurs well for the future of our literature that so many are now striving for self-expression in this medium , however annoying it may be to the bookreviewer to be forced to consider an everincreasing number of volumes piled high on his table and however much it may irk him to waste time in commenting upon writers who seem to him to be beneath criticism . Any increase in the number of books points to a probable increase in the number of good books ? unless , indeed , there has been some sudden relaxing in the fiber of the stock that speaks our language , some strange loss of energy in the race . As a matter of fact , we find in this last decade of the past century an extraordinary number of very poor books , wholly unworthy of publication , useless for any purpose . But we also find more often than ever before that books attain a high average of substance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art so widely understood or so skilfully applied . Never before was technic more masterly or craftmanship more accomplished . Never before were there so many writers of indisputable talent . Whether or not we have now our full share of writers of genius is another question ; but it is a question to which this decade can not furnish an answer . nor the next either . Genius can be tested only by the touchstone of time . Genius is for posterity to proclaim . The more frequent the men of talent among us to-day , the more likely it is that some one of them will be recognized as a man of genius tomorrow . Our perspective is far too short for us to gauge the stature of genius . We are in the underbrush and we can not make sure which of the tall trees is really the loftiest . On his ability to achieve this impossibility many a critic has staked his reputation ? and lost it . As M. Jules Lemaitre has reminded us , the criticism of our contemporaries is not really criticism ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of book-reviewing is to engage in this very discussion of our contemporaries , and this is why bookreviewing , which is a department of journalism , must be carefully distinguished from criticism , which is a department of literature . This is why also we need not worry ourselves overmuch about the present condition of book-reviewing , since it has not all the importance which the British author of Ephemera Critica " has claimed for it and since it can really have very little influence upon the future of literature . As a fact , the condition of book-reviewing is not now so lamentable as the British author has declared , and it is not indeed any worse than it has been in earlier years ; but it might be very much worse than it is , and very much worse than it ever was , without its having any unfortunate influence on the development of a single man of genius . Indeed , genius never more surely reveals itself as genius than in its ability to withstand the pressure of contemporary fashion and go on doing its own work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-reviewers can have little influence , fortunate or unfortunate : and even on the author of talent their influence is at best but indirect . In other words , the book-reviewers wholly misconceive their position when they suppose themselves to have any special duty toward the author , since his work must of necessity be finished and out of hand before they can see it . As we look over the literary history of the nineteenth century , we can discover no single instance of any book-reviewer ever having exerted any influence , favorable or unfavorable , on . any author of ability , either British or American . It is to the reader , and to the reader only , that the book-reviewers are under obligation . It is to the ' reader that they have to render their reports , honestly declaring what manner of book it may be they have before , them , and devoting themselves wholly to such explanation and discussion as will interest and instruct the reader . They need take no thought whatever of the author , whose merits and demerits they are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is then too late for him to profit by any advice of theirs ? but for the sake of the reader . One evidence of the improvement of this branch of journalism is to be seen in the gradual disappearance of the old-school book-reviewers whose attitude toward an author was often that of a querulous pedagogue , now giving him a good mark and now scolding him and bidding him stand in the corner for a dunce . The book-reviewers of the better class , nowadays , pretend to no responsibility for the author and deal with him quite impersonally ; they are well aware that any influence they can exert upon him must be indirect only and through the pressure of public opinion . They recognize that their duty is to the reader only and that their sole means of benefiting literature is by arousing in the public at large a distaste for the affected and the false , a disgust for the sham and the shoddy , a regard and respect for the sincere and honest treatment of life . The British author of " Ephemera Critica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plaints , would apparently like to have the book-reviewers resume the pedagogic attitude they have so wisely abandoned . Ile seems to believe that they are charged with grave responsibilities , having the duty of keeping the weights and the measures and of detecting counterfeit currency . He tells us that the critics of science accept this charge and acquit themselves loyally of this obligation ; and he insists that the same burden should rest also upon the critics of belles lettres ? in other words . upon the book-reviewers . Behind this contention there is a misconception of the power of criticism and a mistaking of its boundaries ; there is an assumption of aristocratic superiority not warranted by the facts of literary history . It is founded on the belief that literature is for the few rather than for the many and that the plain people are pitifully unable to appreciate what is best unless they are led to it by the critic and the scholar . This belief is rarely frankly stated , but it is held by many men of letters ; it is expressed superabundantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for example . But this belief can have for its foundation , only the opinion that what is most important in any art is its form , and not its content ; and that literature itself is rather a matter of words and of phrases than a question of thought and of feeling . It is based on the theory that the substance is of less consequence than the style and that the technic is more vital than the idea . The plain people care little for technic , for style , for mere words and phrases ; they are perhaps unduly impatient at the frequent discussion of these qualities by literary experts ; they are interested far less in manner than in matter . Although they are not so negligent of manner as many assert , they give their chief attention to the matter in hand . They are ready always to respond to emotion and to thought ; and in this they are capable of rising to unexpected heights . The reputation of the great poets has not been made by the scholarly critics chiefly , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years immediately following . Almost every one of the commanding names in literature belongs to a man who enjoyed a wide popularity while he was alive . Sophocles was not only the most powerful but also the most applauded of Greek dramatists . Shakespeare was the favorite of the groundlings who flocked to the Globe Theater ; and Moliere 's plays drew larger audiences oftener than those of any of his rivals . Goethe 's lyrics were on the lips of the young men and maidens of Germany while he was yet alive in Weimar . Among the lyceum audiences of New England , in ' the middle of the nineteenth century , no lecturer was more welcome than Emerson . Many a third-rate poet , failing of popular appreciation , although praised by his fellow-men of letters , has placed his hope in after-ages , when the taste of the people might be more cultivated , and has therefore filed an appeal to posterity . But there is no case on record where posterity has heard the appeal and reversed the unfavorable verdict of the plain people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the author 's lifetime . or within three score years and ten after his birth , it is never obtained at all . When  | the contemporary judgment of the broad public is unfavorable , it is final ; and there is no recourse to any later tribunal . On the other hand , when this contemporary judgment is favorable , it is not final : and often the cause is reargued in every succeeding century . In other words , the next generation will select out of the many popular authors of this generation the few that it will esteem worthy of survival ; but it will never attempt to galvanize into life any of the unpopular authors . In fact , in the history of every truly great writer 's reputation we can observe that he was relished by the plain people of his own day , whether or not he was adequately appreciated by the scholarly critics who were his contemporaries . More than one truly great writer has passed through this life amusing or consoling his fellow-men ; and he has then died before the scholarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their respectful attention . Cervantes certainly was one of these favorites of the plain people , unrecognized by the literary experts of his own tongue ; and probably Shakespeare was another . Not a few of the novelists widely read at the beginning of the twentieth century will be absolutely forgotten at the end of it ; but , on the other hand , such of our writers tf fiction as may be enjoyed at the end of the century will have been selected by the ( unerring hand of Time from the list of those known to-day wherever the English language is spoken . This may seem to some a hazardous contention , although it is borne out by the facts of literary history ; and it is absolutely fatal to any theory that criticism has the power to pass upon the credentials of contemporary poets and romancers . This theory is essentially aristocratic ; it sets up a caste of culture as the only one qualified to decide what is good or bad in literature . Upon questions of style , of form , of rhetoric , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education is often - the best judge , but in considering the essence of literature , the vital qualities to be felt rather than to be formulated , the life of the spirit , its judgment is not so good as that of the plain people , who know what they like although they do not know why . The plain people took to heart the " Pilgrim 's Progress " long before the cultivated caste discovered its worth ; and they thrilled to the Gettysburg Address as it fell from the lips of the homely speaker . The aristocrats of culture put their trust in academic standards , as becomes the custodians of tradition . They look to the past only ; they rarely understand the present ; they are prone to distrust the future . They did not perceive the scope of " Don Quixote , " of " Hamlet , " of the " Cid , " and of " Les Femmes Savantes . " They were outraged by Hugo 's " Hernani " as they were disgusted with Ibsen 's " Ghosts . " They are rarely opened-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works which revolt them ? Zola 's , for example , and Whitman 's . But it is only fair to suggest that they are swift to belaud delicate art and technical skill . They found it easy to appreciate Vergil and Racine , Gray and Longfellow , and in general any other poet who has felt himself to be the heir of the ages and who has walked reverently in the footprints of his predecessors . They are therefore more likely to be right in their opinions on authors of the second rank than in their judgments upon original geniuses . In this latter task their very education seems often to be a disadvantage , sophisticating their perceptions and not leaving them as ready to understand the elemental and the universal as the plain people are . It may even lead them to distrust a writer of primitive force , chiefly because the plain people like him . The book-reviewers are wise in rejecting the advice of the strenuous writers quoted early in this paper and in not being tempted to take themselves too seriously . It is enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their predecessors and to remember that when a book-reviewer decides that it is his duty to scourge the incompetent and to drive out the false pretenders , he may be clever enough to select Robert Montgomery as his victim , or he may be unlucky enough to pick out Byron or Keats or Wordsworth .
