THERE is a comfortable thought springing into life all about us in the happy day of Now , which should be sung into the ear of every woman throughout the land , that each and all may rejoice and be glad . It is that on a last analysis there is comparatively little necessary ugliness in the world , and a hitherto undreamed-of possibility of beauty which needs but to be recognized and made the best of . All human beings , an they be not queer in the making , cherish in their inmost hearts a desire to please ; though sometimes the very ones who seem farthest removed from such wish are those who suffer from it most . I use the word " suffer " deliberately , because these are the timid mortals who , having made up their minds that they could not be pretty even if they tried , are ashamed to be caught making an effort . " No curls or looking glasses for me ! " they say ; and because they were n't born with copper-colored hair , like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show their superiority of mind by sleeking back into a dismal flatness the black or brown tresses which Mother Nature herself thought very lovely when she bestowed the gift . " Cheer up , cheer up ! " the message rings out to all such women to-day . " Away with the old cry that beauty is but skin deep and dealt out unfairly to the favored few . Out upon it for a fallacy ! Beauty is as deep as the heart that longs to please , and the mind that dictates the way . With health beneath the skin and cleanliness without , a little courage and due consultation with the mirror , each one may have some sort of charm , for Dame Nature has been generous one way or another to all her daughters . " But there is a message to another class of women ; to those careless Cinderellas who go about in curl papers , Happy old wrappers and decrepit shoes through half the day , and blossom out in a belated splendor along toward evening when the ball hour draws nigh . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . When  | that faithful but abominated friend , the a l a r m clock , buzzes its harsh greeting in t o the cold , gray dawn , it is almost more than flesh and blood can achieve to rise on the second and graciously a d o r n one 's self to charm and please . To many a woman it is a tragedy ea ell morning anew , that getting up from restful slumber a n d adjusting the reluctant household machinery to its day 's work . If you keep a cook she probably has not come , and until you see her in the flesh you know the chances are she wo n't arrive at all . Being tender-hearted you may pause to think : " Poor thing ; she gets up and begins the task of looking pretty a good hour before the rest of us " ; and you pity her . But things have to be done just the same . The meat man has sent brains instead of steak ? thereby proving his personal lack of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief and sleepy hour ? Mr You particularly wished to take those photographs of the children with him to show to Cousin Will ; but where can they be ? If lie gets off again without signing that school report for the little Irons there will be hot tears and lamentation later on ; but what has become of the report ? The feminine mind staggers before such worries as these , and refuses positively to think about beauty . And yet I say to you , sisters , your husband will forgive the bad breakfast and the loose-jointed package of photographs , draped flimsily about with a sticky and anemic string from the butcher 's bag , before he forgets your tumbled hair and your Mother Hubbard . It is possible that lie is mistaken if he excuses any of the three offenses oftener than as an occasional contretemps . The day has well-nigh passed when women married as mere children and grew up in the first years of their married life . You are very apt to have been old enough to form some idea of what lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr You because you rather thought you cared for him . Remember , therefore , that the breakfast and the little attentions and the making yourself pretty were all in the bond ; or if not , there was n't a great deal to that bond except the hard letter of the law . It would be a plain world indeed if woman let go her hold on the poetry of life ! And one of her opportunities for a bit of poetry is by tucking it into an early and hurried breakfast , which otherwise is truly an earthly matter . How much longer would it take you to dress yourself properly when you get up ? Take out your pencil and calculate the number of minutes necessary , move up the alarm clock that much and subtract the time from your evenings . That will give you the answer to one of your problems . Yes , it is hard . Never any time to yourself for reading or writing letters . Always sweeping and washing and cooking . But clear , me , you ca n't have everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute your unmarr i e d friends who have nothing to do but read and write letters and embroider foolish little doilies . Do you catch that hungry look in the eye as they watch you smoothing Gloria 's hair back from her  | warm pink forehead or settling six disputes in five minutes for the twins ? Moreover , you mothers with your hands and hearts so full , remember that all states of life pass quickly by . That other day will come when instead of babies to be tended there will stand around you tall boys and girls , and from . ' their mouths and through their deeds shall be pronounced your judgment . I am going to tell you something to do n't do . Do n't sweep and wash and cook too much . Far be it from me to suggest any short-cuts toward the town of Happiness ; but ? well , they do say the copper-haired Mrs Mason travels by that way , and does lint sweep her halls but three times a week ; and why is it all the boys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that not quite immaculate house ? And how does she keep so young , with half-grown children of her own , and a husband as poor as a church mouse ? She wakes it a duty to look pretty , if you want to know . The grocer 's boy told hue ? though of course it was very wrong for me to listen to him ? that Allis Mason was just as pretty at 7 a m as at any other hour of the day . The curious part of it all is that she is n't really a pretty woman at all , only sweet and attractive looking . In the business world a merchant refers to his patrons for testimonial as to his worth ; so in testing the home why not ask questions of its inmates ? Two women come to my mind at once as bearing the endorsement of their sons ; and let me say that though a woman may sometimes weary of striving to please her husband . she is a queer person indeed if she be not always on the alert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southerner . She is usually without a servant and gets up early to feed and speed away a husband and five children . She was not a very good housekeeper when she started out , but she has learned lots of detail as she went along , and she always knew the first great principle of looking her best and smiling her sweetest in the morning . No flappy gray calico wrappers for this dear little matron ; but two-piece blue print frocks. the neck turned in and a white kerchief folded about her plump throat . " I hope I 'm not vain , " she smiled at me apologetically as the last of the boys touched her hair with a light gesture of admiration and ran away to school ; " but you see the fact is I have a horror of the children perhaps not wanting to come back home . They might like school better ? the teachers study the matter of dress and do make themselves so attractive ? or they might prefer to go home with some of their friends . So 1 try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise that home is a pleasant place to hurry back to . " And that other mother , who is a northern woman It is good to see her big sons squabbling over which one shall escort her out in the evening ; and it is better still to hear her laugh at the question : " Dow did you do it ' ? " and answer : " l have made the foolish fellows proud to show me to their friends . Fan afraid I have deceived them , for they really think I 'm pretty . " She is not a lady of case , either . Both these women , be it noted , keep themselves well and strong . They do not believe in darning at midnight or sitting up through the small hours to fashion finery for the children . For , believe me , there is no ruble ratified when hands and eyes are weary but a temper is ruffled also ; and never a hem is creased down out of legitimate hours for work but the creases get somehow into one 's face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step toward looking pretty in the morning , be wise the clay before . Try to be happy with fewer things and look well to those few essential . Make ready at night the morning dress , with the little finishing things you will need for putting it on . happy is the - woman who is emancipated from the bond of curl papers ' . But they still claim slaves from among our ranks , and to hide or disguise them is one of the problems involved in looking pretty in the morning . There is no need , perhaps , to go to the extreme of the maiden who is so sensitive to ugliness that she will not inflict the sight of her ctrl papers even on herself , but rolls up the ringlets after her light is out , and takes them down again before she rises nest morning . One handsome young woman who believes in the kid curlers but is unwilling to appear with such adornment before the boy nephew whose early breakfast she prepares , gave the matter a deal of thought . At last she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdress which covers the curlers , and though not sanctioned by any mode or period is much admired by the  | The plan seemed so successful that she made other dainty caps , and wears one through her morning duties , thus giving the curls a better chance . And oh , I beg of you , let us not make the mistake of going about our morning tasks in soiled or ragged finery reduced to its lowest terms ! When your company clothes are fit for the rag bag , by all means let the rag bag have its due ; for the woman who sweeps in battered velvet and broken-spirited dance slippers offends against the rules of both work and play . Some women who refrain from the greater faults in morning dress , or lack of dress , find their Waterloo in the adorning of their necks . It is a safe rule not to wear a ribbon or lawn tie unless you can wear it smooth and snug . If you must be loose about the throat , choose a style that is meant to be loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to taste and your individual need . You can have a turnover collar made right on the dress and clasp it together in the front with a brooch ; or you can turn in the neckband and wear either a soft kerchief , or a sailor collar made to button or pin on . A very pretty neck dress for morning wear is the linen or scrim turnover collar , made , of course , separate from the dress so that it can be frequently changed . Some women find it comfortable to button these collars to the neckband , while others prefer pinning them , because the tightness can then be somewhat adjusted each time the collar is worn . The sleeve to the house gown should be as short as can be comfortably worn , in order to keep it out of mischief , for no puff or clip at the hand , however beautiful it may be of itself , can be graceful enough to be tolerated when it drags through the butter dish or sweeps the best of your bric-a-brac from the shelf . In cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but where the climate or other conditions do not favor this , you should at least have no extra length to hamper the wrists and hands . The two-piece dress is in so many points preferable to the all-in-one gown , that the latter will probably disappear entirely before we are many years older . Two smaller garments are more easily laundered than one large one ; besides which a skirt will often keep nice and wearable through the course of a suecession of waists . On this account it is sometimes desirable to have all one 's house dresses made from the same material , that they may be worn in any combination ; or to have several waists to each skirt . Some clever woman has discovered seersucker as a substitute for plain gingham , because it requires no ironing and thus cuts in half the labor of keeping the morning frock fresh . An objection to the separate waist has often been its tendency to gape and pull away from the skirt at the belt line ; but this difficulty has been solved by one woman who finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or circular ruffle , which covers all differences . Stout women , who need a longer placket than their slim sisters , find great comfort in the skirt which opens down one side of the front , because this opening does not gape like the ordinary one at the back . With such a skirt and a surplice front waist , requiring no neck finish at all , the plump woman is as neat and attractive as can be ; and if , in addition , she is wise enough to put her waist into a band at the bottom and work five buttonholes in the band ? three rather close together in the back and one at each fide about half way toward the front ? and thus button the waist down to the skirt band beneath , she need hardly regret her stoutness any more . The band of the waist must be at least two inches larger than that of the skirt , so that it can be drawn down in front and so add to the length of waist . The short-waisted woman should remember also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better for her than one of a contrasting color which breaks the line of the figure . There is a new garment which might be called a waist-apron. and which is described by its enthusiastic owner as being made of percale , loose enough to slip on over the dress waist , and fastened behind . It is cut low in the neck and has one button at the top and another at the belt . The sleeves are full and rather short , and when the wristband is buttoned the sleeves to the dress waist are held up without being mussed . The sleeve could have a wristband with a narrow rubber instead of the button , if preferred . Really it would seem that once we are started on the question of ways and means toward looking pretty in the morning , there are many helps that come to mind .  |
