 | In the latest volume of his " History of the United States " Mr. James Ford Rhodes quotes these words from Col. Thomas H. Livermore , whose critical and dispassionate study of the history and statistics of the war between the States is one of the most important contributions to a knowledge of that momentous epoch : " The foregoing comparisons do not give ground on which to award the display of superior courage or steadfastness to the armies as a whole on either side . The record on both sides places the people of the United States in the first rank of militant nations . " In a note of acknowledgment at the close of the volume Mr. Rhodes recognizes his indebtedness to " the unique publication , War of the Rebellion : Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies , " and adds , " The acknowledgment of the War Department to the Confederate generals , to Jefferson Davis and his widow , for assistance in the collection of materials and the facts stated in connection therewith have probably no parallel in historical literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years , that a large section of country was swept bare not only of men and food , but of houses and tools ; that the total enlistments in both armies were about four million , two hundred thousand ; that a full half million men died on both sides on the field , from wounds , disease , accidents and other causes ; that the total cost of the war was about $5,000,000,000 , the full significance of these statements becomes apparent . Add to these striking facts the statesmanlike attitude of General Grant in the closing hours of the struggle and the noble and far-seeing patriotism of General Lee and the real spirit in which a great conflict was conducted and ended becomes clear through clouds of misapprehension and deafening confusions of speech . That war closed forty years ago for all save a few score politicians on both sides whose stock in trade is not new ideas and fresh perceptions of the needs of a new age , but worn-out phrases , a dying sectionalism of feeling and a perverted use of splendid traditions ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so absorbed in old-time issues that they continue to live in conditions which have disappeared . The battle flags have been exchanged ; the President of the United States in public address has not only recognized the consummate courage of the men who fought against the Union , but their passionate sincerity as well ; the war is finally and forever over . The day will come when statues of Lee and Stonewall Jackson will find place in the squares of Northern cities as types of ideal Americans , stainless in character , heroic in self-sacrifice , following duty with unshrinking loyalty and at an immense cost ; and statues will be erected in Southern cities to Lincoln , the man of largest and tenderest heart whom the great crisis brought to the front , and the best and wisest friend of the South on either side the line . In his spirit , not in that of Stevens ; in the temper of Lee , not in that of irreconcilable partisans , are to be found the soul of a heroic age and the prophetic lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is wise to recall these things for there is still , at times , a clamor of discordant voices from those who are in the new age but not of it , and because the heroic memories of the struggle form an inexhaustible capital of proud memories and of inspiring impulses for Americans in all time to come . It is only brave foes who can so respect one another that out of bitter strife they strike hands at last in indestructible fraternity . The conflict was sectional , the results of it are national . All honor to the men who conducted the long debate on fundamentally different ideas of the distribution of power under our system , and to the other men who lived through the sublime epic of strife or died in the throes of it ; all reverence to the Grey and Blue as emblems of a kindred honesty of purpose and resolute facing of death ! It is out of soil fed with such blood that great men spring and the noblest growths of national character and ideals arise . These things are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : what are we to do with them ? To put them in a museum as in a shrine and worship them is to show them small honor ; for they are not relics of a dead past ; they are achievements which have created a new age ; and we honor them most truly when we lift ourselves in breadth of vision and of work , to their level . There was an Old South and there is now a New South ; there  | page deleted  | people of the Low Countries in their magnificent struggle against Spain . It believes , in the second place , that on the great question of the relative powers of the nation and of the States the Old South was technically right , though historically wrong ; that Calhoun 's argument , on strictly technical grounds , was unanswerable . In the great debate Rayne spoke authoritatively for the framers of the constitution , while Webster spoke authoritatively for the necessities of the nation . It recognizes , in the third place , that the initial responsibility for slavery was shared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier stages of colonial development , slavery disappeared from the North and strengthened its hold in the South as the result of circumstances rather than of moral repugnance ; and it sees with increasing clearness that to the isolation of the South , logically brought about by slavery , was largely due the arrest of the normal movement of the Southern mind , which , from the start , revealed a notable aptitude for dealing with public affairs in a large and statesmanlike spirit . It recognizes , in the fourth place , that the policy of reconstruction which subverted the order of society in the South and placed the duties of citizenship on the negro without educating him to bear them was a blunder of tragic magnitude and a gross injustice to white and black alike ; that to set in inevitable antagonism a class of men with fifteen hundred years of political education behind them and a class of men who had not learned the rudiments of that education was to invite the bitter and humiliating experience through which the South passed at the close of the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , but it regards those mistakes as part of the old misunderstanding which made Sectional America possible . The New North does not believe that the door of citizenship should be closed in any man 's face because of race or color ; but it also believes that all the conditions of citizenship , save this , belong to the States for settlement ; that the South should decide for itself the conditions precedent to the granting of the franchise ; that the South understands , as the North does not and can not , the actual conditions under which this problem must be worked out ; and that what the South needs from the North is the patience which  | is born of knowledge , the sympathy which comes from an old and common responsibility , and the cooperation which is the fruit of faith . The men and women of the New North recognize , finally , the full co-partnership of the South with the North in the shaping of the early history of the nation and the preponderance of Southern men among the early leaders ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old , and the inspiring leadership in educational activity and interest in the New South ; they are as deeply interested in the early story of William and Mary , as in that of Harvard , Yale and Princeton ; they accept at their full value the great achievements and services of the University of Virginia , one of the pioneers of university methods and training in this country ; they know the solid and high-class work of such State institutions as the Universities of North Carolina , and Georgia , and Texas ; they hold in high regard the long line of Southern colleges like Wofford and Randolph-Macon , which with small means and at great sacrifices , have held fast by the traditions of sound learning ; and they are quick to honor Trinity , Vanderbilt , the University of Tennessee , the University of the South , which have set a new pace for educational progress in the South during the last fifteen years . They regard the rising tide of intellectual and educational interest in the South as one of the foremost movements of progress in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . The men and women of the New North have long been readers of Southern books and have not been slow to perceive that in Mr. James Lane Allen , Mr. Thomas Nelson Page , Mr. Joel Chandler Harris , Mr. John Fox , Jr. , Miss Glasgow , Miss King ? to select a few representative novelists ? the New South holds a foremost place in later American writing . They long ago recognized the genius of Poe and appraised his rare and subtle work by national instead of sectional standards ; they know the lyrics of Timrod , of Hayne , of Thompson , of Dr. Ticknor , of Father Ryan , of Cooke , of Hope and of Mrs. Preston ; they are students of Lanier , whose achievement and career were on a level ; and they are aware of those special qualities , gifts and capacities which the South alone can contribute to a literature which would be impoverished without the love of song for its own sake , the  | power and freedom of emotion , the lyrical abandon and spontaneity which are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its past and to the men and women who made that past articulate and commanding , the men and women of the New North have traveled so far out of sectionalism and into nationalism . They hold the traditions sacred , but they feel the air of a new age , they live in the light of a nobler conception of what is and must be the work of the nation in the spiritual life of the world . They discard sectional valuations of political ideas , of scholarly standards , of literary achievement . They ask no immunity from the most searching criticism so long as it is just ; they must have unfettered freedom of thought and of speech in religious and political discussion ; their allegiance must be to the truth , not to formulas of their State or of their section ; they are Americans to the heart , but they mean also to be citizens of that great community of the nations fast organizing itself as the ultimate unit of society . To this common ground the men and women of the New South and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , prepared alike in the Old North and the Old South , on immovable foundations of righteousness , of mutual comprehension and sympathy , of fellowship in the faith of the fathers for the service of humanity .
