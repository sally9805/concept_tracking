txt Senator Hanna , Chairman of the Republican National Cmmittee , to-day made his first address in . Chicago since his return from New York . : He addressed a noon meeting . of commercial men and retail salesmen . The large hall in. which he spoke was filled , not a few wo= : men being in the audience . Senator Hanna spoke in ' part as follows : " It is encouraging for me to see that the business interests and the workingmen - of the United States are awakening to the importance of the issue . Every Democratic issue that has been presented to the American public thus far has been for the ? pur , pose of leading astray the minds- of the people from the real issue . There is but one issue , - only one  --  the issue of prosperity ' and the continuation of it . ' The issue today is just what it was in 1S9U , only more ' so . The question is . Do the American people want as a foundation for their interest sound money and protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do'not want to talk about imperialistic , my friends . That is played out .. It bugaboo . It was intended to baa - bugaboo : It was intended to deceive the American people . It is an impossible issue ; it is  --  a ' fraud ; it is a humbug to talk about- tli ! American people resolving themselves into an empire , or to say that a man  --  with The reputation , with the character and ability of Nv Imam , would be an Emperor . " There was a conference in Chicago reGently of all the head chiefs- of ' the optiosi tion , and the New York people are anxiously waiting to know . what will be the issue when Mr. Bryan comes east . He has been summoned there by his Emperor . Dick Croker , and he will be told that he must - not talk free silver In New ' York . I have seen in the newspapers  --  and I believe every word of it . strange to say  --  that ? there was a deal made that puts Mr. Croker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this campaign ; and I want to know of our Western friends , whether Democrat or Republican , whether . they ' propose , in view of the present condition of affairs in our country , to follow any man who is dictated to from Tammany Hall . Everybody knows what politics is in New Y ork . Everybody knows ' the power of one man in the rank of the Democratic politicians in New York , and if there is anything approaching imperialism in this country it is the power of the- boss of Tammany . It was under his power that no person was permitted to land a pound . of ice upon the cocks of New York without his permission , and that ' permission was given to only one company , You hear about trusts . The Ice Trust of New York affects every poor man who lives within : the ' limit of that great ' city , ' and is the worst trust. - that ever Was , , ? and : it : eduld not be made efficient unless , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yerk , . Wppid net perri/Wipy other.company to land ' a pound of iceupon a single dock in that great city . That is the motive that governs the men that are now dictating the policies - in this campaign . By their almost united voice as far as the Electoral vote was concerned , : the Northern States in 189d said : We do - not believe in adopting a policy that will . undermine confidence in this country . We do n't believe In the promises made by Mr. Bryan that we need more money . ' We did not need more money . There was plenty of circulating medium , with our great system of commerce , to transact all and more of the business of the day . What we wanted was simply confidence . Party prejudices , party allegiance were forgotten ; self-interest , self-protection assumed sway in the minds of the majority of the- people . And they put their foot down and said : ' We will have none of it . ' It did not make any difference to tl ? . m , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeffersonian Democratic , or what . AA they want to know is , does it mean success and prosperity to ourselves and families ? " They may bring all the demagogues they command upon the rostrum : they may attempt to create class prejudice ; they may lie until they are black in the face ; but they can not fool the people . " We have been for three years through very exciting times . But I have not seen any evidence of any want of confidence . I have not seen any symptoms in the business anti commercial circles in this country denoting any want of confidence ; and why ? Because every man knew that William was at the helm ; because every man knew he was supported by a Republican Congress in both houses . Everybody knew that every effort would be made to settle all of the complications and differences with one single purpose , and that was the beat interest and honor of our country . It has been clone . The United States of America has leaped in to the very front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but feared abroad . We have gained a position second to none , and we gained it through the policy of peace - .. nd good will and justice to everybody . " Mr. Bryan says that he is a friend of the working man . Is be ? How do we know it ? Has he ever proved it ? Never . The old issue that made the hero of the workingman was the tariff . which protected the workinginan . That issue was fought for years , and I do not know of a ? abor organization in this country or those connected with organizations who ever w anted anything of public legislation or anything to protect their honor or interests who did not go to William when he was in the House . They went to him because they knew they were going to their friend . The bill which protected them and bore his name during its short life was a monuirent to the friendship that he bean ; to the working classes of the United States . " It ' was reproduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but during the interim we had an experience of a tariff for revenue . Mr. Bryan was one of the chief exponents and the principal advocate of that measure , and so elated was he . so carried away with the success of the movement . that he was one of the two men who shouldered little Billy Wilson and carried him around the hall ' Of the House of Representatives . " No. my friends . no demagogy or subterfuges are going to blind the eyes of the working people of the United States . I know them , I have been with them , and I believe in them , and when Mr. Bryan shows that over-anxiety in their interests I know that he is not true to what he says . fie simply wants your vote . That is all . Why . h. : even intimates in his public utterances to-day that if he is whipped this time he wo n't be dead yet . He will come up a third time . Why . he is a standing candidate for the Presidency . And I congratulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble and expense of selecting a candidate every time . "
