txt The Tageblatt publishes a remarkable article by Herr1 von Stahl describing the strange influence which a monk named Theophile has gained over the Czar . In many re spects Theophile 's history recalls that of the Lyons doctor . Philippe , who at one time exercised a complete ascendancy over the mind of Nicholas . Theophile is declared by von Stahl to have become the most powerful man in Russia , and by his influence upon the decision of the most important questions in both the domestic and foreign affairs of Russia to have acquired a position in the Imperial Court which is a matter of vital interest to other countries . About six months ago Grand Duke Peter Nicholaievitch took the monk Theophile to the Summer residence at Tsarskoe Selo and presented him to the Czar . Almost from the outset the Czar became , so to speak , the disciple of the astute and ambitious monk . Theophile first attracted the sympathies of the Czar by instructing him in various mystical matters in which the Emperor of all the Russias is keenly interested . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but soon he obtained the right of access to the imperial presence at any time , a privilege possessed in Russia only by members of the imperial family and Cabinet Ministers . Daily Visitor to Palace . After this privilege had been conferred on him , Theophile became a-frequent and subsequently a daily visitor at the palace , and it was not long before the Cabinet Ministers noticed that Theophile had gained an extraordinary ascendancy over the Czar , so that in many cases imperial decrees were traced directly to his influence . One striking incident recently illustrated the predominant position of the monk at the Imperial Court . The Czar had dismissed his old friend , Prince Obolensky , from his post as Chief of the Imperial Cabinet , and the Prince , 1 who is entirely without private fortune . was rendered destitute by the sudden loss of his official salary . The Dowager Empress of Russia interceded in Obolensky- 's behalf and begged her son to grant his old friend a pension sufficient - to rescue him from absolute poverty , but his Majesty refused to grant his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf , whereupon the Czar ordered the Prince 's salary of $25,000 per annum to be paid to him for the rest of his lifetime as a pension . Many other instances could be cited proving the power of this monk of the Orthodox Greek Church over the absolute ruler of Russia . Having been presented to the Czar by Peter Nicholaievitch , the monk is devoted to the interests'pf this Grand Duke , who is one of the leaders of the reactionary party in Russia . So Theophile 's influence is exerted on behalf of a retrogressive policy . The Grand Duke , who is thus increasing , through the monk , his influence over the Czar , which has always been extensive , is regarded by Russian reformers as one of the most dangerous enemies to their cause . Caused Changes in Uniforms . He is responsible for the ridiculous changes in uniform which have been introduced in the Russian Army in recent years much to the disgust of zealous officers responsible for the efficiency of the Czar 's forces . It is now learned that Grand Duke Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who had prepared designs for new uniforms . This officer 's sketches looked extremely attractive on paper , and when the Grand Duke laid them before the Czar he was able without much difficulty to obtain his august relative 's signature to them . The sketches were then sent to the Minister of War in the form of imperial decrees , and that functionary had no choice but to carry them out- One absurd innovation introduced in this way through Grand Duke Peter 's influence was an instruction that gendarmes should wear two swords , one on the right side and one on the left , whereby their freedom of action is greatly hampered . Herr von Stahl concludes his revelations by mentioning that the monk Theophile was preceded in the Czar 's favor by another monk , named Mitja , who for many months was one of the most influential personages at the Russian Court . Mitja , however , unlike the present priestly favorite , was a man Of limited education and low tastes , and fell into complete disfavor when the Czar discovered that he was addicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
