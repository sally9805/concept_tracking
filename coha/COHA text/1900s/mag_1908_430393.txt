 |p537  DOUBTLESS no one would dissent from Hamlet 's dictum that the purpose of playing is " to hold , as ' t were , the mirror up to nature " ; but this statement is so exceedingly simple that it is The rather difficult to understand . What special kind of Magic mirror did that wise dramatic critic have in mind when Mirror lie coined this memorable phrase ? Surely he could not have intended the sort of flat and clear reflector by the aid of which we comb our hair ; for a mirror such as this would represent life with such sedulous exactitude that we should gain no advantage from looking at the reflection rather than at the life itself which was reflected . If I wish to see the tobacco jar upon my writing table , I look at the tobacco jar : I do not set a mirror up behind it and look into the mirror . But suppose I had a magic mirror which would reflect that jar in such a way as to show me not only its outside but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter case , a glance at the represented image would spare me a more laborious examination of the actual object . Now Hamlet must have had in mind some magic mirror such as this , which , by its manner of reflecting life , would render life more intelligible . Goethe once remarked that the sole excuse for the existence of works of art is that they are different from the works of nature . If the theatre showed us only what we see in life itself , there would be no sense at all in going to the theatre . Assuredly it must show us more than that ; and it is an interesting paradox that in order to show us more it has to show us less . The magic mirror must refuse to reflect the irrelevant and non-essential , and must thereby concentrate attention on the pertinent and essential phases of nature . That mirror is the best that reflects the least which does not matter , and , as a consequence , reflects most clearly that which does . In actual life , truth is buried beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vainly , as we might seek a needle in a haystack . In this proverbial search we should derive no assistance from looking at a reflection of the haystack in an ordinary  |p538  mirror . But imagine a glass so endowed with a selective magic that it would not reflect hay but would reflect steel . Then , assuredly , there would be a valid and practical reason for holding the mirror up to nature . The only real triumph for an artist is not to show us a haystack , but to make us see the needle buried in it , not to reflect the trappings and the suits of life , but to suggest a sense of that within which passeth show . To praise a play for its exactitude in representing facts would be a fallacy of criticism . The important question is not how nearly the play reflects the look of life , but how much it helps the audience to understand life 's meaning . The sceneless stage of the Elizabethan As You Like It revealed more meanings than our modern scenic forests empty of Rosalind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be some magic in the mirror . Certain enterprising modern managers permit their press agents to pat them on the back because they have set , say , a locomotive on the stage ; but why should we pay two dollars to see a locomotive in the theatre when we may see a dozen locomotives in the Grand Central Station without paying anything ? Why , indeed ! ? unless the dramatist contrives to reveal an imaginable human mystery throbbing in the palpitant heart , ? no , not of the locomotive , but of the locomotive-engineer . That is something that we could not see at all in the Grand Central Station , unless we were endowed with eyes as penetrant as those of the dramatist himself . But not only must the drama render life more comprehensible by discarding the irrelevant , and attracting attention to the essential ; it must also render us the service of bringing to a focus that phase of life it represents . The mirror which the dramatist holds up to nature should be a concave mirror , which concentrates the rays impinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much a metaphysician to busy his mind about the simpler science of physics ; but surely this figure of the concave mirror , with its phenomenon of concentration , represents most suggestively his belief concerning the purpose of playing and of plays . The trouble with most of our dramas is that they render scattered and incoherent images of life ; they tell us many unimportant things , instead of telling us one important thing in many ways . They reveal but little , because they reproduce too much . But it is only by bringing all life to a focus in a single luminous idea that it is possible , in the two hours ' traffic of the stage , " to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure . "  |p539  An interesting instance of how a dramatist , by holding , as it were , a concave mirror up to nature , may concentrate all life to a focus in a single luminous idea is afforded by that justly celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which an adaptation is now being presented to the public of New York . The original is so much simpler and so much better than the adaptation that it is most fitting for our purposes to review the drama from the Spanish text . This play was first produced at the Teatro Espanol on March 19 , 1881 , and achieved a triumph that soon diffused the fame of its author , which till then had been but local , beyond the Pyrenees . It is now generally recognized as one of the standard monuments of the modern social drama . It owes its eminence mainly to the unflinching emphasis which it casts upon a single great idea . This idea is suggested in its title . In the old French romance of Launcelot of the Lake , it was Gallehault who first prevailed on Queen Guinevere to give a kiss to Launcelot : he was thus the means of making actual their potential guilty love . His name thereafter , like that of Pandarus of Troy , became a symbol to designate a go-between , inciting to illicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesca da Rimini narrates to Dante how she and Paolo read one day , all unsuspecting , the romance of Launcelot ; and after she tells how her lover , allured by the suggestion of the story , kissed her on the mouth all trembling , she adds , Galeotto fu'l libro e chi lo scrisse , @# which may be translated , " The book and the author of it performed for us the service of Gallehault . " Now Echegaray , desiring to retell in modern terms the old familiar story of a man and a woman who , at first innocent in their relationship , are allured by unappreciable degrees to the sudden realization of a great passion for each other , asked himself what force it was , in modern life , which would perform for them most tragically the sinful service of Gallehault . Then it struck him that the great Gallehault of modern life , El Gran Galeoto , was the impalpable power of gossip , the suggestive force of whispered opinion , the prurient allurement of evil tongues . Set all society to glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other is really innocent , start the wicked tongues a-babbling , and you will stir up a whirlwind which will  |p540  blow them giddily into each other 's arms . Thus the old theme might be recast for the purposes of modern tragedy . Echegaray himself , in the critical prose prologue which he prefixed to his play , comments upon the fact that the chief character and main motive force of the entire drama can never appear upon the stage , except in hints and indirections ; because the great Gallehault of his story is not any particular person , but rather all slanderous society at large . As he expresses it , the viIlainhero of his drama is Todo el mundo , ? everybody , or all the world . This , obviously , is a great idea for a modern social drama , because it concentrates within itself many of the most important phases of the perennial struggle between the individual and society ; and this great idea is embodied with direct , unwavering simplicity in the story of the play . Don Julian , a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Teodora , a beautiful woman in her early twenties , who adores him . He is a generous and kindly man ; and upon the death of an old and honored friend , to whose assistance in the past he owes his present fortune , he adopts into his household the son of this friend , Ernesto . Ernesto is twenty-six years old ; he reads poems and writes plays , and is a thoroughly fine fellow . He feels an almost filial affection for Don Julian and a wholesome brotherly friendship for Teodora . They , in turn , are beautifully fond of him . Naturally , he accompanies them everywhere in the social world of Madrid ; he sits in their box at the opera , acting as Teodora 's escort when her husband is detained by business ; and he goes walking with Teodora of an afternoon . Society , with sinister imagination , begins to look askance at the triangulated household ; tongues begin to wag ; and gossip grows . Tidings of the evil talk about town are brought to Don Julian by his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be requested to live in quarters of his own . Don Julian nobly repels this suggestion as insulting ; but Don Severn persists that only by such a course may the family name be rendered unimpeachable upon the public tongue . Ernesto , himself , to still the evil rumors , goes to live in a studio alone . This simple move on his part suggests to everybody ? todo el mundo ? that he must have had a real motive for making it . Gossip increases , instead of diminishing ; and the emotions of Teodora , Don Julian , and himself are stirred to the point of nervous tensity . Don Julian , in spite of his own sweet reasonableness , begins subtly to wonder if there could be , by any possibility , any basis for his brother 's vehemence . Don Severo 's wife , Dona Mercedes , repeats the talk of the town to Teodora , and turns her imagination inward , till it falters in self-questionings . Similarly the great Gallehault , ? which is the word of all the  |p541  world , ? whispers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ernesto . He resolves to seek release in Argentina . But before he can sail away , he overhears , in a fashionable cafe , a remark which casts a slur on Teodora , and strikes the speaker of the insult in the face . A duel is forthwith arranged , to take place in a vacant studio adjacent to Ernesto 's . When Don Julian learns about it , he is troubled by the idea that another man should be fighting for his wife , and rushes forthwith to wreak vengeance himself on the traducer . Teodora hears the news ; and in order to prevent both her husband and Ernesto from endangering their lives , she rushes to Ernesto 's rooms to urge him to forestall hostilities . Meanwhile her husband encounters the slanderer , and is severely wounded . He is carried to Ernesto 's studio . Hearing people coming , Teodora hides herself in Ernesto 's bedroom , where she is discovered by her husband 's attendants . Don Julian , wounded and enfevered , now at last believes the worst . Ernesto seeks and slays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits what the whole world has been whispering . In vain Ernesto and Teodora protest their innocence to Don Severo and to Dona Mercedes . In vain they plead with the kindly and noble man they both revere and love . Don Julian curses them , and dies believing in their guilt . Then at last , when they find themselves cast forth isolate by the entire world , their common tragic loneliness draws them to each other . They are given to each other by the world . The insidious purpose of the great Gallehault has been accomplished ; and Ernesto takes Teodora for his own . Echegaray appropriately dedicated El Gran Galeolo to all the world , ? a todo el mundo ; and surely it must be evident from the foregoing summary that no adaptation is necessary to make this drama comprehensible to American audiences . The only feature of it which is at all difficult for Americans to understand is that Don Severo should have so much to say about the conduct of his brother 's household . Spanish ideas of the solidarity of the family are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stricter view than we do of the concern of every member of a family with the behavior of every other member . But this point could easily be carried if the parts of Don Julian and Don Severn were sincerely acted . Nevertheless , for some inexplicable reason , Mr. William Faversham thought it necessary to have the play adapted ; and Mr. Charles Frederic Nirdlinger was employed to tamper with a masterpiece . Mr. Nirdlinger 's dilution is entitled The World and His Wife . A singular thing about Mr. Nirdlinger is that he considers an American audience incapable of imagination . He believes that New York theatre/ goers can not conceive a story as happening so far back as 1881 ; and he therefore brings the drama " up to date " by alluding repeatedly to the Spanish-American war as a thing of the past , and referring to the marriage of Alfonso Xlll . He believes that they can not conceive a story as happening entirely among Spaniards in such a remote city as Madrid ; and he therefore introduces a new character , who is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the leading people of the play are foreigners . How interesting it would be if Mr. Nirdlinger were engaged to improve that ancient and very foreign drama , Hedda Gabler ! Probably he would introduce an American tourist in Christiania , to tell the audience how curiously Norwegian is the Tesman household . And undoubtedly he would make Assessor Brack refer to the recent election of Mr. Taft to the Presidency of the United States , in order to make the audience forget that the play was acted as far back in the unimaginable past as 1890 . The tragic irony of El Gran Galeoto is based , of course , upon the assumption that nobody in all Madrid has any personal motive for defaming the hero and the heroine . The whole point of the play is that the gossip should be idle , careless , without cause . Mr. Nirdlinger so recasts the plot as to make the traducer in the cafe a personal enemy of Ernesto 's , who deliberately foments the current evil rumors in order to satisfy a private grudge . The adapter doubtless thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive ; whereas , obviously , he was robbing it of its one most significant feature . One of the greatest merits of the Spanish original is its absolute unity of mood . It begins seriously ; the action grows more serious as it proceeds ; and the steady march of the drama to its tragic culmination is conducted with a terrible directness . Mr. Nirdlinger deems it necessary to " liven the piece up a bit " ; and every now and then he halts the progress of the play to let his Englishman be funny for a while . But he climbs to the climax of execrable taste when he permits one of the Spanish characters to make repeated puns . Since punning , in the course of dialogue written in English , depends upon the conformation of English words , the convention that the characters are supposed to be talking in Spanish is thus disrupted and destroyed . El Gran Galeoto ought to have been presented in a literal prose translation . Its frequent soliloquies and asides should , perhaps , have been altered or eliminated , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , it would have been inadvisable to attempt to reproduce the verse-form of the original . Spanish dramatic verse is a free and fluent tetrameter , either rhymed or else punctuated  |p543  with assonantal terminations . This form is utterly foreign to the genius of the English language ; and in our own unrhymed pentameter , it would not be possible to give any suggestion of it . The play , therefore , must necessarily have been translated into prose ; but it should have been translated faithfully . The only way to prepare a really great drama for the American stage is to leave it alone . That alert and enterprising manager , Mr. Frederic Thompson , aspires to be the Mr. Crummles of the contemporary stage . If anybody has forgotten who Mr. Crummles was , let him re-read the following passage from Chapter XXII of Nicholas Nickleby : " I dare say I could scribble something now and then , that would suit you , " said Nicholas Nickleby . " We 'll have a new show piece out directly , " said the manager . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and splendid scenery ? you must manage to introduce a real pump and two washing-tubs . " " Into the piece ? " said Nicholas . " Yes , " replied the manager . " I bought ' em cheap at a sale the other day , and they 'll come in admirably . That 's the London plan . They look up some dresses and properties , and have a piece written to fit ' em . Most of the theatres keep an author on purpose . " " Indeed ! " cried Nicholas . " Oh , yes , " said the manager ; " a common thing . It 'll look very well in the bills in separate lines ? Real pump ! ? Splendid tubs ! ? Great attraction ! " Now Mr. Crummles , ? the energizing Mr. Vincent Crummles , ? was the manager who thus set forth his theory of practical theatrics . Mr. Thompson , proceeding in accordance with this theory , has employed a syndicate of playwrights ? their names are Paul Armstrong , Winchell Smith , E. Balmer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Via Wireless , to fit the furnace room of a steel works and the wireless room of a storm-tossed ship at sea . The furnace room is a faithful and photographic copy of a section of the Midvale Steel Works in Philadelphia , " reproduced by permission of the officials . " " Real pump ! Splendid tubs ! " , as Mr. Crummles ejaculated . But the bother is that the things supposed to happen in the mimic furnace room upon the stage are silly and absurd . A gun is being forged which has been invented by the hero ; and the manager of the works has plotted to ruin the invention by getting the master-mechanic drunk and luring him to misdirect the labor . So far , so good : this is material sufficiently true for a melodramatic struggle . But note the climax of the act . The rich and lovely heroine comes , disguised as a working-girl , to see how things are going  |p544  on . For a few minutes she remains in a private office with the manager of the works , and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shut . When she emerges , the hero forgets all about his gun . Although we have been told that she is the one woman in the world whom he most respects and loves , he traduces her virtue and accuses her of meretricious conduct with the manager . This dastardly and lying situation , which year after year is inflicted upon us in play after play , has never before been dragged in so preposterously . To compromise the heroine in the hero 's eyes by the usual expedient of letting him discover her at midnight in the villain 's bachelor apartments is absurd enough ; but when the discovery is made in a steel works at the busiest hour of the twenty-four , the mind of the hero is shown to be not only prurient and obnoxious , but insane . In the next scene the heroine meets the hero , after an extended inter .. val . Does she despise him , and treat him with the contempt that he deserves ? Not at all . He is a dear and noble fellow ; and she loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely that he ever accused her of being the mistress of the manager . She never mentions the matter ; and the hero , regarding it doubtless as a mere slip of the tongue , does not deem it necessary to apologize . This single instance illustrates not unfairly the worthlessness of this entire entertainment , considered as a reflection of life . The characters are not real people , the incidents are not true ; and the whole piece is uninteresting , for the simple reason that it is impossible to believe the story . Most of the principal puppets are wrecked in a storm while cruising in a yacht . This disaster is narrated to us at second hand , by means of wireless messages exchanged between the sinking yacht and a coasting liner , the scene being set in the wireless room of the latter ship . In sheer mechanical dexterity this scene is marvellous . The heaving of the ship amid the hurly-burly of the storm , and the excitement of the wireless operator as he directs the work of rescue by flashing messages into the turbulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it does n't matter in the least whether the people in peril are saved or drowned , for the simple reason that they have no real existence . Since they have never elicited our sympathies , we can not care about their fate . This is what comes of holding np the mirror to a ship at sea instead of to the minds and hearts of men and women . Mechanism is desirable upon the stage , whenever it is used to illustrate life . But to employ mechanism for its own sake is futile . Nothing is dramatic in the universe but human beings .  |p545  Mr. Paul Armstrong reveals himself to somewhat better advantage in Blue Grass , a racing drama , which he wrote alone . It is not necessary to summarize the story of this piece , which is the same as that of every other racing play . Blue Grass must win a certain race , because every one we care about has staked his future happiness and fortune on this favorable result , and every one we hate has plotted that another horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last act of a racing play if the villain 's horse should be triumphant : undoubtedly this hypothetical concluding act would be of interest to Mr. Hughes . In one or two plays , of which the best remains Saloany Jane , Mr. Armstrong has exhibited ability to create simple and homely characters , to write real talk , and to touch the heart with sentiment and pathos . These genuine and worthy gifts he displays again in Blue Grass . The gentle atmosphere of a Kentucly home is lovingly suggested . There is a deal of pleasant sentiment , and quiet , touching pathos . Many of the characters are real , ? the negroes , in especial , being wisely and naturally depicted . Except for some unfortunately artificial writing in the love scenes , the dialogue is simple and true . The first scene of the third act is structurally superfluous , Localise it merely tells the audience all over again what they knew already at the close of the preceding scene . The piece has other technical defects , such as a lack of motivation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , on the whole , a pleasing entertainment ; and in a genial and sympathetic way , it holds the mirror up to a few real phases of humanity . The second entertainment from the pen of that facile and prolific playwright , Mr. W. Somerset Maugham , that has been imported to America this season , is a comedy entitled Lady Frederick . This is , on the whole , a better play than Jack Straw ; but it reveals no abilities on the part of the playwright which were not already evident in the earlier piece . Mr. Maugham is not an author of importance ; he has nothing to tell us about life ; but he has the pleasing gift of being playful , and the engaging merit of writing with brilliancy and ease . Lady Frederick Berolles is a charming and clever adventuress of somewhat shady reputation . A young lord falls in love with her . In fear lest he should marry Lady Frederick , the young lord 's mother sends hastily for her brother , to help her to avert the threatened indis/ cretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventuress of old ; in fact , he once had been in love with her . Paradine and Lady Frederick engage in a battle of wits , wherein the former is shown to be both sportsmanlike and clever , and the latter is revealed as a feminine good-fellow , thoroughly fair and likable . As a result of the encounter , Lady Frederick resolves that Paradine shall have his way . She invites her boy lover to call upon her in her boudoir in the morning , and submits him to the disenchantment of watching her at her toilet . With genial exaggeration , she paints her face , appends false hair , and thereby suggests that her accustomed beauty artificially conceals an unalluring plainness . The young gentleman is cured of his infatuation ; and Lady Frederick ultimately marries Paradine . All of this material is , of course , familiar . In Robertson 's David Garrick , in Reade 's Nance Oldfeld , and in many other stock plays of an earlier period , the scene of disillusionment is developed in a similar way from a similar motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maugham . In the case of agreeable theatric situations , familiarity breeds content . The people of this pleasant story are conventional theatric types instead of real characters . But the piece is fluently and brightly written ; there are many witty lines ; and the action moves with graceful gaiety and engaging merriment . It is very , very seldom that the critic can charge a play with the defect that it resembles life too closely ; but that is the sole objection that may be made against Salvation Nell , by Mr. Edward Sheldon . It represents with sedulous exactitude the sordid life of the New York slums . In all of its multitudinous details the piece is marvellously accurate . In photographic fidelity to fact it is beyond all praise . But the mirror which Mr. Sheldon has held up to nature is an ordinary flat reflector . It lacks the concavity which concentrates , and the magic which selects . Nell Sanders is first disclosed as a scrub-woman in a cheap and vile saloon . Her lover , Jim Platt , is a loafer and a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns ; and when he is sent to prison for a murderous assault upon another ruffian , she is left without resources in the world . A jocund prostitute tempts her to take up a life of shame ; but instead she seeks shelter with the Salvation Army . We next see her eight years afterward , when she is toiling with the army of regeneration , and bringing up her child , and Jim 's . Jim is released  |p547  from prison and conies to her . From him the child evokes no fatherly affection . He urges Nell to run away with him , on the proceeds of a diamond robbery lie is planning to commit . She seeks to withhold him from this crime , even offering him herself as an alternative . But immediately she revolts from him , in a sudden physical revulsion , and he rushes out to join his pals . However , his purpose weakens and he does not commit the robbery . Later he hears Nell preaching in the streets . his heart is touched ; and the play closes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing new about this story of regeneration , except that Mr. Sheldon never lies about it . His play is free from maudlin sentiment and mawkish moralizing . It is not even asserted at the end that Jim Platt 's reformation will be lasting . The language of the dialogue is at all points both literal and real . The play is the product of unsquinting observation ; the author sets forth life as he has seen it , without evasion and without compromise . This is an extraordinary merit , but it carries with it a concomitant defect . In actual life , events proceed in chronological succession rather than in logical series , and a strand of story is always inters angled with irrelevant incidents . Life is episodic ; it lacks intelligent arrangement . These defects of actuality are shared by Mr. Sheldon 's play . It is wobbly in structure , rather than straightforward . Much of it is sprawling and digressive . Details irrelevant to his central story are introduced merely because they have the look of life . The whole thing lacks selection and arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of nature than a work of art , and renounces what Goethe would have said was its sole excuse for being . Mr. Sheldon graduated last June from Harvard University , and is at present only twenty-two years old . His accuracy of observation is a rare and wonderful gift , and this his first play must be recognized as a remarkable effort . But it is to be hoped that , as his mind develops , his present passion for actuality will mature into a more imaginative contemplation of those implicit truths of life which defy the observation of the eye . A similar lack of selective and constructive imagination is displayed in the performance of the Sicilian Players in the melodrama entitled Malia or , Sorcery , by Luigi Capuana , a professor in the University of Catania . A peasant girl named Jana , who is engaged to marry Ninu , is overcome with love for Cola , who is about to marry her sister Nedda . Throughout the wedding festivities , Jana shows herself  |p548  inexplicably sick at heart . Afterward she wilts and withers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants think her a victim of sorcery , and invoke the aids of superstition and religion to free her spirit from its sad subservience . At last , in a scene with Cola , she breaks down , reveals her love for him , assails him with sudden overwhelming violence of passion , and then succumbs to an hysterical convulsion . Her betrothed , discovering Jana 's love for her sister 's husband , seizes a razor from an itinerant barber and cuts the latter 's throat . This story of primitive passions is set forth savagely , with no artistic attempt at imaginative simplification and interpretation of the theme . The nervous hysteria of Jana is rendered not pathetically , but merely pathologically . Consequently it excites horror , instead of stimulating terror . The performance is an exact representation of uncivilized emotions ; but it is not an illuminative presentation of tragic motives . Undoubtedly it is like the life of Sicily , in certain of the sinister and revolting aspects of the latter ; but it is not , in a big sense , like life at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a faithful and accurate reflection of a certain sorry phase of nature ; but there is , alas ! no magic in the mirror .
