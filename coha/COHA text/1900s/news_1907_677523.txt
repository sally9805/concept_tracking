txt Another Court House Site . I wish to submit my idea of the proper place for the new court house . Instead of building it on Union Square , a court house covering several blocks might be erected on the site bounded on the north by Duane Street , on the east by Centre Street , on the south by Chambers Street , and on the west by Broadway . Have Reade Street closed and divide the land as follows : Next to the Hall of Records erect a municipal building to extend to Duane Street , with an " L " extension to Duane and Centre Streets . Then erect a new court house , allowing a space of 50 feet to the end of the building line . The Court house could be of any desired height , the municipal building to be raised to the height of the new Singer Building .
