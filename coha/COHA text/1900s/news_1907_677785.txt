txt Documentary evidence has just been discovered in Fairfax County , Va. , to prove that George Washington was once " presented " by the Grand Jury of that county for . not entering certain , property for taxation . The presentment was made at the May term of the Fairfax County Court in 1760 . As the offense charged involved swearing to a false list of tax-1 able property , believers in the hatchet-and-cherry-tree tradition may console themselves with tho fact that there is no record that George Washington was ever convicted under this presentment . The discovery of this record was made by Capt . S. R. Donahoe , editor of The Fairfax Herald , the weekly paper of Fairfax Court House , while seeking data for a history of the county , which he is engaged in writing . Capt . Donahoe had occasion to make rigid examination of the ancient records of the County Court , and there in the musty depths of pages yellow with age , he unearthed a day or two ago , to his great surprise , evidence that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering his property for taxation agreeably to law , an offense which involved the making of a false oath . On page 463 of the volume entitled " Liber A , " the minute book of the court , Capt . Donahoe found the . report of the Grand Jury of Fairfax County , Colony of Virginia , rendered to the court on May 21 , 1760 ; and there , in company with presentments and indictments for landing Quakers , the following : " We present George William Fairfax , George Washington , John Carlyle , Daniel French , Robert Bogges , Catesby Cocke , Townshend Dade , ? Sylbill West , Garrard Alexander , J. Emima Minor , William Ramsay , Benjamin Grayson , George Mason , John Plummer , Daniel McCarty and Abraham Barnes for ( not ) entering their wheeled carriages agreeably to law , as appears to us by the list delivered to the clerk of the county . " The word " present " as used in this report carried in those days only a slightly different meaning from that of the word " indict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old laws of the Colony of Virginia , " said to-day the Hon. Walter T. Oliver of the Virginia Legislature , a prominent lawyer of Fairfax , " provided for criminal proceedings in two ways-by , indictment or by presentment . In case of indictment the King 's Counsel initiated the prosecution , bringing the facts before the Grand Juu , who then reported an indictment - t0-  ? - thaTFL'OUrt-  " ? 41 ; n1 " case " -of-presentinent , . however , the-Grand Jurors.proceeded " on ' their ' own - ihitiatiVe ' without the assistance or intervention of the counsel . " They summoned witnesses , and if to the Minds of the twelve the facts showed the suspected person guilty of a crime the case was presented- ' to the court , whereupon proper writs of apprehension were issued for the accused and the King 's counsel was ordered to prosecute the case. - So that , as far as the legal signification of the word means a grave criminal charge by . an authorized jury ' present ' has , in this instance , the same force as ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that an owner 's failure to ' enter ' any property should have been dealt with as -a crime rests upon the meaning of the word ' enter ' in the formal presentment . Under Colonial law an owner , unless he was willing to permit the county officials to make a schedule of his taxable property , made out a list of it himself . As a property holder he was presumed to be a man of responsibility and truth . Nevertheless , to protect the public revenues against fraud the law provided that subjoined to the list of property should be the following oath , taken by the owner : " ' I , ? , do solemnly swear that the property entered in the foregoing list is all , both real and personal , subpect to taxation of which I am seized and possessed in the county of ? , in the colonly of Virginia . ' " This oath was duly made and attested before an authorized official . The offense of swearing falsely to a property list , while perjury , was made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus it was that Washington was criminally charged , not with perjury , but with not ' entering ' certain property . " In short , the greatest of Americans was believed on judicial inquiry and examination . by twelve men of his county to he guilty of what is to-day termed " tax dodging . " Yet he was in good company . The William Fairfax " presented " with him was a nephew of the great Lord Fairfax , whose possessions would have easily blanketed half a dozen German principalities , and the George Mason , caught in this judicial dragnet was afterward the great Mason , the author of the celebrated Bill of Rights " and the bosom friend of Thomas Jefferson . The tradition that Washington was of fl daily charged with swearing to a false tax list for the purpose of evading the payment of taxes has been passed around the gossipping circles of the sleepy old village of Fairfax : or all the generations Of the last century . But until it was proved to be true by Capt . Donahoe 's discovery , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the necessary gossip reactionary against the laudeTVerfection of Washington-the protest of human nature against something over-displayed as a model and rebuke to the weaknesses of ordinary man . According to the reports , say the good citizens of Fairfax , Washington was haled up before the Court some half-dozen times for this offense . The particular record referred to here , however , has only this single case . It is unfortunate that there are no records left of the result of this proceeding . This book alone of all the records survives , and its experience is one of interest . When in the conflict between the States the armies of the North swept through the village of Fairfax , the Union soldiery pillaged the historic old Court House building and burned or hare away as spoil of war every volume and record it contained . After Appomattox , Fairfax County , one of the oldest in h/storY , tradition , and record of all the counties In that historic Commonwealth , and to start over without one vestige of the records of her former life . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sate keeping on the advance of to Bull Run , was preserved . Abount ten years ago : the Clerk of the county was astonished to receive the lone volume . " Liber A , " from a citizen of Pennsylvania , who ' stated in explanation that as administrator of the estate of a Northern soldier lately deceased the book had coma into his hands . It had been taken as a trophy by the dead man while campaigning in Virginia , but the executor and the dead man 's family now considered it right that it should be returned to the owner , Fairfax County . This is the only volume of all the old records that has ever been recovered . It is a huge volume containing about twelve hundred sheets of foolscap paper , or rather paper of the general style of foolscap , but two or three inches larger , bound in heavy leather covers , made , as things were made in those days , as though to stand the wear of ages . The records are in the scholarly script that characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the paper is- faded and crumbling with age the ink is still clear and the presentment e Washington by the Grand .
