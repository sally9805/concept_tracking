txt // The members of the Convention met at Jefferson City on February 28th and organized , by all members taking the oath of office to support the Constitution of the United States and " of the State of Missouri . " They adopted the rules of a previous convention ; elected , on motion of Jas . O. Broadhead , Gen. Sterling Price permanent chairman ; resolved to continue their sessions at St. Louis , and made their resolutions , taken thus far final , by laying a motion for reconsideration on the table ; this latter was carried by a vote of 65 to 30 , showing the ruling tendency of the convention . After this , the convention adjourned to St. Louis , into an atmosphere more favorable to the Union cause . Shortly before , on Friday , February 15th , the Legislature tried to tune the convention by passing Mr. Vest 's anticoercion bill , which emphatically stated that , upon the invasion of any State , " the people of Missouri will instantly rally on the side of their Southern brethren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last extremity . " This resolution may to some extent have influenced public opinion , but had no binding force upon any one member of the convention , nor its decisions , which upon the questions at issue were the supreme law of the State . However , events must be related now which exercised an influence upon the transactions of the convention . NATHANIEL LYON . During the Kansas troubles , a military officer stationed in that Territory called at the li ssouri Democrat office , to settle his subscription . Daniel M. Houser , one of the proprietors , met him and expressed his gratification to find among the very conservative element of the army an officer who would support the radical tendency of the Missouri Democrat , to which remark the officer replied with great earnestness : " Every possible means should be exhausted before another Slave State is admitted into the Union . " This man was Captain Nathaniel Lyon . When it became evident that change in the command at the St. Louis Arsenal was absolutely necessary , D. M. Houser suggested to a conference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who arrived at the St. Louis Arsenal with eighty men , Infantry , not as a stranger , but as a well-known , resolute , uncompromising Union Tim mid a Free Soiler , notwithstanding that he had been a Democrat , favoring free trade . // Lyon was born July 14 , 1818 , at Ashford , Conn. ; graduated at West , Point in 1841 ; distinguished himself in the Mexican War and was breveted Captain August , 1847 , and afterwards served with distinction against the Indians in California . The picture he makes of himself at the time is highly interesting : " Growing old , but not ashamed of it ; proud , perhaps , but not haughty ; prudent , it may be , in worldly affairs , yet not crafty for wealth ; desirous enough for fame , but not infuriated with blind ambition ; and in general , taking the world as it comes , enjoying richly its many blessings , sympathizing with the unfortunate , and laughing with the indifference of cool philosophy at the sore disappointments with which selfishness and cupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Democrat and a supporter of Franklin Pierce , : und , while on leave , spoke in favor of his election . While at Washington lie took great interest in the debates of Congress upon the Kansas-Nebraska issue , and these debates crystalized his opinion and strongly enlisted his sympathies in favor of the oppressed race . Sent to Fort Riley in 1854 , during the animated discussion sprung upon Congress by the Kansas and Nebraska Act , he espoused the cause of the Free Soil party with all the fervor of an earnest soul . A few extracts from his letters will show his disposition . He writes on larch 2d , 1855 : " It is fully apprehended that the aggressions of the pro-Slavery men will not be checked till a lesson has been taught them in letters of fire and blood . " In December of the same yeas Lyon writes : " I have seen so much of the overbearing domination of the pro-Slavery people in Kansas toward the Free State men , that I am persuaded that the latter have either to fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " . " I despair of living peaceably with our Southern brethren , without disgraceful concessions , but rest assured that this will not always he , and in this view I foresee ultimate sectional strife , which do not care to delay . " In another letter he names Jefferson Davis , - at Ilse lime Secretary of War , a heartless villain . The partiality of Buchanan 's administration for the pro-Slavery Marty in Kansas disgusted Lyon to an extent that he seriously considered his resignation from the army rather than to enforce Ilse lees of the limited Slates in Kansas , arguing that he " could not submit too the self-debasement and humiliation of being employed as n tool in the hands of evil rulers for the accomplisment of evil 1 52 The Cloion Cause in St. Louis in 1861 . Lyon writes front Fort Scott , to which place he was sent Ly Gen. Varney to head off Montgomery with the aid of Frost 's ; Missouri Militia : " January 27th , 1861. -1 do not consider troops at all necessary here , and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of contributing to stay the idiotic fratricidal hands now at work to destroy our Government . . . . It is no longer useful to appeal to reason , but to the sword , and trifle no longer in senseless wrangling . I shall not hesitate to rejoice at the triumph of my principles , though this triumph may involve an issue in which I certainly expect to expose and very likely shall lose may life . .1 , would a thousand times rather incur this than recall the result of our presidential election . - We shall rejoice , though , in martyrdom if need be . " It was an " Ave libertas , moriturus to salutam " ( Hail liberty ! fated to die. , I greet thee I " ) . A. few days later Lyon 's company was ordered to St. Louis . Si mead describes Lyon as 4 ; i years old , less than medium height , slender and angular , with abundant sandy hair , reddish-brown beard , deep-set blue eyes , rough and homely features , and weatherbeaten aspect ; while Peckham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature slender and proportionally well built , with large forehead spreading above , clear deep-blue eyes , face narrow , hair and beard sandy . : Both descriptions are correct . There inlay be added to them that Lyon 's features had a thoughtful and keen cast . and trade the impression of a nervous disposition . Ile was a diligent student of classical literature and history , and an admirer of the deeds of great Incr . Personal experience and past events shaped Lyon 's convictions , which were to serve the highest aims of humanity . For hint the flag of the United States was the symbol of that tendency , . and his determination was that it should wave in triumph over the North American Continent . How clear Lyons mind was upon the great issues of the day , his own words show : " I do not see how war is to be avoided . Under quack management it may be long and bloody ; yet if have no apprehension about the final triumph of Almighty Truth , though at the cost of many unnecessary sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flames , from its center to its remotest borders , than that the great rights and hopes of the human race should expire before the arrogance of the secessionists . Of this , however . there is no danger // They ( the Secessionists ) are at war with nature and the human heart , and can not succeed . " Arrived at St. Louis Arsenal February 6th , 1861 , Lyon asserted his right to command , being an older Captain than Hagner . The latter was sustained , however , by Harney and the President , because Magner had been breveted Major . It was said that Lyon made the claim because he distrusted Hagner , who associated with Southern sympathizers , and whose wife was a slave-holder 's daughter . Lyon certainly was convinced of the justice of his own claim , or he never would have made it . He established the closest relations with Blair and other influential Union men , who said that he had been sent to them , as it were , by Providence . " His clear intellect and great energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of the regular army , with its strict discipline and punctilious system of order , it was no easy task to be called to the head of many organizations of a heterogeneous nature , which on all sides were rapidly springing into life ; nor could he have done it without the efficient aid of many able , experienced and cultured men of St. Louis , nor without the devotion of the Union population , which stands without a parallel in the annals of our History . On February 16th the garrison at the Arsenal was reinforced by 203 mein , to which , a few days later , 102 were added , bringing the force stationed there to 484 men . Harney had reported East that there never was a danger of an attack upon the Arsenal , and if an attack should be made , the garrison would be promptly rescued by an overwhelming force from the city . This latter conclusion of Varney was correct , but not the premises , for the Secessionists certainly had the intention and would have improved any chance to capture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vote on members of the Missouri State Convention on February 1 ( ( 8th , defeating every Secession candidate , destroyed all hope of support from the irresolute , noncommittal portion of the community , which at best was an unknown quantity . The vote on . the Convention members had a depressing influence upon the Secessionists , but neither they nor the Union men did for a moment relent in their efforts to prepare by all possible means for the coming conflict . To remedy theunsatisfactory condition of affairs at the Arsenal , F.P Blair went to Washington slopping off on his way at Spring // field , Illinois , to see the incoming President . Lyon wrote to Blair on February 25th a long letter , specifying all grievances , which , among other things , is also memorable for the latitude of expression which an American officer used about his superior officer . Part of the words referred to are : " The announcement of General Scott that the command belongs to Major Hagner , is his own decision and done in his usual sordid spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toadies . " Lyon states in this letter that the fine stone wall surrounding the Arsenal should be used for defense by preparing scaffoldings from which to fire , having sand bags ready to protect artillery pieces , which would sweep the outside faces of the walls ; also to put up traverses inside , and place a battery to clear out intruders inside the walls ; further , to mine the buildings for blowing them up if they could not be defended ; to form a battery towards the Mississippi , or Arsenal Island . and the opposite shore . Major Hagner objected to all these preparations , wanted to admit the enemy unopposed inside the wall , and only to defend the main buildings . Captain Lyon in his letter designates TIagner 's plan in his terse diction : " This is either imbecility or villainy . " IIe ends the letter with the words : " If I should have command . I would have no trouble to arm any assisting party , and perhaps , by becoming responsible for the arms , etc. , I Plight fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ; but most I concern myself with a view to sustain the Government here , and trust to such measures as may be found available . Yours truly , N. Lyon . " Two days before this letter , an article appeared in the Missouri Democrat , representing the defenses of the Arsenal much stronger than they actually were , with the evident intention of deterring Secessionists from attacking the same . A few days later , on March 1st , the Commissioner of Georgia , Luther J. Glenn , arrived at Jefferson City to invite Missouri into the Southern Confederacy . Notwithstanding the overwhelming ITnion vote of the State , Governor Jackson introduced him lo a meeting , and reiterated that the honor of Missouri required her 10 stand with the Confederate States and to join them , should Lincoln make war on the South . Both Houses invited Mr. Glenn to address the members of the Legislature , but his speech did not elicit any specific action of lint body . Glenn had the satisfaction of a serenade // and of witnessing that some members of the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Post Office . The St. Louis State Convention met at the St. Louis Mercantile Library hall on March 4 and organized by electing Sterling Price President , with 75 out of 99 votes . On May 3 the Minute Men raised the flag of Missouri on the Courthouse dome , which , being unauthorized , was taken down by the Custodian . The same parties raised a Secession flag on Berthold 's building , Fifth and Pine , the Minute Men 's Headquarters . A Union flag was raised on the opposite building by Tony Niederwieser , his brother and other Union men . Crowds gathering in the street , commenced to cheer their respective flags , and a chance shot might have precipitated a fearful street fight ; but passions had not reached that fever heat , which disregards all danger and all consequences . The Union men in the street were prevailed upon to defer action to a more propitious time . Rumor brought this excitement in connection with a very improbable scheme to capture the Arsenal . On the 4th of March the spirit of the Secessionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small for such an enterprise , and the chances could not be improved by starting a street fight two and one-half miles away . CHAPTER V. THE APPROACHING STORM . DRIFTING TOWARDS WAR . In the meantime , seizures of United States property went on lustily in the South . On the 3d of January Fort Pulaski , near Savannah ; on the 4th , the Arsenal , near Mount Vernon , Alabama ; on the 5th , Fort Morgan and Gaines , guarding the approaches to Mobile ; on the 6th , the Arsenal at Apalachicola ; on the 7th , Fort Marion , near St. Augustin , was seized ; it was also officially stated that Virginia was already then prepared to arm 25,000 troops . A day of national humiliation , fasting and prayer was proclaimed at Washington , but a less peaceful spirit prevailed next day at many places in the North , where salutes were fired in approval of Major Anderson 's removal to Fort Sumter , which , in fact , was an act of the plainest military duty . Delegates from South Carolina now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them only as private citizens , and also informed them that he would defend Fort Sumter . Upon this information , the delegation of private citizens left unceremoniously for home . On January 5 the " Star of the West " left New York harbor with men and munitions of war for Fort Sumter ; the same day the Senators from Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , Texas and Arkansas met at Washington and advised their States to secede , and to organize a Slave-holding Confederacy . This action was incorrectly attributed to the President 's answer to the citizens of South Carolina , likewise to the sailing of the " Star of the West . " The Senators , as part of the Government , were in daily and direct communication with the President , and did not need any outside information . It may be taken as a self-evident axiom in - History that great events have great causes . The profr , iliiliiy is that the South Carolina delegation was sent to Washington f .. hasten the call for the Slave-holding Confederaition , a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of December , an anticoercion resolution was tabled in the House of Congress by a vote of 98 to 55 , and later a resolution was passed , approving Major Anderson 's removal to Fort Sumter and promising support to the President for all his constitutional measures for the preservation of the Union . A bill introduced by Bingham of Ohio in the . House , empowering the President to transfer the Collector 's office , if need be , on board of a war vessel , was supported by 103 votes against fit , which. , not being the two-third vote requisite under the rules , had to lay over and was never reached . There was no use in President Buchanan 's asking Congress to enact laws , which would give hind power to perform his duty , when the votes of his party friends and Southern sympathizers could block such legislation . The compromise measures still pending were probably the greatest hindrance to energetic action . In times of general excitement men : nay be led to odd notions . Fernando Wood , Mayor of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of New York City , recommended to the Common Council , early in January , to consider the advisability of seceding from the State and the Union . As he stated himself , this step may not be necessary if the Legislature and Congress will bring the desired relief by the repeal of objectionable laws and the restoration of corporate rights . It is not recorded whether the steel-nerved and clear-headed business men of New York only smiled at this odd . Suggestion or laughed outright . This exceeded even the dreams of those political visionaries that hinted at the possibility of a separate Northwestern , Pacific or Western Union , in addition to the Southern Confederacy . When the " Star of the West " arrived before Charleston harbor it was fired upon . from the Batteries of the Secessionists , which had been erected to reduce Fort Sumter and to defend Charleston . The surmise that the mission of the " Star of the West " had precipitated the war , had no foundation in fact , for the Cotton States were bent on Secession , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the solemn duty of the President to maintain the Arsenal and Forts of the United States in a defensible condition . Nor was it very inaterial who commenced hostilities ; for , with the disposition of the people of both sections of the Union , war was iueV I II e . The shot . tired at the " Star of the West " was only the I , il drop , which oiade the bucket ove.rilovV . The response from the // North came quick , in accents which could not be misunderstood . Already , on the 11th of January , the Legislature of New York passed a preamble recounting all treasonable acts in the Cotton States , specifying the " firing into a Government vessel , ordered by the Government to convey troops and provisions to Fort Sumter , " and stating that by this act " the Cotton States virtually declared war . " The Legislature resolved to support and preserve the Union unimpaired , and closed with the emphatic words : " Renewing the pledge given and redeemed by our fathers , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred honor to upholding the Union and Constitution . " The Legislatures of Pennsylvania , Ohio , Illinois , Wisconsin , and Minnesota passed similar resolutions , and Governor Andrews of Massachusetts ordered the enrollment of all militiamen to be ready for field service , on the call of the President . In the meantime the disintegrating process went on in the South . January 9 Mississippi and on the 10th Florida seceded and occupied the barracks at Pensacola , while Lieutenant Slemmer transferred the United States forces from the mainland to Fort Pickens . On the 10th the Arsenal at Baton Rouge , and on the 11th Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson , in Louisiana , were seized , and the same day Alabama seceded and invited all Slave-holding States to send delegates , to meet in convention February 4 at Montgomery , in order to consider pleasures for their common peace and security . On January 19 the Legislature of Virginia voted one million dollars for arming and equipping the Militia , and resolved : " That if all efforts to reconcile the differences between the two sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor and interest demanded that Virginia should unite her destinies with those of her sister Slave-holding States . " About the same time both the Legislatures of Tennessee and Kentucky passed anti-coercion resolutions and threatened to resist every invasion of their territory made by the Federal Army for the purpose of keeping the seceded States in the Union . ALEXANDER STEPHENS ' GREAT EFFORT . In Georgia the example of the seceding States was sorely felt . I is leading Statesman , Alexander Stephens , was opposed to all hasty action , and stated that Secession should be conditioned on 1'n , si 1 ( 1I Lincoln 's actions , or on the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law . vIlicit could not take place before . the new Congress assembled StephenThe // held civil war the greatest curse that can befall a free people , and pointed at improper motives , saying : " Some of our public men have failed in their aspirations , that is true , and from that comes a great part of our trouble , but , for all that , he would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of January he made the effort of his life before the Georgia State Convention , and the strongest and ablest argument that ever was made against Secession . This speech , more than any other circumstance , proves how strong State rights patriotism , and love for accustomed home associations , must have been in the ' South , that , notwithstanding his views of the madness of Secession , Stephens could cling to his native State , even in its folly , and dignify what he knew to be a lost cause by accepting the Vice-Presidency of the Confederate States . Shortly before Stephens had said : " Our institutions constitute the basis , the matrix from which spring all our characteristics , " and he knew that the institution of Slavery had so shaped Southern pride , passion and domineering ambition ; knew that the excitement of the recent political campaign had so inflamed Southern sentiment that the people there would not even listen to , far less consider , the wisest counsel . And , still , Alexander II . Stephens , known as the clearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a final appeal to l prevent the Secession of Georgia , and thus addressed the Convention : " This step ( Secession ) once taken , can never be recalled ; and all the baleful and withering consequences that must follow , will rest on the Convention for all coming time . When we and our posterity shall see our lovely South , desolated by the demon of war , which this act of yours will inevitably invite and call forth ; when our green fields of waving harvest shall be trodden down by the murderous soldiery and fiery car of war sweeping over our land ; our temples of justice laid in ashes ; all the horrors and desolations of war upon us ; who but this Convention will be held responsible for it ? and who but him who shall have given his vote for this unwise and ill-timed measure , as I honestly think and believe , shall be held to strict account for this suicidal act by the present generation , and probably cursed ; Ind execrated by posterity for all coming time , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now propose to perpetrate ? Pause . I entreat you , and consider for a moment what reason you can give that will even satisfy yourself in calmer moments , what reasons you can give to your fellow sufferers , in the calamity that it will bring upon its . What reasons can you give to the nations of the earth to justify it ? They will he the calm and deliberate judges in the case ; and what cause or one overt act can you name or print on which to rest the plea of just Illeat ion ? What right has the North assailed ? What interest of the South has been invaded ? What justice has been denied ? and what claim // founded in justice and right has been withheld ? Can either of you today name one governmental act of wrong , deliberately and purposely done by the Government of Washington of which the South has a right to complain ? 1 challenge the answer . While on the other hand , let me show the facts ( and believe me , gentlemen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here the friend , the firm friend and lover of the South and her institutions , and for this reason I speak thus plainly and faithfully for yours , mine and every other man 's interest , the words of truth and soberness ) of which I wish you to judge , and 1 will only state facts which are clear and undeniable and which now stand as records , authentic , in the History of our country . When we of the South demanded the Slave trade , or the importation of Africans for the cultivation of our lands , did they not yield the right for twenty years ? When we asked a three-fifths representation in Congress for our slaves , was it not granted ? When we asked and demanded the return of any fugitive from justice , or the recovery of those persons owing labor or allegiance . was it not incorporated in the Constitution , and again ratified and strengthened by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 ? But do you reply that in many instances they have violated this compact , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local communities they have done so , but not by the sanction of Government ; for that has always been true to Southern interests . Again , gentlemen , look at another act : when we have asked that more territory should be added that we might spread the institution of Slavery , have they not yielded to our demands in giving us Louisiana , Florida and Texas , out of which four States have been carved , and ample territory for four more to be added in due time , if you by this unwise and impolitic act do not destroy this hope , and , perhaps , by it lose all , and have your last slave wrenched from you by stern military rule , as South America and Mexico , or by the vindictive decree of a universal emancipation , which may reasonably be expected to follow ? But again , gentlemen , what have we to gain by this proposed change of our relation to the General Government ? We have always had the control of it , and can yet , if we remain in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have had a majority of the Presidents chosen from the South , as well as the control and management of most of those chosen from the North . We have had sixty years of Southern Presidents to their twenty-four , thus controlling the executive department . So of the judges of the Supreme Court . we have had eighteen from the South , and but eleven from the North ; although nearly three-fifths of the judicial business has arisen in the Free States , yet a majority of the Court had always been from the South . This we have required so as to guard against any interpretation of the ( ' unstitution unfavorable to us . In like manner , we have been equally watchful to guard our interests in the Legislative branch of Government . In choosing the presiding Presidents ( pro tem ) of the Senate , we have had twenty four to their eleven . Speakers of the House , we have had twenty-three and they twelve . While the majority of the Representatives , front their greater population , have always been from the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he , to a groat extent , shapes and controls Ili ' legislation of the country . Nor have we hail less control in every other // department of the General Government . Attorney-Generals we have had fourteen , while the North had but five . Foreign Ministers we had eightysix , and they but fifty-four . While three-fourths of the business which demands diplomatic agents abroad is clearly from the Free States , from their greater commercial interests , yet we have had the principal embassies , so as to secure the world markets for our cotton , tobacco and sugar , on the best possible terms . We have had a vast majority of the higher offices of both array and navy , while a larger proportion of the soldiers and sailors were drawn from the North . Equally so of clerks , auditors and comptrollers , filling the executive department , the records show for the last fifty years that of the 3,000 thus employed we have had more than two-thirds of the same , while we have but one-third of the white population of the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , be assured , in which we have a great and vital interest ; it is that of revenue , or means of supporting Government . From official documents , we learn that a fraction over threefourths of the revenue collected for the support of Government has uniformly been raised from the North . " Pause now while you can , gentlemen , and contemplate carefully and candidly these important items . Look at another - necessary branch of the Government and learn from stern statistical facts how matters stand in that department . T mean the mail and post-office privileges that we now enjoy under the General Government , as it has been for years past . The expense for the transportation of the mail in the Free States was , by the report of the Postmaster General for the year 1860 , a little over $13,000,000 , while the income was $19,000,000 . But in the Slave States , the transportation of the mail was $14,716,000 , while the revenue from the same was $8,001,026. leaving a deficit of $6,704,974 to be supplied by the North , for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off from this most essential branch of Government . " Leaving out of view for the present the countless millions of dollars you must expend in a war with the North , with tens of thousands of your sons and brothers slain in battle and offered up as sacrifices upon the altar of your ambition and for what ? we ask again . Is it for the overthrow of the American Government , established by our common ancestry , cemented and built up by their sweat and blood , and founded on the broad principles of Right , Justice and Humanity ? And as such I must declare here . as I have often done before , and which has been repeated by the greatest and wises of statesmen and patriots in this and other lands , that it is the best and freest Government ? the most equal in its rights , the most just in its deelsious. the most lenient in its measures , and the most aspiring in its principles , to elevate the race of men that the sun of heaven ever shone neon . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this , under which we have lived for more than three-quarters . of a century  --  in which we have gained our wealth , our standing as a nation , our domestic wifely while the elements of peril are around us , with peace and tranquility accompanied with unbounded prosperity and rights unassailed ? is the height of madness , folly , and wickedness , to which I can neither lend my sanction nor nay vote .. , // It was all in vain . Georgia seceded January 19 , 1861 . Of the means used to bring this about Colonel ' I. T. Gantt , a State Rights man and Democrat , stated in the Missouri State Convention : Most infamous falsehoods were sent over the telegraph in order to precipitate the passage of the act of Secession by the Convention . It was reported , through the telegraph , that the Federal Government had sent an army to Charleston ; that operations were commenced by the bombardment of that city ; that old men , helpless children and women were being slaughtered by the hundreds ; that the-city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannous Federal executive . " Had Georgia voted down Secession , probably no more States would have followed in the wake of South Carolina , and the leaves of History would have recorded less heroism and more compromises . Frail roan must bow to the wisdom which governs the Universe , though he often may not comprehend it . As early as January El , Governor Pickens demanded from Major Anderson the surrender of Fort Sumter . The Major reported this to Washington , where Southern Senators requested the President not to reinforce Fort Sumter . To these Senators the President intimated , through the Secretary of War , J. Holt , that no hostile action is intended by him towards the State of South Carolina , and that the transfer of Major Anderson 's Command to Fort Sumter was for protection of United States property , and purely a defensive measure , and that , when needed , Fort Sumter will be reinforced . On the last day of January Colonel Hayne , pursuant instructions from Charleston , demanded the surrender of Fort Sumter . President Buchanan refused to comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant for such action , and closed his reply with the words : " If the authorities of that State ( South Carolina ) shall assault Fort Sumter . . . and thus plunge our common country into the horrors of civil war , then , upon them and those they represent , must rest the responsibility . " It seems President Buchanan could have made short work of the civil war had he acted with the same decision as President Jackson did under similar circumstances . TILE PEACE CONFERENCE AND SCHemes . The same day on which the Peace Conference called by the Stale of Virginia met at Washington , namely , February I , the delegates // of the seceded States also met at Montgomery , Alabama , adopted a few days later a provisional Constitution , and elected Jefferson Davis President and Alexander Stephens Vice-President of the Confederate States of America . The coincidence of these dates sounds almost like a mockery of fate at the exertions of men . Commissioners appeared to the Peace Conference from the Governors or Legislatures of thirteen Northern and five Border States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the States further South . John Tyler , exPresident of the United States , was made Chairman . The Conference lasted thirteen days ; its recommendations , similar to the Crittenden resolutions , were of little practical value , for both the House of Representatives and the Senate rejected them . The Commissioners which the Confederate States had sent to Washington in February , to treat with the Federal Government upon the establishment of friendly relations , met a similar fate . Shortly afterwards , Jefferson Davis was inaugurated , and called out 1 ( 10,000 Volunteers for military service ; anticipating the first Union call by two months and exceeding it by 25,000 men . The same time , General Twiggs , at San Antonio , Texas , was surrounded by General McCulloch and compelled to surrender , also in Arkansas , which had riot yet seceded , the Arsenal and Totten 's Battery were seized , notwithstanding the protest of the citizens of Little Rock . All over the South , military organization was energetically pushed , and on March I General Beauregard took command of the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South some of their representaI Ives in the United States Congress and Cabinet held to their offices o i t l i the avowed purpose of crippling the United States Goverment . Senator 1 ) . L. Vulee of Florida wrote in a letter dated January 7 , I 11 1 : - By remaining in our places until the 4th of March , it is thought we can keep Mr. Buchanan 's hands tied and disable the Republicans front effecting any legislation which will strengthen the hands tied of thee incoming Administration . " Among such measures was o , by Jefferson Davis , who stayed in the United States Senate till limitary ' ' l , obliging the President to withdraw all United States force , upon request of a State Legislature or Convention ; also one to authorize a Slane to keep troops and a navy . Hunter of Virginia offered a resolution directing the President , upon the request of It Stale , to retrocede jurisdiction . The sane offered a resolution I. sic-peed the laws for the collection of Revenue in South Carolina // or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without being able to state that they would be acceptable to his own people . The most characteristic was a resolution offered February 11 by B. Craigs of North Carolina , proposing that as " South Carolina , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Mississippi and Louisiana have seceded and established a Government under the name of the Confederacy of the United States South , " that " the President of the United States is required to acknowledge the independence of said Government and to receive Ambassadors or Commissioners appointed by it , for the purpose of amicably adjusting the matters . " This was not reported back from the Committee . Less dangerous than these machinations were some meetings of conservative people at New York and Boston ; at the meeting held at Faneuil ' fall even Edward Everett advocated a peaceful separation . These meetings had hardly any effect locally , and none whatever in the Union . In the last days of the session a substitute to a resolution of the Committee of Thirty Three was offered by T. Corwin : Article XIl . " No amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere with Slavery . " This passed the House , and on March 2 passed the Senate , but did not change matters in the least . All these compromise measures were supported by the conservative Democrats North and South ; they were at best a makeshift for a short period . Republicans were opposed to concessions by which the Secessionists were to be bribed to remain loyal to the Union . Lincoln himself condemned such a policy , as his own language , quoted in the New York Tribune , January 30 , 1861 , proves : " I will suffer death before I will consent or advise my friends to consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege of taking possession of the Government to which we have a constitutional right . " Lincoln 's TOURNEY TO WASHINGTON . Such were the grave circumstances under which Lincoln left Springfield , 111. , on February 11. after taking a pathetic leave from his fellow-citizens . On his journey eastward he met the greatest enthusiasm everywhere ; at Indianapolis the Legislation adjourned to greet him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chords of the people at Cincinnati , at Columbus , Cleveland , // Buffalo , Albany , New York and Harrisburg . At Philadelphia , Lincoin hoisted , with his own hands , the United States flag over Independence Hall and said , as if his spirit was dimmed with regard to the immediate , yet prophetically clear in the distant future : " I have often inquired of myself , what great principle or idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long together . It was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the mother land : but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence , which gave liberty , not only to the people of this country , but I hope to the world , for all future time . It was that which gave promise , that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men . This was a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence . Now , my friends , can this country be saved on this basis ? If it can , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I can help save it . If it can not be saved on that principle , it will be truly awful . But if this country can not be saved without giving up that principle , I was about to say , I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it . Now , in my view of the present aspect of affairs , there need be no bloodshed or war . There is no necessity for it . I am not in favor of such a course , and I may say , in advance , that there will be no bloodshed unless it be forced upon the Government , and then it will be compelled to act in self-defense . " Could Lincoln hope that there would be no war ? Seven States had already separated and more were on the threshold of Secession . The peal of hostile cannon which drove the United States boat " Star of the West " from Charleston harbor reverberated all over the Union , and men were marshaling in military array at the North and at the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Border States , were not heeded at all in the Cottoll States , and rejected with a sullen determination by the great majority of the people at the North . At Philadelphia the President-elect was warned that there was a " Ionic laid to start a riot while he was passing through Baltimore , and that he was to be assassinated during the confusion . The programme of the journey was therefore changed , and he passed Cllr a gll Baltimore one day earlier and arrived in Washington on ll ' morning of February 23 . A Committee of the House of Repre-4ullllives had reported in January that Militia companies were ol'p , , nlizl 'll I'roln foriuer political clubs in Maryland , to hinder the of military companies through that State . A few days before Lincoln 's arrival at Washington , Secretary of War J. Holt reported in answer to COngressional inquiry inquiry , that , while troops at Washington were few they can preserve the peace at the Capital . // Early in January the seizure of the Capital was planned ; the statement made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rumors that were corning from different sources and statements made in Congress that Lincoln should not , or could not , be inaugurated at Washington , also indicated maturing plans for its capture , which Southern journals openly advocated . Residents became disquieted and 1 embers of Congress insisted upon precautionary measures . Consequently sufficient military force was concentrated to meet any emergency that might arise , particularly as it was the duty of the outgoing President to secure his successor a peaceful inauguration . The presence of troops for securing this object could only be offensive to those who desired to destroy the Government . LiNCOLN 'S INAUGURATION . In keeping with the above views , Secretary I Iola and General Winfield Scott , the Commander of the United States Armies , assembled a larger force at Washington . By the 4th of March the city was crowded with strangers from all parts of the country . An imposing escort led and followed the carriage in which President Buchanan and Lincoln were conveyed to the East Front of the Capitol . Surrounded by the Senators , Judges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign Ambassadors and at immense concourse of people , the President-elect took his position upon the platform , greeted by the enthusiastic cheers of the masses . At his side stood Senator Stephen A. Douglas , holding his hat , giving by his presence and attitude an ominous warning to the South that the Northern Democracy will stand by the Union . In his address Lincoln again . uttered words of kindness and conciliation , but also defined his first purpose , that the laws of the counttry must be obeyed . With reference to Secession he said : " We can not separate , we can not remove our respective sections from each other , nor build an impassable wall between them . The different parts of our country can not but remain face to face , and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between them . Is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous , or more satisfactory after separation than before ? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws ? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fight always , and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either , you cease lighting , the identical questions as it i terms oI ' intercourse are again upon you .. // " I shall take care that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States . The power confided to me will be used to hold , occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government and collect the duties and imports ; but beyond what may be necessary for this , there will be no invasion , no using of force against or among the people anywhere . " With a pathetic appeal to the memory of common battlefields and patriot graves , the President-elect closed . The oath of office was administered by the Chief Justice , and , with the sane imposing escort . Abraham Lincoln drove to the White House , while the people cheered and the cannon boomed . Did any one dream then that , for four long years , storming Battalions and rushing Squadrons would re-echo those cheers on more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would for years resound over the fertile fields of this Union , intended by Providence to be an Eden of Liberty , and that half a million of graves would soon mark the strife and over a million of orphans and widows would soon weep in consequence of the omissions and commissions of their ancestors ? THE SECESSION CONSTITUTION adopted March 11 , 1861 , by the Convention of the Confederate Slates of America , was substantially the United States Constitution with some changes , such as the " One-term " principle and six years ' term of President and Vice-President ; African Slavery in old and new States ; no protective Tariff ; no bounties ; the privilege of Heads of Departments to discuss questions in Congress ; separate items Veto in appropriation bills , and sonic special provisions securing property in slaves . Jefferson Davis was elected President and Alexander Stepheus Vice-President . The latter in addressing a large meeting at Savannah , came out squarely and acknowledged the cause of Secession . Ile said , with reference to Slavery : This was the immediate cause of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast , had anticipated this as the rock upon which the old union would split . " He was right . What was conjecture with him ha now a realized fact . But whether he comprehended the great truth upon which the rock stood and stands may be doubted . The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were , that the enslavement of the African wee In violation of the laws of nature , that it was wrong in principle , socially , morally and politically . It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with ; hut the general opinion of the men of that day was , that somehow or other , In the order of Providence , the institution would be // evanescent and pass away . . . . Those ideas , however , were fundamentally wrong . They rested upon the assumption of the equality of the races . . . . Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas ; its foundations are laid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not equal to the white man ; that Slavery , subordination to the superior race , is his natural and normal condition . This , our new Government , is the first in the history of the world , based upon this great , physical , philosophical and moral truth . " These candid expressions of Alexander H. Stephens , VicePresident of the Confederacy , frankly show the drift of mind peculiar to Southern Statesmen . Denying equal rights , the only possible basis of a democratic republic , they hide their aristocratic tendency behind the screen of race prejudice . It was , however , of late , no doubt , not only the first , but also the last attempt , to found a State on Slavery . In the light of latter days , there was a bitter irony in the words of Stephens , possibly unbeknown to himself . LOYALTY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE CONVENTION . President Lincoln 's peaceful inauguration at Washington reacted upon the Missouri Legislature , which , after a spirited debate , refused to pass the bill for arming the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thE Mercantile Library the day of Lincoln 's inauguration , the eyes of many of its members while passing were directed to a Secession flag on the Minute Men 's Headquarters , which the eloquent Uriel Wright described as having only one star and one crescent in a blue field , and which was not his flag , and in his enthusiasm for the Star Spangled Banner made the following beautiful quotation : " When freedom from her mountain height Unfurled her standard to the air , She tore the azure robe of night , And set the stars of glory there , She mingled with its gorgeous dies , The milky girdle of the skies , And striped its pure celestial white With streaking of the morning light . Then from his mansion in the skies , She called her eagle-bearer down , end gave into his mighty hand The symbol of her chosen land . // Nevertheless , very soon afterwards , Major Wright did some tall fighting in the Confederate Army . Shortly after reassembling , Luther J. Glenn , Commissioner of the seceded State of Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His proposition was referred to a Committee with John B. Henderson as Chairman . At this session H. R. Gamble called for a Committee on Federal Relations now existing between the Government " of the United States , the Government and people of the different States , and the Government and people of this State . Great many resolutions introduced by members were referred to t If Committee ; they covered a wide range : for the Union ; against coercion ; for State Rights ; for the Crittenden resolutions ; for a Western policy ; for withdrawing Federal garrisons from forts in seceded States ; denying the right of Secession ; for a Border States policy , and others . With regard to the mental complexion of this Convention , it must be acknowledged that , while it was a brilliant assembly in experience , capacity and activity , very few of its members were in sympathy with the Free Soil principles , indorsed by the majority of the nation , ii ; the recent election ; most of the members were still under the influence of their Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench and the rostrum , and only few men among them had emancipated themselves from the thraldom of habit and custom , and were resolved to face the issues upon their absolute merits . These few were considerate , tempered their expressions with patience and forbearance , acknowledged by vote the patriotism of Douglas Lund Crittenden , though not believing in the latter 's proposition ; they followed their chief aim with perseverance and moderation , and eventually secured from the Convention an unqualified expression the Union and against Secession . Broadhead , Hitchcock , Breel ( ( inridge from the city , llenderson , Hall and Birch from the gun fry , used uncontrovertible arguments and gave correct interpret : t ions of the United States Constitution , and thus formed a solid 1 - is to build upon , while considerations of safety , possession . progress Mid development , powerfully aided to bring about a correct HIM ion . Judge Gamble 's legal authority , great circumspection and personal popularity most happily guided the policy of the Convention and even his anti-Free Soil position position , advanced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Con  --  // vention , was not in accord with the majority of the members . His selection was no doubt made to influence the Secession element in the State , but , although he said in taking the chair , " It mnay require a lifetime to retrace one false step , " the example he set later was rather encouraging in the wrong direction . His rulings as Chairman were prompt and fair , but his usual voting with the " very conditional Union " minority in the Convention , left the impression that he abided his time to become a very unconditional Secessionist . This great popularity-in-the State , his military capacity and resolute character would have saved Missouri and the Union a great many sacrifiees had he espoused the Union cause . This disposition of the Chairman had the effect that , towards the end of the Convention , the important committees were elected by the members . Statistical information also greatly aided the Union argument . The Census of 1.8,50 gave Missouri 5 ) 0,000 Slaves and 500,000 free . white inhabitants ; ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was only 112,000 , while that of free white . inhabitants more than doubled , reaching 1,100,000 , comparatively speaking , very few of whom . were Slave owners . The taxable property in Missouri in 1850 was 136 millions and iii 1.860 360 millions . Such a development would have ended Slavery in Missouri iu a few decades . The historian , John C. Moore , bitterly characterizes a large fraction of the Convention and of Missouri 's political men : " The conditional Union men were an . unknown quantity . They sometimes acted with the Secessionists , and sometimes the unconditional Union men , but were not true to either for any considerable length of time . They represented the wealth and the commercial and manufacturing interests of St. Louis and the larger towns of the State , and changed their tactics constantly to suit their interests : On account of the wealth ( ( uid high character of their leaders , their Southern birth and association , and the weak and hesitating policy of the Southern leaders , they had great influence . " The partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the Convention . On March 9 Judge ( bauble , on behalf of the Committee on . Federal Relations , made the following statement upon the cause of Secession : " The origin of the difficulty is rather in the alienated feelings existing between Northern and Southern sections of the country , than in the actual injury suffered by either ; rather in the anticipation of future evils than iu the pressure of any now actually endured . . . . It is true that a secThe // tional political party has been organized at the North , based upon the idea that the institution of Southern Slavery is not to be allowed to extend itself into the Territories of Slavery into the Territories of the United States has been organized and has for the present obtained possession of the Government , is to be deeply regretted . " Notwithstanding these ultra conservative views , which partly were not on a level Nviih the progressive political development in the Union , Judge Gamble and his Committee , loyal to the instructions of the great majority of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued as follows : " To involve Missouri in revolution under the present circumstances is certainly not demanded by the magnitude of the grievances of which we complain nor by the certainty that they can not be otherwise and more peacefully remedied , or even diminished by such revolution . " The position of Missouri in relation to the adjacent States , which would continue in the Union , would necessarily expose her , if she became a member of a new Confederacy , to utter destruction , whenever any rupture might take place between the different republics . In a military aspect Secession and connection with a Southern Confederacy is annihilation of Missouri . " The true position for Missouri to assume is that of a State whose interests are bound up in the maintenance of the Union , and whose kind feelings and strong sympathies are with the people of the Southern States , with whom we are connected by the ties of friendship and blood . . . . To go with those States ? to leave the Government our fathers builded ? to blot out the star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ruin ourselves , without doing them any good . We can not follow them , we can not give up the Union , but will do all in our power to induce them to again take their places with us in the family from which they have attempted to separate themselves . " For this purpose we will not only recommend a compromise with which they ought to be satisfied , but we will endeavor to procure an assemblage of the whole family of States , in order that , in a General Convention , such amendments to the Constitution may be agreed upon as shall permanently restore harmony in the whole nation . The resolutions recommended by the Committee on Federal Relations , Itl adopted by the Convention held : 1 . There is at present no adequate cause to secede . 2 . The Union shall be perpetuated and harmony restored . 3 . The Crittenden amendments are recommended . 4 . A convention of all States shall propose amendments to the United States Constitution . // 5 . Coercion will cause civil war ; therefore the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be withheld and stayed . 6 . The Convention should adjourn to December 3 , 1861 , or be subject to a call of an appointed Committee . A minority report from the Committee on Federal Relations presented a more partisan Southern view , but justly held that amending the Constitution of the United States would require at least 18 months , while remedies sought must be immediate . It opposed coercion , favored the Crittenden resolutions and advocated a Border State Convention . Judge Gamble 's majority report prevailed , with the anti-coercion clause couched in the terms of a cherished desire for its prevention . Of St. Louisans Bridge , Broadhead , Busch , Eitzen , Hitchcock and How voted against even this mild objection to coercion . The Convention was fully informed how matters stood in St. Louis , for on the 20th of March Isidore Bush stated , on behalf of " the thousands of German citizens whom I have the honor to represent , " that " should a conflict be inevitable , your German fellowcitizens will stand by the Government and by the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the Committee for Federal Relations , for on March 18 Judge Gamble reported a resolution to send seven delegates to the Border State Convention called by Virginia . This concession to the conditional Union men was a most dangerous measure , which might have created a Border States combination , hostile to the Free Soil policy , the expressed will of the nation . The danger was imminent that a Border States combination might lead to a neutrality declaration fatal to the Union . There was , however , in this last resolution a very material divergence from the recommendations of the minority report ; the latter proposed a Border Slave State Convention , to frame a collective proposition , which was to be presented to the Northern States for their acceptance or rejection , which , in its very nature , implied a threat ; while Judge Gamble 's proposition also sent delegates to a Border Slave State Convention , but with the limitation to consult only about measures to be taken to pacify the country , and to report the conclusions back to the Missouri Convent ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Convention , through the report of J. B. Henderson 's Committee on Luther J. Glenn 's Secession proposition from Georgia . This report , clear , concise , logical , took up the phases of Secession in their ethical , political , commercial and strategical relations , and proved beyond all doubt that the interests of Missouri are and must be with the Union . This report exercised a great influence upon the wavering and undecided in and out of the Convention . Defeated amendments proposed to Judge Gamble 's report bore evidence that at least two-thirds of the members of the Convention were now unconditional Union men , who , although desirous of using all possible means to pacify the seceded States , did not favor the Secession of Missouri under any conditions . After an animated debate , the report and resolutions presented by Judge Gamble 's Committee were adopted by a very decided majority , and the Convention adjourned , subject to the call of a majority of the Committee selected for that purpose . If an armed neutrality could have been established by the Border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the actual Secession of all or of either of those States . The threat of their Secession in case coercion was attempted , was only a threat , for the cooler and more considered men in those States knew very well that the moment any of the Border States declared for Secession it would be treated as an enemy , overrun from all but one side by Union Armies , and could even be made to bear the expense of the war necessary for its reconquest . The real defeat of the Secession cause in the Missouri Convention lay in the circumstance of that body 's refusal of an armed neutrality or conditional resistance . Undaunted by this check , the Secessionists of Missouri proceeded w i t h their organizations , under various names and pretexts , but all with the one purpose , of joining the Secession Armies of the Southen ' Confederation . The unconditional Union element of St. Louis Was likewise convinced that war was inevitable , and diligently proceeded with perfecting military organizations . An unfavorable decision by the Convention would have only inflamed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Legislature and the State at large were ehielly urged by Price , Jackson , Reynolds , Rains , Vest , frost , Churchill , I reenn ; ua , Clavborne and Harris , all of whom were soon // prominent leaders in the Secession Armies , notwithstanding that the State , by a very large vote , had declared against Secession , the St. Lotus Union men were certainly warranted to anticipate their hostile organizations and to disarm as many of then ' as they could . The spirit which dictated the oath of the Missouri State Militia prescribed by the new military bill can be best judged by Governor Jackson 's declining to issue a commission to Captain George L. Andrews of an Engineer Compnoiy of the National Guards , because Andrews had added to that oath a declaration of his paramount allegiance to the ' Government of the United States in case of any conflict with the State of Missouri . 11 is evident that the oath of the Missouri State Militia was already a stepping stone to Secession . LEGISLATURE TRIES TO CURB ST . LOUIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Green for United States Senator , because he was considered an avowed Secessionist , and elected Waldo P. Johnson as a Union man . Green took no part in the war , while Johnson resigned his scat in the Senate and joined the Secession Army . Upon St. Louis affairs , Snead , the Governor 's Secretary , writes : " The powerful semimilitary organization of Home Guards " ( nearly all Germans ) " sustained the Republican Mayor , it had therefore become a matter of supreme importance to the Secessionists to take this great power from the Mayor , and accordingly a law was now enacted for creating a Board of Police Commissioners . " This bill passed the Senate March 2 , the I louse March 23 . By it four Commissioners were appointed by the Governor , with the consent of the Senate , who , with the ) Mayor , formed a Commission , having absolute control of the police , the Volunteer Militia of St. Louis , of the sheriff and all other conservators of the peace . Snead says : " It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When the resolution of the State Convention for calling a Convention of all the States to frame amendments to the United States Constitution came up before the Missouri Legislature , Vest , as Chairman of a Committee , reported upon it adversely , abusing the Convention in strong terms and very illogically remembered the blood of his two grandfathers , who , during the war for indepependence , fought for our liberties and the establishment of the Federal Union , and not its // destruction . Vest at the time exclaimed , " I will never , never , never submit to Northern rule and dictation . " Vest 's subsequent long and useful career as United States Senator from Missouri proved beyond doubt that he was mistaken in his youthful ardor of 1861 , notwithstanding that the General Assembly indorsed his sentiment and adopted his report , declining to call a Convention of all the States . On March 28 the Missouri Legislature adjourned , the members sought their homes and constituencies , many with a purpose of organizing troops and the intention of transferring their activity from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel G. Taylor , Democrat , was elected Mayor by 2,658 majority over John How , the unconditional Union candidate . This was claimed a reaction in the sentiments of the citizens , who , on February 28 , elected an unconditional Union ticket by over 5,000 majority , but Taylor was deservedly popular , as his considerate administration under trying circumstances proved ; besides this , the issue in April was purely local ; the know-nothing element voted against the Republican foreigners , and the clearest heads lost interest in local politics when it became quite sure that the bullet would supplant the ballot . The police were then under the control of the Secessionists , Basil Duke , James H. Carlisle and Charles McLaren , and the Anti-Coercionist , John A. Brownlee . One of the first acts of the Police Commissioners was an attempt to induce Captain Lyon to withdraw his sentinels from outside the Arsenal walls . This proved to be an idle bluff ; for Captain Lyon informed them politely that he would not withdraw his sentinels , but , on the contrary , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exparte " police was shown at a meeting of Union men at Flora Garden , where an officer , a ) duty was peremptorily ordered to leave the hall . Captain Lyon was not in the least intimidated by the hostile police , and said that in case of need he would issue arms to Union men , law or no law , and if Hagner interfered he would pitch him into the river . Thus forethePolice Commissioner became active in the direction of least resistance , and issued a number of orders , chiefly regulating the colored population . Meetings of colored people were prohibited , t h e i r e ve i i i n g church service stopped , their saloons closed ; Free Negroes and lii al toes had to leave the city by April 24 ; Slaves were not permit led to ; isseioble or hire out their own time , and policemen had to be uresenI during their ehureh service .

THE DAWN OF RELIEF . The repeated representations to Washington from F. P. Blair and other Union men had at last the effect that Captain Lyon was assigned to the command of the troops and the defenses of the Arsenal . Of this he was notified March 19 by Order 58 : " In compliance with Special Order No. 74 , War Department , Adjutant General 's Office , dated March 13 , 1861 , assigning to Captain N. Lyon , Second Infantry , the command of the troops and defenses of this post , the undersigned turns over to Captain Lyon all command and responsibility not appertaining to the commanding officer of the Arsenal and his duties as an officer of Ordnance . By order of Major Hagner . " M. N. WRIGHT , " Lieutenant and Post Adjutant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet the exigencies of the case ; for it left Captain Lyon dependent upon Major Hagner 's opinion , and Lyon 's wants , that might arise on the spur of any moment , were subject to requisitions that had to be approved by General Harney , who , right or wrong , doubted the necessity of any preparations for defense . The incongruity of the arrangements was evident to friends of the cause , and strong representations went to Washington to mend matters . Serious doubts were expressed about Mayor Hagner 's capacity , even about his good will , which was freely discussed in the councils of Union men . Captain Lyon therefore again applied to his friend in need , Frank P. Blair , who was at that time in Washington , and wrote to hilt under date of April 6 : " I have no control of the ordnance department and therefore can not take a single round of ammunition nor a piece of Artillery , or any other firearm , without the direction of General Harney , and in case of an attack various means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not obtain , without taking them forcibly . . . . 1 can not get a hammer , spade , ax // or any needful tool , but upon Major Hagners ' concession . . . . The new organization of the Metropolitan Police system seems to embolden the Secessionists so much as to fill me with deep concern to be prepared for them ; and I am on this account prompted to write you . Of course in all military matters there should be one commander , and no such absurd thing as a division that shall render it liable to an entire perversion of its purpose . . . . Would it not be well for the Secretary of War to order that this Special Order No. 74 , giving me command of the troops and defenses at this post , should have no exception in men and means necessary for this purpose ? " Before Lyon received an answer to the above , the United States Grand Jury called at the Arsenal Gate and claimed admission . The Guard reported to Headquarters , but before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had not been admitted . Captain Lyon explained in the " Missouri Democrat " of April 12 the propriety of the Guard 's action . There were also Secessionists on that Grand Jury , and rumors were ripe in town of espionage in connection with attacks on the Arsenal . The case illustrates the difficult responsibilities which officers have to meet during a civil war . Ix CHAPTER VI . THE WAR COMMENCES . FORT SUMTER . Notwithstanding President Lincoln 's very conservative attitude , matters drew rapidly to a head in the East . John Minor Botts , a Virginian Statesman and Slave-holder , but an uncompromising Union roan , states in his work " The ( treat Rebellion , " that President Lincoln informed him during a private conversation , that he had made through Colonel J. B. Baldwin , a proposition to the Union man in the Virginia Convention , that if that body will adjourn " sine die , " without passing a Secession ordinance , he ( the President ) will withdraw the garrison from Fort Sumter . I. T. Lewis , another Virginian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it from Colonel Baldwin 's own lips . Baldwin , however , later qualified this statement by saying that no specific proposition was made to him by President Lincoln . There is no doubt , however , that the subject was discussed in a spirit of extreme liberality . The news of such intention of President Lincoln spread even to St. Louis , for W. A. Hall of Buchanan stated to the Missouri Convention about the same time , " We know the President is about to abandon Fort Sumter . " In the same conversation the President told that he had sent a vessel with provisions to Fort Sumter , and that on April 8 he had informed Governor Pickens of South Carolina of this mission . Upon this information the Secessionists closed the harbor of Charleston by sinking in its channel vessels loaded with stones , and their President , Jefferson Davis , gave orders to General Beauregard to demand from Major Anderson the evacuation of the Fort , to which the Major replied that the garrison would be starved out by the 15th , and unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leave the Fort . This answer , whose propriety may be seriously doubted , was not deemed satisfactory , and on April 12 , 1861 , Beauregard notified Anderson that ( 178 ) The 1-ur Commences . 179 his Batteries would open fire in an hour , which was actually done from 19 Confederate Batteries . Major Anderson did not answer with his guns until next morning . The bombardment lasted for thirty hours , and over three thousand shots and shells were fired , but , owing to the casemated condition of the Fort 's defenses , no one was hurt . The military honors granted to the garrison were a poor consolation for the surrender . LINCOLN 'S CALL FOR 75,000 MEN . The news of the fall of Fort Sumter was telegraphed from Washington to all loyal States , together with the call for 75,000 men , by the following PROCLAMATION . " Whereas , the laws of the United States have been for some time past and now are opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in the States of South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by law ; " Now , therefore , I , Abraham Lincoln , President of the United States , in virtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution and the laws , have thought fit to call forth , and hereby do call forth , the Militia of the several States of the Union , to the aggregate number of 75,000 , in order to suppress said combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed . " The details of this object will be immediately communicated to the State authorities through the War Department . " I appeal to all loyal citizens to favor , facilitate , and aid this effort to maintain the honor , the integrity , and the existence of our national Union and the perpetuity of popular government , and to redress wrongs , already long enough endured .

" The quota of the State of Missouri , designated in the table which accompanied this letter was four regiments of infantry , being an aggregate of 3,123 officers and enlisted men , including one Brigadier General . GOVERNOR JACKSON 'S TREASON . To this the Governor of Missouri replied by telegraph : " ExECUTIYE DEPARTMENT , JEFFERSON CitY , MO .. April 17 , 1861 . " Hox . SIMON CAMERON , Secretary of War . " Sir : Your dispatch of the 15th instant , making a call on Missouri for four Regiments of men for immediate service has been received . There can be , I apprehend , no doubt but the men are intended to form a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seceded States . " Your requisition , in my judgment , is illegal , unconstitutional and revolutionary in its object , inhuman and diabolical and can not be complied with . Not one man Will the State of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade . Lei rsn . Governor of'Alissourl .. The War Commences . 181 In giving this answer , Governor Jackson disregarded the following provision of the Constitution of the United States : " Article 1 , Section 10 . No State shall enter into any treaty , alliance or Confederation . " Article 6 , Section 2 . This Constitution and the laws of the United States , which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land , and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . " " Article 1 , Section 8 . The Congress shall have power to . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . " " Article 1 , Section 15 . To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions . " Section 16 . To provide for organizing , arming and disciplining the Militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States . " " Article 4 , Section 5 . The Governor shall be Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy of this State , except when they shall be called into the service of the United States . " It is evident from the above quotations that the Governor of Missouri , by refusing to furnish troops legally called out , violated his oath of office to support the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Missouri , and also the laws made pursuant thereof . While the Governors of other Border States , with more directness than dignity , also refused to comply with the President 's call , it was only policy and not law which prevented their impeachment and trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Border States furnished subsequently large numbers of troops , both to the Northern and the Southern armies , Missouri standing at the head of them and St. Louis leading the State . It should be remembered in this connection that when Jefferson Davis asked Jackson to furnish one Regiment for the Confederate service in the East , the Missouri Governor 's answer , given on May 6 , was couched in very polite language , and a conditional . compliance promised by Governor Jackson , who stated that as yet he has to move with great caution . Governor Jackson , however , was far from exercising that great caution , for two days after his refusal to furnish true s for the Union service , namely , on April 19 , he wrote to David Walker . President of the Arkansas State Convention , " Missouri will be ready for Secession in less than thirty days " ( that would have // been within ten days after the capture of Camp Jackson ) " and will secede if Arkansas will only get out of the way and give her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this emergency , Governor Jackson went to St. Louis to consult General Frost and others . Of this , Thomas L. Snead , Confederate historian , writes : " At the conference which they held , some of the most active Secessionists of the city were present . Among them were John A. Brownlee , President of the Police Board ; Judge Wm . A. Cooke , Captain Greene and Duke . They all agreed that the most important and first thing to be done was to seize the Arsenal , so as to obtain means for at once arming and equipping the State Militia . " General Frost was to draw a memorial , how this was to be done . The strongest evidence that Camp Jackson , which was formed later , was only the marshaling of Secession forces under the di guise of the name of State troops is contained in a letter of General Frost to Governor Jackson , dated April 15 , 1.861 , in which he recommends to the Governor , among other things : 1 . To call the Legislature together at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable you to suppress insurrection or repel invasion . 2 . To send an agent to the Governor of Louisiana ( which had already seceded , January 26 ) , or further if necessary , to ascertain if mortar or siege guns could be obtained from Baton Rouge . or other points . 3 . To send an agent to Liberty , Missouri , to see what is there and to put the people of that vicinity on their guard ; to prevent its being garrisoned , as several United States troops will be at Fort Leavenworth from Kearney , in ten or fifteen days from this time . 4 . Publish a proclamation to the people of the State , warning them that the President has acted illegally in calling out troops , thus arrogating to himself the war-making power ; that he has illegally ordered the issue of the public arms to the number of 5,000 to societies of the State who have declared their intention to resist the constituted authorities , whenever these authorities may adopt a course distasteful to them , and that they ' are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort in his attempts to subjugate by force of arms a people who are still free ; but , on the contrary , that they should prepare themselves to maintain all their rights as citizens of Missouri . 5 . Authorize or order the commanding officer of the present military district to form a military camp of instruction ( Camp Jackson ) at or near the City of St. Louis , to muster military companies into the service of the State , to erect batteries and to do all things necessary and proper to he done , to maintain the peace , dignity and sovereignty of the Stale . The people of Missouri . // Regarding this subject , T. L. Snead , the Governor 's Secretary , writes : " On the same day that the Governor refused to comply with the requisition for troops , he sent Captains Greene and Duke to Montgomery , with an autograph letter to the President of the Confederate States , requesting him to furnish those officers with the siege guns and mortars which General Frost wanted for the proposed attack upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia upon a similar errand . " Every one of these measures shows the plain intention of defeating the Union cause and of aiding the seceded States . It does not alter the case that on May 10 , when General Frost saw that he was in the jaws of the lion , averred that no hostility to the United States was intended . To " repel invasion " of United States troops coming to Missouri ; to ask for mortars and siege guns from a seceded State at war with the Union ; to forestall the protection of the Arsenal at Liberty , Mo. , by United States troops , by putting " the people of that vicinity on their guard " and instigate them to plunder it beforehand ; to charge the President of the United States that he has acted illegally in calling out troops " for the protection of United States property and United States citizens , " could have only the meaning of hostility to the United States and an affiliation with Secession . The St. Louis press reflected the impression which the capture of Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after denouncing coercion , said : " The seceding States can never be conquered . " " No one doubts , we apprehend , the ability of the Confederate States to defend themselves against any force which Mr. Lincoln may send to attack them . " On the 16th of April the same paper wrote : " We make , no doubt , that there are fanatics , and fools and vagabonds enough in tile North who , collected together , might make a good-sized army in point of numbers . " What a prophetic foresight , considering the 500,000 men of the Union Army and the circumstance , that one of the vehement proprietors of the St. Louis Republic wore the Federal uniform as a Colonel of a Regiment before the war ended . Even as conservative a man as Colonel William F. Switzler of the " Columbia Statesman " was tarried away hy the impulse of the moment , and urged the Border States . " Let them stand as a wall of fire between the belligerent extremes . . Let them stand pledged as they now // are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and if the war shall actually occur , we shall stand by Virginia and Kentucky , and our Southern sisters . " Sound policy may dictate to a public man or to the press , care , moderation or at times even silence , but it does not warrant the use of threats , which are not intended to be carried out . The proclamation of the President calling out 75,000 men was received at the North with the greatest enthusiasm ; hundreds of meetings were held from East to West , and patriotic telegrams approving the course of the Administration poured in from all sides . The leader of the Northern Democracy , Stephen A. Douglas , called on President Lincoln and offered his services in the gigantic task of restoring the Union . Mr. Blaine said the assault on Fort Sumter consolidated public sentiment at the North and brought the whole people to the determination to re-establish the authority of the Union . It is said within fifteen days of the call for 75,000 men fully 350,000 offered their services . So much is certain that within 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fort Sumter was heralded as the strongest fortress in the seceded States , and its surrender filled the Secessionists with undue confidence in their own military capabilities , and they never reflected that this success was secured with war material seized from the Union , and that the South had very scant means to reproduce that material . HARNEY SEES DANGER . By the 16th of April General Harney revised his views regarding the Arsenal , for he writes to General Scott : " The Arsenal buildings and grounds are completely commanded by the hills immediately in their rear , and within easy range , and I learn from sources which I consider reliable , that it is the intention of the executive of the State to cause Batteries to be erected on these hills , and also upon the island opposite the Arsenal . I am further informed that should such Batteries be erected , it is contemplated by the State authorities , in the event of Secession of the State from the Union , to demand the surrender of the Arsenal . " " The command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and thirty enlisted men . While this force would probably be able to resist successfully an assaulting party greatly superior to itself in numbers , it could not withstand the fire of Batteries situated as above indicated . Under these circumstances I respectfully ask instructions for my guidance . " The War Commences . 18a Lyon must have doubted the reliability of aid from that quarter , for he writes under the same date to Governor Yates of Illinois to secure the service of the six Regiments , the Illinois Quota , and asks Yates to make from hit ( Lyon ) a requisition for arms . In consequence of this Lyon was ordered to deliver to Governor Yates 10,000 stand of arms with accoutrements and ammunition . About this same time the Union men in Frost 's Brigade held a consultation and withdrew from that organization . In fact , some left it already a second time , like Captains Tony Niederwieser and Fred Schaefer , who were prevailed upon by General D. M. Frost to rejoin the command with their Companies of Jagers on foot and mounted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General D. M. Frost , for he must have known that the two officers mentioned above were decided Union men who would not likely be subservient to his aims , as professed in his letters to Governor Jackson . But the keenest apprehensions were felt on account of an order by General Scott that Captain Lyon should appear before a court of inquiry at Leavenworth on the 15th of April . In time of civic commotion every untoward measure is readily laid ' at the door of jealousy , evil intention , scheme , intrigue or even treason ; and se was this move attributed by some to ultra conservatives by others to outright Secession machinations . The legal axiom , " cui prodest ? " ( whom will it benefit ? ) found here also a broad application . Fortunately , General Scott was prevailed upon to revoke the order , General Harney now directed Major Hagner to provide Captain Lyon with everything he may need for a thorough defense of the Arsenal . Consequently loopholes were cut in walls , banquettes raised , batteries prepared , buildings undermined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Arsenal perfected . There was free and frequent intercourse between the members of the w lnion organizations in the city and Captain Lyon , who assured them that in case of necessity lie would furnish arms to the Union men upon his own responsibility . CHAPTER VII . ORGANIZATION . ON TO WASHINGTON . The President 's call for men roused the entire North and was a step in the right direction , which ended all pusillanimous compromises . True , the 75,000 men were considered inadequate to the emergency . This was voiced by Governor Koerner of Illinois , who pointed to the example of small Switzerland calling out 150 , - 000 men and squelching with the same its Secessionist Cantons within a few weeks . While the Secessionists shouted " On to Washington , " the Virginia . State Convention passed on April 17 a Secession Ordinance . This was done in secret session in order to seize Fortress Monroe , the Navy Yard at Norfolk and Harper 's Ferry before proper means for their defense could be secured by the Federal Government . With 3.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ferry . Lieutenant Jones of the United States Array burned its stores and with his 43 men retreated to Carlisle . Nearly ten million dollars ' worth of war material was at the Norfolk Navy Yards . The United States steamer Pawnee with 700 men landed at Gosport . removed large quantities , spiked the heavy guns , of which there was a very large number , and destroyed by fire all that could be reached . Soon after the Confederate General Taliafero occupied Norfolk and closed the harbor by sinking vessels laden with stones . Fortress Monroe , being well fortified and guarded , was beyond the reach of the Secessionists ; but at Washington a feeling of unsafety prevailed and Cassius M. Clay organized a militia force to control rowdies and incendiaries . The sentiments at the South at this period are best characterized by the words of Secretary Walker of the Confederates , who was cheered by an immense crowd at Montgomery . Alabama , when lie said , Hiding hi the Secession bunting " The flag w 111 ( .11 now f h ) 11111 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol at Washington before the first of May , and it may eventually float on Faneuil Hall itself . " Events , however , that happened at the same time in the North and near Faneuil Hall were apt to disappoint such sanguine expectations . When on April 15 a telegram reached Boston from Washington calling for help , Governor Andrews of Massachusetts dispatched orders to the neighboring towns , and already on the 16th three companies from Marble Head arrived and marched to Faneuil hall . Troops now poured in from all sides and as early as the 18th of April , the Sixth Massachusetts Volunteers left Boston for Washington and the Third and Fourth Regiments left by steamer for Fortress Monroe , while the same evening 400 Pennsylvania Volunteers and three Companies of Regulars occupied the Washington Capitol . Next day , the 19th of April , the last hundred men of the Eighth Massachusetts , passing Baltimore in cars , were attacked by a mob . The Bay State men got out , formed on the sidewall .. fixed bayonets and forced their way to the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wounded , they fired and dispersed the mob . It was on the anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1776 that the first blood was also shed in the Civil War of 1861 . The same day General Butler left Boston for Washington with the Eighth Massachusetts , and the next day the Fifth and a Company of Light Artillery starts for the same place . On the 21st the Sixth Massachusetts arrives at Washington , and on the 22d the Seventh New York and the Eighth Massachusetts at Annapolis . The latter Regiment , numbering a great many mechanics , repaired the railroad to Washington and enabled the Seventh New York to reach that city on the 25th . The next day , the Twelfth and Seventy-first New York passes to Washington , and the Fifth , Eighth and Sixty-ninth gets to Annapolis . May 2 the Rhode Island Flying Artillery is received by Rhode island Infantry on Pennsylvania avenue , and the day after Elsworth 's Fire Zouaves enter the city . These rapid moves . show the energetic spirit of the Northeasterns , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well appointed Militia . Similar enthusiasm and energy prevailed in all Northern States , though not with the same chances of offering immediate aid to Washington ; but the AM ( ' facts prove the sagacity of the Missouri Governor , v1h1 ) ener elinuily organized the Stale Militia , to be used in the cause of Secession . // UNION MILITARY ORGANIZATION IN ST . LOUIS . The political campaign of 1856 , and still more that of 1860 , consolidated the anti-Slavery elements in St. Louis with the Republican party . These elements in their main constituent parts were a limited number of Americans from Eastern and Northern States , who came here already with strong ethical convictions of the wrong of Slavery ; also Americans who came to Missouri from the Mountain Districts of Border and Southern States and who never had an interest in the peculiar institution , likewise the more cultured or political immigrants of Ireland and the overwhelming mass of the other European immigration , by far the largest number of which came from Germany . These last , by their great numbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican party in St. Louis . At that time most of this European immigration sought the hospitable shores of America from a love of free institutions , and looked at the Federal Union as the embodiment of the most perfect Government on earth . Fleeing themselves from the oppression of privileged classes and hereditary possessive prerogatives , they were natural foes to any kind of similar relations on this continent . Liberty was for them a religion , and the very name of Slavery was sufficient cause in their eyes to condemn everything and everybody connected with it . St. Louis had grown from the small hunter and trapper colony of the year 1785 from 500 inhabitants to double that number in 1800 ; in 1810 to 1,400 ; 1820 to 4,000 ; 1830 to 5,000 ; 1840 to 16,000 ; 1850 to 78,000 : 1860 to 185,000 . It will be noted that the decades after 1830 and 1840 , which included the two great political immigrations , show the relative greatest increase in this heterogeneous population . Political Ward Clubs , campaign companies , nominating conventions brought these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom of speech at public meetings led to strong marching organizations , such as the " WideAwakes , " under Colonel Jas . Peckham on the Republican , and the " Broom Rangers " and other companies , on the Democratic side . These companies , neatly uniformed , marched in good order to their respective meetings , added dignity by their appearance and increased the audiences and the safety of the speakers . 11-though these companies were not armed , their lampsticks and // broomsticks might have been readily exchanged for muskets . In this sense they fostered a military spirit and prepared the inhabitants for the latter organizations . To stop party jealousy , a meeting on January 11 at Washington Hall , called for the formation of Union Clubs all over town . It was quite natural that the great majority of their members were Republicans . Iai February Union Guards were enrolled at Washington Hall . Third and Elm , Darby 's building , Fifth and Olive , and in more or less private meetings at Turner Hall , Filley 's foundry , Farrar 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winkelmeyer 's Brewery , Ruedi 's and Flora Garden and a number of other places . There are lists published of about 750 names , but no organic connection between the separate clubs is in evidence , and a legal foundation , system , order , and a central direction came only into the movement when the Volunteer and Tome Guard Regiments organized and were mustered into the United States service at the St. Louis Arsenal after the 20th of April and at the commencement of May , 1861 . The St. Louis Turners , with a few other citizens and some members of the old Missouri Turn Society , formed the first three Companies , A , B and C , of the First Volunteer Regiment ; John S. Cavender , from the . Missouri State Militia ; Robert B. Beck , John McFall , Francis Manter , from the first Union Club ; David Murphy from Franklin County , were prominently active in the organization of the other Companies of the same Regiment , which latter elected Francis ' . Blair Colonel . Governor Yates of Illinois had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Turner Hall ; Blair and the Filleys bought seventy muskets with their own means , out sixty Sharp 's rifles were stored at Filley 's foundry . The Filleys tool : a memorable part in the Union movement from its very inpi ion . Descended from the original settlers near Plymouth Rock , they became leaders of industrial pursuits and maintained the inherited spirit of free institutions , when sorely pressed to a test in 1861 . Besides O. D. Filley , Mayor of St. Louis at the time , mentioned Inter as President of the Safety Committee , there was Giles F. Filley , who came to the city in 1834 ; he was the first to establish in St. Louis a pottery plant and later the Excelsior Stove Works and the ( " barter Oil : Range and Iron Company . He helped to organize the Free , Soil or Liberty party of 1848 , and a newspaper // called the " Union , " said to be the ancestor of the " Dispatch " ; he aided materially the construction of the Eads bridge and the Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and a half million dollars with which he had accommodated a business friend . Samuel and Edward Filley came to St. Louis in 1844 and 1845 , and Chauncey Ives Filley in 1850 . All these men aided the Union cause with- their advice , means and active service . The last named was a member of the Third Reserve Regiment , later on Mayor of St. Louis and for forty years a leader in political affairs . THE SAFETY COMMITTEE . Money had to be collected for the most pressing expenses , as in the inception of the Union movement the United States officers and officeholders of Buchanan 's administration permitted themselves to be tied hand and foot by Army regulations and a worse than Gordian Knot of red tape , which tauntingly braved the sword of a second Alexander . At one of the meetings of a Union Club , Frank P. Blair suggested that as he would be absent at Washington City as member of Congress , O. D. Filley as President , John How , Samuel Glover , James O. Broadhead and J. J. Witzig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct matters . The suggestion was agreed to and the men named thereafter exercised a more or less directive influence , which was based on their standing in the community and their well known Union fealty . There is an inherent contradiction in the name of a Safety Committee , for it is always raised in the hour of great public danger and has been known under different names in all revolutions . A Safety Committee is an informal trust , established by the confidence of many citizens , in whose opinion the regular constituted authorities do no more represent the true interests of the commonwealth . The authority of such a Committee is mainly advisory , its tenure indefinite and transitory . During popular uprisings such a Safety Committee forms a central medium of advice , information and direction ; but the St. Louis Safety Committee , through President Lincoln 's order at the end of April also became , the trusted representative of the Federal Government . The melt of the Safety Committee risked fortune , station and life , and Mill be kept in grateful memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee in 1861 were prominent citizens , some of very large means , and all had a well established reputation among their fellow citizens . The President , O. D. Filley , was Mayor of the city at the time , a descendant of a Puritan fondly ; he became a friend of Senator Benton , was in the tinware , crockery and stove business . John how was born and raised in Philadelphia ; established in St. Louis an extensive leather business and tannery , acquired a fortune from which he made a princely gift to the Washington University ; he was twice Mayor of St. Louis , in 1853 and 1856 . Samuel T. Glover was born in Kentucky in 1813 , admitted to the Bar in Palmyra , Missouri , came to St. Louis in 1849 , had been member of the Legislature , ranked among the best lawyers of the State , and although born in a Slave State . was in favor of emancipation . James Overton Broadhead , born in Virginia in 1819 , admitted to the Bar in Pike County , Missouri , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a memorable argument in the Missouri State Convention of 1861 in support of the right of the Federal Government to call out the State Militia to suppress insurrection , and used the diction , " The Union at any cost " ; he also was a leading lawyer iii the State and was in politics it Democrat . J. J. Witzig , of - German descent , a mechanical engineer , a strong Union man , plain , outspoken and uncompromising . V rank P. Blair was the most prominent , active and resolute man of the Committee ; born in Lexington , Kentucky , in 1821 , a son to Francis P. Blair , Sr. , who had been called to Washington , I ) . C. , by President Jackson to combat John C. Calhoun 's nullifiention wing of the Democracy . Frank P. Blair , Jr. , came to St Louis a graduate of Princeton College in 1843 ; practiced law , served as a private in the Mexican War , was elected to the Legislature in 1852 and re-elected in 1854 , and favored free labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure which , even if practicable . would beggar the South . In 1856 Blair was elected to Congress and was re-elected later ; after Lincoln 's election lie considered war inevitable . Blair rendered the Union cause and the Union movement in St. Louis invaluable services in Washington , and by his great personal acquaintance in Missouri , was the most trusted and valuable advisor of Nathaniel Lyon , though his Congressional duties removed him to a degree from the immediate local organization . It will be seen from the above short sketch of the Safety Committee that three of its members // hailed from the South , two from the North and one from Europe , also that all its members were among the best respected men of the community . A Union author styles the Club in which Blair was the leader the " Parent Company , " a claim which can not be substantiated , for although many members of this and other Union Club organizations joined the Regiments which later went into active military service , with the exception of Blair and a few officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not members of the so-called " Parent Club " ; in fact organizations and preparations for an armed activity went on in various parts of the city , as at Flora Garden , Soulard Market , White Beer Brewery , Yaeger 's Garden , Tyrolean Hall , Fourth and Poplar ; Ruedi 's Garden , Turner Hall , Franklin avenue , and Stifel 's Brewery . Best appointed and led was the movement at Turner Hall , where over three hundred members of the St. Louis Turner Society took an active part , and were joined by a number of men outside of the Society . This body was diligently drilled by Captain Learned , a former United States officer ; by General Sigel and others . At a meeting of a Union Club on March 10 at Turner Hall , the President of the Club , said to have been a son or relative of Governor Gamble , made a speech , in which he claimed that Missouri should fight for the flag but under no circumstances against Missourians . This , qualification of Union fealty was energetically opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn up by E. W. Decker and signed by G. A. Finkelnburg , R. T. and R. G. Rombauer , J. H. Tiemeyer , Hugo Gollmer and nearly all St. Louis Turners present , declaring that the undersigned will stand by the Union unconditionally , against all its foes in Missouri or out of Missouri . In consequence of this controversy the members separated from the Club and formed three Companies , namely , the first under G. A. Finkelnburg , the second under Hugo Gollmer and the third under J. H. Tiemeyer . On the 15th of March , three boxes of arms were brought to Turner Hall from Woodward &; Co. , in a manner to obviate suspicion . They had been sent via Alton by Governor Yates of Illinois . The great unsafety of political relations at St. Louis and the evident hostile disposition of different portions of the inhabitants // and sections of the city brought about a feeling of unrest , general distrust and reduction in business ; collections and payments were poor , purchases nominal , manufactures at a standstill ; the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singing and private Societies arranged concerts , theatrical and other exhibitions to support with the proceeds public soup houses , often frequented by persons who never lived on charity before . There was a surplus of energy , capacity and labor in all industrial channels . This to some extent accounts for the phenomenal filling up of Union and Secession ranks . ST . LOUIS MINUTE MEN . Secessionists organized in squads , even before the old year expired , and were drilling at the Tobacco Warehouse . On January 7 Minute Men Companies were organized at a meeting presided over by Chas . McLaren at Washington Ball ; they were armed with the latest and best arms and later they established headquarters at Berthold 's mansion , northwest corner Broadway and Pine , numbering early in February about ; 100 and rapidly increasing . Estimates of their numbers soon went as high as 1,500 , which in all probability represented-more or less loosely canvassed and registered Southern sympathizers of a military disposition . Five Companies of these Minute Men , though flying the Secession flag and engaged to stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by General Frust ; their Captains were Basil Duke , James P. Shaler , Colton Greene , O. H. Barrett and ( 4 . F. Hubbard . They formed a Battalion , elected Shaler Major and later joined Bowen 's Regiment . Although greatly outnumbered by the Union organizations , it was surmised hot ( arty in the year they " might have taken the Arsenal or perished in the attempt , " but for the advice of the Governor and other leaders , who were in hopes that the people of Missouri would declare for Secession . Thus morally supported , the Minute Men , with General F'rost 's Militia and thousands who were expected to flock Io Iheir aid , could afterwards easily take the Arsenal . Failing in this hope and expectation , Governor Jackson and his party viewed the growing Union strength with apprehensions : he therefore had the legislature insert a clause in the Militia bill which ordered the commanding officer of the District to disarm every Company // which was not regularly organized and mustered into the service of the State . Snead in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Secessionists , few in number , but young , full of zeal and well organized , did not care whether they were constitutionally right or not , " for the God-given right of revolution is a higher and more sacred right than any which is based upon the bargaining and concessions of men . " But Snead did not seem to have considered that this highsounding proposition is subject to some unavoidable conditions . In the first instance , a revolution which is bound to fail in its object is always wrong . The disproportion of the North and South in men , in wealth , in communicational means . in industrial outfit , in the education of the masses . was so great that only the genius of the military leaders of the South , the selfsacrificing devotion of its armies and the immense distances of sparsely populated regions could stave off the sure defeat for the period of a few years ; and secondly , the right of revolution is only considered a right when it is iu line with some ethical principle : it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher plane of perfection and which adds to human happiness . Is there any one so blind to all logic to assert that a revolution for the perpetuation of the curse of Slavery had an object which was elevating humanity ? For it must not be lost sight of that it is the deteriorating effect upon the owner which every Slavery entails , which forms the chief cause for its condemnation . The unavoidable conditions of a free commonwealth are equal rights and duties of its citizens . These are incompatible with black or white , feudal or hierarchical , political or industrial Slavery , all of which in their continuance must become fatal to liberty . Snead also holds that few Secessionists organized until " Sturgeon 's folly " set fire to the passions of men and lit the flames of civil war on the soil of Missouri . This is a serious misconception of facts : for Union men and Secessionists had made up their mind long ago what they will do , and a military escort for the removal of funds which were endangered by actual seizures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite no sensible man . Crowds will gather on the streets when two newspaper boys fight or a pocket thief is arrested , and before 1861 soldiers were an unusual sight . Mr. Sturgeon , as United States Assistant Treasurer , showed only proper discretion and care for the safety of Government fiends in his hands . // THE TTTREE MONTHS VOLUNTEERS . In the meantime the work of aggregation and formation weny on all over town , chiefly by the younger men who formed the Volunteer Regiments , and when President Lincoln made the call for 75,000 men , St. Louis was thoroughly prepared for it , even though the Governor and the State Militia were on the other side . The three Turner Companies were long ready , and the energy and popularity of Francis T. Blair made him the natural leader of the First Volunteer Regiment , which listed originally nearly 50 per cent German , over 42 per cent American and French and about 8 per cent Irish names . It is characteristic how some of these Companies were formed . The aggregation of the first Companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis Turn Verein , with some members from kindred Societies and sympathetic associates . Members of the Union Clubs , former State Militia officers and men , with a large proportion of Americans , formed the other Companies , of which one was manned almost entirely by loyal Irishmen . The origin of one Company of the First Missouri Volunteers is so characteristic of the conditions that prevailed in Missouri at the time that it may be related more in detail . David Murphy was teaching at the quiet country town of Union , Missouri , and his sympathies were enlisted in the Union cause . The political excitement grew until the surrender of Fort Sumter April 14 , and President Lincoln 's call for 75,000 men , April 15 , capped the climax . V ' hen the children assembled in school next day , Murphy addressed them briefly , stating that he deems it his duty to follow the cull of his country and join the Union forces . Bidding the children Good-Bye , " he dismissed school , boarded a train of the Missouri Pacifie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and asked , " What are you doing in the city , Murphy ? " to which he answered , " I am going to Tllinois to join the Union troops . as Governor Jackson of Missouri has refused to furnish any , " and Blair said , " Why , we have nearly four Regiments ready enlisted : go hack to Union , form a Company and come to my Regiment at the Arsenal . " Murphy considered a moment and answered , " It will not be an easy matter , but T will do it . " Returning to Union he quickly organized a Company , though surrounded by Southern // sympathizers who were also recruiting for their side . To avoid a useless fight with questionable result , the members of the Union Company were ordered to assemble individually on train time at Washington , Missouri . When the train arrived Murphy 's Company stood ready on the platform . There were two Companies of State troops on the train already who lustily cheered for " Jefferson Davis . fired pistols at random and damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned Murphy that it was dangerous to board that train , but the Captain answered coolly , " I am in command here . Attention ! Forward ! Take the first car , " and ordered the men to sit facing the rear cars , where the hostile Companies were . Murphy heard that at the station of Gray 's Summit a meeting was held With the avowed purpose of stopping and mobbing his Company . He called on the conductor and warned him he must not stop at Gray 's Summit at the peril of his life . The conductor referred hint to the engineer , to whom Murphy , after crawling over to the engine , repeated the warning in a manner which could not be misunderstood . The train flew past Gray 's Summit , not heeding the signals and shouts of a large number of armed men . Captain Belly of the Camp Jackson song ' fame , asked Murphy what the meaning of that organized troop was and received the answer : " This is a Company of onion teen going to the St. Louis Arsenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections ? " To which Kelly said , " None whatever ; you are safe on this train to St. Louis . " To which Murphy retorted : " We are able to take care of ourselves . " The Company arrived safely at the Arsenal and joined the Rifle Battalion . The First Regiment Volunteer Infantry of Missouri organized April 27 , 1861 , by electing Francis P. Blair ' Colonel . The leading spirit in the Second Missouri Volunteer Regiment was Henry Boernstein , editor of the " Anzeiger des Westerns , " an energetic , able man of radical views and a gifted writer . Being a leader in political , social and theatrical enterprises he became popular and influential , chiefly among citizens of German descent . Henry Baernstein was born November 4 , 1805 , in Hamburg . educated at the University of Lemberg it Galicia , joined the Austrian ' " It was on the tenth of May , Kelly 's men were all away .

Emigrating to this country , he first practiced medicine , afterwards became editor and proprietor of the " Anzeiger des Westens , " at that time a radical Republican paper . Boernstein was the founder of the " Free Mens ' Rationalistic Society , " promoted theatre enterprises and progressive institutions and took a very active part in politics . Peter J. Osterhaus , who became one of the best Generals of the Union Army , and Colonel Fred Schaefer , who fell at the battle of Murfreesboro , were members of this Regiment . Drilling was going on long before the President 's call , among other places , at the house of Professor A. Hammer , an eminent surgeon , where the students of the Humboldt Institute assembled and were instructed by P. J. Osterhaus in anticipation of coming events . At one such evening an alarm was heard and Dr. Hammer excitedly rushed for his revolver , which the cool-headed Osterhaus quietly took front hint . The house of Dr. IIammer stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryo state , and as that was almost within pistol shot of the Arsenal gate , the Doctor 's excitement could be readily explained . A squad of about twenty students , to whom Lyon furnished muskets , held here an advanced guard . Osterhaus afterward aided to form the Second Volunteers . whose Rifle Battalion he commanded , which rendered eminent service at the battle of Wilson 's Creek . Dr. A. Hammer aided the formation of the I+'ourth Volunteers , whose LieutenantColonel he was ; Dr. Joseph Spiegelhalter that of the Fifth Volunteers and other squads and their members , aided similarly in different organizations , according to the immediate need and convenience , as the spontaneous and elementary nature of the Union movement demanded . Rank and advancement was gained quick . The Private of one day was made Captain the next , and the Commander of Battalion or Regiment the third or fourth day . Francis Sigel , the most prominent organizer of the Third Regiment Volunteers , had an established reputation as a military man . As second in command of the revolutionary army at Baden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a high degree ; as a man of decided progressive republican views , possessed of good miliarty education , it was obvious that he should become a lender inn ' unitary Sigel was Superintendent of the German // Institute of Education , which enjoyed a very good reputation . The Second and Third Regiments were manned almost entirely by Germans . The " Schwarze Jaeger , " or Fourth Regiment Missouri Volunteers , had its origin in a hunting and rifle club of many years ' standing . Its members were chiefly German immigrants , their leader in 1861 was Nicolaus Schuettner , a carpenter by trade , who made up for his lack of education by a most resolute patriotism and the earnestness of deep conviction . There were a few Americans in some of their Companies , and in one a great many Bohemians . The " Schwarze Jaeger " were always armed and being accustomed to the handling of rifles , having the practice and outfit of hunters , were in the first four months of 1861 , up to April 21 , of more consequence than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon in the defense of the Arsenal for immediate armed resistance . The original Schwarze Jaeger Society was largely composed of men who had been in military service in Europe . They assembled for gun and rifle practice and had social gatherings . They commenced to organize military Companies for field service early in 1861 at several points , such as Ruedi 's Garden , South Third , Broadway near Park and Arsenal and Broadway , Jaegers ' Garden and Wild Hunters . When Captain Anthony Niederwieser planted the Union flag on the southeast corner of Broadway and Pine , right opposite the Minute Men 's Secession ensign , Captain Schuettner , with a Company of about forty men from the original " Schwarze Jaeger , " mounted guard for its protection . The Fifth Regiment Missouri Volunteers was organized by electing C. E. Solomon Colonel . The first meetings of men for its organization were held on Park avenue and Seventh street and at Flora Garden . The members came chiefly from the Southern part of town , Carondelet and from St. Louis County . The first five Companies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the 10th and two more by the 15th of May . The Regiment organized on May 18 . C. E. Solomon , the Commander of the Regiment , was a civil engineer and as such particularly apt to take advantage of topographical conditions for tactical problems . The slower organization of this Regiment was owing to the fact that the first four Regiments had filled the Missouri quota under the President 's call for 75,000 men , and the Fifth Volunteers muster in was only made legal after the President increased the Missouri quota to 10,000 men . The political excitement carried its partisan fire also into the churches ; the Catholic houses of worship were least affected because they were governed in the main by their highest capacities . The German churches were on the Union side , the majority of the American favored Secession ; some had a divided congregation , while others had a decided Union membership and eminent preachers . Eliot and Galusha Anderson were animated apostles of truth and liberty , and did much to develop the Union cause among American religious people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Border City During the Civil War , " which sketches the contest in St. Louis from the ethical standpoint and casts a lurid light upon the unchristian features of Slavery in the home community , also upon the obligated subserviency to it by public officers . Conservative members of Rev. Galusha Anderson 's congregation objected to his usual prayer for the welfare of the President . After an inward struggle between his interests and his duty , Anderson said from the pulpit on April 21 , 1861 : " I wish to bear my own individual testimony to express the feelings of my heart . I love my country ? I love the freedom of my country . It was purchased by the blood of our fathers , and when I become so base , so cowardly , so besotted that I dare not speak out in behalf of that for which they so bravely fought , I pray that my tongue may cleave to the roof of my mouth . " At the end of the service the congregation on Sixth and Locust sung with great fervor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a large number of people passing on the street joined .

" I. ' May 6 an appeal was was sent by the Colonels of the first four Volunteer Regiments to prominent loyal men in other States , stating that no aid can be expected from Governor Jackson , who is hostile // to the Union , therefore they seek aid for the equipment and uniforming of their men from parties outside , trusting to share in the liberality shown to Union troops in other States . They promise " to strain every nerve to uphold the authority of our Federal Government in this remote and important post of the great West , etc . " " Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act for us as receiver and disburser , and patriotic men in New York , Philadelphia and Boston were asked to act as collectors . " Many patriotic responses were made to this appeal , the collections amounting to over $30,000 . The armed organization of the ST . LOUIS HOME GUARD OR UNITED STATES RESERVE CORPS , MO . VOLUNTEERS , whose first Regiments were sworn in May 7 , took no part in this petition or its results , as they lived at their family homes and provided for their own wants ; their organization differed materially from that of the Volunteers and deserves special notice . As usual in times of public commotion , the young men and those who had no immediate family obligations first entered the Volunteer service . But the news from the South , even from the Border States , went from bad to worse . With a Legislature and police administration hostile to the Union and a militia organization under the control of the Secessionists , even the rapidly filling Volunteer organizations were not deemed to be a guarantee for the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens to organize as near as possible among neighbors a military body of men for the protection of the home and family , for the free exercise of the franchise and the supremacy of the Union . The leading idea was to make this body strong enough in numbers to prevent even the chance of a fight within the limits of the city . For this purpose Anselm Albert , Robert J. and Roderick E. Rornbauer of the First Ward met early in January to form such an organization . As all three had taken part in the war of 1848 in Hungary , they knew the value of an early movement . The start for getting the list headed by native citizens was not encouraging : among others a prominent jurist remarked : " When it comes to a fight I will take my revolver and step into the street . " A couple months later , the wine party joined a Reserve Regimetn . After this the movent was followd up with the First Ward of St. Louis           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
