txt At one of the most remarkable meetings ever held ' by the stockholders Of a fifty-million-dolla eorporatio F. A. Heinze , through his representatives in Hoboken , threw out the old Directors of the United Copper Company yesterday and elected in their stead Directors of his own choosing . The old Directors for the last week have been in various stages of contempt before Judge Lacombe in the United States Circuit Court on account of their failure to produce the missing books of the United Copper Company . These books are badly needed by United States District Attorney Wise in his investigations of the doings of F. A. Heinze while President of the Mercantile Bank . The ' old Directors were scheduled to meet to-day to take action on the removal of F. A. Heinze from the Presidency of the United Copper Company ; so that by removing them yesterday Heinze beat them at the removal game by twentyfour hours . Nevertheless the methods used in yesterday 's meeting were such that several lawyers representing minority stockholders , who were present , declared the election of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Directors will meet to-day after all and go throught the form of ousting Heinze , then causing a suit to be instituted in the name of the company to replevin the missing books from Helnze 's possession . Nor will the new Directors find their pathway one of roses , in so far as they are within reach of the United States Circuit Court . United States District Attorney Wise has announced his intention of bringing the new board and any other new boards that Heinze may elect to succeed his present nominees before the Grand Jury and into court on contempt proceedings for failure to produce the books of the company . Following are the members of the new board : David Micheljohn of Butte , L. A. Dunham of Salt Lake , Stanley Gifford of New York , ( now on his way to Europe , ) F. A. Heinze and M. M. Joyce of New York , Richard R. Kilroy of Butte , George Lane of Montreal , and Abraham V. Wyckoff of Newark . Dugan Oat of the Tombs . In addition to the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Heinze matter yesterday . George Baglin , Helnze 's Secretary and Vice President of the United Copper Company , who was sent to the Tombs in contempt proceedings the day berme , was released at 4 o'clock in the afternoon because of the certainty that he would be ousted from office at the meeting and thereby placed in a position where he could not produce the missing books if ne would . Other Directors who were in danger of cernempt punishment also got relief by the action of Hcinze 's representatives in the meeting yesterday afternoon , but not so Sanford Robinson , who has been a Directer of the United Copper Company since 196e , and counsel for Heinze in all " f his copper deals for years before that . Mr. Wise read to Judge Lacombe yestere. , y the testimony of Baglin before the rand Jury , in which Baglin declared that he overheard Robinson and Arthur Ifeinze , brother of F. A. Heinze , discussing the removal of the books on May 19 , the day before Mr. Wise discovered that they were gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ertradictory statements as to - why he refused to testify about the conversation referred to by Baglin . A respite until Friday was given him to obtain further advice of counsel , but at that time , unless he produces the books or otherwise exculpates himself , he will face immediate commitment to the Tombs . At yesterday 's meeting in Hoboken there were present in the board room at 9 o'clock Charles ' W Saacke , an employe of the Milted Copper Company ; a woman stenographer , four or five stockholders , Edward T. Rice , a lawyer of this city , representing other stockholders ; another New York lawyer woe some stockholders among his clients , and . bout fifteen newspaper men . Half an hoe went by and there was no action other than the arrival of John A. Sleicher . Then arrived Mr. Kilroy , W. T. English , a law Partner of Attorney General Robert MeCarter of New Jersey , counsel for the ' United Copper Company , and a young man named Isaac Levy , who said he was a lawyer in this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and announced that this was the annual meeting for the election of Directors , whereupon Mr. Sleicher euggsested that an orderly procedure be taken , and that announcement be made first by a responsible official of the QOMpany that a majority of the stock was represented . Mr. Sleicher remarked also that reports of officers were in order . and asked whether a list of stockholders was on hand , as required by law . Mr. English said he did not know , and none of the other Heinze representatives helped him out . " Is any official of the company ores . ent ? " came from another stockholder , No answer . " Is there anybody here from Mr. Tom linson 's office ? " asked Mr. English , referring to the attorney whose name has been featured afecmg the legal talent engaged in the Heinze defense . Farcical Proceedings at Meeting . By way of reply a small boy with a squeaky voice arose in one corner of the room . " I am from Mr. Tomlinson 's office , " 1 he began , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had come to perform . He told reporters that his last name was Nackey , then declined " to give any further information . " Nackey is about 17 years old . " Where are the books of the company ? " shouted a stockholder . " In the Tombs , " yelled another stockholder . We have sent downstairs to the Hudson Trust Company for a list of stockholders , " said Mr. English . " Are the by-laws here ? " demanded Mr. Rice . " We are trying to get them from the Trust Company , " explained Mr. English . " Are the Inspectors of election here ? " Mr. Rice persisted . No answer . " Is there anybody here who knows where the inspectors of election are ? " was the next questiw .. A stockholder angered on behalf of the management . One has skipped to Canada and the other has resigned . " " I know they have the Vice President in the Tombs , " yelled somebody else . " You might bring him over . I am sure hn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest that the indictments against the President be spread on the minutes as hen of Me list of stockholders , " another one loved . About this time Mr. English and Mr. Kilroy beat a retreat to the hall , where Lawyer Levy had already preceded them , and conferred as to a course of action . It was well after 4 o'clock when they returned to the room and suggested an adjournment of two weeks , as the list of stockholders had not yet arrived from the trust company , and the meeting still lacked the missing by-laws , but Mr. Rice had a poser ready for them . " How can the meeting adjourn , when it has not yet come to order : " he asked . In the course of ten minutes more the present stock books and list of stockholders arrived in charge of a guard from the Hudson Trust Company . Mr. English thereupon called the meeting to order and Mr. Kilroy nominated Mr. Levy for Chairman . Instantly Henry Movius , a German stockholder who had come to the meeting full of righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never relaxed until the meeting was over . He demanded first if Levy was a stockholder . Levy said he did not know . Then some body nominated Mr. Sleicher . " Are you a stockholder ? " demanded Movius . " Yes " said Mr. Sleicher sharply . " He knows , " came from somebody in the crowd . Taree or four other stockholders objected to Levy 's name going in and he therefore remarked : " If mere is a question about my holding stock and as I am not in a position to say whether I am a stockholder or not , I am willing to withdraw . " Nominations had already teen closed and a motion was made that they be reopened . There were a few " ayes " and a thundering chorus of " noes , all the newspaper men voting in the negative . Movius was on his feet once more . " There is not nothing here to say who a stockholder is and who is a stockholder not . The ayes and noes have been given verbatim ? " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which followed this , Mr. Rice asked if a secretary was present to announce the extent of the stock represented . Mr. Saacke , who in the meantime had been chosen Chairman , said that unfortunately there was none . but Mr. Kilroy declared that he had proxies for 240,000 shares , and others an-nounced holdings of about a thousand shares more . Movius objected that this 241,000 shares was not a majority of the entire stock of the company . which consists of 450,000 shares of common and 50,000 shares of preferred , but Mr. Kilroy and the Chair had things going their way by this time , and Saacke declared that a majority of the stock was present . Movius was on his feet again . I protest that there should not be further proceedings , " he shouted , " for no quorum there is present . " " Sit down , " yelled the Chair , bud Movius would not sit down . " I protest , signed Henry Movius , " I Yelled Movius Then the meeting took another adjournment until order had been restored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already named . The list as first read , included the name of William P. Reilly of Montreal , but Mr. Movius was up again , protesting this time on the ' ground that no one of the board proposed was a resident of New Jersey . whereupon it was announced that it had been discovered that Reilly was not a stockholder , although a nominee for Director . and accordingly the name of Abraham V. Wyckoff was substituted . This was about the end of the excitement . Mr. Kilroy voted his 240,000 shares of stock , the minority voted their 1,000 shares , and when the polls had been allowed to stay open for an hour and the tellers had announced the vote , the meeting adjourned in time to catch a 7 o'clock boat for ' Manhattan . Before Judge Lacombe yesterday morning Joseph Cotton . Jr. , counsel for Lawyer Robinson , asked for an adjournment until 1:30 o'clock to-morrow Of the contempt proceedings against his client . Judge Lacombe said he would grant the adjournment because lie hesitated to beHave that a member of the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson had placed himself . Mr. Wise then read the proceedings before the Grand Jury leading up to the Robinson contempt case . In his examination at this time Robinson had said , first , that he could not find the books , and then that he did not know where to look for them . He had refused to answer questions about the conversation with A. P. Heinze , of which Baglin testified , claiming professional privilege , and declared that the decision of the courts in the contempt case growing out of the refusal of Paul E. Cravath to testify to a conversation with Thomas F. Ryan before the Traction Grand Jury applied to his case . Finally Mr. Wise had made Robinson admit that he , Robinson , had made no effort to find the books . It appeared from Baglin 's testimony as read before Judge Lacombe yesterday that the information about Baglin 's overhearing a conversation between Robinson and F. A. Heinze had come almost gratuitously to the Grand Jury . Baglin declared that he went to Henze 's lawyers after he had been served with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affidavit which they had prepared . " I heard some talk , " he said , d that they were going to be removed . " " From whom ? " asked Mr. Wise . " I think it was Sanford Robinson , " said Baglin . Baglin placed the conversation on May 19 , and said , as he remembered it , that Robinson was talking to Arthur P. Heinze and that the conversation was about the removal of books . They asked Baglin to leave the room , and he did so . Mr. Baglin said that a man named C. 0 . Gear , a. clerk in the office of Arthur P. Heinze. took out two trunks from the United Copper Company 's offices late on the afternoon of May 19 . Baglin assumed the books were in these trunks , although he said he did not know . Mr. Wise also read testimony given by Robinson when he was taken before the Grand Jury on Tuesday for the second time . He was examined at that time particularly as to the grounds on which he based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations . One was that he was acting as counsel for F. A. Heinze ; the second , that he was acting as counsel for A. P. Heinze ; the third , that both he and A. P. Heinze were acting as counsel for the United Copper Company . Mr. Wise asked If Mr. Robinson , as a Director of the United Copper Company , had ever seen any authorization of the retainer of A. P. Heinze as counsel , or of any fee paid to him as counsel , or account rendered by him for legal services . Robinson said he bad not . Word came from Albany yesterday that A. P. Heinze has not been registered with the Court of Appeals as a practicing lawyer since 1891 , and therefore , under a law passed in 1898 , is not eligible to prac- , tice law in this State . When taken from the Tombs Baglin was brought over to the Federal Building and allowed to go . Max F. Schultz , one of the partners of Otto Heinze &; Co. , obtained an order yesterday from Judge Hough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possession of the District Attorney be held open to the inspection of representatives of the bankrupt brokerage firm whenever not actually needed by Mr. Wise .

In the bankruptcy petition Rothenberger said that Heinze owed him about $15,000 , due on account of transactions in the purchase of Ohio Copper for Heinze . The latter , on the other hand , alleged that Rothenberger &; Co. owe him $20,000 . David Lamar was associated with Heinze in the Ohio Copper transaction , and he was named as owing the firm money . David Lamar was present at the hearing . Heinze has also been subpoenaed to attend , but was excused from appearing yesterday . He will be present later on , it was said . Moritz Rothenberger was asked at the outset what his relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time'David Lamar , who represented that he was acting for F. Augustus Heinze , had been purchasing small blocl:s of Ohio Copper . Mr. Rothenberger said that he had generally delivered the stock at Heinze 's office , at 74 Broadway . At one time , he said , he had delivered 2,800 shares of Ohio Copper at Heinze 's office . The first time that he got an order which he considered as coming direct from Mr. Heinze was on Feb. 18 last , when Lamar told him Feinze wanted s , 800 shares of Ohio Copper purchased foe his account . The 8,800-share order was executed , and on Feb. 23 Rothenberger said he met Heinze at his Broadway office and was introduced to him by Lamar as the broker who was executing the copper orders .
