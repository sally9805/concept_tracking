Grant was Julia Dent , and her birthplace was St. Louis , Mo . There is no prettier romance in the history of American life than that of Mrs. Grant and her famous husband . A high-strung Southern girl , used to all the luxury and refinement which social life in St. Louis afforded before the war , she gave her heart to the impecunious Union Lieutenant ; she bore with unfaltering love all the trials which his lack of means entailed during their early married life , she was at his side to counsel and to cheer him during the dark days of the titanic struggle from which he was to emerge with military glory such as has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sue shared with him his civil triumphs , being the inspiration of a home life which was . as beautiful as any the White House has ever known . and when , upon Mount he fought his last fight she was by his side to give him that consolation which she alone could give . Mrs. Grant was born on Jan. 26 , 1826 . The home of her parents was located on the old travois Road , a short distance out from St Louis . - Her father was Frederick Dent Frederick Dent was the son of Gape George Dent , who led the forlorn hope at Fort Montgomery when it was stormed by Mad Anthony Wayne . On her mother 's side she was descended from John Wrenshall , who came from England to this country to escape religious intolerance , and settled in Philadelphia , Penn . At the age of ten years Miss Dent was sent to a fashionable boarding school in St. Louis conducted by a Miss Moreau . She remained at this school until her gradElation , seven years later . It was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieut Grant , then of the Fourth infantry , stationed at Jefferson Barracks , near St. Louis . It was in the Spring of 1844 that she became engaged to himSpeaking of his courtship Gen. Grant has this to say in his Memoirs : GEN . GRANT 'S COURTSHIP . " We would often take walks or go on Lorseback to visit the neighbors until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity . lf the Fourth Infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracks it is possible , even probable , that this life might have continued for some years without my finding out that there was anything serious the matter with me . " But in May following Gen. Grant 's regiment was ordered to Louisiana . This order brought to him the consciousness that he was in love . He decided to learn his fate before he departed for the new scene of duty . He started for the Dent farm on horseback . On the way he had to cross Gravois Creek , in which usually there is very little water , and over which at that time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a torrent . But Grant urged his horse into the water , determined not to be turned back from his purpose . The horse was soon off his feet and swimming with his rider down the stream of the current . Grant guided the animal toward the other shore , however , and finally reached it , drenched up to the waist . In this condition he rode to the Dent home , where he procured a dry suit from his future brother-in-law , a man nearly twice his size . Thus ridiculously attired he wooed his sweetheart . Before he left the farm Miss Dent had surrendered . The removal of the Fourth Infantry to Louisiana was in anticipation of trouble with Mexico . When war was finally declared , Grant 's regiment was ordered to the scene of hostilities , and it was not until the Summer of 1S4S when peace had been proclaimed that Grant was able to return to St. Louis and claim the redemption of Miss Dent 's pledge to become his wife . On Aug. 22 of that year they were married . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he had won that rank by his gallantry in Mexico  --  was sent to Detroit , Mich . The first four years of the young couple 's married life was spent at Detroit and Sacket 's Harbor . N. Y. , to which Capt . Grant was transferred later . In 167 , a Capt . Grant 's regiment was ordered to the Pacific Coast . Mrs. Grant did not accompany him . It was decided that she should remain with her parents in St. Louis until her husband was able to send for her . EARLY MATRIMONIAL LIFE . The opportunity never came . Grant found his salary too small to bring his wife and family to the coast and support them there in comfort , and he resigned his commission in the army and returned to St. Louis in the Summer of 18,4 . In his Memoirs he alludes to this event , and the following six years of his career as follows : " In the late Summer of 1854 I rejoined ray family , to find in it a son I had never seen . born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now to commence , at the age of thirty-two , a new struggle for our support . My wife had a farm near St Louis . to which we went , but I had no means to stock it . A house had to be built also . I worked very hard . never losing a day because of bad weather , and accomplished the object in a moderate wayIf nothing else could be done I would load a cord of wood on a wagon and take it to the city for sale . I managed to keep along very well until 1858. when I was at- I tacked by fever and ague . I had suftered.i very severely and for a long time with this disease while a boy in Ohio . It lasted now over a year , and while it did not keep me in the house , it did interfere greatly with the amount of work I was able to perform . In the Fall of 183S I sold out my stock , crops , and farming utensils at auction and gave up farming . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boggs , a cousin of Mrs. tIrant , in the real estate agency business . I spent the Winter in St. Louis myself . but did re-ot take my tamily into town until Spring . Our business might have become PrDsperous if I had been able to wait for it to grow . As it was there was no more than one person could attend to and not enough to support two families . I withdrew from the copartnership with Boggs , and in May , 1Stid , removed to Galena , Ill. , and took a clerkship in my father 's store . " The logs for the cabin to which Grant alludes were cut and hewed by him with his own hands during the Summer of 1Y.54 . Wlien the cabin was campleted he and his family went to live in it . The cabin is still in existence , and is now exhibited at Old Orchard , a suburb of St. Louis , not far from the original site on which the cabin was located . It contained four rooms , two above and two below . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The land on which Grant built his cabin comprised eighty acres , and was Major Dent 's wedding gift to his daughter . Major Dent was a radical Southerner , and conceived a hearty dislike for his son-in-law on account of Grant 's Northern proclivities . He was a man of means , but with the /exception of this gift of land he left the young couple to their own resources . During the time in which Grant and his family lived in their log cabin they were often pinched for the necessities of life . But despite the contrast which her life with her husband in their humble abode afforded to the life of luxury and ease which she had led as a young girl under her father 's roof , Mrs. Grant 's devotion to her husband and her family was such that her cheerful disposition was not blunted in the slightest degree . Instead of lamenting the misfortune which had overtaken her , she did everything in her power to lighten the burden which she knew bore so heavily on the man whom she loved . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near neighbors and friends were invited , and was constantly employing her woman 's Ingenuity to surround her family circle with as much sunshine as her husband 's circumstances would permit . It was due to hej ' in no small degree that her husband 's dauntless spirit was preserved unbroken through the trials which he passed , and that when the great crisis came which was to mark the turning point in his career he was able to take . full advantage of the opportunity which the war afforded his military genius . DURING AND AFTER THE WAR . During the civil war Mrs. Grant passed much of the time with Gen. Grant near the scene of action , he sending for her whenever opportunity permitted . She was with him at City Point . in the Winter of 1864-5 , and accompanied him to Washington when he returned with his victorious army . She saw her husband twice inaugurated President of the United States , and was his companion on his journey around the world . Speaking of the tour they took she remarked to a friend : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accompanied my Ulysses in his wanderings around the world . " The days which she spent in the White House were happy days for Mrs. Grant . She often referred to them as the happiest days of her life , except those in which she had found her greatest joy in comforting and sustaining her husband in the struggles of their early married life . On their return from abroad Gen , Grant and his wife took up their residence in New York City . Their home here was temporarily broken up when Gen. Grant was stricken with his fatal illness . After the General 's death at Mount . Mrs. Grant continued to maintain her household in New York , but when her sons had all married she gave it up , finding it too lonesome . Mrs. Grant had four children born to her  --  three sons  --  Frederick Dent , Ulysses , Jr. , and Jesse , and one daughter , Nellie . Frederick Grant is now a Brigadier General in the United States Army , Ulysses , Jr. , and Jesse are business men HT-California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington with her children . During her later years Mrs. Grant visited around among her children . She was very fond of her grandchildren , and they in turn were devoted to her . Most of her time had been spent with her daughter Nellie , in Washington . Nellie was always the idol of her mother 's and her father 's heart , and the misfortune of her marriage was the greatest sorrow of her mother 's life , as it was also of her father 's . She married Algernon Sartoris. a ? Englishman . from whom she separated some years before his death , in 189 ' . A WEALTHY WOMAN . Mrs. Grant was a wealthy woman . Patriotic friends of the General gave the family many presents of value . besides the New York house , which they occupied for a number of years ; the Government granted her a pension of 83.000 per annum and the proceeds from the sale of her husband 's Memoirs are said to have netted her nearly . $.500,0110 . Mrs. Grant 's eyesight was not good for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a companion to read to her . She always had her photograph taken in profile , In connection with a slight affliction of the eyes a very pretty story is told indicative of Gen. Grant 's tender devotion to her . When he was President she became somewant sensitive about her eyes  --  she suffered from strabismus  --  and consulted a specialist to see what could be done for her . The specialist  - -  told her he thought he could improve her eyes , but the operation would be painful . She consulted her husband to learn whether he would advise the operation . Do n't have it done , dear , " said the General pressing her cheeks with his two hands . ' ? Let those dear eyes stay just as they are . If they were changed I might not recognize my sweetheart . ' A few years after the death of Gen. Grant , Mrs. Grant began work on her autobiography . This was completed several years ago . It was her desire that her grandchildren should know Gen. Grant as she knew him , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hers . The biography contains the General 's letters to her as lover and husband . It is doubtful if it will ever see the light of day in the exact way in which it was written , but it may be that in after years the General 's descendants may be persuaded to give at least some portions of it to the public in the interest of history . When Gen. Grant died and the movement to build him a magnificent mausoleum on the banks of the Hudson was inaugurated Mrs. Grant notified the committee that conceived the project that if the mausoleum was built a resting place must be provided for her alongside her husband , otherwise she would have him buried Where she could be with him in death . Her wishes were regarded . and in the mausoleum on Riverside Drive . where the remains of the General now repose , there are two sarcophagi exactly similar ; and in the vacant one the remains of Mrs. Grant will be placed .               @ @ @ @ @ @
