WE are told with wearisome reiteration , until it vexes us even as a thing that is raw , that America produces few great scholars who are pioneers in the domain of thought ; that in exploiting a continent we have been too busy to explore the mysteries of natural science , or the mind of man . So far as this charge is true , and we can not deny that it has some foundation , it is commonly ascribed to our rapid industrial development , with the consequent attractiveness of material pursuits which draw our most promising youth away from the paths of learning . But must not our schools , and above all our universities and colleges , take their share of blame ? It is our privilege to magnify the importance of education , but in doing so we must assume responsibility , not only for the benefits conferred thereby , but also for any evils that may flow from errors committed . Education has many sides and many functions ; otherwise it would not be the fascinating pursuit that it is . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imparting knowledge , and of the training of the mind ; but in our zeal for these essential matters we seem , perhaps , to have neglected a not less important function , that of sifting out the minds capable of great intellectual achievement . Is it not possible , in short , that we have paid attention too exclusively to teaching , and too little to recruiting young men of the highest promise ? This ought we to have done , and not to leave the other undone , for both are needed in keeping educational work at a high level . Every one who has had personal experience in a university must be aware that the standard maintained is due quite as much to the calibre of the students as to that of their instructors . The success of our law schools , for example , must be attributed not only to the capacity of the professors , and to the direct effect of their method of teaching , but in no less degree to the fact that these schools attract the most ambitious and vigorous college graduates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not clear that the process of sifting is as effective as it used to be . The old classical school , with its rigid curriculum , was inelastic , unadaptable to individual needs , and is said to have been repellent and dulling to the ordinary child ; but none the less it seems to have sorted out the boys with intellectual aptitudes and to have steered them toward higher education . The same thing was probably true of the old-fashioned college . The minimum , and indeed the average , amount of study has risen very much since those days . No doubt the ordinary student was more indolent then , and acquired less mental training , but it may be doubted whether there is now so great an incentive to superiority in scholarship . If that be true , our colleges are not performing so well as they did in the past the function of intellectual selection . But have we not a new institution created to supply that very need ? The Graduate Schools in our universities , that consummate product of the last thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were surely intended to recruit the intellectual flower of the youth , fitting them to be leaders and teachers of the next generation ; and when Johns Hopkins opened its doors it became a mecca for young men who aspired to high places among the learned . Since that time Graduate Schools have multi- plied , their students have increased beyond expectation , and with theit growth in popularity they have " faded into the light of common day . " They certainly contain men of the finest type , but the bulk of their students are not of first-rate quality , and much of the instruction consists in burnishing rather soft metal . In the best of them the standard is very high so far as training and knowledge are concerned ; quite as high , perhaps , as is wise , for it can not be raised indefinitely without risk to one of the functions performed by these schools . They are , in fact , attempting to serve two objects , which are not necessarily identical in America : the education of productive scholars and of teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or both of these objects may suffer . The Graduate Schools of our universities contain in the aggregate some six thousand students , all preparing themselves , according to the popular impression , to be great scholars . But with any such conception the figures are monstrous . If we could turn out a score of men a year with any serious chance of eminence we should do well . The great bulk of the students have no delusions of this nature . All but a few of them are being trained to teach ; to diffuse knowledge , not to add to it ; to be live wires , not to be dynamos . We talk of their all doing research work , but that term covers a multitude of operations . The original thesis they are required to present for a degree proves that a student can handle original material , not that be can construct with it anything really new ; it shows a familiarity with the sources of knowledge , but it does not show capacity for productive scholarship . Our method of attracting students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate energy you must have a resistance to be overcome . If you desire to recruit men of force and ambition , there must be a great prize to be won by facing an obstacle , just as , when you want to recruit strong characters , you must call for sacrifice . In our Graduate Schools we pursue to some extent a contrary policy , for we subsidize men freely with scholarships . By so doing we are in danger of making the Graduate School the easiest path for the good but docile scholar with little energy , independence , or ambition . There is danger of attracting an industrious mediocrity , which will become later the teaching force in colleges and secondary schools , Such a policy is due in part to a feeling that a large number of students is needed to justify the expense of our graduate instruction ; and in part to a less laudable spirit of intercollegiate rivalry . A long list of graduate students is regarded as a proof that a university is fruitful in its highest work of training the great scholars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind . Yet the popular assumption is not unnatural , because it is hard even for men engaged in education , and it is impossible for the general public , to distinguish between quality and quantity in an institution with which they are not thoroughly familiar . While , therefore , the instruction in our Graduate Schools is admirable , our success in recruiting for them students of the strongest intellectual fibre is by no means so great . This is the vital point , for although eaglets are raised best in an eagle 's nest , yet there is a better chance of producing them by setting eagle 's eggs under a hen , than hen 's eggs under an eagle . But how are the eagle 's eggs to be collected ? How are young men of intellectual power to be drawn into the Graduate School ? My answer is that young men must be attracted to the pursuit of scholarship while undergraduates in college , and success in doing this depends upon the extent to which intellectual appetite and ambition are stirred there . It depends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few men are stirred , but also upon the diffusion of that attitude among the mass of undergraduates . The intellectual feast spread by the Graduate Schools does little , therefore to create an appetite for learning . It feeds hungry scholars , but it does not make them . Craving for scholarship must be formed in college , and is deeply affected by the general atmosphere there . Important as this is for the recruiting of great scholars , it is of not less consequence in giving an intellectual tone to all the alumni wherever their paths in life may lead ; but from that point of view the present situation is far from perfect . It is safe to say that no member of a faculty is satisfied with the respect in which scholarship is held by the great body of college students to-day . Every one complains in his heart , although in public he is apt to declare that the conditions in his own college are better than they are elsewhere . In fact , we know little enough about the state of affairs in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume to draw comparisons with other places . This is a case where measuring ourselves by ourselves , and comparing ourselves among ourselves , is not wise . In spite of divergences in detail , the problem is essentially the same everywhere , and any college that helps to solve it will confer a benefit upon the whole country . Nor is it enough if we are better than our fathers were , if the average amount of study in college is greater , and the minimum much greater , than it was . In the community at large the general activity has increased prodigiously ; even elegant indolence is by no means so fashionable as it used to be . Our colleges ought , in a movement of this kind , to set the pace , not follow it ; and they must not rest satisfied until they create among their students a high standard of achievement . When the elective system was first introduced , its advocates believed that it would have a powerful selective influence , by offering to each student ampler opportunity for self-development in the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system did not deny this , but complained that the undergraduate was not capable of judging what was best for him , and that to follow his own bent would lead to a one-sided development . In the plans of men , the indirect , and therefore unforeseen , consequences are often more important than those which form the subject of discussion . The elective system ? which has to a greater or less extent penetrated almost all our colleges ? did , indeed , furnish an opportunity for self-development ; but at the same time it weakened the stimulus to exertion . It was based upon the assumption that opportunity alone is enough , that a man will put forth his utmost powers if he can do so in a congenial field . Yet this is by no means true , even in the ease of the highest genius . Many a man of talent has worked only from the stress of poverty , groaning all the time at his hard fate . Shakespeare himself did much of his writing under the pressure of finishing plays for the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to time is notorious , ? a difficulty not wholly due to the fitful inspiration of the muse . If opportunity alone were enough , hereditary wealth , which vastly enlarges opportunity , ought to increase intellect . ual productiveness . There ought to be no place " where wealth accumulates and men decay . " But there is too much truth in the common belief that abundant means usually lessens the output of creative work ; and even Shakespeare , when rich enough to retire as a country gentleman , wrote no more . The mere opportunity for self-development , and for the free exercise of one 's faculties , the mere desire for self-expression , are not enough with most men to bring out all their latent powers . This is because in civilized life we are seeking to foster an activity far above the normal ; we are striving to evoke a mental energy much greater than that required for a bare subsistence , and unless education can effect this it is a failure . In addition to opportunity , there must be a stimulus of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied in part by compe- tition . Since all the students were following the same course they were naturally ranked by their marks , and there was no little emulation among the more ambitious ones . Rivalry , with its component elements , the desire to win and the still stronger desire not to be beaten , is a pervasive sentiment in human nature , often most prominent when the object itself is least worth striving for . It is constantly shown in trivial things , from the schoolboy who quickens his pace when a stranger walks faster than he , to the countryman who hates to have his horse passed on the road . The intensity of the emulation depends , in fact , far less upon the value of the end to be attained , than upon the case with which the chances of the contestants are compared ; provided , of course , they are nearly enough matched to make the result uncertain . A race where the participants run side by side on the same track is obviously more exciting than one in which they start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of one another . That is the chief reason why an athletic contest , or a physical struggle of any kind , is more interesting than almost any other competition . The sport is visible , its progress can be easily watched , and the varying chances of the players are readily compared . The world does not really believe that athletic success is the most desirable form of achievement on earth , and yet men tend to transfer a part of their emotions from the contest itself to its results . Thirty thousand people can not go to a football game , and become greatly excited over it , without being convinced that the victory is in itself a highly important matter . Thus competition provokes rivalry , intense rivalry gives rise to a keen interest , and this in turn enhances the apparent value of the object for which the contest is waged . It is one of many instances where a state of mind is produced by stimulating the secondary emotions to which it naturally gives birth . But the free elective system in college has reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps no two men are taking precisely the same series of courses , and hence their achievements are incommensurate . Like the Caucus Race in Alice in Wonderland , every one begins and ends where he pleases , save that he must take at least a certain number of courses ; and , as on that famous occasion , little interest is taken in the distribution of prizes . But it is the fashion to say that young men of college age ought not to work for prizes , or rank . This , we are told , is a low motive ; and a man ought to study for the knowledge , the training , and the culture he acquires . In short , he ought not to need the spur of competition , or any other external stimulus , because it ought to be enough for him that his future welfare is in his own hands , and his own best interests ought to guide him in the way he should go . But such an assumption leads to a rather startling conclusion ; for if the ordinary undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord , if his natural impulses are correct , then his attitude toward his studies is what it should be . If he has less respect for scholarship than one might wish , nevertheless under this assumption he is right , while we who disagree with him must be wrong . It may be that the need of competition or other stimulus to exertion among undergraduates depends upon the position which the college occupies in the general scheme of education , and upon the intricate functions of play and work in building up the faculties of mind and body . If so , it may be worth while to consider these questions briefly . Of late years we have been taught much about the value of play in the development both of animals and of man ; and for that purpose the word is commonly used to denote those acts which are performed for mere pleasure without any other serious motive . ' Now I am perfectly aware of the iniquity of employing a technical term in an unusual sense ; and yet on this occasion I propose , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physiological object is a development of the powers of the actor , as distinguished from the accomplishment of a result in itself useful , or the acquisition of the means for reaching such a result . This seems a more apt definition in connection with education , because thereby attention is fixed on the physiological and educational object , not on the personal motive of the actor . To illustrate what is meant , let us look at the case of the over-studious boy , who is compelled to coast or ride when he does not want to do so , and does not enjoy it . We say that he is obliged to play , but that is a contradiction in terms if play means only things done for pleasure . Again , it pleasure is the criterion , and a student takes , because he enjoys it , an additional course beyond the number required by the curriculum , it must be classed for him as play ; while for the student next him , who is taking only the prescribed number of courses , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a member of an athletic team , not for the mere fun of it , but because he thinks it good for him , or because he hopes that he can help his college to win the game , then again it is not play ; and as we shall see hereafter , a large part of the physical sports of youth are in fact pursued from motives other than mere pleasure . A pursuit , then , which is followed , whether voluntarily or by compulsion , because it tends to develop the mind or body , is play ; while one that is followed for the sake of gain , or because it supplies the manual skill or technical knowledge needed to earn bread , is not play . The application of the definition to studies is clearly shown in the varying relations between general education and professional training . In American schools for engineers it has been common to intersperse a certain amount of general education among the technical courses . But in the schools of divinity , law , and medicine , it has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversely , the American college of the older type was devoted entirely to studies that were deemed to be of general educational value , without having any direct professional bearing . So far as this object has been retained , and for the most part it still holds its ground , the college may be regarded as the last period of play . Do not misunderstand me . By play I do not mean anything trivial , unessential , or even necessarily pleasurable . I refer to pursuits which develop the mental , physical , and moral powers , as distinguished from the acquisition of directly profitable attainments . While any one may quarrel with this use of the word " play , " the thing itself is intensely serious . It is the chief occupation of the most formative part of life , and should therefore be taken in a spirit of earnest determination . For class-room purposes this is , no doubt , the well-worn distinction between liberal or cultural studies on one side , and professional or vocational ones on the other ; but it is wider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason I use it . The object , for example , of athletics in college is physical development , yet if a member of a baseball nine were paid for his services , or if he joined it in order to fit himself to become a professional hereafter , for him it would not be play . Now , I believe that there is a close analogy between outdoor sports and those indoor studies which are pursued for intellectual development , especially in regard to the question of stimulus by competition . According to the usual definition of play , as an action in itself pleasurable and pursued from that motive alone , any other stimulus is obviously unnecessary . But after early infancy that is not quite true of what we commonly understand by play . With very young children mere delight in exercising nascent faculties may be enough to provoke all the activity needed to develop those faculties , but that condition is soon outgrown . With most animals , indeed , the struggle for existence begins so early that the development by play covers only a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient incentive . Man , however , goes through a long period of adolescence before he is self-supporting , and with the progress of civilization it seems destined to become longer and longer , at least for pursuits that require intellectual labor . During a very small part of this period can we trust to the propelling force of enjoyment alone , even for the training of the physical powers . The mete pleasure of exercise soon ceases to suffice , because muscular strength and nervous and moral force can be brought to a high point only by strenuous exertion that surpasses the bounds of strict physical enjoyment . To make the most of himself the boy must be induced to put forth an uncomfortable effort , and for this he must have an external stimulus of some kind . No one who knows much about intercollegiate football believes that most of the men are on the team chiefly because the game itself is pleasurable ; and , in fact , other motives than immediate pleasure enter largely into all violent competitive sports after an early period of childhood . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in games only so far as they enjoyed the exercise , without being affected by ambition or the opinion of their fellows , a large portion of the more strenuous sports , and therewith much valuable training , physical and moral , would be lost . The stimulus needed is usually found in competition ; and , in fact , the object of throwing a boy into contact with others of his own age is , not only to train his social instincts , but also to bring him into rivalry with his mates , to make him play with them games which test his powers , and stimulate him to use them to the full . Within the range of their immediate interests , young people are good practical psychologists , from whom we have still much to learn by studying the way they organize their sports to provoke exertion or select superior capacity ; and it may be observed that competition in sport becomes more intense as maturity is approached . No doubt competition is often carried too far , until it has the effect of eliminating from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his Social Life in Greece , Professor Mahaffy pointed out the advantage to the community of the field sports of Sparta , in which every one of ordinary strength could engage , as compared with the gymnastic games of Athens , where only remarkable athletes took part and the rest of the young men looked on . Athletic sports in our colleges involve the same danger , by tending to accentuate the selective principle at the expense of the physical improvement of the whole body of students . But the fact that competition may be carried further than is wise , does not prove that it is not valuable as a stimulus , that it is not indeed the main factor in the physical development of youth . There is certainly no less need for an effective stimulus in scholarly than in physical training , but it is far more difficult to use , because we can not at present rely on the same constant enthusiasm on the part of the young people themselves . In the professional schools this matter is in a satisfactory state to-day . Fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study in these schools , but they have now succeeded generally in convincing their students that excellence in the work of the school has great importance , both as an equipment for their coming career , and as an indication of future success . In some cases competition is indeed used with marked effect , but it is not indispensable , because the student has the powerful incentive of feeling that he ban begun his life 's work , in which his prospects depend on his diligence . The schools for engineers where general and technical subjects are taught side by side , bring into sharp contrast the strong professional motive and the feebler desire for self-improvement . It is difficult there to make the ordinary student realize the value of a cultural course . He is apt to regard it as something foreign to his regular work ; something very well in its way , but not essential to success in his future career . He labors without a groan on mathematics , which most college undergraduates shun like a pestilence , while he treats English literature or the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly worthy of strenuous effort . At the other end of the educational ladder , also , in the preparatory school , competition , although highly useful , is not indispensable . The boy is subject to discipline , accustomed to obey , and much influenced by the precepts and wishes of his parents and teachers . If a good boy , he tries to do well , and being under constant supervision he tends to conform to the expectations of those about him . The serious difficulty begins in college , where he is plunged into a far wider liberty ? a freedom that brings vast opportunities , intellectual and moral , by which he may rise , but which on the other hand he may abuse . The old schoolboy motives for hard study he has left behind ; the professional ones are not yet in sight ; and it is not easy to make him appreciate the seriousness of the education within his reach . To some extent he believes that it is good for him , and he intends to obtain a real advantage from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the least possible exertion . He means to do reasonably well , but he has no idea of the benefit to be derived from striving for excellence . In short , he has a fair , but not a high standard . Now , there is no grave difficulty in enforcing a fair amount of work ; and of late years our colleges have wisely turned their attention to the matter , making the minimum requirements distinctly more severe than they were . We can , in fact , raise the minimum for a degree to any level that we may desire , provided we recognize frankly what that level implies . Suppose , for example , that the dullest tenth of the students who enter college ought not to graduate , no matter how faithfully they toil ; then the line will be drawn at such a point that the dullest man above that tenth can get through if he devotes to study as many hours as a young man of ordinary health can properly spend over his books . But , in that case , a brighter man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as differences in natural ability are very great , a student who stands in capacity among the more talented half of his class can get through with very little work . On the other hand , we could so draw the line that only the brighter half of the class could graduate at all ; and in that case we should have , like the German universities , a large mass of students who had no intention of taking a degree , but who could hardly be refused the privilege of living about the college as special students so long as they were well behaved . We can , therefore , set the minimum where we please , ? a minimum , however , in which the amount of work required is in inverse proportion to natural ability , ? and we can not by that process compel a clever student to be industrious . We can set a minimum of capacity , and establish a ratio between brains and labor , but we can not thereby set up a high standard for men of ability . For that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this brings us to our really difficult problem , that of applying a stimulus . College work may affect the fortunes of a lifetime more profoundly than the studies either of boyhood or of the professional school , but the ordinary student does not know it . The connection is too vague , too subtle , for him to see ; it rests on intangible principles , the force of which he does not feel . It is in college , therefore , that an external stimulus is most needed ; yet college is the very place where it is found the least . The result is that a fellow who ranks high in school , and works like a tiger when he studies his profession , is too often quite satisfied with mediocrity in college . The disintegration of the curriculum caused by the elective system in any of its common forms , the disdain of rank as a subject for ambition , ? encouraged by students , by the public , and sometimes even by instructors , ? and other forces that have crept in unawares , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scholarship has been well-nigh driven from the college . Again , I must ask you not to misunderstand me when 1 speak of the elective system . No sane man would propose to restore anything resembling a fixed curriculum in any of our larger colleges . We must not go backward , we could not if we would ; but neither must we believe that progress consists in standing still . We must go forward , and our path must be such that a choice of electives shall not lessen , among those capable of it , the stimulus to excellence . Now , there is no reason to suppose that young men have by nature a stronger desire for physical than for intellectual power , or a greater admiration for it ; yet , largely by the free use of competition , athletics , in the esteem both of undergraduates and of the community at large , has beaten scholarship out of sight . The world to-day has a far higher regard for Newton , Locke , and Moliere than for Augustus the Strong ; but in our colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would attract much more attention . I am not one of those who condemn athletic contests , for I do not think we can afford to diminish any spur to activity in college , but I am convinced that we ought to stimulate other forms of energy , and that we can get many a hint from athletic experience . ' Ishe production of true scholars , or even of the scholarly tone of mind , is not the only object of the college . It aims to produce men well developed in all directions , and it has many agencies for doing so outside the class-room ; but it cannotexist for these alone , and if it fails on the scholarly side it will be irrevocably doomed . One hundred years ago the English universities awoke to behold the low state of scholarship among their students . It boots nothing to inquire how it compared with the worst that has ever existed here , but it was bad enough . They met it by a resort to frank competition . First in one subject , and then in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades , and they succeeded in making the honors , not only a goal of ambition , but , what is more , an object of general respect . They have prizes , too , which are eagerly sought ; and , in short , the stimulus to scholarship rests on an elaborate system of competition for prizes and honors . Of course , there are voices raised against it , protesting that the muses ought to be wooed for worthier motives ; but it is our province to make the most of men as they are , not to protest that they ought to have an innate love of learning . The problem of human nature , the question whether we could have made it better if we had presided at creation , is too large to discuss here . The fact remains that the Oxford and Cambridge men are firmly persuaded that success at the bar , in public life , and in other fields , is closely connected with high honors at graduation ; and the contest for them is correspondingly keen . The prizes and honors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , referred to even in brief notices of him , ? much as his athletic feats are here , ? and they certainly do help him powerfully to get a start in his career . The result is that , by the Isis and the Cam , there is probably more hard study done in subjects not of a professional character than in any other universities in the world . What defects the system may possess , its strength and its weakness in other directions , need not detain us . The structure of English society , on which the old universities are built , is very different from ours ; yet there are qualities in human nature that are common to all mankind , and without copying an institution we may , by observing it , discover the secret of its success . Although we do not follow , we may learn . Competition as an effective stimulus to scholarship in our colleges suffers to-day from a widespread feeling among the students that the distinctions won are a test of industry rather than of superior intellectual power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which is applied with great impartiality to all high scholars , instead of being reserved , as it seems to me it was formerly , to a certain kind of laborious mediocrity . The general use of the word is certainly unjust , for statistics show that , as compared with other men , the high scholars win a far larger share of distinction in the professional schools and in after life . But the feeling contains a grain of truth . In our desire to ensure from every student a fair amount of work , we are too apt to use tests that measure mere diligence , with the result that high rank in college is no sure measure of real ability . This has been to a great extent avoided in England by distinct honor and pass examinations , the questions in the former being of such a nature that industry alone can not , it is believed , attain the highest grade ; and this is an important matter if high rank is to command admiration . It is surely possible to devise tests which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we not touch here upon one of many indications that we have lost the key to the true meaning of the college ? The primary object of the professional schools is knowledge , a command of the tools of the trade , and a facility in handling them ; while in college the primary object is intellectual power , and a knowledge of facts or principles is the material on which the mind can exercise its force , rather than an end in itself . If we could make the world believe that high rank is a proof of intellectual power , our task in instilling among un dergraduates a desire to excel would be simple . The difficulty in stimulating a scholarly ambition is enhanced by a new , and on the whole a higher , moral tone among college men . The philosophers of a century ago preached the harmony of interests both in politics and economics . They taught that , in seeking his own highest good , a man promoted that of all the world ; and they looked forward to a millennium based on universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more altruistic spirit has replaced the extreme individualism of our fathers ; and , as usual , the new tendencies are particularly strong in the rising generation . In college , the upperclassmen feel a responsibility for the welfare of the younger students , and look after them , to an extent that would have been regarded as extraordinary , if not indeed meddlesome , half a century ago . The sense of mutual obligation , and with it the corporate spirit , has grown apace . A man no longer wants to feel that he is working for himself alone ; he wants to labor for the organization of which he forms a part , because that seems to him a nobler motive . This is one reason for the halo that surrounds the athlete ; while the scholar seems to be striving for nothing better than personal distinction . If he is seeking a pecuniary scholarship , his aim , though needful , appears sordid ; if not , it seems at best selfish , and therefore unworthy of the highest admiration . But the member of the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose courage and devotion are placed freely at the service of his alma mater , stands out as a hero worthy of all the praise that can be lavished upon him . Many a man , deaf to all other appeals , can be induced to make a creditable record in his studies on the ground that otherwise he can not play upon a team , and that it is his duty to do something for the honor of his college . Such sentiments deserve respect , although to a serene philosopher they may seem a substitution of coopers- live for personal selfishness . But they assuredly place an obstacle in the path of any one who would try to raise the esteem for scholarly attainment . The undergraduate sees no way in which scholarship adds lustre to his college , and this complicates the problem of making it admirable in his eyes . We have seen that the sifting out of ) ( Ring men capable of scholarship is receiving to-day less attention than it deserves ; and that this applies , not only to recruiting future leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop the intellectual powers he may possess . We have seen also that , while the Graduate School can train scholars , it can not create love of scholarship . That work must be done in undergraduate days . We have found reason to believe that during the whole period of training , mental and physical , which reaches its culmination in college , competition is not only a proper but an essential factor ; and we have observed the results achieved at Oxford and Cambridge by its use . In this country , on the other hand , several causes , foremost among them the elective system , have almost banished competition in scholarship from our colleges ; while the inadequate character of our tests , and the corporate nature of self-interest in these latter times , raise serious difficulties in making it effective . Nevertheless I have faith that these obstacles can be overcome , and that we can raise intellectual achievement in college to its rightful place in public estimation . We are told that it is idle to expect young men to do strenuous work before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they naturally love ease and self-indulgence , and can be aroused from lethargy only by discipline , or by contact with the hard facts of a struggle with the world . If I believed that , I would not be president of a college for a moment . It is not true . A normal young man longs fornothing so much as to devote himself to a cause that calls forth his enthusiasm , and the greater the sacrifice involved the more eagerly will he grasp it . If we were at war , and our students were told that two regiments were seeking recruits , one of which would be stationed at Fortress Monroe , well housed and fed , living in luxury , without risk of death or wounds , while the other would go to the front , be starved and harassed by fatiguing marches under a broiling sun , amid pestilence , with men falling from its ranks killed or suffering mutilation , not a single man would volunteer for the first regiment , but the second would be quickly filled . Who is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculty , or the players themselves ? A young man wants to test himself on every side , in strength , in quickness , in skill , in courage , in endurance ; and he will go through much to prove his merit . He wants to test himself , provided he has faith that the test is true , and that the quality tried is one that makes for manliness ; otherwise he will have none of it . Now , we have not convinced him that high scholarship is a manly thing worthy of his devotion , or that our examinations are faithful tests of intellectual power ; and in so far as we have failed in this , we have come short of what we ought to do . Universities stand for the eternal worth of thought , for the preeminence of the prophet and the seer ; but , instead of being thrilled by the eager search for truth , our classes too often sit listless on the bench . It is not because the lecturer is dull , but because the pupils do not prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any great pursuit , or indeed in any sport . To make them see the greatness of that end , how fully it deserves the price that must be paid for it , how richly it rewards the man who may compete for it , we must learn ? and herein lies the secret ? we must learn the precious art of touching their imagination .
