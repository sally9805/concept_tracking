Throughout the western part of continental Europe , from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century , absolute monarchy was superseding feudalism ; and in France the victory of the newer over the older system was especially thorough . Then , suddenly , although not quite without warning , a third system was brought face to face with the two others . Democracy was born full-grown and defiant . It appealed at once to two sides of men ' s minds , to pure reason and to humanity . Why should a few men be allowed to rule a great multitude as deserving as themselves ? Why should the mass of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are difficult to answer . The Philosophers of the eighteenth century pronounced them unanswerable . They did not in all cases advise the establishment of democratic government as a cure for the wrongs which they saw in the world . But they attacked the things that were , proposing other things , more or less practicable , in their places . It seemed to these men no very difficult task to reconstitute society and civilization , if only the faulty arrangements of the past could be done away . They believed that men and things might be governed by a few simple laws , obvious and uniform . These natural laws they did not make any great effort to discover ; they rather took them for granted ; and while they disagreed in their statement of principles , they still believed their principles to be axiomatic . They therefore undertook to demolish simultaneously all established things which to their minds did not rest on absolute logical right . They bent themselves to their task with ardent faith and hope. @# The larger number of people , who had been living quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attacks of the Philosophers seemed to them just in many cases , the reasoning conclusive . But in their hearts they could not believe in the reality and importance of the assault . Some of those most interested in keeping the world as it was , honestly or frivolously joined in the cry for reform and for destruction. @# At last an attempt was made to put the new theories into practice . The social edifice , slowly constructed through centuries , to meet the various needs of different generations , began to tumble about the astonished ears of its occupants . Then all who recognized that they had something at stake in civilization as it existed were startled and alarmed . Believers in the old religion , in old forms of government , in old manners and morals , men in fear for their heads and men in fear for their estates , were driven together . Absolutism and aristocracy , although entirely opposed to each other in principle , were forced into an unnatural alliance . From that day to this , the history of the world has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new ideas , resting on natural law and on logic , with those of the older forms of thought and customs of life , having their sanctions in experience . It was in France that the long struggle began and took its form . It is therefore interesting to consider the government of that country , and its material and moral condition , at the time when the new ideas first became prominent and forced their way toward fulfillment. @# It is seldom in the time of the generation in which they are propounded that new theories of life and its relations bear their full fruit . Only those doctrines which a man learns in his early youth seem to him so completely certain as to deserve to be pushed nearly to their last conclusions . The Frenchman of the reign of Louis XV. listened eagerly to Voltaire , Montesquieu and Rousseau . Their descendants , in the time of his grandson , first attempted to apply the ideas of those teachers . While I shall endeavor in this book to deal with social and political conditions existing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to turn to that of his predecessor for the origin of French thoughts which acted only in the last quarter of the century. @# @# CHAPTER I. @# THE KING AND THE ADMINISTRATION. @# When Louis XVI. came to the throne in the year 1774 , he inherited a power nearly absolute in theory over all the temporal affairs of his kingdom . In certain parts of the country the old assemblies or Provincial Estates still met at fixed times , but their functions were very closely limited . The Parliaments , or high courts of justice , which had claimed the right to impose some check on legislation , had been browbeaten by Louis XIV. , and the principal one , that of Paris , had been dissolved by his successor . The young king appeared , therefore , to be left face to face with a nation over which he was to exercise direct and despotic power . It was a recognized maxim that the royal was law . Footnote : Si veut le roi , si veut la loi . Moreover , for more than two centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the great desires of men in those ages had been organization and strong government . A despotism was considered more favorable to these things than an aristocracy . Democracy existed as yet only in the dreams of philosophers , the history of antiquity , and the example of a few inconsiderable countries , like the Swiss cantons . It was soon to be brought into greater prominence by the American Revolution . As yet , however , the French nation looked hopefully to the king for government , and for such measures of reform as were deemed necessary . A king of France who had reigned justly and strongly would have received the moral support of the most respectable part of his subjects . These longed for a fair distribution of public burdens and for freedom from unnecessary restraint , rather than for a share in the government . The admiration for the English constitution , which was commonly expressed , was as yet rather theoretic than practical , and was not of a nature to detract from the loyalty undoubtedly felt for the French crown. @# Every monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many barriers which it takes a strong man to overleap . And so it was with the king of France . Although he was the fountain of justice , his judicial powers were exercised through magistrates many of whom had bought their places , and could therefore not be dispossessed without measures that were felt to be unjust and almost revolutionary . The breaking up of the Parliament of Paris , in the latter years of the preceding reign , had thrown the whole body of judges and lawyers into a state of discontent bordering on revolt . The new court of justice which had superseded the old one , the Parlement Maupeou as it was called , after the name of the chancellor who had advised its formation , was neither liked nor respected . It was one of the first acts of the government of Louis XVI. to restore the ancient Parliament of Paris , whose rights over legislation will be considered later , but which exercised at least a certain moral restraint on the royal authority. @# But it was in the administrative part of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in fact most hampered . A vast system of public offices had been gradually formed , with regulations , traditions , and a professional spirit . This it was which had displaced the old feudal order , substituting centralization for vigorous local life. @# The king ' s councils , which had become the central governing power of the state , were five in number . They were , however , closely connected together . The king himself was supposed to sit in all of them , and appears to have attended three with tolerable regularity . When there was a prime minister , he also sat in the three that were most important . The controller of the finances was a member of four of the councils , and the chancellor of three at least . As these were the most important men in the government , their presence in the several councils secured unity of action . The boards , moreover , were small , not exceeding nine members in the case of the first four in dignity and power : the Councils of State , of Despatches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Privy Council , or Council of Parties , was larger , and served in a measure as a training-school for the others . It comprised , beside all the members of the superior councils , thirty councilors of state , several intendants of finance , and eighty lawyers known as maitres des requetes . Footnote : De Lucay , Les Secretaires d ' Etat , 418 , 419 , 424 , 442 , 448 , 449. @# The functions of the various councils were not clearly defined and distinguished . Many questions would be submitted to one or another of them as chance or influence might direct . Under each there were a number of public offices , called bureaux , where business was prepared , and where the smaller matters were practically settled . By the royal councils and their subordinate public offices , France was governed to an extent and with a minuteness hardly comprehensible to any one not accustomed to centralized government. @# The councils did nothing in their own name . The king it was who nominally settled everything with their advice . The final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch himself . Every important matter was in fact submitted to him . Thus in the government of the country , the king could at any moment take as much of the burden upon his own shoulders as they were strong enough to bear. @# The legislative power was exercised by the councils . It was a question not entirely settled whether their edicts possessed full force of law without the assent of the high courts or parliaments . But with the councils rested , at least , all the initiative of legislation . The process of lawmaking began with them , and by them the laws were shaped and drafted. @# They also possessed no small part of the judiciary power . The custom of removing private causes from the regular courts , and trying them before one or another of the royal councils , was a great and , I think , a growing one . This appellate jurisdiction was due in theory partly to the doctrine that the king was the origin of justice ; and partly to the idea that political matters could not safely be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to all his subjects and that it is an act of grace , perhaps even a duty on his part , to administer it in person when it is possible to do so , is as old as monarchy itself. @# Solomon in his palace , Saint Louis under his oak , when they decided between suitors before them , were exercising the inherent rights of sovereignty , as understood in their day . The late descendants of the royal saint did not decide causes themselves except on rare occasions , but in questions between parties followed the decision of the majority of the council that heard the case . Thus the ancient custom of seeking justice from a royal judge merely served to transfer jurisdiction to an irregular tribunal . Footnote : De Lucay , Les Secretaires d ' Etat , 465. @# The executive power was both nominally and actually in the hands of the councils . Great questions of foreign and domestic policy could be settled only in the Council of State . Footnote : Sometimes called Conseil d ' en haut , or Upper Council . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same direction . Questions of detail were submitted from all parts of France . Hardly a bridge was built or a steeple repaired in Burgundy or Provence without a permission signed by the king in council and countersigned by a secretary of state . The Council of Despatches exercised disciplinary jurisdiction over authors , printers , and booksellers . It governed schools , and revised their rules and regulations . It laid out roads , dredged rivers , and built canals . It dealt with the clergy , decided differences between bishops and their chapters , authorized dioceses and parishes to borrow money . It took general charge of towns and municipal organization . The Council of Finance and the Council of Commerce had equally minute questions to decide in their own departments . Footnote : De Lucay , Les Secretaires d ' Etat , 418 . For this excessive centralization , see , also , De Tocqueville , L ' ancien Regime et la Revolution , passim. @# Evidently the king and his ministers could not give their personal attention to all these matters . Minor questions were in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the king did little more than sign the necessary license . Thus matters of local interest were practically decided by subordinate officers in Paris or Versailles , instead of being arranged in the places where they were really understood . If a village in Languedoc wanted a new parsonage , neither the inhabitants of the place , nor any one who had ever been within a hundred miles of it , was allowed to decide on the plan and to regulate the expense , but the whole matter was reported to an office in the capital and there settled by a clerk . This barbarous system , which is by no means obsolete in Europe , is known in modern times by the barbarous name of bureaucracy. @# The royal councils and their subordinate bureaux had their agents in the country . These were the intendants , men who deserve attention , for by them a very large part of the actual government was carried on . They were thirty-two in number , and governed each a territory , called a generalite . The Intendants were not great lords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ; they were hard-working men , delegated by the council , under the great seal , and liable to be promoted or recalled at the royal pleasure . They were chosen from the class of maitres des requetes , and were therefore all lawyers and members of the Privy Council . Thus the unity of the administration in Versailles and the provinces was constantly maintained. @# It had originally been the function of the intendants to act as legal inspectors , making the circuit of the provincial towns for the purpose of securing uniformity and the proper administration of justice in the various local courts . Footnote : Du Boys , i. 517 . They retained to the end of the monarchy the privilege of sitting in all the courts of law within their districts . Footnote : De Lucay , Les Assemblees provinciales , 31 . But their duties and powers had grown to be far greater than those of any officer merely judicial . The intendant had charge of the interests of the Catholic religion and worship , and the care of buildings devoted to religious purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He encouraged and regulated agriculture and commerce . He settled many questions concerning military matters and garrisons . The militia was entirely managed by him . He cooperated with the courts of justice in the control of the police . He had charge of post-roads and post-offices , stage coaches , books and printing , royal or privileged lotteries , and the suppression of illegal gambling . He was , in fact , the direct representative of the royal power , and was in constant correspondence with the king ' s minister of state . And as the power of the crown had constantly grown for two centuries , so the power of the intendant had constantly grown with it , tending to the centralization and unity of France and to the destruction of local liberties. @# As the intendants were educated as lawyers rather than as administrators , and as they were often transferred from one province to another after a short term of service , they did not acquire full knowledge of their business . Moreover , they did not reside regularly in the part of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and spent most of their time near the centre of influence , in Paris or Versailles . Yet their opportunities for doing good or harm were almost unlimited . Their executive command was nearly uncontrolled ; for where there were no provincial estates , the inhabitants could not send a petition to the king except through the hands of the intendant , and any complaint against that officer was referred to himself for an answer . Footnote : For the intendants , see Necker , De l ' administration , ii. 469 , iii. 379 . Ibid . , Memoire au roi sur l ' etablissement des administrations provinciales , passim . De Lucay , Les Assemblees provinciales , 29 . Mercier , Tableau de Paris , ix. 85 . The official title of the intendant was commissaire departi. @# The intendants were represented in their provinces by subordinate officers called sub-delegates , each one of whom ruled his petty district or election . These men were generally local lawyers or magistrates . Their pay was small , they had no hope of advancement , and they were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oppressive manner . Footnote : De Lucay , Les Assemblees provinciales , 42 , etc. @# Beside the intendant , we find in every province a royal governor . The powers of this official had gradually waned before those of his rival . He was always a great lord , drawing a great salary and maintaining great state , but doing little service , and really of far less importance to the province than the new man . He was a survival of the old feudal government , superseded by the centralized monarchy of which the intendant was the representative . Footnote : The generalite governed by the intendant , and the province to which the royal governor was appointed , were not always coterminous. @# @# CHAPTER II. @# LOUIS XVI . AND HIS COURT. @# A centralized government , when it is well managed and carefully watched from above , may reach a degree of efficiency and quickness of action which a government of distributed local powers can not hope to equal . But if a strong central government become disorganized , if inefficiency , or idleness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling place in it , the whole governing body is diseased . The honest men who may find themselves involved in any inferior part of the administration will either fall into discouraged acquiescence , or break their hearts and ruin their fortunes in hopeless revolt . Nothing but long years of untiring effort and inflexible will on the part of the ruler , with power to change his agents at his discretion , can restore order and honesty. @# There is no doubt that the French administrative body at the time when Louis XVI. began to reign , was corrupt and self-seeking . In the management of the finances and of the army , illegitimate profits were made . But this was not the worst evil from which the public service was suffering . France was in fact governed by what in modern times is called " a ring . " The members of such an organization pretend to serve the sovereign , or the public , and in some measure actually do so ; but their rewards are determined by intrigue and favor , and are entirely disproportionate to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will spend a million of the state ' s money in a needless undertaking , in order to divert a few thousands into their own pockets. @# They hold together against all the world , while trying to circumvent each other . Such a ring in old France was the court . By such a ring will every country be governed , where the sovereign who possesses the political power is weak in moral character or careless of the public interest ; whether that sovereign be a monarch , a chamber , or the mass of the people . Footnote : " Quand , dans un royaume , il y a plus d ' avantage a faire sa cour qu ' a faire son devoir , tout est perdu . " Montesquieu , vii. 176 , ( Pensees diverses. ) @# Louis XVI. , king of France and of Navarre , was more dull than stupid , and weaker in will than in intellect . In him the hobbledehoy period had been unusually prolonged , and strangers at court were astonished to see a prince of nineteen years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full of dirty clothes . Footnote : Swinburne , i. 11 . The clumsy youth grew up into a shy and awkward man , unable to find at will those accents of gracious politeness which are most useful to the great . Yet people who had been struck at first only with his awkwardness were sometimes astonished to find in him a certain amount of education , a memory for facts , and a reasonable judgment . Footnote : Campan , ii. 231 . Bertrand de Moleville , Histoire , i . Introd . ; Memoires , i. 221 . Among his predecessors he had set himself Henry IV. as a model , probably without any very accurate idea of the character of that monarch ; and he had fully determined he would do what in him lay to make his people happy . He was , moreover , thoroughly conscientious , and had a high sense of the responsibility of his great calling . He was not indolent , although heavy , and his courage , which was sorely tested , was never broken . With these virtues he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness of will enough to support a good minister , or to adhere to a good policy . But such strength had not been given him . Totally incapable of standing by himself , he leant successively , or simultaneously , on his aunt , his wife , his ministers , his courtiers , as ready to change his policy as his adviser . Yet it was part of his weakness to be unwilling to believe himself under the guidance of any particular person ; he set a high value on his own authority , and was inordinately jealous of it . No one , therefore , could acquire a permanent influence . Thus a well-meaning man became the worst of sovereigns ; for the first virtue of a master is consistency , and no subordinate can follow out with intelligent zeal today a policy which he knows may be subverted tomorrow. @# The apologists of Louis XVI. are fond of speaking of him as " virtuous . " The adjective is singularly ill-chosen . His faults were of the will more than of the understanding . To have a vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general way , and to lack the moral force to do it ,  --  surely this is the very opposite of virtue. @# The French court , which was destined to have a very great influence on the course of events in this reign and in the beginning of the French Revolution , was composed of the people about the king ' s person . The royal family and the members of the higher nobility were admitted into the circle by right of birth , but a large place could be obtained only by favor . It was the court that controlled most appointments , for no king could know all applicants personally and intimately . The stream of honor and emolument from the royal fountain-head was diverted , by the ministers and courtiers , into their own channels . Louis XV had been led by his mistresses ; Louis XVI was turned about by the last person who happened to speak to him . The courtiers , in their turn , were swayed by their feelings , or their interests . They formed parties and combinations , and intrigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave and took bribes . In all these intrigues , bribes , and bargains , the court ladies had a great share . They were as corrupt as the men , and as frivolous . It is probable that in no government did women ever exercise so great an influence. @# The factions into which the court was divided tended to group themselves round certain rich and influential families . Such were the Noailles , an ambitious and powerful house , with which Lafayette was connected by marriage ; the Broglies , one of whom had held the thread of the secret diplomacy which Louis XV. had carried on behind the backs of his acknowledged ministers ; the Polignacs , new people , creatures of Queen Marie Antoinette ; the Rohans , through the influence of whose great name an unworthy member of the family was to rise to high dignity in the church and the state , and then to cast a deep shadow on the darkening popularity of that ill-starred princess . Such families as these formed an upper class among nobles , and the members firmly believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poorer nobility , on the other hand , saw with great jealousy the supremacy of the court families . They insisted that there was and should be but one order of nobility , all whose members were equal among themselves . Footnote : See among other places the Instructions of the Nobility of Blois to the deputies , Archives parlementaires , ii. 385. @# The courtiers , on their side , thought themselves a different order of beings from the rest of the nation . The ceremony of presentation was the passport into their society , but by no means all who possessed this formal title were held to belong to the inner circle . Women who came to court but once a week , although of great family , were known as " Sunday ladies . " The true courtier lived always in the refulgent presence of his sovereign . Footnote : Campan , iii. 89. @# The court was considered a perfectly legitimate power , although much hated at times , and bearing , very properly , a large share of the odium of misgovernment . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we still speak of the Court of St. James , the Court of Vienna , as powers to be dealt with . Under a monarchy , people do not always distinguish in their own minds between the good of the state and the personal enjoyment of the monarch , nor is the doctrine that the king exists for his people by any means fully recognized . When the Count of Artois told the Parliament of Paris in 1787 that they knew that the expenses of the king could not be regulated by his receipts , but that his receipts must be governed by his expenses , he spoke a half-truth ; yet it had probably not occurred to him that there was any difference between the necessity of keeping up an efficient army , and the desirability of having hounds , coaches , and palaces . He had not reflected that it might be essential to the honor of France to feed the old soldiers in the Hotel des Invalides , and quite superfluous to pay large sums to generals who had never taken the field and to colonels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to interfere with their salaries was to disturb the most sacred rights of property . In 1787 , when the strictest economy was necessary , the king united his " Great Stables " and " Small Stables , " throwing the Duke of Coigny , who had charge of the latter , out of place . Although great pains were taken to spare the duke ' s feelings and his pocket , he was very angry at the change , and there was a violent scene between him and the king . " We were really provoked , the Duke of Coigny and I , " said Louis good-naturedly afterwards , " but I think if he had thrashed me , I should have forgiven him . " The duke , however , was not so placable as the king . Holding another appointment , he resigned it in a huff . The queen was displeased at this mark of temper , and remarked to a courtier that the Duke of Coigny did not appreciate the consideration that had been shown him. @# " Madam , " was the reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with compliments . It is too bad to live in a country where you are not sure of possessing today what you had yesterday . Such things used to take place only in Turkey . " Footnote : Besenval , ii. 255. @# It is not easy , in looking at the French government in the eighteenth century , to decide where the working administration ended , and where the useless court that answered no real purpose began . The ministers of state were reckoned a part of the court . So were many of the upper civil-servants , the king ' s military staff , and in a sense , the guards and household troops . So were the " great services , " partaking of the nature of public offices , ceremonial honors , and domestic labors . Of this kind were the Household , the Chamber , the Antechamber and Closet , the Great and the Little Stables , with their Grand Squire , First Squire and pages , who had to prove nobility to the satisfaction of the royal herald . There was the department of hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeys , one for the guard , another for police , yet another for ceremonies . There were five hundred officers " of the mouth , " table-bearers distinct from chair-bearers . There were tradesmen , from apothecaries and armorers at one end of the list to saddle-makers , tailors and violinists at the other. @# When a baby is at last born to Marie Antoinette ( only a girl , to every one ' s disappointment ) , a rumor gets about that the child will be tended with great simplicity . The queen ' s mother , the Empress Maria Theresa , in distant Vienna , takes alarm . She does not approve of " the present fashion according to Rousseau " by which young princes are brought up like peasants . Her ambassador in Paris hastens to reassure her . The infant will not lack reasonable ceremony . The service of her royal person alone will employ nearly eighty attendants . Footnote : Mercy-Argenteau , iii. 283 , 292 . The military and civil households of the king and of the royal family are said to have consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five million francs per annum . The holders of many of the places served but three months apiece out of every year , so that four officers and four salaries were required , instead of one. @# With such a system as this we can not wonder that the men who administered the French government were generally incapable and self-seeking . Most of them were politicians rather than administrators , and cared more for their places than for their country . Of the few conscientious and patriotic men who obtained power , the greater number lost it very speedily . Turgot and Malesherbes did not long remain in the Council . Necker , more cautious and conservative , could keep his place no better . The jealousy of Louis was excited , and he feared the domination of a man of whom the general opinion of posterity has been that he was wanting in decision . Calonne was sent away as soon as he tried to turn from extravagance to economy . Vergennes alone , of the good servants , retained his office ; perhaps because he had little to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to keep himself decidedly subordinate to whatever power was in the ascendant . The lasting influences were that of Maurepas , an old man who cared for nothing but himself , whose great object in government was to be without a rival , and whose art was made up of tact and gayety ; and that of the rival factions of Lamballe and Polignac , guiding the queen , which were simply rapacious. @# The courtiers and the numerous people who were drawn to Versailles by business or curiosity were governed by a system of rules of gradual growth , constituting what was known as " Etiquette . " The word has passed into common speech . In this country it is an unpopular word , and there is an impression in many people ' s minds that the thing which it represents is unnecessary . This , however , is a great delusion . Etiquette is that code of rules , not necessarily connected with morals , by which mutual intercourse is regulated . Every society , whether civilized or barbarous , has such a code of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no man would know what to expect of his neighbors , nor be able promptly to interpret the words and actions of his fellow-men . It is in obedience to an unwritten law of this kind that an American takes off his hat when he goes into a church , and an Asiatic , when he enters a mosque , takes off his shoes ; that Englishmen shake hands , and Africans rub noses . Where etiquette is well understood and well adapted to the persons whom it governs , men are at ease , for they know what they may do without offense . Where it is too complicated it hampers them , making spontaneous action difficult , and there is no doubt that the etiquette that governed the French court was antiquated , unadvisable and cumbrous . Its rules had been devised to prevent confusion and to regulate the approach of the courtiers to the king . As all honors and emoluments came from the royal pleasure , people were sure to crowd about the monarch , and to jostle each other with unmannerly and dangerous haste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , must have his place definitely assigned to him . To be near the king at all times , to have the opportunity of slipping a timely word into his ear , was an invaluable privilege . To be employed in menial offices about his person was a mark of confidence . Rules could not easily be revised , for each of them concerned a vested right . Those in force in the reign of Louis XVI. had been established by his predecessors when manners were different. @# At the close of the Middle Ages privacy may be said to have been a luxury almost unknown to any man . There was not room for it in the largest castle . Solitude was seldom either possible or safe . People were crowded together without means of escape from each other . The greatest received their dependents , and often ate their meals , in their bedrooms . A confidential interview would be held in the embrasure of a window . Such customs disappeared but gradually from the sixteenth century to our own . But by the latter part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the etiquette of the French court was still old-fashioned . It infringed too much on the king ' s privacy ; it interfered seriously with his freedom . It exposed him too familiarly to the eyes of a nation overprone to ridicule . A man who is to inspire awe should not dress and undress in public . A woman who is to be regarded with veneration should be allowed to take her bath and give birth to her children in private . Footnote : See the account of the birth of Marie Antoinette ' s first child , when she was in danger from the mixed crowd that filled her room , stood on chairs , etc. , 19th Dec. 1778 . Campan , i. 201 . At her later confinements only princes of the blood , the chancellor and the ministers , and a few other persons were admitted . Ibid. , 203. @# Madame Campan , long a waiting-woman of Marie Antoinette , has left an account of the toilet of the queen and of the little occurrences that might interrupt it . The whole performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything about it was governed by rules . The Lady of Honor and the Lady of the Bedchamber , both if they were there together , assisted by the First Woman and the two other women , did the principal service ; but there were distinctions among them . The Lady of the Bedchamber put on the skirt and presented the gown . The Lady of Honor poured out the water to wash the queen ' s hands and put on the chemise . When a Princess of the Royal Family or a Princess of the Blood was present at the toilet , the Lady of Honor gave up the latter function to her . To a Princess of the Royal Family , that is to say to the sister , sister-in-law , or aunt of the king , she handed the garment directly ; but to a Princess of the Blood ( the king ' s cousin by blood or marriage ) she did not yield this service . In the latter case , the Lady of Honor handed the chemise to the First Woman , who presented it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies observed these customs scrupulously , as appertaining to her rank. @# One winter ' s day it happened that the Queen , entirely undressed , was about to put on her chemise . Madame Campan was holding it unfolded . The Lady of Honor came in , made haste to take off her gloves and took the chemise . While she still had it in her hands there came a knock at the door , which was immediately opened . The new-comer was the Duchess of Orleans , a Princess of the Blood . Her Highness ' s gloves were taken off , she advanced to take the shift , but the Lady of Honor must not give it directly to her , and therefore passed it back to Madame Campan , who gave it to the princess . Just then there came another knock at the door , and the Countess of Provence , known as Madame , and sister-in-law to the king , was ushered in . The Duchess of Orleans presented the chemise to her . Meanwhile the Queen kept her arms crossed on her breast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without waiting to take off her gloves , merely threw away her handkerchief and put the chemise on the Queen . In her haste she knocked down the Queen ' s hair . The latter burst out laughing , to hide her annoyance ; and only murmured several times between her teeth : " This is odious ! What a nuisance ! " @# This anecdote gives but an instance of the well-known and not unfounded aversion of Marie Antoinette to the etiquette of the French court . But the young queen made no attempt to reform that etiquette ; she tried only to evade it . Much has been written about Marie Antoinette as a woman , her terrible misfortunes and the fortitude with which she bore them having evoked the sympathy of mankind . Her conduct as a queen-consort has been less considered . The woman was lively and amiable , possessing a great personal charm , which impressed those who approached her ; but that mattered little to the nation , whose dealings were with the queen . What were the duties of her office and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her was parade . She had to keep up the splendor and attractiveness of the French monarchy . This , in spite of her impatience of etiquette , was of all her public duties the one which she best performed . Her manners were dignified , gracious , and appropriately discriminating . It is said that she could bow to ten persons with one movement , giving , with her head and eyes , the recognition due to each separately. @# She had also the art of talking to several people at once , so that each one felt as if her remarks had been addressed to himself , and the equally important art ( sometimes called royal ) of remembering faces and names . As she passed from one part of her palace to another , surrounded by the ladies of her court , she seemed to the spectator to surpass them all in the nobility of her countenance and the dignified grace of her carriage . She had the crowning beauty of woman , a well-poised and proudly carried head . Her gait was a gliding motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally were enchanted with her , and to them she owes no small part of her posthumous popularity . The French nobility , on the other hand , complained , not unreasonably , that the queen was too exclusively devoted to the society of a few intimate companions , for whose sake she neglected other people . Her court , on this account , was sometimes comparatively deserted . But a young queen can hardly be very severely blamed if she often prefers her pleasures and her friends to the tedious duties of her position . Marie Antoinette had had little education or guidance . Her likes and dislikes were strong , nor was she entirely above petty spite . " You tell me , " wrote Maria Theresa to her daughter on one occasion , " that for love of me you treat the Broglies well , although they have been disrespectful to you personally . That is another odd idea . Can a little Broglie be disrespectful to you ? I do not understand that . No one was ever disrespectful to me , nor to any of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen that wrote this most royal reproof . Marie Antoinette never rose to this height of dignity , where the great lady sits above the clouds . In her days of prosperity she certainly never approached it . Perhaps no mortal woman ever reached it in early life .

Here Marie Antoinette was deficient . Her private conduct has probably been slandered , but she brought the slanders on herself . Beside the code of morals , there is in every country a code of proprieties , and people who habitually do that which is considered improper have only themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . The scandals concerning Marie Antoinette were numberless and public . The young queen of France chose for her intimate companions men and women of bad reputation . Her brother , Joseph II. , was shocked when he visited her , at the familiar manners which she permitted . He wrote to her that English travelers compared her court to Spa , then a famous gambling-place , and he called the house of the Princess of Guemenee , which she was in the habit of frequenting , " a real gambling-hell . " Accusations of cheating at cards flew about the palace , and one courtier had his pocket picked in the royal drawing-room . The queen was constantly surrounded by dissipated young noblemen , who on race days were allowed to come into her presence in costumes which shocked conservative people . She herself was recognized at public masked balls , where the worst women of the capital jostled the great nobles of the court . When she had the measles , four gentlemen of her especial friends were appointed nurses , and hardly left her chamber during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be appointed to nurse the king if he were ill . In her amusements she was seldom accompanied by her husband . It hardly told in her favor that the latter was a man for whom a young and high-spirited woman could not be expected to entertain any very passionate affection. @# The country was deeply in debt , and during a part of the reign an expensive war was going on . It was obviously the queen ' s duty to retrench her own expenses , and to set an example of economy . Yet her demands on the treasury were very great . Her personal allowance was much larger than that of the previous queen , and she was frequently in debt . Her losses at play were considerable , in spite of her husband ' s well-known aversion to gambling . She increased the number of expensive and useless offices about her court . She was constantly accessible to rapacious favorites . The feeble king could at least recognize that he owed something to his subjects ; the queen appears to have thought that the revenues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounty to people who had done nothing to deserve it . On the other hand , she acknowledged the duty of private charity , and believed that thereby she was earning the gratitude of her subjects . That the taxpayer was entitled to any consideration is an idea that does not seem to have entered her mind. @# Had Marie Antoinette been the wife of a strong and able king , she would probably have been quite right in avoiding interference in the government of the state . Being married to Louis XVI. , it was inevitable that she should try to direct his vacillating will in public matters . It therefore becomes pertinent to ask whether her influence was generally exerted on the right side. @# It is evident that in the earlier part of her reign the affairs of the state did not interest her , though her feelings were often strongly moved for or against persons . Her preference for Choiseul and his adherents , over Aiguillon and his party , was natural and well founded . The Duke of Choiseul was not only the author of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was also the ablest minister who had recently held favor in France . Had Marie Antoinette possessed as much influence over her husband in 1774 as she obtained later , she might perhaps have overcome what seems to have been one of his strongest prejudices , and have brought Choiseul back to power , to the benefit of the country . But her efforts in that direction were unavailing . In her relations with the other ministers , Turgot , Malesherbes , and Necker , her voice was generally on the side of extravagance and the court , and against economy and the nation . This , far more than the intrigues of faction , was the cause of the unpopularity that pursued her to her grave . If the court of France was a corrupt ring living on the country , Marie Antoinette was not far from being its centre. @# @# CHAPTER III. @# THE CLERGY. @# The inhabitants of France were divided into three orders , differing in legal rights . These were the Clergy , the Nobility , and the Commons , or Third Estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileged orders , contained but a small fraction of the population numerically , but their wealth and position gave them a great importance. @# The clergy formed , as the philosophers were never tired of complaining , a state within a state . No accurate statistics concerning it can be obtained . The whole number of persons vowed to religion in the country , both regular and secular , would seem to have been between one hundred and one hundred and thirty thousand . They owned probably from one fifth to one quarter of the soil . The proportion was excessive , but it does not appear that the lay inhabitants of the country were thereby crowded . Like other landowners , the clergy had tenants , and they were far from being the worst of landlords . For one thing , they were seldom absentees . The abbot of a monastery might spend his time at Versailles , but the prior and the monks remained , to do their duty by their farmers . It is said that the church lands were the best cultivated in the kingdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , treated . Footnote : Barthelemy , Erreurs et mensonges historiques , xv. 40 .

Mathieu , 324 . Babeau , La vie rurale , 133 . In any case the church was rich . Its income from invested property , principally land , has been reckoned at one hundred and twenty-four million livres a year . It received about as much more from tithes , beside the amount , very variously reckoned , which came in as fees , on such occasions as weddings , christenings , and funerals. @# Tithes were imposed throughout France for the support of the clergy . They were not , however , taken upon all Articles of produce , nor did they usually amount to one tenth of the increase . Sometimes the tithe was compounded for a fixed rent in money ; sometimes for a given number of sheaves , or measures of wine per acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , varying from one quarter to one fortieth . In some places wood , fruit , and other commodities were exempt ; in other places they were charged . Tithe was in some cases taken of calves , lambs , chickens , sucking pigs , fleeces , or fish ; and the clergy or the tithe owners were bound to provide the necessary bulls , rams , and boars . A distinction was usually made between the Great tithes , levied on such common articles as corn and wine , and the Small tithes , taken from less important crops . Of these the former were often paid to the bishops , the latter to the parish priest . The tithes had in some cases been alienated by the church and were owned by lay proprietors . In general , it is believed that this tax on the agricultural class in France amounted to about one eighteenth of the gross product of the soil . Footnote : Chassin , Les cahiers due clerge , 36 .

The livre of the time of Louis XVI. is commonly reckoned to have had at least twice the purchasing power of the franc of to-day. @# The whole body of the clergy , as it existed within the boundaries of the kingdom , was not subject to the same rules and laws . The larger part of it formed what was known as the " Clergy of France , " and possessed peculiar rights and privileges presently to be described . Those ecclesiastics , however , who lived in certain provinces , situated principally in the northern and eastern part of the country , and annexed to the kingdom since the beginning of the sixteenth century , were called the " Foreign Clergy . " These did not share the rights of the larger body , but depended more directly on the papacy . They paid certain taxes from which the Clergy of France were exempt . The mode of appointment to bishoprics and abbacies was different among them from what it was in the rest of the country . Throughout France , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these. @# The Church of France enjoyed great and peculiar privileges , both among the churches of Christendom , and among the Estates of the French realm . By the Concordat , or treaty of 1516 , made between Pope Leo X. and King Francis I. , the nomination to bishroprics and to considerable ecclesiastical benefices had been given to the king , while the Holy Father kept only a right of veto on appointments . The annates , or first-fruits of the bishoprics , taxes equal in theory to one year ' s revenue on every change of incumbent , but in fact of less amount than that , were paid to the Pope , and these , with other dues , made up a sum of three or four million livres sent annually from France to Rome . On the other hand , the Clergy of France was the only body in the state which had undisputed constitutional rights independent of the throne . Its ordinary assemblies were held once in ten years . The country was divided into sixteen ecclesiastical provinces , each under the superintendence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held , composed of delegates of the various dioceses . Each of these provincial meetings elected two bishops and two other ecclesiastics , either regular or secular . These deputies received , from their constituents , instructions called cahiers to be taken by them to the Ordinary Assembly of the clergy , which was held in Paris . This body granted subsidies to the king , managed the debt and other secular affairs of the clergy , and pronounced unofficially even in matters of doctrine . Smaller Assemblies , nearly equal in power , came together at least once during the interval which elapsed between the meetings of the Ordinary Assemblies ; so that as often as once in five years the Church of France exercised a true political activity . The sum voted to the king was called a Free GiftFootnote : Don Gratuit , and the name was not altogether inappropriate , for , although required was stated by the king ' s ministers , conditions were not infrequently exacted of the crown . Thus in 1785 , on the occasion of a gift of eighteen million livres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And once at least , as late as 1750 , on the occasion of a squabble between the church and the court , the clergy had refused to make any grant whatsoever . The total amount of the Free Gift voted during the reign of Louis XVI. was 65 , 800 , 000 livres , or less than four and a half millions a year on an average . The grant was not annual , but was made in lump sums from time to time ; a vote of two thirds of the assembly being necessary for making it . The assembly itself assessed the tax on the dioceses . A commission managed the affairs of the clergy when no assembly was sitting . The order had its treasury , and its credit was good . The king was its debtor to the extent of about a hundred million livres. @# The clergy itself was in debt . Instead of raising directly , by taxation of its members , the money which it paid to the state , it had acquired the habit of borrowing the necessary sum . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty-four million livres . In addition to the amount necessary for interest on this debt , and for a provision for its gradual repayment , the order had various expenses to meet . For these purposes it taxed itself to an amount of more than ten million livres a year . On the other hand it received back from the king a subsidy of two and a half million livres . From most of the regular , direct taxes paid by Frenchmen the Clergy of France was freed . Footnote : Revue des questions historiques , 1st July , 1890 ( L ' abbe L.

In spiritual affairs they were judged by the ecclesiastical courts. @# The income of the clergy , had it been fairly distributed , was amply sufficient for the support of every one connected with the order . It was , however , divided with great partiality . There were set over the clergy , both French and foreign , eighteen archbishops and a hundred and twenty-one bishops , beside eleven of those bishops in partibus infidelium , who , having no sees of their own in France , might be expected to make themselves generally useful . These hundred and fifty bishops were very highly , though unequally paid . The bishoprics , with a very few exceptions , were reserved for members of the nobility , and this rule was quite as strictly enforced under Louis XVI. as under any of his predecessors .

Several rose to be ministers of state . Even in that age they were accused of worldliness . It was a proverb that with Spanish bishops and French priests an excellent clergy could be made . But not all the French bishops were worldly , nor neglectful of their spiritual duties . Among them might be found conscientious and serious prelates , abounding both in faith and good works , living simply and bestowing their wealth in charity . Footnote : Rambaud , ii. 37 .

They were not even obliged to be members of the religious orders they were supposed to govern . Footnote : The abbots of abbeys en commende were appointed by the king . These appear to have been most of the rich abbeys . There were also abbayes regulieres , where the abbot was elected by the brethren . Rambaud , ii. 53 . The revenues of the monasteries were divided into two parts , the mense abbatiale , for the abbot , the mense conventuelle , for the brethren . Mathieu , 73 . Leaving the charge of their monasteries to the priors , they spent the incomes where new preferment was to be looked for , and devoted their time to intrigues rather than to prayers . No small part of the revenues of the clergy was wasted in the dissipations of these ecclesiastic courtiers . They were imitated in their vices by a rabble of priests out of place , to whom the title of abbot was given in politeness , the little abbes of French biography and fiction . These men lived in garrets , haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at rich men ' s tables , picking up a living as best they could . They were to be seen among the tradesmen and suitors who crowded the levees of the great , distinguishable in the throng by their black clothes , and a very small tonsure . They attended the toilets of fashionable ladies , ever ready with the last bit of literary gossip , or of social scandal . They sought employment as secretaries , or as writers for the press . The church , or indeed , the opposite party , could find literary champions among them at a moment ' s notice . Nor was hope of professional preferment always lacking . It is said that one of the number kept an ecclesiastical intelligence office . This man was acquainted with the incumbents of valuable livings ; he watched the state of their health , and calculated the chances of death among them . He knew what patrons were likely to have preferment to give away , and how those patrons were to be reached . His couriers were ever on the road to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich places in France , in spite of the Concordat . Footnote : Mercier , ix. 350. @# Another large part of the revenues of the church was devoted to the support of the convents . These contained from sixty to seventy thousand persons , more of them women than men . Owing to various causes , and especially to the action of a commission appointed to examine all convents , and to reform , close , or consolidate such as might need to be so treated , the number of regular religious persons fell off more than one half during the last twenty-five years of the monarchy . Yet many of the functions which in modern countries are left to private charity , or to the direct action of the state , were performed in old France by persons of this kind . The care of the poor and sick and the education of the young were largely , although not entirely , in the hands of religious orders . Some monks , like the Benedictines of St. Maur , devoted their lives to the advancement of learning . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public , and were entirely occupied with their own spiritual and temporal interests , giving alms , perhaps , but only incidentally , like other citizens . Against these the indignation of the French Philosophers was much excited . Their celibacy was attacked , as contrary to the interests of the state ; they were accused of laziness and greed . How far were the Philosophers right in their opposition ? It is impossible to discuss in detail here the policy of allowing or discouraging religious corporations in a state . Should men and women be permitted to retire from the struggles and duties of active life in the world ? Is the monastery , with its steady and depressing routine , its religious observances , often mechanical , and its quiet life , more or less degrading than the wearing toil of the world without , and the coarse pleasures of the club or the tavern ? Is it better that a woman , whom choice or necessity has deprived of every probability of governing a home of her own , should struggle against the chances and temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country ; or that she should find the stupefying protection of a convent ? These questions have seldom been answered entirely on their own merits . They have presented themselves in company with others even more important ; with questions of freedom of conscience and of national existence . The time seems not far distant when they must be reconsidered for their own sake . Already in France the persons leading a monastic life are believed to be twice as numerous as they were at the outbreak of the Revolution . It is difficult to ascertain the number in our own country , but it is not inconsiderable . Footnote : Rambaud ( ii. 52 and n. ) reckons 100 , 000 in the 18th century and 158 , 500 to-day in France , but the figures for the last century are probably too high , at least if 1788 be taken as the point of comparison . Sadlier ' s Catholic Directory , 1885 , p. 116 , gives the number of Catholic religions in the Archdiocese of New York at 117 regular priests , 271 brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @# A pleasant life the inmates of some convents must have had of it . The incomes were large , the duties easy. @# Certain houses had been secularized and turned into noble chapters . The ladies who inhabited them were freed from the vow of poverty . They wore no religious vestment , but appeared in the fashionable dress of the day . They received their friends in the convent , and could leave it themselves to reenter the secular life , and to marry if they pleased . Such a chapter was that of Remiremont in Lorraine , whose abbess was a princess of the Holy Roman Empire , by virtue of her office . Her crook was of gold . Six horses were harnessed to her carriage . Her dominion extended over two hundred villages , whose inhabitants paid her both feudal dues and ecclesiastical tithes . Nor were her duties onerous . She spent a large part of her time in Strasburg , and went to the theatre without scruple . She traveled a good deal in the neighborhood , and was a familiar figure at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her good example . Some of them were continually on the road . Others stayed at home in the convent , and entertained much good company . They dressed like other people , in the fashion , with nothing to mark their religious calling but a broad ribbon over the right shoulder , blue bordered with red , supporting a cross , with a figure of Saint Romaric . No lady was received into this chapter who could not show nine generations or two hundred and twenty-five years of chivalric , noble descent , both on the father ' s and on the mother ' s side. @# Such requirements as this were extreme , but similar conditions were not unusual . The Benedictines of Saint Claude , transformed into a chapter of canonesses , required sixteen quarterings for admission ; that is to say , that every canoness must show by proper heraldic proof , that her sixteen great  --  grandfathers and great  --  grandmothers were of noble blood . The Knights of Malta required but four quarterings . They had two hundred and twenty commanderies in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of sixty thousand livres to the Prior , who was always a prince . The revenues of the order were 1 , 750 , 000 livres. @# But very rich monasteries were exceptional after all . Those where life was hard and labor continuous were far more common . In some of them , forty men would be found living on a joint income of six thousand livres a year . They cultivated the soil , they built , they dug . They were not afraid of great undertakings in architecture or engineering , to be accomplished only after long years and generations of labor , for was not their corporation immortal ? Then we have the begging orders , infesting the roads and villages , and drawing several million livres a year from the poorer classes , which supported and grumbled at them . And against the luxury of the noble chapters must be set the silence , the vigils , the fasts of La Trappe . This monastery stood in a gloomy valley , sunk among wooded hills . The church and the surrounding buildings were mostly old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was furnished with but a mattress , a blanket and a table , without chair or fire . The monks were clad in a robe and a hood , and wore shoes and stockings , but had neither shirt nor breeches . They shaved three times a year . Their food consisted of boiled vegetables , with salad once a week ; never any butter nor eggs . Twice in the night they rose , and hastened shivering to the chapel . Never did they speak , but to their confessor ; until , in his last hour , each was privileged to give to the prior his dying messages . Hither , from the active and gay world of philosophy and frivolity would suddenly retire from time to time some young officer , scholar , or courtier . Here , bound by irrevocable vows , he could weep over his sins , or gnash his teeth at the folly that had brought him , until he found peace at last in life or in the grave. @# To enjoy the temporal privileges of the religious life neither any great age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure of souls or the abbacy of a " regular " convent ( whose inmates chose their abbot ) , a man must be twenty-five years old . But an abbot appointed by the king need only be twenty-two , a canon of a cathedral fourteen , and a chaplain seven . It can not be doubted that persons of either sex were obliged to make irrevocable vows , without any proof of free vocation , or any reason to expect a fixed resolution . Daughters and younger sons could thus be conveniently disposed of . A larger share was left for the family , for the religious were civilly dead , and did not take part in the inheritance . On the other hand , misfortune and want need not be feared for the inmate of the convent . If a nun were lost to the joys of the world , she was lost to its cares .

Footnote : The bishops , of course , belonged to the secular clergy . So , in fact , did the canons ; who , on account of the similarity of their mode of life , have been treated with the regulars .

But the parish priest , with all other churchmen , was exempt from the state taxes , although obliged to pay a proportion of the decimes , Footnote : Decime , in the singular , was an extraordinary tax levied on ecclesiastical revenue for some object deemed important .

This minimum was set at five hundred livres a year for a cure in 1768 , and raised to seven hundred in 1785 . A vicaire received two hundred and three hundred and fifty . These amounts do not seem large , but they must have secured to the country priest a tolerable condition , for we do not find that the clerical profession was neglected. @# Apart from considerations of material well being , the condition of the parish priest was not undesirable . He was fairly independent , and could not be deprived of his living without due process of law . His house was larger or smaller according to his means , but his authority and influence might in any case be considerable . He had more education and more dealings with the outer world than most of his parishioners . To him the intendant of the province might apply for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peasants by fire , or by epidemics among their cattle . His sympathy with his fellow-villagers was the warmer , that like them he had a piece of ground to till , were it only a garden , an orchard , or a bit of vineyard . Round his door , as round theirs , a few hens were scratching ; perhaps a cow lowed from her shed , or followed the village herd to the common . The priest ' s servant , a stout lass , did the milking and the weeding . In 1788 , a provincial synod was much disturbed by a motion , made by some fanatic in the interest of morals , that no priest should keep a serving-maid less than forty-five years of age . The rule was rejected on the ground that it would make it impossible to cultivate the glebes . Undoubtedly , the priests themselves often tucked up the skirts of their cassocks , and lent a hand in the work . They were treated by their flocks with a certain amount of respectful familiarity . They were addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishioners , their connection was at once intimate and professional .

But the spirit that dictated them had in a measure died out during the corrupt reign of Louis XV .

It was against her that the most persistent and violent assault of the Philosophers was directed . Before considering the doctrines of those men , who differed among themselves very widely on many points , it is well to ask what was the cause of the great excitement which their doctrines created . Men as great have existed in other centuries , and have exercised an enormous influence on the human mind. @# But that influence has generally been gradual ; percolating slowly , through the minds of scholars and thinkers , to men of action and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rapid . It was the nature of the opposition which they encountered which drew popular attention to the attacks of the Philosophers. @# @# CHAPTER IV. @# THE CHURCH AND HER ADVERSARIES. @# The new birth of learning in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had been followed by the strengthening and centralization of government , both in church and state . France had its full share of this change . Its civil government became the strongest in Europe , putting down every breath of opposition . Against the political conduct of Louis XIV neither magistrate nor citizen dared to raise his voice . The Church of France , on the other hand , in close alliance with the civil power , became almost irresistible in her own sphere . The Catholic Church throughout Europe had been the great schoolmaster of civilization . It had fallen into the common fault of schoolmasters , the assumption of infallibility . It was , moreover , a state within all states . Its sovereign , the Pope , the most powerful monarch in Christendom , is chosen in accordance with a curious and elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His rule , nominally despotic , is limited by powers and influences understood by few persons outside of his palace . His government , although highly centralized , is yet able to work efficiently in all the countries of the earth . It is served by a great body of officials , probably less corrupt on the whole than those of any other state . They are kept in order , not only by moral and spiritual sanctions , but by a system of worldly promotion . They wield over their subjects a tremendous weapon , sometimes borrowed , but seldom long or very skillfully used by laymen , and called , in clerical language , excommunication . This , when it is confined to the denial of religious privileges , may be considered a spiritual weapon . But in the eighteenth century the temporal power of Catholic Europe was still in great measure at the service of the ecclesiastical authorities . Obedience to the church was a law of the state . Although Frenchmen were no longer executed for heresy in the reign of Louis XVI. , they still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriages invalid . Their children might be taken from them . Such toleration as existed was precarious , and the Church of France was constantly urging the temporal government to take stronger measures for the extirpation of heresy. @# The church had succeeded in implanting in the minds of its votaries one opinion of enormous value in its struggle for power . Originally and properly an association for the practice and spreading of religion , the corporation had succeeded in making itself an object of worship . One great reason why atheism took root in France was the impossibility , induced by long habit , of distinguishing between religion and Catholicism , and of conceiving that the one may exist without the other . The by-laws of the church had become as sacred as the primary duties of piety ; and the injunction to refrain from meat on Fridays was indistinguishable by most Catholics , in point of obligation , from the injunction to love the Lord their God. @# The Protestant churches which separated themselves from the Church of Rome in the sixteenth century carried with them much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the commonplace sneers of the unreflecting to say that religious toleration has always been the dogma of the weaker party . The saying , if it were true , which it is not , yet would not be especially sagacious . Toleration , like other things , has been most sought by those whose need of it was greatest . But they have not always recognized its value . It was no small step in the progress of the human mind that was taken when men came to look on religious toleration as desirable or possible . That the state might treat with equal favor all forms of worship was an opinion hardly accepted by wise and liberal-minded men in the eighteenth century . It may be that the fiery contests of the Reformation were still too near in those days to let perfect peace be safe or profitable. @# Yet religious toleration was making its way in men ' s minds . Cautiously , and with limitations , the doctrine is stated , first by Locke , Bayle , and Fenelon in the last quarter of the seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighteenth . The Protestants , with their experience of persecution , assert that those persons should not be tolerated who teach that faith should not be kept with heretics , or that kings excommunicated forfeit their crowns and kingdoms ; or who attribute to themselves any peculiar privilege or power above other mortals in civil affairs ; in short , they exclude the Catholics . Atheists also may be excluded , as being under no possible conscientious obligation to dogmatize concerning their negative creed . The Catholics maintain the right of the sovereign to forbid the use of ceremonies , or the profession of opinions , which would disturb the public peace . Montesquieu , a nominal Catholic only , declares that it is the fundamental principle of political laws concerning religion , not to allow the establishment of a new form if it can be prevented ; but when one is once established , to tolerate it . He refuses to say that heresy should not be punished , but he says that it should be punished only with great circumspection . This left the case of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws denied that they had been established in the kingdom , and the church always asserted that it was mild and circumspect in its dealings with heretics . Voltaire will not say that those who are not of the same religion as the prince should share in the honors of the state , or hold public office . Such limitations as these would seem to have deprived toleration of the greater part of its value , by excluding from its benefits those persons who were most likely to be persecuted . But the statement of a great principle is far more effectual than the enumeration of its limitations . Toleration , eloquently announced as an ideal , made its way in men ' s minds . " Absolute liberty , just and true liberty , equal and impartial liberty , is the thing we stand in need of , " cries Locke , and the saying is retained when his exceptions concerning the Catholics are forgotten . " When kings meddle with religion , " says Fenelon , " instead of protecting , they enslave her . " Footnote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Felice , Voltaire , xli. 247 ( Essai sur la tolerance ) . @# The Church of France had long been cruel to her opponents . The persecution of the French Protestants , which preceded and followed the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 , is known to most readers . It was long and bloody . But about the middle of the eighteenth century it began to abate . The last execution for heresy in France appears to have taken place in 1762 . A Protestant meeting was surprised and attacked by soldiers in 1767 . Some eight or ten years later than this , the last prisoner for conscience ' sake was released from the galleys at Toulon . But no religion except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its clergy alone were entrusted certain functions essential to the conduct of civilized life . No marriage could be legally solemnized but by a Catholic priest . No public record of births was kept but in the parish registers . As a consequence of this , no faithful Protestant could be legally married at all , and all children of Protestant parents were bastards , whose property could be taken from them by the nearest Catholic relative . It is true that the courts did much to soften the execution of these laws ; but the judges , with the best intentions , were sometimes powerless ; and all judges did not mean to act fairly by heretics. @# Slowly , during the lifetime of a generation , the Protestants gained ground . The coronation-oath contained a clause by which the king promised to exterminate heretics . When Louis XVI. was to be crowned at Rheims , Turgot desired to modify this part of the oath . He drew up a new form . The clergy , however , resisted the innovation , and Maurepas , the prime minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , is said to have muttered some meaningless sounds , in place of the disputed portion of the oath. @# In 1778 , an attempt was made to induce the Parliament of Paris to interfere in behalf of the oppressed sectaries , It was stated that since 1740 , more than four hundred thousand marriages had been contracted outside of the church , and that these marriages were void in law and the constant cause of scandalous suits . But the Parliament , by a great majority , rejected the proposal to apply to the king for relief . In 1775 , and again in 1780 , the assembly of the clergy protested against the toleration accorded to heretics . It is not a little curious that at a time when a measure of simple humanity was thus opposed by the highest court of justice in the realm , and by the Church of France in its corporate capacity , a foreign Protestant , Necker , was the most important of the royal servants. @# The spirit of the church , or at least of her leading men , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop of Vienne , perhaps the most prominent French ecclesiastic of the century . The church , he says , has never persecuted , although misguided men have done so in her name . The sovereign should maintain the true religion , and is himself the judge of the best means of doing it . But religion sets bounds to what a monarch should do in her defense . She does not ask for violent or sanguinary measures against simple heretics . Such measures would do more harm than good . But when men have the audacity to exercise a pretended and forbidden ministry , injurious to the public peace , it would be absurd to think that rigorous penalties applied to their misdeeds are contrary to Christian charity . And in connection with toleration , the prelate brings together the two texts , " Judge not , that ye be not judged ; "  --  " but he that believeth not is condemned already . " This plan of dealing gently with Protestants , while so maltreating their pastors as to make public worship or the administration of sacraments very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great devolution was close at hand . On the last day of the first session of the Assembly of Notables , in the spring of 1787 , Lafayette proposed to petition the king in favor of the Protestants . His motion was received with almost unanimous approval by the committee to which it was made , and the Count of Artois , president of that committee , carried a petition to Louis XVI. accordingly . His Majesty deigned to favor the proposal , and an edict for giving a civil status to Protestants was included in the batch of bills submitted to the Parliament of Paris for registration . The measure of relief was of the most moderate character . It did not enable the sectaries of the despised religion to hold any office in the state , nor even to meet publicly for worship . Yet the opposition to the proposed law was warm , and was fomented by part of the nobility and of the clergy . One of the great ladies of the court called on each counselor of the Parliament , and left a note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws . The Bishop of Dol told the king of France that he would be answerable to God and man for the misfortunes which the reestablishment of Protestantism would bring on the kingdom . His Majesty ' s sainted aunt , according to the bishop , was looking down on him from that heaven where her virtues had placed her , and blaming his conduct . Louis XVI. resented this language and found manliness enough to send the Bishop of Dol back to his see . On the 19th of January , 1788 , the matter was warmly debated in the Parliament itself . D ' Espremenil , one of the counselors , was filled with excitement and wrath at the proposed toleration . Pointing to the image of Christ , which hung on the wall of the chamber , " would you , " he indignantly exclaimed , " would you crucify him again ? " But the appeal of bigotry was unavailing . The measure passed by a large majority . Footnote : For the last persecution of the Protestants , see Felice , 422 . Howard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. 406 . Cherest , i. 45 , 382 .

The majority was 94 to 17 . Seven counselors and three bishops retired without voting. @# It was not against Protestants alone that the clergy showed their activity . The church , in its capacity of guardian of the public morals and religion , passed condemnation on books supposed to be hostile to its claims . In this matter it exercised concurrent jurisdiction with the administrative branch of the government and with the courts of law . A new book was liable to undergo a triple ordeal . A license was required before publication , and the manuscript was therefore submitted to an official censor , often an ecclesiastic . Thence it became the custom to print in foreign countries , books which contained anything to which anybody in authority might object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses of Holland and of Geneva were thus used . Sometimes , instead of this , a book would be published in Paris with a foreign imprint . Thus " Boston " and " Philadelphia " are not infrequently found on the title-pages of books printed in France in the reign of Louis XVI . Such books were sold secretly , with greater or less precautions against discovery , for the laws were severe ; an ordinance passed as late as 1757 forbade , under penalty of death , all publications which might tend to excite the public mind . So loose an expression gave discretionary power to the authorities . The extreme penalty was not enforced , but imprisonment and exile were somewhat capriciously inflicted on authors and printers. @# But a book that had received the imprimatur of the censor was not yet safe . The clergy might denounce , or the Parliament condemn it . The church was quick to scent danger . An honest scholar , an upright and original thinker , could hardly escape the reproach of irreligion or of heresy . Nor were the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to allude disagreeably to the mistress of a prince , than to attack the government of the kingdom . Had a severe law been severely and consistently enforced , slander , heresy , and political thought might have been stamped out together . Such was in some measure the case in the reign of Louis XIV . But under the misrule of the courtiers of his feeble successors , no strict law was adhered to . There was a common tendency to wink at illegal writings of which half the public approved . Malesherbes , for instance , was at one time at the head of the official censors . He is said to have had a way of warning authors and publishers the day before a descent was to be made upon their houses . Under laws thus enforced , authors who held new doctrines learned to adapt their methods to those of the government . Almost all the great French writers of the eighteenth century framed some passages in their books for the purpose of satisfying the censor or of avoiding punishment . They were profuse in expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding ludicrously hollow , sometimes conveying the most biting mockery and satire , and again in words hardly to be distinguished from the heartfelt language of devotion . They became skillful at hinting , and masters of the art of innuendo . They attacked Christianity under the name of Mahometanism , and if they had occasion to blame French ministers of state , would seem to be satirizing the viziers of Turkey . Politics and theology are subjects of unceasing and vivid interest , and their discussion can not be suppressed , unless minds are to be smothered altogether . If any measure of free thought and speech is to be admitted , the engrossing topics will find expression . If people are not allowed pamphlets and editorials , they will bring out their ideas in poems and fables . Under Louis XV and Louis XVI , politics took possession of popular songs , and theology of every conceivable kind of writing . There was hardly an advertisement of the virtues of a quack medicine , or a copy of verses to a man ' s mistress , that did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There can be no doubt that the moral nature of authors and of the public suffered in such a course . Books lost some of their real value . But for a time an element of excitement was added to the pleasure both of writers and readers . The author had all the advantage of being persecuted , with the pleasing assurance that the persecution would not go very far . The reader , while perusing what seemed to him true and right , enjoyed the satisfaction of holding a forbidden book . He had the amusement of eating stolen fruit , and the inward conviction that it agreed with him . Footnote : Lomenie , Vie de Beaumarchais , i. 324 .

" It is hard to be consistent in the use of this word as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sometimes given to all those who advocated reform or alteration in church or state . In its stricter application , it belongs to a party among them ; to Voltaire and his immediate followers , and especially to the Encyclopaedists. @# " Never , " says Voltaire , in his " English Letters , " " will our philosophers make a religious sect , for they are without enthusiasm . " This was a favorite idea with the disciples of the great cynic , but the event has disproved its truth . The Philosophers in Voltaire ' s lifetime formed a sect , although it could hardly be called a religious one . The Patriarch of Ferney himself was something not unlike its pontiff . Diderot and d ' Alembert were its bishops , with their attendant clergy of Encyclopaedists . Helvetius and Holbach were its doctors of atheology . Most reading and thinking Frenchmen were for a time its members . Rousseau was its arch-heretic . The doctrines were materialism , fatalism , and hedonism . The sect still exists . It has adhered , from the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstition , which may be expressed somewhat as follows : " Human reason and good sense were first invented from thirty to fifty years ago . " " When we consider , " says Voltaire , " that Newton , Locke , Clarke and Leibnitz , would have been persecuted in France , imprisoned at Rome , burnt at Lisbon , what must we think of human reason ? It was born in England within this century . " Footnote : Voltaire ( Geneva ed. 1771 ) xv. 99 ( Newton ) . Also ( Beuchot ' s ed. ) xv. 351 ( Essai sur les Moeurs ) and passim . The date usually set by Voltaire ' s modern followers is that of the publication of the Origin of Species ; although no error is more opposed than this one to the great theory of evolution . And similar expressions are frequent in his writings . The sectaries , from that day to this , have never been wanting in the most glowing enthusiasm . In this respect they generally surpass the Catholics ; in fanaticism ( or the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of their chief tenets , but never undertake to conceal their contempt for any one who disagrees with them . The sect has always contained many useful and excellent persons , and some of the most dogmatic of mankind. @# @# CHAPTER V. @# THE CHURCH AND VOLTAIRE. @# The enemies of the Church of France were many and bitter , but one man stands out prominent among them . Voltaire was a poet , much admired in his day , an industrious and talented historian , a writer on all sorts of subjects , a wit of dazzling brilliancy ; but he was first , last , and always an enemy of the Catholic Church , and although not quite an atheist , an opponent of all forms of religion . For more than forty years he was the head of the party of the Philosophers . During all that time he was the most conspicuous of literary Frenchmen . Two others , Rousseau and Montesquieu , may rival him in influence on the modern world , but his followers in the regions of thought are numerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lawyer named Arouet . There are doubts as to the origin of the name he has made so famous ; whether it was derived from a fief possessed by his mother , or from an anagram of AROUET LE JEUNE . At any rate , the name was adopted by the young poet , at his own fancy , a case not without parallel in the eighteenth century . Footnote : As in the case of D ' Alembert . For Voltaire ' s name , see Desnoiresterres , Jeunesse de Voltaire , 161. @# Voltaire began early to attract public attention . Before he was twenty-five years old he had established his reputation as a wit , had spent nearly a year in the Bastille on a charge of writing satirical verses , and had produced a successful tragedy . In this play a couplet sneering at priests might possibly have become a familiar quotation even had it been written by another pen . Footnote : Oedipe , written in 1718 . " Nos pretres ne sont point ce qu ' un vain peuple pense ; Notre credulite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene I. For several years Voltaire went on writing , with increasing reputation . In 1723 , his great epic poem , " La Henriade , " was secretly circulated in Paris . Footnote : Desnoiresterres , Jeunesse , 297 . The author was one of the marked men of the town . At the same time his reputation must have been to some extent that of a troublesome fellow . And in December of that year an event occurred which was destined to drive the rising author from France for several years , and add bitterness to a mind naturally acid. @# The details of the story are variously told . It appears that Voltaire was one evening at the theatre behind the scenes , and had a dispute with the Chevalier de Chabot , of the family of Rohan . " Monsieur de Voltaire , Monsieur Arouet , what ' s your name ! " the chevalier is said to have called out . " My name is not a great one , but I am no discredit to it , " answered the author . Chabot lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mademoiselle Lecouvreur , the actress , for whose benefit , perhaps , the little dispute was enacted , took occasion to faint . Chabot went off , muttering something about a stick. @# A few days later , Voltaire was dining at the house of the Duke of Sulli . A servant informed him that some one wanted to see him at the door . So Voltaire went out , and stepped quietly up to a coach that was standing in front of the house . As he put his head in at the coach door , he was seized by the collar of his coat and held fast , while two men came up behind and belabored him with sticks . The Chevalier de Chabot , his noble adversary , was looking on from another carriage. @# When the tormentors let him go , Voltaire rushed back into the house and appealed to the Duke of Sulli for vengeance , but in vain . It was no small matter to quarrel with the family of Rohan . Then the poet applied to the court for redress , but got none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded the prime minister that his petitioner was the author of a certain epigram , addressed to His Excellency ' s mistress , in which she was reminded that it is easy to deceive a one-eyed Argus . ( The minister had but one eye . ) Finally Voltaire , seeing that no one else would take up his quarrel , began to take fencing lessons and to keep boisterous company . It is probable that he would have made little use of any skill he might have acquired as a swordsman . Voltaire was not physically rash . The Chevalier de Chabot , although he held the commission of a staff-officer , was certainly no braver than his adversary , and was in a position to take no risks . Voltaire was at first watched by the police ; then , perhaps after sending a challenge , locked up in the Bastille . He remained in that state prison for about a fortnight , receiving his friends and dining at the governor ' s table . On the 5th of May , 1726 , he was at Calais on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeunesse , 345. @# Voltaire spent three years in England , years which exercised a deep influence on his life . He learned the English language exceptionally well , and practiced writing it in prose and verse . He associated on terms of intimacy with Lord Bolingbroke , whom he had already known in France , with Swift , Pope , and Gay . He drew an epigram from Young . He brought out a new and amended edition of the " Henriade , " with a dedication in English to Queen Caroline . He studied the writings of Bacon , Newton , and Locke . Thus to the Chevalier de Chabot , and his shameful assault , did French thinkers owe , in no small measure , the influence which English writers exercised upon them. @# While in England , Voltaire was taking notes and writing letters . These he probably worked over during the years immediately following his return to France . The " Lettres Philosophiques , " or " Letters concerning the English Nation , " were first published in England in 1733 . They were allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Promptly condemned by the Parliament of Paris as " scandalous and contrary to religion and morals , and to the respect due to the powers that be , " they were " torn and burned at the foot of the great staircase , " and read all the more for it. @# It is no wonder that the church , and that conservative if sometimes heterodox body , the Parliament of Paris , should have condemned the " English Letters . " A bitter satire is leveled at France , with her religion and her government , under cover of candid praise of English ways and English laws . What could the Catholic clergy say to words like these , put into the mouth of a Quaker ? " God forbid that we should dare to command any one to receive the Holy Ghost on Sunday to the exclusion of the rest of the faithful ! Thank Heaven we are the only people on earth who have no priests ! Would you rob us of so happy a distinction ? Why should we abandon our child to mercenary nurses when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern the house and oppress mother and child . God has said : Freely ye have received ; freely give . ' After that saying , shall we go chaffer with the Gospel , sell the Holy Ghost , and turn a meeting of Christians into a tradesman ' s shop ? We do not give money to men dressed in black , to assist our poor , to bury our dead , to preach to the faithful . Those holy occupations are too dear to us to be cast off upon others . " Footnote : Voltaire , xxxvii. 124. @# Having thus attacked the institution of priesthood in general , Voltaire turns his attention in particular to the priests of France and England . In morals , he says , the Anglican clergy are more regular than the French . This is because all ecclesiastics in England are educated at the universities , far from the temptations of the capital , and are called to the dignities of the church at an advanced age , when men have no passions left but avarice and ambition . Advancement here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in the army . You do not see boys becoming bishops or colonels on leaving school . Moreover , most English priests are married men . The awkward manners contracted at the university , and the slight intercourse with women usual in that country , generally compel a bishop to be content with his own wife . Priests sometimes go to the tavern in England , because custom allows it ; but if they get drunk , they do so seriously , and without making scandal. @# " That indefinable being , who is neither a layman nor an ecclesiastic , in a word , that which we call an abbe , is an unknown species in England . Here all priests are reserved , and nearly all are pedants . When they are told that in France young men known for their debauched lives and raised to the prelacy by the intrigues of women make love publicly , amuse themselves by composing amorous songs , give long and dainty suppers every night , and go thence to ask the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit , and boldly call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are Protestants ;  --  but they are vile heretics , to be burned by all the devils , as says Master Francois Rabelais . Which is why I have nothing to do with them . " Footnote : Voltaire , xxxvii. 140. @# While the evil lives of an important part of the French clergy are thus assailed , the doctrines of the Church are not spared . The following is from the letter on the Socinians . " Do you remember a certain orthodox bishop , who in order to convince the Emperor of the consubstantiality of the three Persons of the Godhead ventured to chuck the Emperor ' s son under the chin , and to pull his nose in his sacred majesty ' s presence ? The Emperor was going to have the bishop thrown out of the window , when the good man addressed him in the following fine and convincing words : Sir , if your Majesty is so angry that your son should be treated with disrespect , how do you think that God the Father will punish those who refuse to give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The people of whom I speak say that the holy bishop was ill-advised , that his argument was far from conclusive , and that the Emperor should have answered : Know that there are two ways of showing want of respect for me ; the first is not to render sufficient honor to my son , the other is to honor him as much as myself . ' " Footnote : Voltaire , xxxvii. 144 . Such words as these were hardly to be borne . But the French authorities recognized that there was a greater and more insidious danger to the church in certain other passages by which Frenchmen were made to learn some of the results of English abstract thought. @# Among the French writers of the eighteenth century are several men of eminent talent ; one only whose sinister but original genius has given a new direction to the human mind . I shall treat farther on of the ideas of Rousseau . The others , and Voltaire among them , belong to that class of great men who assimilate , express , and popularize thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us then pause for a moment , while studying the French Philosophers and their action on the church , and ask who were their masters. @# Montaigne , Bayle , and Grotius may be considered the predecessors on the Continent of the French Philosophic movement , but its great impulse came from England . Bacon had much to do with it ; Hooker and Hobbes were not without influence ; Newton ' s discoveries directed men ' s minds towards physical science ; but of the metaphysical and political ideas of the century , John Locke was the fountain-head . Some Frenchmen have in modern times disputed his claims . To refute these disputants it is only necessary to turn from their books to those of Voltaire and his contemporaries . The services rendered by France to the human race are so great that her sons need never claim any glory which does not clearly belong to them . All through modern history , Frenchmen have stood in the front rank of civilization . They have stood there side by side with Englishmen , Italians , and Germans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They belong to the whole European family of nations . The attempt to set aside Locke , Newton , and Bacon , as guides of the eighteenth century belongs not to that age but to our own. @# The works of Locke are on the shelves of most considerable libraries ; but many men , now that the study of metaphysics is out of fashion , are appalled at the suggestion that they should read an essay in three volumes on the human understanding , evidently considering their own minds less worthy of study than their bodies or their estates . It may be worth while , therefore , to give a short summary of those theories , or discoveries of Locke which most modified French thought in the eighteenth century . The great thinker was born in 1632 and died in 1704 . His principal works were published shortly after the English Revolution of 1688 , but had been long in preparation ; and the " Essay on the Human Understanding " is said to have occupied him not less than twenty years. @# It is the principal doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He acknowledges that " it is a received doctrine that men have native ideas and original characters stamped upon their minds in their very first being ; " but he utterly rejects every such theory . It is his principal business to protest and argue against the existence of such " innate ideas . " Virtue he believes to be generally approved because it is profitable , not on account of any natural leaning of the mind in its direction . Conscience " is nothing else but our own opinion or judgment of the moral rectitude or pravity of our own actions . " Memory is the power in the mind to revive perceptions which it once had , with this additional perception annexed to them , that it has had them before . Wit lies in the assemblage of ideas , judgment in the careful discrimination among them . " Things are good or evil only in reference to pleasure or pain ; " . . . " our love and hatred of inanimate , insensible beings is commonly founded on that pleasure or pain which we receive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though with their destruction ; but hatred or love of beings incapable of happiness or misery is often the uneasiness or delight which we find in ourselves , arising from a consideration of their very being or happiness . Thus the being and welfare of a man ' s children or friends , producing constant delight in him , he is said constantly to love them . But it suffices to note that our ideas of love and hatred are but dispositions of the mind in respect of pleasure or pain in general , however caused in us. " @# We have no clear idea of substance nor of spirit . Substance is that wherein we conceive qualities of matter to exist ; spirit , that in which we conceive qualities of mind , as thinking , knowing , and doubting . The primary ideas of body are the cohesion of solid , and therefore separate parts , and a power of communicating motion by impulse . The ideas of spirit are thinking and will , or a power of putting body into motion by thought , and , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mobility , and duration are common to both. @# Locke ' s intelligence was clear enough to perceive that these two ideas , spirit and matter , stand on a similar footing . Less lucid thinkers have boldly denied the existence of spirit while asserting that of matter . Locke ' s system would not allow him to believe that either conception depended on the nature of the mind itself . He therefore rejected the claims of substance as unequivocally as those of spirit , declaring it to be " only an uncertain supposition of we know not what , i. e. , of something whereof we have no particular , distinct , positive idea , which we take to be the substratum or support of those ideas we know . " Yet he inclines on the whole toward materialism . " We have , " he says , " the ideas of matter and thinking , but possibly shall never be able to know whether any mere material being thinks , or no ; it being impossible for us , by the contemplation of our own ideas , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some system of matter , fitly disposed , a power to perceive and think , or else joined and fixed to matter so disposed a thinking immaterial substance , it being , in respect of our notions , not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that God can , if he pleases , superadd to matter a faculty of thinking , than that he should superadd to it another substance , with a faculty of thinking ; since we know not wherein thinking consists , nor to what sort of substances the Almighty has been pleased to give that power , which can not be in any created being , but merely by the good pleasure and power of the Creator . " . . . " All the great ends of morality and religion , " he adds , " are well secured without philosophical proof of the soul ' s immateriality . " As to our knowledge " of the actual existence of things , we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence , and a demonstrative knowledge of the existence of God ; of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensitive knowledge , which extends not beyond the objects present to our senses .

Voltaire writes to a friend that the censor might have been brought to give his approbation to all the letters but this one . " I confess , " he adds , " that I do not understand this exception , but the theologians know more about it than I do , and I must take their word for it .

" Never , " says Voltaire , " was there perhaps a wiser or a more methodical spirit , a more exact logician , than Locke . " . . . " Before him great philosophers had positively decided what is the soul of man ; but as they knew nothing at all about it , it is very natural that they should all have been of different minds . " And he adds in another part of the letter , " Men have long disputed on the nature and immortality of the soul . As to its immortality , that can not be demonstrated , since people are still disputing about its nature ; and since , surely , we must thoroughly know a created being to decide whether it is immortal or not . Human reason alone is so unable to demonstrate the immortality of the soul , that religion has been obliged to reveal it to us . The common good of all men demands that we should believe the soul to be immortal ; faith commands it ; no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not the same as to its nature ; it matters little to religion of what substance is the soul , if only it be virtuous .

In the various editions of Voltaire ' s collected works published in the last century these letters do not appear as a series , but their contents is distributed among the miscellaneous articles , and those of the Dictionnaire philosophique .

Desnoiresterres , Voltaire a Cirey , 28 , Voltaire , xxxvii. 113 . In Beuchot ' s edition the letters appear in their original form ) . @# The " Lettres philosophiques " may be considered the first of Voltaire ' s polemic writings . They exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is in them , perhaps , more real gayety , more spontaneous fun , than in his later books . Voltaire was between thirty-five and forty years old when they were written , and although he possessed to the end of his long life more vitality than most men , yet he was physically something of an invalid , and his many exiles and disappointments told upon his temper . From 1734 , when these letters first appeared in France , to 1778 , when he died , worn out with years , labors , quarrels , and honors , his activity was unceasing . He had many followers and many enemies , but hardly a rival . Voltaire was and is the great representative of a way of looking at life ; a way which was enthusiastically followed in his own time , which is followed with equal enthusiasm to-day . This view he expressed and enforced in his numberless poems , tragedies , histories , and tales . It formed the burden of his voluminous correspondence . As we read any of them , his creed becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his more than ninety volumes . It may almost be said to be on every page of them . That creed may be stated as follows : We know truth only by our reason . That reason is enlightened only by our senses . What they do not tell us we can not know , and it is mere folly to waste time in conjecturing . Imagination and feeling are blind leaders of the blind . All men who pretend to supernatural revelation or inspiration are swindlers , and those who believe them are dupes . It may be desirable , for political or social purposes , to have a favored religion in the state , but freedom of opinion and of expression should be allowed to all men , at least to all educated men ; for the populace , with their crude ideas and superstitions , may be held in slight regard. @# Voltaire ' s hatred was especially warm against the regular clergy . " Religion , " he says , " can still sharpen daggers . There is within the nation a people which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the age , which is inaccessible to the progress of reason , and over which the atrocity of fanaticism preserves its empire , like certain diseases which attack only the vilest populace . " The best monks are the worst , and those who sing " Pervigilium Veneris " in place of matins are less dangerous than such as reason , preach , and plot . And in another place he says that " a religious order should not a part of history . " But it is well to notice that Voltaire ' s hatred of Catholicism and of Catholic monks is not founded on a preference for any other church . He thinks that theocracy must have been universal among early tribes , " for as soon as a nation has chosen a tutelary god , that god has priests . These priests govern the spirit of the nation ; they can govern only in the name of their god , so they make him speak continually ; they set forth his oracles , and all things are done by God ' s express commands . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the more divine such a government calls itself , the more abominable it is. @# All prophets are imposters . Mahomet may have begun as an enthusiast , enamored of his own ideas ; but he was soon led away by his reveries ; he deceived himself in deceiving others ; and finally supported a doctrine which he believed to be good , by necessary imposture . Socrates , who pretended to have a familiar spirit , must have been a little crazy , or a little given to swindling . As for Moses , he is a myth , a form of the Indian Bacchus . The Koran ( and consequently the Bible ) may be judged by the ignorance of physics which it displays . " This is the touchstone of the books which , according to false religions , were written by the Deity , for God is neither absurd nor ignorant . " Several volumes are devoted by Voltaire to showing the inconsistencies , absurdities and atrocities of the Old and New Testaments , and the abominations of the Jews. @# The positive religious opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of this great writer was mainly to destroy . He was a theist , of wavering and doubtful faith . He was well aware that any profession of atheism might be dangerous , and likely to injure him at court and with some of his friends . He thought that belief in God and in a future life were important to the safety of society , and is said to have sent the servant out of the room on one occasion when one of the company was doubting the existence of the Deity , giving as a reason that he did not want to have his throat cut . Yet it is probable that his theism went a little deeper than this . He says that matter is probably eternal and self-existing , and that God is everlasting , and self-existing likewise . Are there other Gods for other worlds ? It may be so ; some nations and some scholars have believed in the existence of two gods , one good and one evil . Surely , nature can more easily suffer , in the immensity of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own portion , than two limited gods in this world , one confined to doing good , the other to doing evil . If God and matter both exist from eternity , " here are two necessary entities ; and if there be two there may be thirty . We must confess our ignorance of the nature of divinity. " @# It is noticeable that , like most men on whom the idea of God does not take a very strong hold , Voltaire imagined powers in some respects superior to Deity . Thus he says above that nature can more easily suffer several independent gods than two opposed ones . Having supposed one or several gods to put the universe in order , he supposes an order anterior to the gods . This idea of a superior order , Fate , Necessity , or Nature , is a very old one . It is probably the protest of the human mind against those anthropomorphic conceptions of God , from which it is almost incapable of escaping . Voltaire and the Philosophers almost without exception believed that there was a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taught to man by instinct . Sometimes in their system God was placed above this law , as its origin ; sometimes , as we have seen , He was conceived as subjected to Nature . " God has given us a principle or universal reason , " says Voltaire , " as He has given feathers to birds and fur to bears ; and this principle is so lasting that it exists in spite of all the passions which combat it , in spite of the tyrants who would drown it in blood , in spite of the impostors who would annihilate it in superstition . Therefore the rudest nation always judges very well in the long run concerning the laws that govern it ; because it feels that these laws either agree or disagree with the principles of pity and justice which are in its heart . " Here we have something which seems like an innate idea of virtue . But we must not expect complete consistency of Voltaire . In another place he says , " Virtue and vice , moral good and evil , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ; and in all times and in all places he who sacrifices the most to the public is the man who will be called the most virtuous . Whence it appears that good actions are nothing else than actions from which we derive an advantage , and crimes are but actions that are against us . Virtue is the habit of doing the things which please mankind , and vice the habit of doing things which displease it . Liberty , he says elsewhere , is nothing but the power to do that which our wills necessarily require of us .

Morley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the arguments that are still repeated nowadays concerning the Mosaic account of the creation , etc. etc. , come from Voltaire . Notice also that Voltaire , while too incredulous of ancient writers , was too credulous of modern travelers. @# The Church of France was both angered and alarmed by the writings of Voltaire and his friends , and did her feeble best to reply to them . But while strong in her organization and her legal powers , her internal condition was far from vigorous . Incredulity had become fashionable even before the attacks of Voltaire were dangerous . An earlier satirist has put into the mouth of a priest an account of the difficulties which beset the clergy in those days . " Men of the world , " he says , " are astonishing . They can bear neither our approval nor our censure . If we wish to correct them , they think us ridiculous . If we approve of them , they consider us below our calling . Nothing is so humiliating as to feel that you have shocked the impious .

The state of neutrality is difficult .

That happy and tranquil condition which is so much praised we do not enjoy in society . As soon as we appear , we are obliged to discuss . We are forced , for instance , to undertake to prove the utility of prayer to a man who does not believe in God ; the necessity of fasting to another who all his life has denied the immortality of the soul . The task is hard , and the laugh is not on our side . " Footnote : Montesquieu , Lettres persanes , i. 210 , 211 , Lettre lxi. @# The prelates appointed to their high offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make good their cause by spiritual weapons . There was no Bossuet , no Fenelon in the Church of France of the eighteenth century . Her defense was intrusted to far weaker men . First we have the archbishops , Lefranc de Pompignan of Vienne and Elie de Beaumont of Paris . Then come the Jesuit Nonnotte and the managers of the Memoires de Trevoux , the Benedictine Chaudon , the Abbe Trublet , the journalist Freron , and many others , lay and clerical . The answers of the churchmen to their Philosophic opponents are generally inconclusive . Lefranc de Pompignan declared that the love of dry and speculative truth was a delusive fancy , good to adorn an oration , but never realized by the human heart . He sneered at Locke and at the idea that the latter had invented metaphysics . His objections and those of the Catholic church to that philosopher ' s teachings were chiefly that the Englishman maintained that thought might be an attribute of matter ; that he encouraged Pyrrhonism , or universal doubt ; that his theory of identity was doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these matters are well open to discussion , and the advantage might not always be found on Locke ' s side . But in general the Catholic theologians and their opponents were not sufficiently agreed to be able to argue profitably . They had no premises in common . If one of two disputants assumes that all ideas are derived from sensation and reflection , and the other , that the most important of them are the result of the inspiration of God , there is no use in their discussing minor points until those great questions are settled . The attempt to reconcile views so conflicting has frequently been made , and no writings are more dreary than those which embody it . But men who are too far apart to cross swords in argument may yet hurl at each other the missiles of vituperation , and there were plenty of combatants to engage in that sort of warfare with Voltaire , Rousseau , and the Encyclopaedists. @# On the two sides , treatises , comedies , tales , and epigrams were written . It was not difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church were inconsistent with each other ; that Rousseau contradicted Voltaire , that Voltaire contradicted himself . There were many weak places in the armor of those warriors . Pompignan discourses at great length , dwelling more especially on the worship which the Philosophers paid to physical science , on their love of doubt , and on their mistaken theory that a good Christian can not be a patriot . Chaudon , perhaps the cleverest of the clerical writers , sometimes throws a well directed shaft . " That same Voltaire , " he says , " who thinks that satires against God are of no consequence , attaches great importance to satires written against himself and his friends . He is unwilling to see the pen snatched from the hands of the slanderers of the Deity ; but he has often tried to excite the powers that be against the least of his critics . " This was very true of Voltaire , who was as thin-skinned as he was violent ; and who is believed to have tried sometimes to silence his opponents by the arbitrary method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have them locked up . Palissot , in a very readable comedy , makes fun of Diderot and his friends . As for invective , the supply is endless on both sides . The Archbishop of Paris condemns the " Emile " of Rousseau as containing a great many propositions that are " false , scandalous , full of hatred of the church and her ministers , erroneous , impious , blasphemous , and heretical . " The same prelate argues as follows : " Who would not believe , my very dear brethren , from what this impostor says , that the authority of the church is proved only by her own decisions , and that she proceeds thus : I decide that I am infallible , therefore so I am . ' A calumnious imputation , my very dear brethren ! The constitution of Christianity , the spirit of the Scriptures , the very errors and the weakness of the human mind tend to show that the church established by Jesus Christ is infallible . We declare that , as the Divine Legislator always taught the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the church , not by the church ' s authority , but by that of Jesus Christ , a process as accurate as the other , with which we are reproached , is absurd and senseless. " @# The arguments of the clerical writers were not all on this level . Chaudon and Nonnotte prepared a series of articles , arranged in the form of a dictionary , in which the Catholic doctrine is set forth , sometimes clearly and forcibly . But it is evident that the champions of Catholicism in that age were no match in controversy for her adversaries .

When they are few , timid and uninfluential , knowledge and power , nay , simple piety itself , can hardly support her . In the Church of France , through the ages , there have been many saints ; but in the reigns of Louis XVI. and his immediate predecessor there were but few , and none of prominence .

It is a mistake , however , to suppose that this word bears on the Continent exactly the same meaning as in England . Where all the children of a nobleman are nobles , a strict class is created . An English peerage , descending only to the eldest son , is more in the nature of an office . The French noblesse in the latter years of the old monarchy comprised nearly all persons living otherwise than by their daily toil , together with the higher part of the legal profession . While the clergy had political rights and a corporate existence , and acted by means of an assembly , the nobility had but privileges . This , however , was true only of the older provinces , the " Lands of Elections , " whose ancient rights had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estates , " which still kept a remnant of self-government , the order was to some extent a political body with constitutional rights. @# The nobility have been reckoned at about one hundred thousand souls , forming twenty-five or thirty thousand families , owning one fifth of the soil of France . Only a part of this land , however , was occupied by the nobles for their gardens , parks , and chases . The greater portion was let to farmers , either at a fixed rent , or on the metayer system , by which the landlord was paid by a share of the crops . And beside his rent or his portion , the noble received other things from his tenants : payments and services according to ancient custom , days of labor , and occasional dues . He could tramp over the ploughed lands with his servants in search of game , although he might destroy the growing corn . The game itself , which the peasant might not kill , was still more destructive . Such rights as these , especially where they were harshly enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although there were far too many absentees among the great families , yet the larger number of the nobles spent most of their time at home on their estates , looking after their farms and their tenants , attending to local business , and saving up money to be spent in visits to the towns , or to Paris . When they were absent , their bailiffs were harder masters than themselves . Unfortunately the eyes of the noble class were turned rather to the enjoyments of the city and the court than to the duties of country life on their estates , an inevitable consequence of their loss of local power. @# If the nobles had few political rights , they had plenty of public privileges . They were exempt from the most onerous taxes , and the best places under the government were reserved for them . Therefore every man who rose to eminence or to wealth in France strove to enter their ranks , and since nobility was a purchasable commodity , through the multiplication of venal offices which conferred it , none who had much money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order had come to comprise almost all persons of note , and a great part of the educated class . To describe its ideas and aspirations is to describe those of most of the leaders of France . Nobility was no longer a mark of high birth , nor a brevet of distinction ; it was merely a sign that a man , or some of his ancestors , had had property . Of course all persons in the order were not equal . The descendants of the old families , which had been great in the land for hundreds of years , despised the mushroom noblemen of yesterday , and talked contemptuously of " nobility of the gown . " Theirs was of the sword , and dated from the Crusades . And under Louis XVI. , after the first dismissal of Necker , there was a reaction , and ground gained by the older nobility over the newer , and by both over the inferior classes . As the Revolution draws near and financial embarrassment grows more acute , the pickings of the favored class have become scarcer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church or state must no longer go to the vulgar. @# There is a distinction among nobles quite apart from the length of their pedigree . We find a higher and a lower nobility , with no clear line of division between them . They are in fact the very rich , whose families have some prominence , and the moderately well off . For it may be noticed that among nobles of all times and countries , although wealth unaided may not give titles and place , it is pretty much a condition precedent for acquiring them . A man may be of excellent family , and poor ; but to be a great noble , a man must be rich . In old France the road to preferment was through the court ; but to shine at court a considerable income was required ; and so the noblesse de cour was more or less identical with the richer nobility. @# In this small but influential part of the nation , both the good and the bad qualities which are favored by court life had reached a high degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exhibiting the best of manners and the worst of morals . I believe that both sides of the picture have been painted in too high colors . The courtier was not always polite , nor were all great nobles libertines . Faithful husbands and wives were by no means exceptional ; although , as in other places , well behaved people did not make a parade of their morality . There is such a thing as a French prig ; but prigs are neither common nor popular in France . Before the Revolution the art of pleasing was more studied than it is to-day ,  --  that art by which men and women make themselves agreeable to their acquaintance. @# " In old times , under Louis XV. and Louis XVI. , " says the Viscount of Segur , " a young man entering society made what was called a debut . He cultivated accomplishments . His father suggested and directed this work , for work it was ; but the mother , the mother only , could bring her son to that last degree of politeness , of grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural tenderness , her pride was so much at stake that you may judge what care , what studied pains , she used in giving her children , on their entrance into society , all the charm that she could develop in them , or bestow upon them . Thence came that rare politeness , that exquisite taste , that moderation in speech and jest , that graceful carriage , in short that combination which characterized what was called good company , and which always distinguished French society even among foreigners . If a young man , because of his youth , had failed in attention to a lady , in consideration for a man older than himself , in deference for old age , the mother of the thoughtless young fellow was informed of it by her friends the same evening ; and on the following day he was sure to receive advice and reproof . " Footnote : The Viscount of Segur was brother to the Count of Segur , from the preface to whose Memoirs this extract is taken. @# The instruction thus early given was not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably less formal in some ways than any other European society ; and in Paris people were more free than in the provinces . Although making a bow was a fine art , although a lady ' s curtsey was expected to be at once " natural , soft , modest , gracious , and dignified , " ceremonious greetings were considered unnecessary , and few compliments were paid . To praise a woman ' s beauty to her face would have been to disparage her modesty . Good manners consisted in no small part in distinguishing perfectly what was due to every one , and in expressing that distinction with lightness and grace . Different modes of address were appropriate toward parents , relations , friends , acquaintances , strangers , your superiors in rank , your poor dependents , yet all must be treated with courtesy and consideration . Such manners are possible only where social distinctions are positively ascertained . In old France , at least , every man had his place and knew where he was. @# But it was in their dealings with ladies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Vicious they might be , but discourteous they were not . No well-bred man would then appear in a lady ' s room carelessly dressed , or in boots . In speech between the sexes , the third person was generally used , and a gentleman in speaking to a lady dropped his voice to a lower tone than he employed to men . Gentlemen were careful before ladies not to treat even each other with familiarity . Still less would one of them , however intimate he might be with a lady ' s husband or brother , speak to her of his friend by any name less formal than his title . These habits have left their mark in France and elsewhere to this day ; but the mark is fast disappearing , not altogether to the advantage of social life . Footnote : Genlis , Dictionnaire des Etiquettes , i. 94 , 218 ; ii. 194 , 347. @# Friendship between men was sometimes carried so far as to interfere with the claims of domestic affection . At least it was faithful and sincere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , or the disgraced courtier , was followed in his adversity by the kindness of his friends . Of all the virtues this is perhaps the one which in our hurried age tends most to disappear . It is left for the occupation of idle hours , and the smallest piece of triviality which can be tortured into the name of business , is allowed to crowd away those constantly repeated attentions which might add a true grace and refinement to the lives of those who gave and of those who received them . It is often said that friendships are formed only in youth . Is not this partly because youth Revolution , men of all ages made friendships , and supported them by the consideration for others which is at the bottom of all politeness . The Frenchman is nervous and irritable . When he lets his temper get beyond his control , he is fierce and violent . He has little of the easy-going good-nature under inconveniences , which some branches of the Teutonic race believe themselves to possess . He has less kindly merriment than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and has learned , when on his good behavior , to make others happy about him . And it is part of the well-bred Frenchman ' s pride and happiness to be almost always on his good behavior. @# In one respect Paris in the eighteenth century was more like a provincial town than like a great modern capital . Acquaintanceship had not swallowed up intimacy . A man or a woman did not undertake to keep on terms of civility with so many people that he could not find time to see his best friends oftener than once or twice a year . The much vaunted salons of the old monarchy were charming , in great measure because they were reasonably organized . An agreeable woman would draw her friends about her ; they would meet in her parlor until they knew each other , and would be together often enough to keep touch intellectually . The talker knew his audience and felt at home with it . The listener had learned to expect something worth hearing . The mistress of the house kept language and men within bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bores . But even French wit and vivacity were not always equal to the demands upon them . " I remember , " says Montesquieu , " that I once had the curiosity to count how many times I should hear a little story , which certainly did not deserve to be told or remembered ; during three weeks that it occupied the polite world , I heard it repeated two hundred and twenty-five times , which pleased me much . " Footnote : Oeuvres , vii 179 ( Pensees diverses ) . @# Beside the tie of friendship we may set that of the family . In old France this bond was much closer than it is in modern America . If a man rose in the world , the benefit to his relations was greater than now ; and there was no theory current that a ruler , or a man in a position of trust , should exclude from the places under him those persons with whom he is best acquainted , and of whose fidelity to himself and to his employers he has most reason to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one member of a family spread its blight on all the others , and the judicial condemnation of one man might exclude his near relations from the public service  --  a state of things which was beginning to be repugnant to the public conscience , but which had at least the merit of forming a strong band to restrain the tempted from his contemplated crime. @# In fact , the old idea of the family as an organic whole , with common joys , honors , and responsibilities , common sorrows and disgraces , was giving way to the newer notion of individualism . In France , however , the process never went so far as it has done in some other countries , including our own. @# Good manners were certainly the rule at the French court , but there were exceptions , and not inconspicuous ones , for Louis XV. was an unfeeling man , and Louis XVI. was an awkward one . When Mademoiselle Genet , fifteen years old , was first engaged as reader to the former king ' s daughters , she was in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourning , and the great rooms hung with black , the state armchairs on platforms , several steps above the floor , the feathers and the shoulder-knots embroidered with tinsel made a deep impression on her . When the king first approached , she thought him very imposing . He was going a-hunting , and was followed by a numerous train .

The Count of Osmont , for instance , was continually fidgeting with anything that might come under his hand , and could not see a snuff-box without ladling out the snuff with three fingers , and sprinkling it over his clothes like a Swiss porter . He sometimes varied this pleasant performance by putting the box itself under his nose , to the great disgust of whomever happened to be its owner . He once spent a week at the house of Madame de Vassy , a lady who was young and good-looking enough , but stiff and ceremonious . This lady wore a skirt of crimson velvet over a big panier , and was covered with pearls and diamonds .

Footnote : Dufort , ii. 46. @# That which above all things distinguished the French nobility , and especially the highest ranks of it , from the rest of mankind was the amount of leisure which it enjoyed . Most people in the world have to work , most aristocracies to govern The English gentleman of the eighteenth century farmed his estates , acted as a magistrate , took part in politics . Living in the country , he was a mighty hunter . The French nobleman , unless he were an officer in the army ( and even the officers had inordinately long leave of absence ) , had nothing to do but to kill time . Only the poorer country gentlemen ever thought of farming their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was but occasional sport to be had . Indeed , the Frenchman , although he likes the more violent and tumultuous kinds of hunting , is not easily interested in the quieter and more lasting varieties of sport . He will joyfully chase the wild boar , when horses , dogs , and horns , with the admiration of his friends and servants , concur to keep his blood boiling ; but he will not care to plod alone through the woods for a long afternoon on the chance of bringing home a brace of woodcock ; nor can he mention fishing without a sneer . Being thus deprived of the chief resource by which Anglo-Saxons combine activity and indolence , the French nobility cultivated to their highest pitch those human pleasures which are at once the most vivid and the most delicate . They devoted themselves to society and to love-making . Too quick-witted to fall into sloth , too proud to become drunkards or gluttons , they dissipated their lives in conversation and stained their souls with intrigue . Never , probably , have the arts which make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excellence as among them . Never perhaps , in a Christian country , have offenses against the laws of marriage been so readily condoned , where outward decency was not violated , as in the upper circles of France in the century preceding the Revolution. @# The vice of Parisian society under Louis XV. and his grandson presented a curious character . Adultery had acquired a regular standing , and connections dependent upon it were openly , if tacitly recognized . Such illicit alliances were even governed by a morality of their own , and the attempt to induce a woman to be unfaithful to her criminal lover might be treated as an insult . Footnote : Witness Rousseau and Mme. d ' Houdetot in the Confessions . Mlle. d ' Aydie was accounted very virtuous for dissuading her lover from marrying her , even after the birth of her child , for fear of injuring his prospects . Yet the match would not seem , to modern ideas , to have been a very unequal one . But this pedantry of vice was not always maintained . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very frequently , yielding to the caprice of the moment , as the senses or the wit might lead them . Such people were not passionate , but simply depraved ; yet the mass of the community , deterred partly by fear of ridicule , and partly by the Philosophic spirit which had decided that chastity was not a part of natural morals , did not visit them with very severe condemnation. @# If eccentricity sometimes overrode etiquette and even politeness , good morals and religion not infrequently made a stand against corruption . There were loving wives and careful mothers among the highest nobility . Of the Duchess of Ayen we get a description from her children . Her mansion was in the Rue St. Honore , and had a garden running back almost to that of the Tuileries ( for the Rue de Rivoli was not then in existence ) . The house was known for the beauty of its apartments , and for the superb collection of pictures which it contained . After dinner , which was served at three o ' clock , the duchess would retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damask , and take her place in a great armchair by the fire . Her books , her work , her snuff-box , were within reach . She would call her five girls about her . These , on chairs and footstools , squabbling gently at times for the places next their mother , would tell of their excursions , their lessons , the little events of every day . There was nothing frivolous in their education . Their old nurse had not filled their minds with fairy tales , but with stories from the Old Testament and with anecdotes of heroic actions. @# The pleasures of these girls were simple . Once or twice in a summer they went on a visit to their grandfather , the Marshal de Noailles at Saint Germain en Laye . In the autumn they spent a week with their other grandfather , Monsieur d ' Aguesseau at Fresnes . An excursion into the suburbs , a ride on donkeys on the slopes of Mont Valerien , made up their innocent dissipations . Their most frivolous excitement was to see their governess fall off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects appear extravagant . Her fourth daughter had two beggars of the parish for god-parents , as a constant reminder of humility . The same child was of a violent and willful disposition , but was converted at the age of eleven and became mild , patient , and studious . The conversion of so young a sinner , and the seriousness with which the event was treated by the family , seem rather to belong to the atmosphere of Puritanism than to that of the Catholicism of the eighteenth century . But if the religion of the Duchess of Ayen sometimes led her to fantastic extremes , these were not its principal characteristics . Her piety was applied to the conduct of her daily life and to the education of her daughters in honesty , reasonableness , and self-devotion . Their faith and hers were to be tested by the hardest trials , and to be victorious both in prison and on the scaffold . We are fortunate in possessing their biographies .

Sometimes we find them on friendly terms with the villagers , acting as godfathers and godmothers to the children , summoning the peasants to take part in the chase , or to dance in the courtyard of the castle . We find them endowing hospitals , giving alms , keeping an eye on the conduct of the village priest . A continual interchange of presents goes on between the cottage and the great house . A new lord is welcomed by salvos of musketry , the ladies of his family are met by young girls bearing flowers . Such relations as these are said to have grown less common as the great Revolution drew near . It has often been remarked of the Vendee and Brittany , where a larger proportion of lords resided on their estates than was the case elsewhere , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower classes ; and that it was in those provinces that a stand was made by lords and peasants alike for the maintenance of the old order of things . In some parts of the country the peasants and their lords were continually quarreling and going to law . The royal intendant was besieged with complaints . The poor could not get their pay for their work . They received blows instead of money . Arrogance and injustice on the one side were met by impudence and fraud on the other . The old leadership had passed away . The upper class had lost its power and its responsibility ; it insisted the more tenaciously on its privileges . Exemption from certain taxes was the chief of these , but there were others as irritating if less important . Quarrels arose with the priest about the lord ' s right to be first given the holy water . One vicar in his wrath deluged his lordship ' s new wig. @# In general , we may conceive of the lesser nobles , deprived of their useful function of regulating and administering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hunted a good deal , they slept long . Generally they did not eat overmuch , for gluttony is not a vice of their race . They grumbled at the ascendency of the court , and at the new army-regulations . They preserved in their families the noble virtues of dignity and obedience . Children asked their parents ' blessing on their knees before they went to bed . The elder Mirabeau , the grim Friend of Men , still knelt nightly before his mother in his fiftieth year . The children honored their parents in fact as well as in form , and took no important step in life without paternal consent . The boys ran rather wild in their youth , but settled down at the approach of middle life ; the oldest inheriting the few or barren paternal acres ; the younger sons equally noble , and thus debarred from lucrative occupations , pushing their fortunes in the army . The girls were married young or went into a convent . Marriages were arranged entirely by the parents . " My father , " said a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a marriage for me .

Its privileges were claimed on account of services rendered in the field . The priests pray , the nobles fight , the commons pay for all ; such was the theory of the state . It is true that the nobility no longer furnished the larger part of the armies ; that the old feudal levies of ban and rear-ban , in which the baron rode at the head of his vassals , were no longer called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the proper career of the nobleman . A large proportion of the members of the order were commissioned officers , and most officers were members of the order. @# The rule which required proofs of nobility as a prerequisite to obtaining a commission was not severely enforced in the reign of Louis XV. , and in the earlier years of his successor . In many regiments it was usual to promote one or two deserving sergeants every year . In others the necessary certificate of birth could be signed by any nobleman and was often obtained from greed or good-nature . Moreover , an order of 1750 had provided that officers of plebeian extraction should sometimes be ennobled for distinguished services . But in 1781 , a new rule was established . No one could thenceforth receive a commission as second lieutenant who could not show four generations of nobility on his father ' s side , counting himself . Thus were all members of families recently ennobled excluded from the service , and no door was left open to the military ambition of people belonging to the middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , strict genealogical proofs were required , the candidate for a commission having to submit his papers to the royal herald . Exceptions were made in favor of the sons of members of the military order of Saint Louis . Footnote : Segur , i. 82 , 158 . Cherest , i. 14 . Anciennes lois francaises , 22d May , 1781 . The regiments to which the regulation applies are those of French infantry ( not foreign regiments ) , cavalry , light horse , dragoons , and chasseurs a cheval . This would seem to exclude the artillery and engineers . The foreign regiments appear to have been included in a later order . Cherest , i. 24. @# But all nobles were not on the same footing in the army . Among the regimental officers two classes might be distinguished . There were , on the one hand , the ensigns , lieutenants , captains , majors , and lieutenant-colonels , who generally belonged to the poorer nobility . They served long and for small pay , with little hope of the more brilliant rewards of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiments , although leave of absence was not difficult to obtain in time of peace . Their lives were hard and frugal , a captain ' s pay not exceeding twenty-five hundred livres , which was perhaps doubled by allowances . On the other hand were the colonels and second colonels , young men of influential families , who , at most , passed through the lower ranks to learn something of the duties of an officer . Their commissions were procured by favor . There was scarce a bishop about the court who did not have a candidate for a colonelcy , scarcely a pretty woman who did not aspire to make her friend a captain . The rich young men , thus promoted , threw their money about freely in camp and garrison . Thus if the nobility had exclusive privileges , the court had privileges that excluded those of the rest of the nobility , and in the very last days of the old monarchy , these also were enhanced . The Board of War in 1788 , decided that no one should become a general officer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions , besides being very expensive , were given , as above stated , by favor alone . Thus on the eve of the Revolution were the bands of privilege drawn tighter in France . Footnote : Segur , i. 154 . Cherest , ii. 90 . The colonels thus appointed were generally not wanting in courage . The French nobility of all degrees was ready enough to give its blood on the battle-field . Thus the son of the Duke of Boufflers , fourteen years old , had been made colonel of the regiment which bore the name of his family . The duke served as a lieutenant-general in the same army . Fearing that the boy might not know how to behave in battle , the father , on the first occasion , obtained permission from the Marshal , Maurice de Saxe , commander of the army , to accompany his son as a volunteer . The boy ' s regiment was ordered to attack the intrenched village of Raucoux . The young colonel and his father , followed by two pages , led their men against the intrenchments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son in his arms and threw him over the parapet . He himself followed , and both came off unhurt , but the two pages were shot dead . Footnote : Montbarey , i. 38. @# In America , as in Europe , the young favorites of fortune were ready enough to fight . Such men as Lauzun , Segur , or the Viscount of Noailles asked nothing better than adventures , whether of war or love ; but in peace they could not be looked on as satisfactory or hard-working officers . Yet they and their like continued to get advancement . Ordinances might be passed from time to time , requiring age or length of service , but ordinances in old France did not apply to the great . The poorer nobility might grumble , but the court families continued to get the good places . The lieutenant-colonels and the other working officers of the army had but little chance of rising to be general officers . Even before the order of 1788 , promotion fell to the courtier colonels . The baton of the marshals of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility . All over Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , armies were often commanded by men born to princely rank . That this did not necessarily mean that they were ill commanded may be shown by the names of Turenne and Conde , Maurice de Saxe and Eugene of Savoy , Prince Henry of Prussia I and Frederick the Great. @# While the higher commands were thus monopolized ( or nearly so ) by the rich and powerful , the poorer nobility flocked into the army , to occupy the subordinate ranks of commissioned officers . Sometimes they came through the military schools . The most important of these had been founded at Paris in 1750 , by the financier Paris-Duverney . Here several hundred young gentlemen , mostly born poor and preferably the sons of officers , received a military education . The boys came to the school from their homes in the country between the ages of nine and eleven , rustic little figures sometimes , in wooden shoes and woolen caps , like the peasant lads who had been their early playmates . They were taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright carriage , the manual and tactics , and something of military science . Other schools , kept by monks , existed in the provinces where the young aspirants for commissions learned engineering and the theory of artillery . But many young a noblemen entered their career by a process more in accordance with youthful tastes . We find boys in camp in time of war , evading the orders which forbade entering the service before the age of sixteen . Children of twelve and thirteen are wounded in battle . Footnote : Babeau , Vie militaire , ii. 7 , 45 . Montbarey , i. 18. @# As the only form of active life in which most nobles could take part was found in the army , there was always too large a number of officers , and too great a proportion of the military expenses was devoted to them . In 1787 hardly more than one in three of those holding commissions was in active service . The number of soldiers under Louis XVI. was less than a hundred and fifty thousand actually with the colors . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed . The soldiers cost the state 44 , 100 , 000 livres a year , the officers 46 , 400 , 000 livres . Footnote : Babeau , Vie militaire , i. 15 ; ii. 90 , 145 . Necker , De l ' Administration , ii. 415 , 418. @# The relation between the officers and the soldiers of the old French army was more intimate and kindly than that existing in any other European army of the time . For both , their regiment was a home , and the military service a lifelong profession . They had entered it young , and they hoped to die in it . Their relation to each other had become a part of the structure of their minds ; a condition of coherent thought . A soldier might rise from the ranks and become a lieutenant , or even a captain , but such promotion was infrequent ; few common soldiers had the education or the means to aspire to it . On the other hand , the command of a company was sometimes almost hereditary . The captain might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that case he would care for them in sickness , and perhaps even grant a furlough when the private was much needed by his family at home . His own chance of promotion was small . He expected to do the work of his life in that company , among those soldiers , with perhaps his younger brother , or , in time , his son , as his lieutenant . It would seem that in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution these kindly relations were in some measure dying out . The captain was no longer so closely connected with his company as he had been . Officialism was taking the place of those personal connections which had characterized the feudal system . The gulf between soldiers and officers , if not harder to cross for the ambitious , separated the commonplace members of each group more widely from those of the other .

They were , nominally at least , volunteers . Unruly lads , mechanics out of work , runaway apprentices , were readily drawn into the service by skillful recruiting officers . Thirty years before , it had been the custom of these landsharks to cheat or bully young men into the service . The raw youth , arriving in Paris from the country , had been offered by a chance acquaintance a place as servant in a gentleman ' s family , and after signing an engagement had found himself bound for eight years to serve His Majesty , in one of his regiments of foot . The young barber-surgeon had waked from a carouse with the king ' s silver in his pocket . Such things were still common in Germany . In France some effort had been made to regulate the activity of the recruiting officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the authorities . The soldiers of Louis XVI. , therefore , were engaged with comparative fairness . The infantry came mostly from the towns , the cavalry and artillery from the country . The soldiers were derived from the lowest part of the population . Whether they improved or deteriorated in the service depended on their officers . In any case they became entirely absorbed in it . The soldier did not keep even the name by which he had been known in common life . He assumed , or was given , a nom de guerre such as La Tulippe , La Tendresse , Pollux , Pot-de-Vin , Vide-bouteille , or Va-de-bon-coeur . His term of service was seven or eight years , but he was by no means sure of getting a fair discharge at the end of it ; and was in any case likely to reenlist . Thus the recruit had , in fact entered upon the profession of his life . Footnote : Babeau , Vie militaire , i. 55 , 136 , 182 . Mercier , x. 273 .

The French soldier of the line wore white clothes with colored trimmings , varying according to his regiment . On his head was perched the triangular cocked hat of the period , standing well out over his ears , but hardly shading his eyes . Beneath it his hair was powdered , or rather , pasted ; for the powder was sifted on to the wet hair , and caked in the process . The condition of the mass after a rainy night at the camp-fire may be imagined . In some regiments the wearing of a moustache was required , and those soldiers whom nature had not supplied with such an ornament were obliged to put on a false one , fastened with pitch , which was liable to cause abcesses on the lip . Sometimes a fine , uniform color was produced in the moustaches of a whole regiment by means of boot-blacking . Broad white belts were crossed upon the breast . The linen gaiters , white on parade , black for the march , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garters impeded the step . It was a tedious matter to put these things on ; and if a pebble got in through a button-hole , the soldier was tempted to leave it in his shoe , until it had made his foot sore . Uniforms were seldom renewed . The coat was expected to last three years , the hat two , the breeches one . Footnote : Babeau , Vie militaire , i. 93 . Encyc. meth .

See also a very interesting little book by a great man , Maurice de Saxe , Les Reveries. @# All parts of the soldier ' s uniform were tight and close fitting . I think that this was learned from the Prussians . The ideal of the army as a machine seems to have originated , or at least to have been first worked out in Germany . Such an ideal was a natural consequence of the military system of the age . Of the soldiers of Frederick the Great only one-half were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners as they could . In the French army were many regiments of foreign mercenaries . Nowhere was the pay high , or the soldier well treated . Desertion was very common . Under these circumstances mechanical precision became an invaluable quality . The soldier must be held in very strict bands , for if left free he might turn against the power that employed him. @# The connection between a rigid system in which nothing is left to the soldier ' s intelligence or initiative , and a tight uniform , which confines his movements , is both deep and evident . If a man is never to have his own way , his master will inevitably find means to make him needlessly uncomfortable . As the modern owner of a horse sometimes diminishes the working power of the animal by check-reins and martingales , so the despot of the eighteenth century buckled and buttoned his military cattle into shape , and made them take unnatural paces . But even under these disadvantages the French soldiers surpassed all others in grace and ease of bearing . Officers were sometimes accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evolutions of the troops involved steps more appropriate to the dancing-master than to the drill sergeant . Footnote : Montbarey , ii. 272 . Such criticisms as these have often been made on the French soldier by his own countrymen and by foreigners . But those who think he can be trifled with on this account , are apt to find themselves terribly mistaken. @# The food of the soldiers was coarse and barely sufficient . The pay was so absorbed by the requirements of the uniform , many of the smaller parts of which were at the expense of the men , and by the diet , that little was left for the almost necessary comforts of drink and tobacco . The barracks , handsome outside , were close and crowded within . During this reign orders were given that only two men should sleep in a bed . In some garrisons soldiers were still billeted on the inhabitants . In sickness they were better cared for than civilians , the military hospitals being decidedly better than those open to the general public .

Footnote : Babeau , Vie militaire , i. 374 @# " The soldiers are very clean , " writes an English traveler in France in the year 1789 ; " so far from being meagre and ill-looking fellows , as John Bull would persuade us , they are well-formed , tall , handsome men , and have a cheerfulness and civility in their countenances and manner which is peculiarly pleasing . They also looked very healthy , great care is taken of them . " Footnote : Rigby , 13. @# The period of twenty-five years that preceded the Revolution was a time of attempted reform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' War had served as a lesson . The Duke of Choiseul , the able minister of Louis XV. , abolished many abuses . The manoeuvres of the troops became more regular , the discipline stricter and more exact for a time . The Duke of Aiguillon ousted Choiseul , by making himself the courtier of the strumpet Du Barry , and things appear to have slipped back . Then the old king died , and Aiguillon followed his accomplice into exile . Louis XVI. found his finances in disorder , his army and navy demoralized . The death of the minister of war in 1775 gave him the opportunity to make one of his well-meant and feeble attempts at reform . He called to the ministry an old soldier , the Count of Saint-Germain , who had for some time been living in retirement . The count had seen much foreign service , was in full sympathy neither with the French army nor with the French court , and was moreover a man who had little knack at getting on with anybody . He had written a paper on military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in office , he attacked some crying abuses , especially the privileges granted to favored regiments and favored persons . While he disgusted the court in this way , he raised a storm of indignation in the army by his love of foreign innovations , and especially of one practice considered deeply degrading . This was the punishment of minor offenses by flogging with the flat of the sword ; using a weapon especially made for that purpose . The arguments in favor of this punishment are obvious . It is expeditious ; it is disagreeable to the sufferer , but does not rob the state of his services , nor subject him to the bad influences and foul air of the guard-house . The objections are equally apparent . Flogging , which seems the most natural and simple of punishments to many men in an advanced state of civilization , is hated by others , hardly more civilized , with a deadly hatred . In the former case it inflicts but a moderate injury upon the skin ; in the latter , it strikes deep into the mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which way a nation will take it . The English soldier of Waterloo , like the German of Rossbach , received the lash almost as a joke . The Frenchman , their unsuccessful opponent on those fields , could hardly endure it . Grenadiers wept at inflicting the sword stroke , and their colonel mingled his tears with theirs . " Strike with the point , " cried a soldier , " it hurts less ! " @# To some of the foreigners in the French service this sensitiveness seemed absurd . The Count of Saint-Germain consulted , on the subject , a major of the regiment of Nassau , who had risen from the ranks . " Sir , " said the veteran , " I have received a great many blows ; I have given a great many , and all to my advantage . " Footnote : Segur , i. 80 . Mercier , vii. 212 . Besenval , ii. 19 .

The Count of Segur tells a story of such an one ; and although no name be given , he seems to point to the brother-in-law of Lafayette , the brave Viscount of Noailles. @# " One morning , " says Segur , " I saw a young man of one of the first families of the court enter my bedroom . I had been his friend from childhood . He had long hated study , and thought only of pleasure , play , and women . But recently he had been seized with military ardor , and dreamed but of arms , horses , school of theory , exercises , and German discipline. @# " As he came into my room , he looked profoundly serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we were alone : What is the meaning , my dear Viscount , ' said I , of so early a visit and so grave a beginning ?

It will undoubtedly seem very strange to you ; but it is necessary in order to enlighten me on the great subject we are all discussing ; we can judge well only of what we have ourselves undergone . When I tell you my plan you will feel at once that I could intrust it only to my best friend , and that none but he can help me to execute it . In a word , here is the case : I want to know positively what effect strokes with the flat of the sword may have on a strong , courageous , well-balanced man , and how far his obstinacy could bear this punishment without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say " Enough. " ' @# " Bursting out laughing at this speech , I did all I could to turn him aside from his strange plan , and to convince him of the folly of his proposal ; but it was useless .

So I set to work ; but , to my great astonishment , the sufferer , coldly meditating on the effect of each blow , and collecting all his courage to support it , spoke not a word and constrained himself to appear unmoved ; so that it was only after letting me repeat the experiment a score of times that he said : Friend , it is enough . I am contented ; and I now understand that this must be an efficacious method of conquering many faults. ' @# " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point the scene had seemed to me simply comic ; but just as I was about to ring for my valet to dress me , the Viscount , suddenly stopping me , said : One moment , please ; all is not finished ; it is well that you should make this experiment , too. ' @# " I assured him that I had no desire to do so , and that it would by no means change my opinion , which was entirely adverse to an innovation so opposed to the French character. @# " Very well , ' answered he , but I ask it not for your sake but for mine . I know you ; although you are a perfect friend , you are very lively , a little fond of poking fun , and you would perhaps make a very amusing story of what has just happened between us , at my expense , among your ladies. ' @# " But is not my word enough for you ? ' I rejoined. @# " Yes , ' said he , in any more serious matter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscretion , that fear is too much . And so , in the name of friendship , I beg you , set me completely at ease on that point by taking back what you have been kind enough to lend me so gracefully .

France was engaged in but one war during the reign of Louis XVI. , and in that war the land forces were occupied only in America . " The French discipline is such , " writes Lafayette to Washington from Newport , " that chickens and pigs walk between the lines without being disturbed , and that there is in the camp a cornfield of which not one leaf has been touched . " And Rochambeau tells with honest pride of apples hanging on the trees which shaded the soldier ' s tents . " The discipline of the French army , " he says , " has always followed it in all its campaigns . It was due to the zeal of the generals , of the superior and regimental officers , and especially to the good spirit of the soldier , which never failed . " But Rochambeau was a working general , and Lafayette had done his best in France that , as far as was possible , the French commander in America should have working officers under him . Neither in war nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline ; and the discontent which had been caused by the changes above mentioned had not tended to strengthen it in the closing years of the monarchy . " Whatever idea I may have formed of the want of discipline and of the anarchy which reigned among the troops , " says Besenval , " it was far below what I found when I saw them close , " and circumstances confirm the testimony of this not over-trustworthy witness .

He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prime minister to Louis XV. , his friend and cousin . " I have named you to the king , " said the duke , " as the only man who would be able to bring the Dauphiny regiment into a state of discipline .

If I were offering you a favor , you might refuse ; but this is an act of duty , and I have assured the king that you would undertake it. " @# " You do me justice , " answered Brehan . " I will take the command of the regiment , but I must make three conditions . I must have unlimited power to reward and punish ; I must be pardoned if I overstep the regulations ; and if I succeed in bringing the regiment into good condition , I am not to be obliged to keep it for more than a year. " @# His conditions granted , Brehan set out for Marseilles , where the regiment was quartered . On his arrival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconspicuous inn , and , dressed as a civilian , made his way on foot to a coffee-house , which was said to be a favorite lounging-place of the officers of the Dauphiny regiment . Taking a seat , he listened to the conversation going on about him , and soon made out that the insubordinate subalterns were talking about their new colonel , and of the fine tricks they would play him on his arrival . Picking out two young officers who were making themselves particularly conspicuous , he interrupted their conversation. @# " You do not know , " he says , " the man whom you want to drive away . I advise you to mind what you do , or you may get into a scrape. " @# " Who is this jackanapes that dares to give us advice ? " @# " A man who will not stand any rudeness , and who demands satisfaction ! " cries Brehan , unbuttoning his civilian ' s coat and showing his military order of Saint Louis. @# So he goes out with the young fellows , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he chaffs and badgers them . This puts them more and more out of temper , so that when they reach the ground they are very much excited , while he is perfectly cool . He wounds them one after the other ; then , turning to the witnesses : " Gentlemen , " says he , " I believe I have done enough , for a man who has been traveling night and day all the way from Paris . If anybody wants any more , he can easily find me . I am not one of the people who get out of the way. " @# Thereupon he leaves them , goes back to his inn , puts on his uniform , calls on the general commanding the garrison , and sends orders to the officers of the Dauphiny regiment to come and see him . These presently arrive , and are thoroughly astonished when they recognize the man whom they met in the coffee-house , and who has just wounded two of their comrades . But Brehan pretends not to know any of them , speaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bears in case of insubordination , and expresses the hope and conviction that there will be no trouble . He then asks if all the officers of the regiment are present . They answer that two gentlemen are ill . " I will go to see them , " says the new colonel , " and make sure that they are well taken care of . " He does in fact visit his late adversaries , and finds them in great trepidation . They try to make excuses , but Brehan stops them . " I do not want to know about anything that happened before I took command , " he says , " and I am quite sure that henceforth I shall have only a good report to make to the king of all the officers of my regiment , with whom I hope to live on the best of terms.

He restored its discipline and left it when his service was over , much regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 162. @# The lieutenants of the French army were united in an association called the Calotte . The legitimate object of this society was to lick young officers into shape , by obliging them to conform to the rules of politeness and proper behavior , as understood by their class . For this purpose the senior lieutenant of each regiment was the chief of the regimental club , and there was a general chief for the whole army . Offenses against good manners , faults of meanness , or oddity of behavior , were discouraged by admonitions , given privately by the chief , or publicly in the convivial meetings of the club . Moral pressure might be carried so far in an aggravated case , as to cause the culprit to resign his commission . The society in fact represented an organized professional spirit ; and although not recognized by the regulations , was favored by the superior officers .

Not content with moral means , it undertook to enforce its decrees by physical ones ; and it extended its jurisdiction far above the rank of lieutenant. @# At the outbreak of the war between France and England in 1778 , two camps were formed in Normandy and Brittany for the purpose of training the army , and perhaps with some intention of making a descent on the English coast . The young French officers swarmed to these camps and divided their time between drill and pleasure . On one occasion , seats had been reserved on a hill for some Breton ladies , who were to see the manoeuvres . Two colonels , escorting two ladies of the court who had recently arrived from Paris , undertook to appropriate the chairs for their companions . A squabble such as is common on such occasions was the result. @# The Count of Segur , above mentioned , was acting as aide-de-camp to the commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , just as he was going to begin a game of prisoners ' base , two officers who were his friends informed him privately that the Calotte had ordered the two colonels who had given offense on that occasion to be publicly tossed in blankets and that the sentence was about to be carried out . Segur , to gain time , ordered the drummers to beat an alarm . The game was broken up , every officer ran to his colors , and the aide-de-camp hastened to explain the matter to the astonished general . The proposed punishment was deferred and finally prevented ; but the escape from a scandalous breach of discipline had been a narrow one. @# As the Revolution drew nearer , its spirit became evident in the army . The Count of Guibert , the most talented and influential member of the Board of War in 1788 , was the object of satire and epigram . The younger officers conspired to spoil the success of his manoeuvres . The experiments that had been tried , the frequent changes in the regulations , had unsettled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German discipline , they protested that English officers alone , and not the machine-like soldiers of a despot , were the models for freemen . The common soldiers caught the spirit of insubordination from those who commanded them . Especially , the large regiment of French Guards , a highly privileged body , permanently quartered in Paris , was infected with the spirit of revolt . Its men were conspicuous in the early troubles of the Revolution , acting on the side of the mob . Footnote : Cherest , i. 552 . Miot de Melito , i. 3. @# The militia of old France does not call for a long notice . It consisted of from sixty to eighty thousand men , whose chief duty was in garrison in time of war , and who during peace were not kept constantly together , but assembled from time to time for drill . As the term of service was six years , the number of men drawn did not exceed fifteen thousand annually . This was surely no great drain on a population of twenty-six millions . Militia duty was greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men did not volunteer for it , but were drafted ; and because many persons were exempted from the draft . This immunity covered not only the sons of aged parents who were dependent on them for support , but privileged persons of all sorts , from apothecaries to advocates , gentlemen and their servants and game-keepers . The burden was thus thrown entirely on the poorer peasantry . Footnote : Broc , i. 117 ; Babeau , Le Village , 259. @# The navy in the time of Louis XVI. reached a high state of efficiency . The war of 1778 to 1783 was in great measure a naval war , and although the French and their allies were worsted in some of the principal actions , the general result may be held to have been favorable to them . The navy at the outbreak of hostilities consisted of about seventy ships of the line , and as many frigates and large corvettes , with a hundred smaller vessels . These ships were built on admirable models , for the French marine architects were well-trained and skillful ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design . The invention of coppering the ships ' bottoms , and thus adding to their speed , although generally practiced in England , had been applied in France only to the smaller part of the navy . The French , however , had an advantage over the English in the fact that ships of the same nominal class were in reality larger and broader of beam among the former than among the latter , so that the French were sometimes able to fight their lower batteries in rough water , when the English had to keep their lower ports closed. @# The naval officers of France were almost all noblemen , and received a careful professional training . Yet the practice of transferring officers of high rank from the army to the navy had not been completely abandoned . Thus d ' Estaing , who commanded with little distinction on the North American coast in 1778 , was no sailor , but a lieutenant-general , artificially turned into a vice-admiral . Such cases , however , were not common , and in general the French commanders erred rather by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional training . In the navy , as elsewhere , no great original talent was developed during this reign , which was a time of expectation rather than of action. @# The men , like the officers , were good and well-trained , except when the lack of sailors obliged the government to employ soldiers on shipboard . It is noticeable that the seamen bore the rope ' s end with equanimity , although the landsmen were so much offended at flogging with the flat of the sword . Nor do I find any complaint of want of discipline at sea. @# The administration of naval affairs was less satisfactory than the ships or the crews . The magazines were not well provided ; and the stores were probably bad , for the fleets were subject to epidemics . Footnote : Chabaud-Arnault , 189 , 196 , 214 . Charnoek , iii. 222 , 282 Segur , i. 138 . Chevalier. @# In general the navy appears to have suffered less than the army from the fermentation of the public mind .

Prominent in French affairs in the eighteenth century we find the Parliaments , a branch of the old feudal courts of the kings of France , retaining the function of high courts of justice , and playing , moreover , a certain political part . In the Parliament of Paris , on solemn occasions , sat those few members of the highest nobility who held the title of Peers of France . With these came the legal hierarchy of First President , presidents a mortier and counselors , numbering about two hundred . The members were distributed , for the purposes of ordinary business , among several courts , the Great Chamber , five courts of Inquest , two courts of Petitions , etc . Footnote : Grand ' Chambre , Cour des Enquetes , Cour des Requetes . The Parliament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of central France ,  --  too large a part for the convenience of suitors ,  --  but there were twelve provincial parliaments set over other portions of the kingdom . The members of these courts , and of several other tribunals of inferior jurisdiction , formed the magistracy , a body of great dignity and importance. @# We have seen that the church possessed certain political rights ; that it held assemblies and controlled taxes . The political powers of the parliaments were more limited , amounting to little more than the right of solemn remonstrance . Under a strong monarch , like Louis XIV. , this power remained dormant ; under weak kings , like his successors , it became important. @# The method of passing a law in the French monarchy was this . The king , in one of his councils , issued an edict , and sent it to the Parliament of Paris , or to such other Parliaments as it might concern , for registration . If the Parliament accepted the edict , the latter was entered in its books , and immediately promulgated as law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to enter on a contest with the king and his advisers , it refused to register . In that case the king might recede , or he might force the registration . This was done by means of what was called a bed of justice . His Majesty , sitting on a throne ( whence the name of the ceremony ) , and surrounded by his officers of state , personally commanded the Parliament to register , and the Parliament was legally bound to comply . As a matter of fact , it did sometimes continue to remonstrate ; it sometimes adjourned , or ceased to administer justice , by way of protest ; but such a course was looked on as illegal , and severe measures on the part of the king and his counselors  --  the court , as the phrase went ,  --  were to be expected . These measures might take the form of imprisonment of recalcitrant judges , or of exile of the Parliament in a body . Sometimes new courts of justice , more closely dependent on the king ' s pleasure , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Maupeou Parliament under Louis XV. , the Plenary Court of Louis XVI . Had these monarchs been strong men , the new courts would undoubtedly have superseded the old Parliaments altogether ; as it was , they led only to confusion and uncertainty . Footnote : Du Boys , Hist. du droit criminel de la France , ii. 225 , 239. @# Throughout the reign of Louis XV. the Parliament of Paris was fighting against the church , while the court repeatedly changed sides , but oftener inclined to that of clergy . The controversy was theological in its origin , the magistrates being Jansenist in their proclivities , while the Church of France was largely controlled by the Molinist , or Jesuit party . The contest was long and doubtful , neither side obtaining a full victory . It was the fashion in the Philosophic party to represent the whole matter as a miserable squabble . Yet , apart from the importance of the original controversy , which touched the mighty but insoluble questions of predestination and free-will , the quarrel had a true interest for patriotic Frenchmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of religious matters ; the Parliament for the supremacy of law in the state. @# In the reign of Louis XVI. the Parliament was principally engaged in struggles of another character . The magistrates were members of a highly privileged class . Their battle was arrayed for vested rights against reforms . From the time of Turgot to that of Lomenie de Brienne and the Notables , the Parliament of Paris , sometimes in sympathy with the nation , sometimes against it , was vigorously resisting innovations . Yet so great was the irritation then felt against the royal court that the Parliament generally gained a temporary popularity by its course of opposition. @# The courts of justice , and especially the Parliaments , were controlled by men who had inherited or bought their places . Footnote : Under Louis XIV , the price of a place of president a mortier was fixed at 350 , 000 livres , that of a maitre des requetes at 150 , 000 livres , that of a counselor at 90 , 000 to 100 , 000 livres . The place of First President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , xiii. 53 and n . The general subject of the venality of offices is considered in the chapter on Taxation . This , while offering no guarantee of capacity , assured the independence of the judges . As the places were looked on as property , they were commonly transmitted from father to son , and became the basis of that nobility of the gown which played a large part in French affairs . The owner of a judicial place was obliged to pass an examination in law , before he could assume its duties and emoluments . This examination differed in severity at different times and in the different Parliaments . In the latter part of the eighteenth century it would appear to have been very easy at Paris , but harder in some of the provinces . The Parliaments , in any case , retained control over admission to their own bodies . Although they could not nominate , they could refuse certificates of capacity and morality . They insisted that none but counselors should be admitted to the higher places , and that candidates should be men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where honor should be the only guide , they might be able to live independently of the profits accessory to their labors , which should never have any influence . " This caution was especially necessary as the judges were paid in great measure by the fees , or costs , which under the quaint name of spices were borne by the parties . Originally these fees had in fact consisted of sugar plums , not more than could be eaten in a day , but subsequently they had been commuted and increased until they amounted to considerable sums . Footnote : Bastard d ' Estang , i. 122 , 245 ; Du Boys , 535. @# By requiring pecuniary independence and social position , together with a certain amount of learning and of personal character , the tone of the upper courts was kept good , the magistrates being generally among the most learned , solid , and respectable men in France . They seem also to have been hard-working and honest , although prejudiced in favor of their own privileged class . As the Revolution drew near , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the worship of public opinion , and the love of popularity . We find the Parliament of Paris undergoing , and even courting , the applause of the mob in its own halls of justice . Like the great Assembly which was soon to have in its hands the destinies of France , the most dignified court of justice in the land failed to perceive that the deliberative body that allows itself to be influenced or even interrupted by spectators , will soon , and deservedly , lose respect and power .

Grimm , xi. 314. @# When we pass from the consideration of the political functions of the Parliaments , and of their composition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are struck by the diversity of the law in civil matters , and by its severity in criminal affairs . The kingdom of France , as it existed in the eighteenth century , was made up of many provinces and cities , various in their history . Each one had its local customs and privileges . The complication of rules of procedure and rights of property was almost infinite . The body of the law was derived from sources of two distinct kinds , from feudal custom and from Roman jurisprudence . The customs which arose , or were first noted , in the Middle Ages , originating as , they did in the manners of barbarian tribes , or in the exigencies of a rude state of society , were products of a less civilized condition of the human mind than the laws of Rome . From a very early period , therefore , the most intelligent and educated lawyers all over Europe were struggling , more or less consciously , to bring customary feudal law into conformity with Roman ideas . These legists recognized that in many matters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful question arose , they looked for guidance to the more perfect system . " The Roman law , " they said , " is observed everywhere , not by reason of its authority , but by the authority of reason . " This idea was peculiarly congenial to the tone of thought current in the eighteenth century. @# Even in England the common and customary law was enlarged at that time and adapted to new conditions in accordance with Latin principles , by the genius of Lord Mansfield and other eminent lawyers . In France the process began earlier and lasted longer . Domat , d ' Aguesseau , and Pothier were but the successors of a long line of jurists . By the time of Louis XVI. , some uniformity of principle had been introduced ; but everywhere feudal irregularity still worried the minds of Philosophers and vexed the temper of litigants . The courts were numerous and the jurisdiction often conflicting . The customs were numberless , hardly the same for any two lordships . To the subjects of Louis XVI. , believing as they did that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by man , this state of things seemed anomalous and absurd . " Shall the same case always be judged differently in the provinces and in the capital ? Must the same man be right in Brittany and wrong in Languedoc ? " cries Voltaire . And the inconvenience arising from this excessive variety of legal rights , together with the vexatious nature of some of them , did more perhaps than any other single cause to engender in the men of that time their too great love of uniformity . Footnote : " Servatur ubique jus romanum , non ratione imperii , sed rationis imperio . " Laferriere , i. 82 , 532 . See Ibid. , i. 553 n. , for a list of eighteen courts of extraordinary jurisdiction , and of five courts of ordinary jurisdiction , viz. ; 1 , Parlemens , 2 , Presidiaux , 3 , Baillis et senechaux royaux , 4 , Prevots royaux , 5 , Juges seigneuriaux . Voltaire , xxi. 419 ( Louis XV . ) , Sorel , i. 148. @# It has been said that the judges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially in those tribunals which still depended on the lords , oppression and injustice appear to have been not uncommon . The bailiffs who presided in them were often partial where the interests of the lords whose salaries they received were concerned . And even when we come to the practice before the Parliaments , the American reader will sometimes be struck with astonishment at the extent to which members of those high tribunals were allowed by custom to be influenced by the private and personal solicitation of parties . The whole spirit of the continental system of civil and criminal law is here at variance with that of the Anglo-Saxon system . English and American judges are like umpires in a conflict ; French judges like interested persons conducting an investigation . The latter method is perhaps the better for unraveling intricate cases , but the former would seem to expose the bench to less temptation . A judge who is long closeted with each of the contestants alternately must find it harder to keep his fingers from bribes and his mind from prejudice than a judge who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in the full glare of the court-room , and from listening to any argument of counsel , save where both sides are represented . Accusations of bribery , even of judges , were common in old France . The lower officers of the court took fees openly . Thick books , under the name of memoires , were published , with the avowed intention of influencing the public and the courts in pending cases . Footnote : For a statement that influential persons went unpunished in criminal matters and got the better of their adversaries in civil matters by means of lettres de cachet , and for instances , see Bos. 148 ; a long list of iniquitous judgments , Ibid. , 190 , etc. @# One judicial abuse especially contrary to fair dealing had become very common . Powerful and influential persons could have their cases removed from the tribunals in which they were begun , and tried in other courts where from personal influence they might expect a more favorable result . It was not only the royal council that could draw litigation to itself . The practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal by which an action was to be tried could be changed. @# This appears to have been a frequent cause of failure of justice. @# As for the criminal proceedings of the age , there was hardly a limit to their cruelty . Under Louis XV. the prisons were filthy dens , crowded and unventilated , true fever-holes . A private cell ten feet square , for a man awaiting trial , cost sixty francs a month . Large dogs were trained to watch the prisoners and to prevent their escape . Twice a year , in May and September , the more desperate convicts left Paris for the galleys . They made the journey chained together in long carts , so that eight mounted policemen could watch a hundred and twenty of them . The galleys at Toulon appear to have been less bad than the prisons in Paris . They were kept clean and well-aired , and the prisoners were fairly well fed and clothed ; but some of them had been imprisoned for forty , fifty , or even sixty years . They were allowed to for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into three classes , deserters , smugglers , and thieves , distinguished by the color of their caps . Footnote : Mercier , iii. 265 , x. 151 . Howard , Lazarettos , 54. @# Torture was regarded as a regular means for the discovery of crime . It was administered in various ways , the forms differing from province to province . They included the application of fire to various parts of the body , the distension of the stomach and lungs by water poured into mouth , thumbscrews , the rack , the boot . These were but methods of investigation , used on men and women whose crime was not proved . They might be repeated after conviction for the discovery of accomplices . The greater part of the examination of accused persons was carried on in private , and during it they were not allowed counsel for their defense . They were confronted but once with the witnesses against them , and that only after those witnesses had given their evidence and were liable to the penalties of perjury if they retracted it . Many offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but under Louis XVI. public feeling rightly judged the punishment too severe for the offense , so that masters would not prosecute nor judges condemn for it . Footnote : Counsel were not allowed in France for that important part of the proceedings which was carried on in secret . Voltaire , xlviii. 132 . In England , at that time , counsel were not allowed of right to prisoners in cases of felony ; but judges were in the habit of straining the law to admit them . Strictly they could only instruct the prisoner in matters of law . Blackstone iv. fol. 355 ( ch. 27 ) . The English seem for a long time to have entertained a wholesome distrust of confessions .

The poor wretch was then laid on his back on a cart wheel , his broken bones protruding through his flesh , his head hanging , his brow dripping bloody sweat , and left to die . A priest muttered religious consolation by his side . By such sights as these was the populace of the French cities trained that the gaoler at Avignon told him that he had seen prisoners under torture sweat blood . Lazarettos , 53. @# It was not until the middle of the century that men ' s minds were fairly turned toward the reform of the criminal law . Yet eminent writers had long pointed out the inutility of torture . " Torture-chambers are a dangerous invention , and seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Montaigne ; but he thinks them the least evil that human weakness has invented under the circumstances . Montesquieu advanced a step farther . He pointed out that torture was not necessary . " We see today a very well governed nation the English reject it without inconvenience . " . . . " So many clever people and so many men of genius have written against this practice , " he continues , " that I dare not speak after them . I was about to say that it might be admissible under despotic governments , where all that inspires fear forms a greater part of the administration ; I was about to say that slaves among the Greeks and Romans ,  --  but I hear the voice of nature crying out against me . " Voltaire attacked the practice in his usual vivacious manner ; but , with characteristic prudence suggested that torture might still be applied in cases of regicide .

Question ) , xxxii. 391 ( Ibid . , Torture ) . @# Such scattered expressions as these might long have remained unfruitful . But in 1764 appeared the admirable book of the Milanese Marquis Beccaria , and about thirteen years later the Englishman John Howard published his first book on the State of the Prisons . Beccaria shared the ideas of the Philosophers on most subjects . Where he differed from them , it was as Rousseau differed , in the direction of socialism . But in usefulness to mankind few of them can compare with him . From him does the modern world derive some of its most important ideas concerning the treatment of crime . Extreme , like most of the Philosophers of his age ; unable , like them , to recognize the proper limitations of his theories , he has yet transformed the thought of civilized men on one of the most momentous subjects with which they have to deal . So great is the change wrought in a hundred years by his little book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could ever have been thought to contain novelties . " The end of punishment. . . is no other than to prevent the criminal from doing farther injury to society , and to prevent others from committing the like offense . " " All trials should be public . " " The more immediately after the commission of a crime the punishment is inflicted , the more just and useful it will be . " " Crimes are more effectually prevented by the certainty than by the severity of punishment . " These are the commonplaces of modern criminal legislation . The difficulty lies in applying them . In the eighteenth century their enunciation was necessary . " The torture of a criminal during his trial is a cruelty consecrated by custom in almost every nation , " says Beccaria . Indeed it seems to have been legal in his day all over the Continent , although restricted in Prussia and obsolete in practice in Holland . Beccaria opposed torture entirely , on broad grounds . As to torture before condemnation he holds it a grievous wrong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every man is innocent whose crime has not been proved . Besides , it is confounding all relations to expect that a man should be both the accuser and the accused , and that pain should be the test of truth ; as if truth resided in the muscles and sinews of a wretch in torture . By this method , the robust will escape and the weak will be condemned . " The penalties proposed by Beccaria are generally mild ,  --  he would have abolished that of death altogether ,  --  his reliance being on certainty and not on severity of punishment . Footnote : Beccaria , passim . Lea , Superstition and Force , 515. @# It was not to be expected that Beccaria ' s book should work an immediate change in the manners of Christendom . The criminal law remained unaltered at first , in theory and practice . But the consciences of the more advanced thinkers were affected . In 1766 , at Abbeville , a young man named La Barre was convicted of standing and wearing his hat while a religious procession was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making blasphemous gestures . There was much popular excitement at the time on account of the mutilation of a crucifix standing on a bridge in the town , but La Barre was not shown to have been concerned in this outrage .

The young man , having been tortured , was condemned to make public confession with a rope round his neck , before the church of Saint Vulfran , where the injured crucifix : had been placed , to have his tongue cut out , to be beheaded , and to have his body burned . This outrageous sentence was confirmed by the Parliament of Paris . The superstitious king , Louis XV. , would not grant a pardon . The capital sentence was executed , but the cutting out of the tongue was omitted , the executioner only pretending to do that part of his work . La Barre ' s head fell , amid the applause of a cruel crowd which admired the skillful stroke of the headsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ran through the liberal party in France . The anger and grief of Voltaire were loudly expressed . It was at least an improvement on the state of public feeling in former generations that such severity should not have met with universal acquiescence .

One of them asked what could be done to find stolen money if the thief refused to say where he had hidden it . But this was not his only argument . " The accused himself , " he said , " has a guarantee in torture , which makes him a judge in his own case , so that he becomes able to avoid the capital punishment attached to the crime of which he is accused . " And this writer confidently asserts that for a single example which might be cited in two or three centuries of an innocent man yielding to the violence of torture , a million cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Vougland , quoted in Du Boys , ii. 205 @# Yet the march of progress was fairly rapid in the latter part of the eighteenth century . In the jurisprudence of that age a distinction was made between preparatory torture , which was administered to suspected persons to make them confess , and previous torture , which was inflicted on the condemned , previous to execution , to obtain the accusation of accomplices . The former of these , by far the greater disgrace to civilization , was abolished in France on the 24th of August , 1780 ; the latter not until , 1788 , and then only provisionally . Thus was one of the greatest of modern reforms accomplished before the Revolution . About the same time many ordinances were passed for the amelioration of French prisons . They were about as bad as those of other countries , and that was very bad indeed . Footnote : Question preparatoire ; question prealable , sometimes called q. definitive .

The Parliament of Paris was in the habit of passing condemnation on books supposed to contain dangerous matter . The suspected volume was brought to the bar of the court by the advocate general , the objectionable passages were read , and the book declared to be " heretical , schismatical , erroneous , blasphemous , violent , impious , " and condemned to be burned by the public executioner .

Footnote : Mercier , iv. 241. @# As for the author , the Parliament would sometimes proceed directly against him , but oftener he was dealt with by an order under the royal hand and seal , known as a lettre de cachetFootnote : The lettre de cachet was written on paper , signed by the king , and countersigned by a minister . It was so sealed that it could not be opened without breaking the seal . It was reputed a private order . Larousse . Arbitrary imprisonment , without trial , is a thing so outrageous to Anglo-Saxon feelings that we are apt to forget that it has until recent years formed a part of the regular practice of most civilized nations . It is considered necessary to what is called the police of the country , a word for which we have in English no exact equivalent . Police , in this sense , not only punishes crime , but averts danger . Acts which may injure the public are prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed to come to action. @# This sort of protection is a part of the function of every government ; but on the Continent , in old times , and still in some countries , long and painful imprisonment of men who had never been convicted of any crime was considered one of the proper methods of police . It was justified in some measure in French eyes by the fact that secrecy saved the feelings of innocent families , which thus did not suffer in the public estimation for the misdeeds of one unruly member . In France , where the family is much more of a unit than in English-speaking countries , the disgrace of one person belonging to it affects the others far more seriously . The lettre de cachet of old France , confining its victim in a state prison , was too elaborate a method to be used with the turbulent lower classes  --  for them there were less dignified forms of proceeding ; but it was freely employed against persons of any consequence . Spendthrifts and licentious youths were shut up at the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped into the Bastille , Vincennes or Fors l ' Eveque . Voltaire , Diderot , Mirabeau , and many others underwent that sort of confinement ; and the first of them is said to have procured by his influence the incarceration of one of his own literary enemies . Fallen statesmen were fortunate when they did not pass from the cabinet to the prison , but were allowed the alternative of exile , or of seclusion in their own country houses . But this was not the worst . The lettre de cachet was too often the instrument of private hate . Signed carelessly , or even in blank , by the king , it could be procured by the favorite or the favorite ' s favorite , for his own purposes . And if the victim had no protector to plead his cause , he might be forgotten in captivity and waste a lifetime. @# For such abuses as this , there is no remedy but publicity . If , on the one hand , too much has been made of the romantic story of the Bastille , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too great stress , on the other hand , may be laid on the undoubted fact that under Louis XVI. the grim old fortress contained but few prisoners , and that some of them were persons who might have been cast into prison under any system of government . In the reign of that king ' s immediate predecessor great injustice had been committed . Nor had arbitrary proceedings been entirely renounced by the government of Louis XVI. itself . In the very last year before that in which the Estates General met at Versailles , the royal ministers imprisoned in the Bastille twelve Breton gentlemen , whose crime was that they importunately presented a petition from the nobles of their province . The apartments which they were to occupy were filled with other prisoners , so room was made by removing these unhappy occupants to the madhouse at Charenton , whence they were released only in the following year by order of a committee of the National Assembly .

Perhaps the most terrifying thing about the Bastille was that no one really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common people were not afraid of it , iii. 287 , 289. @# @# CHAPTER IX. @# EQUALITY AND LIBERTY. @# It was as a privileged order that the Nobility of France principally excited the ill-will of the common people . The more thoughtful Frenchmen of the eighteenth century , all of them at least who have come to be known by the name of Philosophers , set before themselves two great ideals . These were equality and liberty . The aspiration after these was accompanied in their minds by contempt for the past and its lessons , misunderstanding of the benefits which former ages had bequeathed to them , and hatred of the wrongs and abuses which had come down from earlier times . Among them the word gothic was a violent term of reproach , aimed indiscriminately at buildings , laws , and customs . History , with the exception of that of Sparta , was thought to consist far more of warnings than of models . Just before the Revolution , a number of persons who had met in a lady ' s parlor were discussing the education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette , " that he would do well to begin his History of France with the year 1787. " @# This tendency to depreciate the past was due in a measure to the preference , natural to lively minds , for deductive over inductive methods of thought . It is so much easier and pleasanter to assume a few plausible general principles and meditate upon them , than to amass and compare endless series of dry facts , that not by long chastening will the greater part of the world be brought to the more arduous method . Nor should enthusiasm for one of the great processes of thought cause contempt of the other . Even the great inductive French philosopher of the eighteenth century , Montesquieu , failed in a measure to grasp the continuity of history ; and drew the facts for his study rather from China and from England than from France , rather from the Roman republic than the existing monarchy . Fear of the censor and of the civil and ecclesiastical tribunals , which would not bear the open discussion of questions of present interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first seems simple , but equality may be of many kinds . Absolute equality in all respects between two human beings , no one has ever seen , and no one perhaps has ever thought of desiring . All the relations of life are founded on inequality . By their differences husband and wife , friend and friend , are made necessary and endeared to each other ; the parent protects and serves the child , the child obeys and helps the parent ; the citizen calls on the magistrate to guard his rights , the magistrate enforces the laws which have their sanction in the consent of the body of citizens . Equality as a political ideal is therefore a limited equality . It may extend to condition , it may be confined to civil rights , or to opportunities. @# The Philosophers of the eighteenth century , followed by a school in our day , universally assumed that an approximate equality of condition was desirable . Rousseau agreed with Montesquieu , in believing that a small republic , none of whose citizens were either very rich or very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Virtue , they thought , would be its especial characteristic . In some of the Swiss cantons , and later in the struggling American colonies of Great Britain , Frenchmen discovered communities approaching their ideal in respect to the equal distribution of wealth ; and their discovery in the latter case was not without great results . This kind of equality has since passed away from large portions of America , as it must always disappear where civilization increases . Good people mourn its departure ; some few , perhaps , would patiently endure its return . They are about as numerous as those who abandon city life to dwell permanently in the country , also the home of comparative equality of condition . The theoretic admiration for this sort of equality was shared by a large and enlightened part of the French nobility . Thus the order was weakened by the fact that many of its own members did not believe in its claims. @# Another kind of equality is that of civil rights . Before the Revolution , France was ruled by law , but all Frenchmen were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons and privileged localities . Of these anomalies , sometimes working hardship , the minds of intelligent men at that time were especially impatient . They believed , as has been said , in natural laws , implanted in every breast , finding their expression in every conscience ; and many of them entertained a crude notion that such laws could easily be applied to the enormously complicated facts of actual life . Assuming such laws to exist , as absolute as mathematical axioms and far easier of application , all variation was error , all anomaly absurd , all claims of a privileged class unfair and unfounded. @# Equality of civil rights is also desired from the fear of oppression ; a very important motive in the eighteenth century , when the great still had the power to be very oppressive at times . We have seen the treatment which Voltaire received at the hands of a member of one of the great families . Outrages still more flagrant appear to have been not uncommon in the reign of Louis XV. , and although there had probably never been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successor , their memory was still fresh . It is in their decrepitude that political abuses are most ferociously attacked . When young and lusty they are formidable. @# Again , there is equality of opportunity . This is desired as a means of subverting equality of condition to our own advantage , as a chance to be more than equal to our fellow-men . This kind is longed for by the able and ambitious . Where it is denied , the strongest good men will be less useful to the state , unless they happen to be favorably placed at birth ; the strongest bad men perhaps more dangerous , because more discontented . It is this sort of equality , more than any other , which the French Philosophers and their followers actually secured for Frenchmen , and in a less degree for other Europeans of to-day . By their efforts , the chance of the poor but talented child to rise to power and wealth has been somewhat increased . This chance , when they began their labors , was not so hopeless as it is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes assumed to be . Still , there has been one decided advance . We have seen that under the old monarchy many important places were reserved for members of the noble class , and practically for a few families among them . Since that monarchy passed away , the opportunity to serve the state , with the great prizes which public life offers to the strong and the aspiring , has been thrown open , theoretically at least , to all Frenchmen. @# If the idea of equality be comparatively simple , that of liberty is very much the reverse . The word , in its general sense , signifies little more than the absence of external control . In politics it is used , in the first place , for the absence of foreign conquest , and in this sense a country may be called free although it is governed by a despot . The next signification of liberty is political right , and this is the sense in which it has been most used until recent years . When a tyrant overthrew the liberties of a Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of an oligarchy . The mass of the inhabitants may have been neither better nor worse off than before . When Hampden resisted the encroachments of King Charles I , he was fighting the battle of the upper and middle classes against despotism , and we hold him one of the principal champions of liberty . Indeed , liberty in this sense is so far from being identical with equality , that many of those who have been foremost in its defense have been members of aristocracies and holders of slaves . To accuse them of inconsistency is to be misled by the ambiguous meaning of a word . They fought for rights which they believed to be their own ; they denied that the rights of all men were identical . During the eighteenth century in France , certain bodies , such as the clergy and the Parliament of Paris , were struggling for political liberties in this older sense , and before the outbreak of the French Revolution many of the most enlightened of the nobility hoped to acquire such liberties . Much blood and confusion might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchmen clutched less wildly at the phantom of equality , and sought the safer goal of political liberty. @# Another sort of liberty , although it has undoubtedly been desired by individuals in all ages , is almost entirely modern as an ideal for civilized communities . This is the absence of interference , not only of a foreign power or of a lawless oppressor , but of the very law itself . The desire for such freedom as this , would in almost all ages of the world have been held inconsistent with proper respect for order and security . It would have been considered no more than the wicked longing of an unchastened spirit , the temptation of the Evil One himself . In the eighteenth century , however , we see the rise of new opinions . It may be that order had become so firmly established in the European world that a reaction could safely set in . At any rate we find a new way of looking at things . " Independence , " a word which had been often used by the clerical party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Philosophers with favor . Toleration of all kinds of opinions , and of most kinds of spoken words , is making way . Footnote : In spite of the impatience shown by Voltaire of any criticism of himself , he and his followers did more than any other men that ever lived to make criticism free to all writers . A new school of thinkers is adapting the new form of thought to economical matters . Laissez faire ; laissez passer . Restrict the functions of government . Order will arise from the average of contending interests ; right direction is produced by the sum of conflicting forces . The doctrine has exerted enormous influence since the French Revolution in resisting the claims of socialism ,  --  that new form of tyranny in which all are to be the despot and each the slave . But few of the Philosophers accepted it entirely . Most of them desired the constant interference of the government for one purpose or another , and many believed in the power , almost the omnipotence , of a mythical personage , borrowed in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action of this personage may be roughly stated as follows . Every nation now civilized was in early days in a barbarous condition . Once upon a time , a great man came from somewhere , and brought a complete set of laws , morals , and manners with him . To these laws and customs he generally ascribed a divine origin . The nation to which they were proclaimed adopted them , and the people ' s subsequent happiness and prosperity were in proportion to their excellence . The reasons which are supposed to have induced the barbarous tribe to change all its habits at the bidding of one man are seldom given , or if given , are ludicrously inadequate . The theory of the legislator is now out of date . It is generally held that the institutions of every race have grown up with it , that they are appropriate to its nature and history , gradually modified sometimes by act of the national will , and more or less changed under foreign influences , but that their general character can not suddenly be subverted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the skin without fur or the erect position belong to mankind . There is some evidence in support of either theory , and the truth will probably be found to lie between them , although nearer to the latter . Yet the effect of a higher civilization implanted on a lower one seems at times singularly rapid . The story of the legislator is a part of most early histories and mythologies . The classical model has generally been held to be either Minos or Lycurgus . There were few clever men in France between the years 1740 and 1790 who did not dream of trying on the sandals of those worthies. @# While the ideas attached to equality and to liberty were vague and indefinite , it was generally assumed that they would coincide . Liberty and equality , however , have tendencies naturally opposed to each other . Remove the exterior forces which control the wills of men , overturn foreign domination , give every citizen political rights , reduce the interference of laws to a minimum , and the natural differences and inequalities of physical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inherent in mankind , will have the fuller opportunity to act . The strong improve their natural advantage , they acquire dominion over their weaker neighbors , they monopolize opportunities for themselves , their friends and their children . Only by keeping all men in strict subjection to something outside of themselves can all be kept in comparative equality . This fact was instinctively apprehended by one school of French thinkers . We shall see that the followers of Rousseau , while posing as champions of Liberty , were in fact the founders of a system which is the very antithesis of individual freedom . Footnote : It is perhaps needless to remark that I have touched here only on the political meanings of the word Liberty . In the eighteenth century the word was much used in its philosophical sense , and the eternal problem of necessity and free-will was warmly discussed. @# @# CHAPTER X. @# MONTESQUIEU. @# One man stands out among the French nobility of the gown in the eighteenth century , influencing human thought beyond the walls of the court-room ; one Philosopher who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The work of Voltaire and his followers was principally negative . Their favorite task was demolition . The ugly and uninhabitable edifices of Rousseau ' s genius required for their erection a field from which all possible traces of civilized building had been removed . But Montesquieu , while he satirized the vices of the society which he saw about him , yet appreciated at their full value the benefits of civilization . He recognized that change is always accompanied by evil , even if its preponderating result be good , and that it should be attempted only with care and caution . His ideas influenced the leading men of the second half of the century somewhat in proportion to their judgment and in inverse proportion to their enthusiasm. @# Charles Louis de Secondat , Baron of Montesquieu , born in 1689 , was by inheritance one of the presidents of the Parliament of Bordeaux .

In appearance he was ugly , with a large head , weak eyes , a big nose , a retreating forehead and chin . In temperament he was calm and cheerful .

Also Montesq. vii. 150 , ( Pensees diverses . Portrait de M. par lui-meme , apparently written when he was about forty ) . Also Vian , 141. @# Montesquieu set himself a high standard of duty . In a paper intended only for his son , he writes : " If I knew something which was useful to myself and injurious to my family , I should reject it from my mind . If I knew of anything which was useful to my family and which was not so to my country , I should try to forget it . If I knew something useful to my country , which was injurious to Europe and the human race , I should consider it a crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s first book appeared in 1721 , a book very different from those which followed it . It is witty and licentious after a rather stately fashion , full of keen observation and cutting satire . In contrast to the books of other famous writers of the century , the " Persian Letters " are eminently the work of a gentleman ;  --  of a French gentleman , when the Duke of Orleans was Regent. @# The " Lettres Persanes " are , as their name suggests , the supposed correspondence of two rich Persians , Usbek and Rica , traveling in France and exchanging letters with their friends and their eunuchs in Persia . The letters which the travelers receive , containing the gossip of their harems , form but the smaller portion of the book , and are evidently intended to give it variety and lightness . In the letters which they write to their Persian correspondents we have the satirical picture of French society . How far had the ruling , infallible church sunk in the minds of Frenchmen , when a well-placed and rather selfish man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Christians . He is an old idol , to which people burn incense from the force of habit .

He calls himself the successor of one of the earliest Christians , known as Saint Peter ; and it is certainly a rich inheritance , for he has enormous treasures and a rich country under his dominion. " @# The bishops are legists , subordinate to the Pope . They have two functions . When assembled they make articles of faith as he does . When separate , they dispense people from obeying the law . For the Christian religion is full of difficult observances ; and it is thought to be harder to do your duty than to have bishops to give you dispensation . The doctors , bishops , and monks are constantly raising questions on religious subjects , and dispute for a long time , until at last an assembly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there been as many civil wars as in that of Christ . Footnote : Montesq. , i. 124 . Letter xxix. @# Farther on we have a picture of the way in which religion is regarded in French society . It is less a subject of sanctification than of dispute . Courtiers , soldiers , even women , rise up against ecclesiastics and ask them to prove what the others have resolved not to believe . This is not because people have determined their minds by reason , nor that they have taken the trouble to examine the truth or falsehood of this religion which they reject . They are rebels who have felt the yoke and who have shaken it off before they have known it . They are , therefore , no firmer in their unbelief than in their faith . They live in an ebbing and flowing tide , which unceasingly carries them from one to the other . Footnote : Montesq. , i. 251 . Letter lxxv . Making a large allowance for satire , we have yet an interesting and doleful picture of a small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable that the Persian Letters precede by thirteen years Voltaire ' s " Philosophical , " or " English Letters . " Footnote : 1721-1734. @# Montesquieu argues that it is well to have several sects in a country , as they keep a watch on each other , and every man is anxious not to disgrace his party . But it is for toleration and not for equality that the author pleads . A state church seemed almost necessary to thought in the early part of the eighteenth century . Yet Montesquieu has no great liking for any form of dogmatic religion ; in this he belongs distinctly with the Philosophers ; morality is , in his eyes , the great , perhaps the only thing to be desired ; obedience to law , love to men , filial piety , those , he says , are the first acts of all religions ; ceremonies are good only on the supposition that God has commanded them ; but about the commands of God it is easy to be mistaken , for there are two thousand religions , each of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Catholics , that the multiplicity of Protestant sects  --  provided their falsity , turned against its inventors . Footnote : Ibid. , i. 164 . Letter xlvi . Compare with Montesquieu ' s opinion , expressed in the Spirit of the Laws , that the sovereign should neither allow the establishment of a new form of religion , nor persecute one already established. @# The licentiousness of the " Persian Letters " has been mentioned . It is one of the most noticeable features of the writings of the Philosophers of the eighteenth century that the whole subject of sexual morality is viewed by them from a standpoint different from that taken by ourselves . The thinking Frenchmen of that age believed that there was a system of natural morals , imposed on man by his own nature and the nature of things . They believed that there was also an artificial system resting only on positive law , or on the ordinances of the church . It was the tendency of the ecclesiastical mind to ignore that distinction . That tendency had been pushed too far and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite disregarded even by men of those races which have most respect for law . Nobody feels that the injunction to keep off the grass in a public park , or the rule to pass to the right in driving , is of quite the same sort of obligation as the precept to keep your hands from picking and stealing . A far greater amount of odium is incurred by the known breach of a rule of natural morals , than by that of a rule depending solely on the ordinance of the legislative power . Smuggling may be mentioned as a crime coming near the dividing line in the popular feeling of most countries . Few men would feel as much disgraced at being caught by a custom-house officer , with a box of cigars hidden under the trowsers at the bottom of their trunk , as at being seized in the act of stealing the same box from the counter of a tobacconist . In countries where the laws are arbitrary and the law-making power distrusted , this distinction is more strongly marked than where the government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more progressive Frenchmen of a hundred and fifty years ago believed the laws of their country to be bad in many respects . They therefore thought that there was a great difference between what jurists call prohibited wrong and wrong in itself. @# Now , admitting this distinction to exist in men ' s minds , there is one large class of crimes and vices which is put in one category by most Anglo-Saxons and which was put in the other by the French Philosophers . These are the breaches of the sexual laws . It is one of the greatest services of the church to Christendom that she has always laid particular emphasis on the duty of chastity . It is one of her greatest errors , that she has exalted the practice of celibacy over that of conjugal fidelity . The Philosophers , as was their custom , looked abroad on the practice of various nations . They found that some of the ancients granted divorce freely at the request of either party . They learned that Orientals generally allowed polygamy . They saw in their own country a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly due perhaps to the example of a depraved court . Observation and desire concurred with hatred of the clergy to warp their judgments . They forgot , at least in part , that chastity is the foundation of the family and the civilized state ; that divorce and polygamy , although of momentous importance , are but secondary questions ; that on sexual self-restraint civilization rests , as much as on respect for life and property . On the false theory that unchastity is but an artificial crime , the delusive invention of an ascetic church , will , I think , be found to depend much that has been worst in the practice of Frenchmen , much that is most disgusting in their literature . Footnote : The commandment " Thou shalt not commit adultery " is equally applicable to polygamists and monogamists . It was originally promulgated to the former , and to a nation in which a man could put away his wife. @# This theory is seldom held unreservedly . In the " Persian Letters " it goes no farther than an elaborate apology for divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licentiousness of tone . The later writings of Montesquieu are free from indecency . But it is noticeable of him , perhaps the most high-minded of the Philosophers , and of the rest of them , that while they constantly insist on the importance of virtue , they hardly rank chastity among the virtues . Footnote : See the story of a Guebir who marries his sister , Montesq. , i. 226 , Letter lxvii . The point appears to be that the laws forbidding marriage in cases of consanguinity are arbitrary. @# The monarchy fares little better than the church in the " Persian Letters . " " The King of France , " says Rica , " is the most powerful prince in Europe . He has no gold-mines like his neighbor the King of Spain ; but he has more wealth than the latter , for he draws it from the vanity of his subjects , more inexhaustible than mines .

He even goes so far as to make them believe that he cures them of all manner of diseases by touching them . Such is the strength and power that he has over their minds .

But Rica is informed that you can not tell about these western kings until you know of their mistress and their confessor .

But the sanctuary of honor , reputation , and virtue seems to be built in republics , where a man may feel that he has indeed a country .

The book we have been considering was by far the lightest , as it was the earliest , of his considerable writings . The good sense , caution , and conservatism of his nature appear in the " Persian Letters " less conspicuously than in his later works ; yet , even there , are in marked contrast to the haste and shallowness of many of the Philosophers .

After several years , for things did not move fast in Old France , he was proposed for election to the Academy . To be one of the forty members of that body is the legitimate ambition of the literary Frenchman . The Cardinal de Fleury , who was prime minister , is said to have announced that the king would never consent to the election of the author of the " Persian Letters . " He added that he had not read the book , but that people in whom he had confidence assured him that it was dangerous . According to Voltaire , Montesquieu thereupon had a garbled edition of the Letters hastily printed , himself took a copy to the Cardinal , induced His Eminence to read a part of it , and , with the help of friends , prevailed on him to alter his decision . Such a trick is more worthy of Voltaire , who continually denied his own works , than of Montesquieu , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alembert tells the story in a way entirely creditable to the latter . He says that Montesquieu saw the minister , told him that for private reasons he did not give his name to the " Persian Letters , " but that he was far from disowning a book of which he did not think he had cause to be ashamed . He then insisted that the Letters should be judged after reading them , and not on hearsay . Thereupon the Cardinal read the book , was pleased with it and with its author , and withdrew his opposition to the latter ' s election to the Academy . Footnote : Nouvelle Biographie Universelle .

Having thus obtained leisure , he set out on a long course of travel , lasting three years .

He would appear , before he started on his travels , to have already formed the project of writing a great work on the Spirit of the Laws . But in 1784 he published a smaller book , the " Greatness and Decadence of the Romans . " It is said that this essay was composed of a part of the material collected for the Spirit of the Laws , and was published separately in order not to give the Romans too large a place in the more important work . This has been doubted , but there is nothing either in the subject or in the treatment to make it improbable . Nor is it important , so long as between the two books there is unity of purpose and agreement of method. @# The " Greatness and Decadence of the Romans " is a study of philosophic history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first ten books of Livy . That remarkable work would have been most profitable reading for Frenchmen of the eighteenth century , as it must be in all times for students of the science of politics . Of republics Machiavelli had more experience than Montesquieu . Both considered the republican form of government the most desirable ; both thought it impossible without the preservation of substantial equality of property among the citizens . Montesquieu , who knew more of monarchy than Machiavelli , had also more faith in it . Both hated the Rule of the Roman Church . Footnote : Machiavelli , ii. 210 . Montesq. , ii. 136 , 140 . Mach. , ii. 130 . The Frenchman excels the Italian in practical wisdom ; he is also more brilliant . By his brilliancy he may sometimes have been led away , but I think not often . While we feel in reading Voltaire that the sparkling point is often the cause of the saying , with Montesquieu we are generally struck with the weight of thought in what we read. @# " The tyranny of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nearer to ruin , than indifference to the public good brings a republic .

The advantage of a free state is that there are no favorites ; but when that is not the case , and when instead of enriching the prince ' s friends and relations , all the friends and relations of all those who share in the government have to be enriched , all is lost ; the laws are evaded more dangerously than they are violated by a prince , who , being always the greatest citizen of a state , has the most interest in its preservation . " Footnote : Montesq. , ii. 139. @# Kings , as Montesquieu points out , are less envied than aristocracies ; for the king is too far above most of his subjects to excite comparisons , while the nobility is not so placed .

Complete despotism he believes to be impossible . There is in every nation a general spirit on which all power is founded . Against this , the ruler is powerless . It is wise not to disturb established forms and institutions , for the very causes which have made them last hitherto may maintain them in the future , and these causes are often complicated and unknown . When the system is changed , theoretic difficulties may be overcome , but drawbacks remain which only use can show . It is folly in conquerors to wish to make the conquered adopt new laws and customs , and it is useless ; for under any form of government , subjects can obey .

" In the same book occurs the expression of an idea ( afterwards repeated and worked out ) , which was to be perhaps the most fruitful of his teachings . " The laws of Rome , " he says , " had wisely divided the public power among a great number of offices , which sustained , arrested , and moderated each other ; and as each had but a limited power , every citizen was capable of attaining to any one of them ; and the people , seeing several persons pass before it one after the other , became accustomed to none of them . " Footnote : Ibid. , ii. 200. @# This idea that the division of power was highly desirable , that a system of checks and balances in government would tend to secure freedom , never took firm root in France . Indeed , Montesquieu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than read in his own country . Footnote : Ibid. , vii. 157 ( Pensees diverses . Portrait de M par lui-meme ) . But in the distant colonies of America the " Greatness and Decadence of the Romans " and the " Spirit of the Laws " found eager students . The thoughts of Montesquieu were embodied in the constitutions of new states , whose social and economic condition was not far removed from that which he considered the most desirable . In these states the doctrine of the division of powers was consciously and carefully adopted , with the most beneficent results . This division was not a new idea to the American colonists : it was already in a measure a part of their institutions . But there can be little doubt that the idea was enforced in their minds by being clearly stated by one of the writers on political subjects whom they most admired . Footnote : We have seen that Montesquieu had arrived at this idea from the study of the English Constitution as it existed in his day . In respect to the division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more nearly to his idea than does the present government of England , in which the system of balanced powers has been superseded by that of government by the Lower Chamber , of which he pointed out the danger . The full results of this change will be known only to future generations. @# Fourteen years had passed from the time of the publication of the " Greatness and Decadence of the Romans , " when in 1748 appeared the great work of Montesquieu , the " Spirit of the Laws . " The book is announced by its author as something entirely original , " a child without a mother . " Footnote : Prolem sine matre creatam , on the title-page . Nor is the claim altogether unfounded , although any reader familiar with the " Politics " of Aristotle can hardly fail to observe the resemblance between that great book and the other . Nor is it a detraction from the genius of Montesquieu to say that the comparison will not be altogether in his favor. @# Montesquieu ' s scheme is announced in the title originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Laws , or of the relation which the laws should have to the constitution of every government , manners , climate , religion , commerce , etc . To which the author has added new researches into the Roman laws concerning inheritance , into French laws , and into feudal laws . " Thus we see that the principal subject of the book is the relation of laws to the circumstances of the country in which they exist . In this also is its chief value and its claim to originality . The Philosophers of the eighteenth century , following the example of the churches , believed that there was an absolute standard of justice to which all laws could easily be referred , independently of the country in which the laws existed . If the laws of Naples differed from those of Prussia , the laws which governed the phlegmatic Dutchman from those which contained the excitable inhabitant of Marseilles , one or the other set of laws , or both of them , must be wrong . The Civil Law of the Latin races , the Common Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect abstract reason . The church with its canon , the same for all races and climates , confirmed the theory . To all these came Montesquieu with a teaching that would reconcile their claims. @# " Law in general is human reason , in so far as it governs all the nations of the earth ; and the political and civil laws of each nation should be but the particular cases to which that human reason is applied. " @# " They should be so adapted to the people for whom they are made , that it is a very great chance if those of one nation will apply to another. " @# " They must be in relation to the nature and the principle of the government which is established , or about to be established ; whether they form it , as do political laws ; or maintain it , as do civil laws. " @# " They must be in relation to the physical nature of the country ; to the frozen , burning , or temperate climate ; to the quality of the soil , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life of the people , as farmers , hunters , or shepherds ; they should be in relation to the amount of liberty which the constitution may allow ; to the religion of the inhabitants , their inclinations , their wealth , their numbers , their customs , their morals , and their manners . Finally , they have relations to each other ; they have them to their own origin , to the object of the legislator , to the order of things on which they are established . They should be considered from all these points of view. " @# " This is what I undertake to do in this work . I will examine all these relations . They form together what is called the Spirit of the Laws . ' " Footnote : Montesq. , iii. 99 ( liv. i. c. 3 ) . @# It will be noticed that Montesquieu by no means denies that there are general principles of justice .

" It is better to say that the government most in conformity with nature is that whose particular disposition is most in relation to the disposition of the people for which it is established .

Footnote : Ibid. , iii. 99 ; Aristotle , Politics , liv. vii. c. ii. @# The conception was a great one , so simple that it seems impossible that it could ever have been missed ; but it was combated with violence on its announcement , and many brilliant and learned men have failed to grasp it . Footnote : Montesq. , iv. 145 n Such are the persons in our own time who praise despotism in France , or who would set up parliamentary government in India . Montesquieu probably carried his theories too far . To the north he assigned energy and valor , as if the most widely conquering nations that Europe had then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Macedonian , the Italian , and the Spaniard . Sterility of soil he considered favorable to republics , fertility to monarchies . It was natural that a man in revolt against the long spiritual tyranny that had oppressed thought in Europe should have attributed excessive importance to material causes . Not the less did the idea contain its share of truth . Nor was his statement of this , which we may call his favorite theory , always excessive . " Several things , " he says , " govern man ; climate , religion , laws , the maxims of government , the examples of things past , morals , manners ; whence comes a general spirit which is their result . Sometimes one of these forces dominates and sometimes another . " Footnote : Montesq. , iv. 307 ( liv. xix. c. 4 ) . @# It may be noted of Montesquieu , and as often of Voltaire , that each of them is constantly led astray by imperfect knowledge of foreign , and especially of barbarous and savage nations . Since the voyages and conquests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , written in many cases by men anything but accurate , if not , in the words of Macaulay , " liars by a double right , as travellers and as Jesuits .

They wished to draw instruction from distant objects , and their spy-glasses distorted shapes and modified colors . Imperfect knowledge of foreign countries sometimes led Montesquieu into curious mistakes ; yet these affected his illustrations oftener than his theories. @# Having stated his general doctrine , Montesquieu proceeds to apply it . As laws should be adapted to the nature of the government of each country , it is essential to study that nature , and to consider what is the principle , or motive force of each form of government . " There is this difference , " he says , " between the nature of the government and its principle : that its nature is what makes it such as it is , and its principle what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other the human passions which cause it to operate . " Footnote : Montesq. , iii , 120 ( liv. iii. c. 1 ) . @# Four kinds of government are recognized by Montesquieu : democratic , aristocratic , monarchical , and despotic . The principle of democracy he holds to be virtue , without which popular government can not continue to exist . Footnote : Montesq. , iii. 122 ( liv. iii. c. 3 ) . An aristocratic state needs less virtue , because the people is kept in check by the nobles . But the nobility can with difficulty repress the members of their own order , and do justice for their crimes . In default of great virtue , however , an aristocratic state can exist if the ruling class will practice moderation . Footnote : Ibid. , iii. 126 ( liv. c. 4 ) . In monarchies great things can be done with little virtue , for in them there is another moving principle , which is honor .

These qualities of virtue , honor , and fear , may not exist in every republic , monarchy , and despotism ; but they should do so , if the government is to be perfect of its kind . Footnote : Ibid. , iii. 140 ( liv. iii. c. 11 ) . @# It is worth while to remember , when considering the " Spirit of the Laws , " that Montesquieu oftenest had in his mind , when speaking of democratic republics , those of Greece ; when speaking of aristocratic republics , early Rome and Venice ; of monarchies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote : But he sometimes refers to England as a country where a republic is hidden under the forms of a monarchy . Montesq , iii. 216 ( liv . V. c. 19 ) . @# Under each form of government , education and the laws should work together to strengthen the motive principle belonging to that form . Especially is this necessary in republics , for honor , which sustains monarchies , is favored by the passions ; but virtue , on which democracies depend , implies renunciation of self . Virtue , in a republic , is love of the republic itself , which leads to good morals ; the public good is set above private gratification . Thus we see that monks love their order the more , the more austere is its rule . The love of the state , in a democracy , becomes the love of equality , and thus limits ambition to the desire to render great services to the republic . The love of equality and frugality are principally excited by equality and frugality themselves , when both are established by law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every way ; as by forbidding last wills , and preventing the acquisition of large landed estates . In a democracy all men contract an enormous debt to the state at their birth , and , do what they may , they can never repay it . There should be no great wealth in the hands of private persons , because such wealth confers power and furnishes delights which are contrary to equality . Domestic frugality should make public expenditure possible . Even talents should be but moderate . But if a democratic republic be founded on commerce , individuals may safely possess great riches ; for the spirit of commerce brings with it that of frugality , economy , moderation , labor , wisdom , tranquillity , and order. @# It is very important in a democracy to keep old laws and customs ; for things tend to degenerate , and a corrupted nation seldom does anything great . To maintain an aristocratic republic , moderation is necessary . The nobles should be simple in their lives and hardly distinguishable from plebeians . Distinctions offensive to pride , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should belong to the senate as a body and simple respect only be paid to the individual senators . Footnote : Montesq. , iii. 151 ( liv. iv. c. 5 ) .

Nobility must be hereditary ; it must have prerogatives and rights ; it forms the link between the prince and the nation . Monarchical government has the great advantage over the republican form , that , as affairs are in a single hand , there is the greater promptitude of execution . But there should still be something to moderate the will of the prince . This is best found , not in the nobility itself , but in such bodies as courts of law with constitutional rights , like the French Parliaments .

While recognizing that a republic was a more just and equal form of government , he thought that monarchy was that best suited to his time and country . Many people who have watched the history of France since his day will be found to agree with him . While defending some practices which are now considered among the flagrant abuses of old France , he recommended some reforms which would have been very salutary . It is often wiser to find excuses for retaining an old custom than reasons for introducing a new one ; and Montesquieu was a conservative , made so by his nature , his social position , his wealth , his education as a lawyer , his age and his experience . When he wrote the " Persian Letters " he might possibly have been willing to overthrow the principal institutions of his country for the sake of remedying abuses ; but when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laws , " when he had realized the complication of life , and the interdependence of things , he was more ready to reform than to destroy. @# In a despotic government the motive principle is fear . The governor of the town must be absolutely responsible to the governor of the province , or the latter can not be entirely responsible to the sovereign . Thus absolutism extends throughout the state . As there is no law but the will of the prince , and as that law can not be known in detail to every one , there must be a great number of petty tyrants dependent on those immediately above them . Footnote : Montesq. , ii. 209 ( liv. v. c. 16 ) . @# After a not very successful attempt to define liberty , which he decides to be the power to do that which we ought to desire and not to do that which we ought not to desire , Footnote : Ibid. , iv. 2-4 ( liv. xi. c. 2 , 3 ) . Montesquieu tells us that political liberty is found only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to abuse it , and will go on until they meet with obstacles ; as virtue itself needs to be restrained . Various nations , he then says , have various objects : conquest was that of Rome , war of Sparta , commerce of Marseilles ; there is a country the direct object of whose constitution is political liberty . That country is England . Footnote : Montesquieu , here and elsewhere , avoids mentioning England or France by name ; a curious affectation . The references , however , are unmistakable. @# There are in every state three kinds of power , the legislative , the executive , and the judicial . Political liberty in a citizen is the tranquillity of mind which comes from the opinion he has of his own security ; and to give him this liberty the government must be such that no citizen can be afraid of another . Now this security can exist only where the legislative , executive , and judicial powers are in different hands . In most of the monarchies of Europe the government is limited , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third to others ; he makes laws and executes them , but he appoints other men to act as judges in his place . In the republics of Italy all three powers are united . The same body of magistrates makes the laws , executes them , and judges every citizen according to its pleasure ; such a body is as despotic as an eastern prince . Footnote : This judgment is somewhat softened as to Venice . The most conspicuous example in modern times of the tyranny of a single popular body is that of France under the Convention . The judicial power , says Montesquieu ( with the English jury in his mind ) , should not be given to a permanent senate , but exercised by persons drawn from the body of the people , forming a tribunal which lasts only as long as necessity may require it . In serious cases the criminal should combine with the law to choose his judges , or at least should have a right of challenge . The legislative and executive powers can with less danger be given to permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then commends representative government and the freedom left to members of Parliament in the English system . He believes the people more capable of choosing representatives wisely than of deciding questions , an opinion on which modern experience may have thrown some doubt . He approves of the existence of a second chamber , composed of persons distinguished by birth , wealth , or honors ; for if such were mixed with the people and given only one vote apiece like the others , the common liberty would be their slavery , and they would have no interest in defending it , because it would oftenest be turned against themselves . Footnote : Montesq. , iv. 7 ( liv. xi. c. 6 ) . @# The government of France , says Montesquieu , has not , like that of England , liberty for its direct object ; it tends only to the glory of the citizen , the state , and the prince . But from this glory comes a spirit of liberty , which in France can do great things , and can contribute as much to happiness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in England ; but they have a distribution of their own , according to which they approach more or less to political liberty ; and if they did not approach it , the monarchy would degenerate into despotism . Footnote : Montesq. , iv. 24. ( liv. xi. c. 7 ) . This sounds somewhat like an empty phrase ; yet there undoubtedly were in Montesquieu ' s time some checks on the absolutism of a French monarch . " If subjects owe obedience to kings , kings on their part owe obedience to the laws , " said the Parliament of Paris in 1753 . And outside of its own boundaries France had long been considered a limited monarchy . Footnote : Rocquain , 170 . Machiavelli , ii. 140 , 215 , 322 ( Discourses on the first ten books of Livy ) . Apart from the limitations imposed by the privileges of the church and of the Parliaments , there appear to have been some acknowledged fundamental laws ( the succession of the crown in the male line was one of them ) which it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being to destroy . And public opinion , as Montesquieu has already told us , has power even in the most despotic countries . In a European nation , not broken in spirit by long-continued tyranny , and possessing the printing-press , this power must always be very great. @# As for Montesquieu ' s admiration of the English form of government , it doubtless concurred with other causes to encourage on the Continent the study of English political methods . Those methods have since been adopted by many continental states , with hardly as many modifications to adapt them to local circumstances as might have been desirable . But it is the modern English constitution , in which power lies almost entirely in the House of Commons , and is exercised by its officers , that has been thus copied . In America the principle of the division of powers has been carried farther than it ever was in England ; and is , of all parts of their form of government , that from which many intelligent Americans would be most loath to part. @# We have seen enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most violent of them were made in his youth , and in a book avowedly satirical . In mature life , writing in a more philosophical spirit , his language is temperate and wise . " It is bad reasoning against religion , " he says , " to bring together in a great work a long enumeration of the evils which she has produced , unless you also recount the good she has done . If I should tell all the harm which civil laws , monarchy , or republican government have done in the world , I should say frightful things . " Footnote : Montesq. , v. 117 ( liv. xxiv. c. 2 ) . This idea was far beyond the reach of Voltaire. @# Montesquieu goes on to argue about different forms of religion . Mahometanism he holds especially suited to despotism , Christianity to limited governments . Catholicism is adapted to monarchies , Protestantism , and especially Calvinism , to republics . Where fatalism is a religious dogma , the penalties imposed by law must be more severe , and the watch kept on the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these motives who otherwise would abandon self-restraint ; but if the dogma of liberty be established , the case is otherwise . Climate is not without influence on religion . The ablutions required of a Mahometan are useful in his warm country . The Protestant of Northern Europe has to work harder for a living than the Catholic of the South , and therefore desires fewer religious holidays . If a state can prevent the establishment of a new form of religion within its borders , it will find it well to do so ; but if several religions are established , they should not be allowed to interfere with each other . Penal laws in religious matters should be avoided ; for each religion has its own spiritual penalties , and to put a man between the fear of temporal punishment , on the one hand , and the fear of spiritual punishment on the other , degrades his soul . The possessions of the clergy should be limited by laws of mortmain .

Footnote : Montesq. , v. 379 ( liv. xxix. c. 1 ) . @# It was this moderation which made the " Spirit of the Laws " distasteful to the more ardent Philosophers . Sharing in many of the feelings of his contemporaries , and especially in their distrust of the church , Montesquieu was yet unwilling to go to the same extremes as they . His chapter on Uniformity and the criticisms made on it by Condorcet , form an admirable instance of this. @# " There are certain ideas of uniformity , " says Montesquieu , " which sometimes take possession of great minds ( for they touched Charlemagne ) , but which invariably strike small ones . These find in them a kind of perfection which they recognize , because it is impossible not to see it ; the same weights in matters of police , the same measures in commerce , the same laws in the state , the same religion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions ? Is the evil of changing always less than the evil of suffering ? And would not the greatness of genius rather consist in knowing in what case uniformity is necessary , and in what case difference ? In China , the Chinese are governed by the Chinese ceremonies , and the Tartars by Tartar ceremonies ; yet this is the nation in all the world which is most devoted to tranquillity . So long as the citizens obey the law , what matters it that they shall all obey the same ? " @# This chapter ( the whole of it is given above , and it may pass in the " Spirit of the Laws " for one of middling length ) , is , according to Condorcet , " one of those which have acquired for Montesquieu the indulgence of all prejudiced people , of all who hate intellectual light ; of all protectors of abuses , etc . " And after going on with his invective for some time , Condorcet states the substance of his argument as follows : " As truth , reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , of liberty , of security , are the same everywhere , we do not see why all the provinces of one state , or even why all states should not have the same criminal laws , the same civil laws , the same laws of commerce , etc . A good law must be good for all men , as a true proposition is true for all . The laws which appear as if they should be different for different countries , either pronounce on objects which should not be regulated by laws , like most commercial regulations , or are founded on prejudices and habits which should be uprooted ; and one of the best means of destroying them is to cease to sustain them by laws .

Rousseau also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nations , but it is because he considers most nations childish or effete. @# In these two passages we have the issue between Montesquieu and the Philosophic party fairly joined . He alone of the great Frenchmen of his century recognized the enormous complication of human life and human affairs . Not denying that there are fundamental principles of justice , he saw that those principles are hard to formulate truly , harder to apply wisely . For their application he offered many valuable suggestions . These were lost in the rush and hurry of approaching revolution . The superb simplicity of mind which could ignore the diversities of human nature was perhaps necessary for the uprooting of old abuses . But the delicate task of constructing a permanent government can not succeed unless the differences as well as the resemblances among men be taken into account. @# @# CHAPTER XI. @# PARIS. @# The members of the Third Estate differed among themselves far more than did those of the Clergy or the Nobility .

And although this was the unprivileged order , there were privileged bodies and privileged persons within it . Corporations , guilds , cities , and whole provinces possessed rights distinct from those of the rest of the country. @# In the reign of Louis XVI. the city of Paris held a position , in the world even more prominent than that which it holds to-day . For France was then incontestably the first European power , and Paris was then , as it is now , not only the capital and the metropolis , but the heart and centre of life in France . The population was variously estimated at from six to nine hundred thousand . The city was growing in size , and new houses were continually erected . There was so much building at times during this reign , that masons worked at night , receiving double wages . Architects and master masons were becoming rich , and rents were high when compared to those of other places . Strangers and provincials flocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the fine season . Sentimentalists read the works of Rousseau and praised a country life , but then as now few people that could afford to stay in the city , and had once been caught by its fascination , cared to live permanently out of town . Footnote : Mercier , iv. 205 , vii. 190 . Babeau , Paris en 1789 , 27. @# The public buildings and gardens were worthy of the first city in Europe . With some of them travelers of to-day are familiar . The larger number of the remarkable churches now standing were in existence before the Revolution . Of the palaces then in the city , the three most famous have met with varied fates . The Luxembourg , which was the residence of the king ' s eldest brother , is the least changed . To the building itself but small additions have been made . Its garden was and is a quiet , orderly place where respectable family groups sit about in the shade . The Louvre has been much enlarged . Under Louis XVI. it consisted of the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river ( the gallery of Apollo ) , and of a long gallery , since rebuilt , running near the river bank and connecting this older palace with the Tuileries . About one-half of the space now enclosed between the two sides of the enormous edifice , and known as the Place du Carrousel , was then covered with houses and streets . The land immediately to the east of the Tuileries palace was not built upon , but part of it was enclosed by a tall iron railing . Such a railing , either the original one or its successor , was to be seen in the same place until recent times and may be standing to-day . The Place du Carrousel , as it then existed outside of this railing , was a square of moderate size surrounded by houses. @# The Palace of the Tuileries itself has had an eventful history since Louis XVI. came to the throne , and has only in recent years been utterly swept from the ground . But the gardens which bear its name are little changed . The long raised terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no Rue de Rivoli , and the only access to the gardens on the north side was by two or three streets or lanes from the Rue Saint-Honore . Within the garden the arrangement of broad , sunny walks and of shady horse-chestnuts was much the same as now . Well-dressed persons walked about or sat under the trees , and the unwashed crowd was admitted only on two or three holidays every year . In consequence of this exclusion the wives of respectable citizens used to come unattended to take the air in the gardens . They were brought in sedan-chairs , from which they alighted at the gate . What is now the Place de la Concorde was then the Place Louis Quinze , with an equestrian statue of that " well-beloved " monarch where the obelisk stands . Not far from the pedestal of that statue overturned ,  --  not far from the entrance of the street called Royal ,  --  near the place where many people had been crushed to death in the crowd assembled to see the fireworks in honor of the marriage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to stand the scaffold on which that Dauphin and that princess , after reaching the height of earthly splendor , were to pay for their own sins and weaknesses and for those of their country. @# To the west of the square came the Champs Elysees , still somewhat rough in condition , but with people sitting on chairs even then to watch the carriages rolling by , as they still do on any fine afternoon . The Boulevards stretched their shady length all round the city , and were a fashionable drive and walk , near which the smaller theatres rose and throve , evading the monopoly of the opera and the Francais . But the boulevards were almost the only broad streets . Those interminable , straight avenues which even the brilliancy and movement of Paris can hardly make anything but tiresome , had not yet been cut . The streets were narrow and shady ; most of them not very long , nor mathematically straight , but keeping a general direction and widening here and there into a little square before a church door , or curving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not in accordance with the taste of the age and caused progressive people to complain of Paris . Rousseau , who had seen Turin , was disappointed in the French capital . On arriving he saw at first only small , dirty , and stinking streets , ugly black houses , poverty , beggars , and working people ; and the impression thus made was never entirely effaced from his mind , in spite of the magnificence which he recognized at a later time . Young thought that Paris was not to be compared with London ; and Thomas Jefferson wrote that the latter , though handsomer than Paris , was not so handsome as Philadelphia . But the Parisian liked his uneven streets well enough . There were fine things to be seen in them . Although the city was crowded , there were gardens in many places , belonging to convents and even to private persons . And once in your walk you might come out upon a bridge , where , if there were not houses built upon it , you might catch a breath of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant village of Chaillot ; for nowhere does he set more gloriously than along the Seine .

There was little water to use , and none to waste , for the larger part of the city depended upon wells or upon the supply brought in buckets from the Seine . The scarcity was hardly to be regretted , for there were few drains to carry dirty water away , and the gutter was full enough already . It ran down the middle of the street , which sloped gently toward it , and there were no sidewalks . When it rained , this street-gutter would rise and overflow , and enterprising men would come out with little wooden bridges on wheels and slip them in between the carriages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he did not slip in from the wet plank ; while a pretty woman would sometimes trust herself to the arms of a burly porter . Footnote : See the print in Fournel , 539 , after Granier . Conductors were coming into use before the Revolution . Encyc. meth . Jurisp. , x. 716 . The houses had gutters along the eaves , but no conductors coming down the walls , so that the water from the roofs was collected and came down once in every few yards in a torrent , bursting umbrellas , and deluging cloaks and hats . The manure spread before sick men ' s doors to deaden the sound of wheels was washed down the street to add to the destructive qualities which already characterized the mud of Paris . An exceptionally heavy fall of snow would entirely get the better of the authorities , filling the streets from side to side with pools of slush , in which fallen horses had been known to drown . When the sun shone again all was lively as before ; the innumerable vehicles crowded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing well out beyond the wheels , and threatened to eviscerate the pedestrian , as he flattened himself against the house . The carriages of the nobility dashed through the press , the drivers calling out to make room ; they were now seldom preceded by runners in splendid livery , as had been the fashion under the former reign , but sometimes one or two huge dogs careered in front , and the Parisians complained that they were first knocked down by the dogs and then run over by the wheels . At times came street cleaners and swept up some of the mud , and carted it away , having first freely spattered the clothes of all who passed near them . In some streets were slaughter-houses , and terrified cattle occasionally made their way into the neighboring shops . The signs swung merrily overhead . They appealed to the most careless eye , being often gigantic boots , or swords , or gloves , marking what was for sale within ; or if in words , they might be misspelt , and thus adapted to a rude understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street musicians performed on their instruments . Ballad-singers howled forth the story of the last great crime .

Footnote : Mercier , xii. 71 , i. 107 , 123 , 215 , 216 . Young , i. 76 . In 1761 the signs in the principal streets were reduced to a projection of three feet .

The cocked hat was believed to have permanently driven out the less graceful round hat . It was jauntily placed on the wearer ' s own hair , which was powdered and tied behind with a black ribbon . For the coat , stripes were in fashion , of light blue and pink , or other brilliant colors . The waistcoat and breeches might be pale yellow , with pink bindings and blue buttons ; the garters and the clocks of the white stockings , blue ; the shoes black , with plain steel buckles . This would be an appropriate costume for the street ; although many people wore court-mourning from economy , and forgot to take it off when the court did . A handsome snuff-box , often changed , and a ring , were part of the costume of a well-dressed man ; and it was usual to wear two watches , probably from an excessive effort after symmetry ; while it is intimated by the satirist that clean lace cuffs were sometimes sewn upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fashion plates in various books . For evening dress , suits all of black were beginning to come in towards 1789 . In the street gentlemen were beginning to dress like grooms , aping the English . The sword was still worn at times , even by upper servants , but the cane was fast superseding it . Women also carried canes , which helped them to walk in their high-heeled shoes . Mercier , xi. 229 , i. 293. @# The costume of gentlemen in this reign was as graceful in shape as any that has been worn in modern Europe . The coat and waistcoat were rather long and followed the lines of the person ; the tight breeches met the long stockings just below the knee , showing the figure to advantage . The dress of ladies , on the other hand , was stiff , grotesque , and ungainly ; waists were worn very long , and hoops were large and stiff . But the most noticeable thing was the huge structure which , almost throughout the reign , was built upon ladies ' heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was very elaborate in design , it could not often be taken down . No little skill was required to construct it , and poor girls could sometimes earn a living by letting out their heads by the hour to undergo the practice of clumsy barbers ' apprentices . At one time red hair came into fashion and was simulated by the use of red powder . The colors for clothes varied with the invention of the milliners , and the habit of giving grotesque names to new colors had already arisen in Paris . About 1782 , " fleas ' back and belly , " " goose dung , " and " Paris mud " were the last new thing . Caps " a la Boston , " and " a la Philadelphie , " had gone out . Instead of the fashion-plates with which Paris has since supplied the world , but which under Louis XVI. were only just coming into use , dolls were dressed in the latest style by the milliners and sent to London , Berlin , and Vienna . Footnote : Franklin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ii. l97 , l98 , 213 @# The dress of the common people was more brilliant and varied than it is in our time , but probably less neat . Cleanliness of person has never been a leading virtue among the French poor . Although there were elaborate bathing establishments in the river , a large proportion of the people hardly knew what it was to take a bath . Footnote : But Young says , " In point of cleanliness I think the merit of the two nations is divided ; the French are cleaner in their persons , and the English in their houses . " Young , i. 291 . The whole comparison there given of French and English customs is most interesting . The sentimental milkmaids of Greuze are no more like the tanned and wrinkled women that sold milk in the streets of Paris , than the court-shepherdesses of Watteau and Boucher were like the rude peasants that watched their sheep on the Jura mountains . But the Parisian cockney was fond of dress , and would rather starve his stomach than his back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day in sight of the street , reminding the Parisians of seraglios , were never empty of those who had money to spend . For leaner purses , the women who sat under umbrellas in front of the Colonnade of the Louvre had bargains of cast-off clothing ; and there were booths along the quays on Sunday , and a fair in the Place de la Greve on Monday .

I believe that this is entirely untrue , and that in the second half of the nineteenth century a smaller proportion of the inhabitants of civilized countries suffers from hunger and cold than ever before . Whatever be the figures by which fortunes are counted , there is no doubt that the visible difference between the rich and the poor was greater in the reign of Louis XVI. than in our own time .

His liveried servants waited about his door . His lackeys climbed behind his coach , and awoke the dimly lighted streets with the glare of their torches , as the heavy vehicle bore him homeward from the supper and the card-table . The luxuries of great houses were relatively more expensive . A dish of early peas might cost six hundred francs . Six different officials ( a word less dignified would hardly suit the importance of the subject ) , had charge of the preparation of his lordship ' s food and drink , and bullied the numerous train of serving-men , kitchen-boys , and scullions . There was the maitre d ' hotel , or housekeeper , who attended to purchases and to storing the food ; the chief cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and entremets ; the pastry-cook , with general charge of the oven ; the roaster , who fattened the poultry and larded the meat before he put the turnspit dog into the wheel ; an Italian confectioner for sweet dishes ; and a butler to look after the wine . Bread was usually brought from the bakers , even to great houses , and was charged for by keeping tally with notches on a stick . Baking was an important trade in Paris , and in times of scarcity the bakers were given the first chance to buy wood . For delicacies , there was the great shop at the Hotel d ' Aligre in the Rue Saint Honore , a " famous temple of gluttony , " where truffles from Perigord , potted partridges from Nerac , and carp from Strasbourg were piled beside dates , figs , and pots of orange jelly ; and where the foreigner from beyond the Rhine , or the Alps , could find his own sauerkraut or macaroni .

The host opened his house two or three times a week for dinner or supper , and anybody who had once been invited was always at liberty to drop in . Thus arose a class of respectably dressed people who were in the habit of dining daily at the cost of their acquaintance . After dinner it was the fashion to slip away ; the hostess called out a polite phrase across the table to the retreating guest , who replied with a single word .

Mercier says that a man who was a whole year without calling at a house where he had once been admitted had to be presented over again , and make some excuse , as that he had traveled , etc .

It was of course but a small part of the inhabitants of Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare of the middle classes was far less elaborate ; but it generally included meat once or twice a day . The markets were dirty , and fish was dear and bad . The duties which were levied at the entrance of the town raised the price of food , and of the wine which Frenchmen find equally essential . Provisions were usually bought in very small quantities , less than a pound of sugar at a time . Enough for one meal only was brought home , in a piece of printed paper , or an old letter . Unsuccessful books thus found their use at the grocer ' s . Before dinner the supply for dinner was bought ; before supper , that for supper . After the meal nothing was left . The poorer citizens carried their dinners to be baked at the cook-shops , and saved something in the price of wood .

It was sold about the streets for two sous a cup , including the milk and a tiny bit of sugar . While the rich drank punch and ate ices , the poor slaked their thirst with liquorice water , drawn from a shining cylinder carried on a man ' s back . The cups were fastened to this itinerant fountain by long chains , and were liable to be dashed from thirsty lips in a crowd by any one passing between the drinker and the water-seller . Footnote : Mercier , viii. 270 , n. , iv. 154 , xii. 296 , v. 310 . See plates in Fournel , 509 , 516. @# For the very poor there was second-hand food , the rejected scraps of the rich . In Paris they were nasty enough ; but at Versailles , where the king and the princes lived , even people that were well to do did not scorn to buy dishes that had been carried untouched from a royal table . Near the poultry market in Paris , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capons boiling in it ; you bought a boiled fowl with its broth , a savory mess . In general the variety of food was increasing . Within forty years the number of sorts of fruit and vegetables in use had almost doubled . Footnote : Ibid. , v. 85 , 249 . Genlis , Dictionnaire des Etiquettes , ii. 40 , n. , citing Buffon . Scraps of food are still sold in the Central Market of Paris. @# The population was divided into many distinct classes , but there was a good deal of intercourse from class to class , nor was it extremely difficult for the able and ambitious to rise in the world . The financiers had become rich and important , but were regarded with jealousy . In an aristocratic state the nobles think it all wrong that any one else should have as much money as themselves . This is not strange ; but it is more remarkable that the common people are generally of the same opinion , and that , while the profusion of the great noble is looked on as no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagance of the mere man of money is condemned and derided . This tendency was increased in France by the fact that many of the greatest fortunes were made by the farmers of the revenue , who were hated as publicans even more than they were envied as rich men . Yet one financier , Necker , although of foreign birth , was perhaps the most popular man in France during this reign , and it was not the least of Louis ' s follies or misfortunes that he could not bring himself to share the admiration of his people for his Director General of the Treasury. @# The mercantile class in Paris did not hold a high position . The merchant was too much of a shopkeeper , and the shopkeeper was too much of a huckster . The smallest sale involved a long course of bargaining . This was perhaps partly due to the fact , admirable in itself , that the wife was generally united with her husband in the management of the shop . The customary law of Paris was favorable to the rights of property of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands in commerce and consulted in all affairs . This habit is still observed in France . It tends to draw husband and wife together , by uniting their occupations and their interests . Unfortunately it tends also to the neglect of children , especially in infancy , when their claims are exacting . Thus the Frenchwoman of the middle class is in some respects more of a wife and less of a mother than the corresponding Anglo-Saxon . The babies , even of people of very moderate means , were generally sent out from Paris into the country to be nursed . Later in the lives of children , girls were kept continually with their mothers , watched and guarded with a care of which we have little conception . Boys were much more separated from their parents , and left to schoolmasters . Neither boys nor girls were trusted or allowed to gain experience for themselves nearly as much as we consider desirable . Footnote : Mercier , i. 53 , v. 231 , ix. 173 , vi. 325. @# Marriages were generally left to the discretion of parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often governed by pecuniary , rather than by personal considerations in choosing the wives and husbands of their sons and daughters . Such a system of marriage would seem unbearable , did we not know that it is borne and approved by the greater part of mankind . It is possible that the chief objection to it is to be found less in the want of attachment between married people , which might be supposed to be its natural result , than in the diminution of the sense of loyalty . In England and America it is felt to be disgraceful to break a contract which both parties have freely made , with their eyes open ; and this feeling greatly reenforces the other motives to fidelity . Yet while the rich and idle class in France , if the stories of French writers may be trusted , has always been honeycombed with marital unfaithfulness , there are probably no people in the world more united than the husbands and wives of the French lower and middle classes . Working side by side all the week with tireless industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek their innocent pleasures together on Sundays and holidays . The whole neighborhood of Paris is enlivened with their not unseemly gayety , as freely shared as the toil by which it was earned . The rowdyism of the sports in which men are not accompanied by women , the concentrated vulgarity of the summer boarding-house , where women live apart from the men of their families , are almost equally unknown in France . In the latter part of the eighteenth century many of the comfortable burghers of Paris owned little villas in the suburbs , whither the family retired on Sundays , sometimes taking the shop-boy as an especial favor . The common people also were to be found in great numbers in the suburban villages , such as Passy , Auteuil , or in the Bois de Boulogne , dancing on the green ; although in the reign of Louis XVI. they are said to have been less gay than before .

But it was noticed that on account of the abridgment of the power of the trade-guilds , and the consequent rise of competition , French goods were losing in excellence , while they gained in cheapness ; so that it was said that workmanship was becoming less thorough in Paris than in London. @# The police of Paris was already remarkable for its efficiency . The inhabitants of the capital of France lived secure in their houses , or rode freely into the country , while those of London were in danger of being stopped by highwaymen on suburban roads , or robbed at night by housebreakers in town . From riots , also , the Parisians had long been singularly free , and for more than a century had seen none of importance , while London was terrified , and much property destroyed in 1780 by the Gordon riots . In spite of the forebodings of some few pessimists , people did not expect any great revolution , but rather social and economic reforms . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the powers of insurrection . The crash came , at last , not through the failure of the ordinary police , but from demoralization at the centre of government and in the army . While Louis still reigned in peace at Versailles , the administration of Paris went on efficiently . Correspondence was maintained with the police of other cities . Criminals and suspected persons , when arrested , could be condemned by summary process . The Lieutenant General of Police had it in his discretion to punish without publicity . The more scandalous crimes were systematically hidden from the public ; a process more favorable to morality than to civil liberty . For the criminal classes in Paris arbitrary imprisonment was the common fate , and disreputable men and women Were brought in by bands . Footnote : Mercier , vi. 206 . Monier , 396. @# The liability to arbitrary arrest affected the lives of but a small proportion of the citizens after all .

At the Hotel Dieu , the greatest hospital in Paris , six patients were sometimes wedged into one filthy bed . Yet even , there , some improvement had taken place . And while Howard considered that hospital a disgrace to Paris , he found many other charitable foundations in the city which did it honor . Here as elsewhere there was no uniformity .

More than eight hundred students attended the school of surgery . In medicine , inoculation was slowly making its way , but was resorted to only by the upper classes . Excessive bleeding and purgation were going out of fashion , but the poor still employed quacks , or swallowed the coarse drugs which the grocers sold cheaper than the regular apothecaries , or relied on the universal remedy of the lower classes in Paris , a cordial of black currants .

In some cases , it is said , the great lords contented themselves with sending their liveried servants to represent them . Soldiers formed the escort . The crowd in the street fell on its knees as the procession passed . Flowers , incense , music , the faithful with their foreheads in the dust , all contributed to the picturesqueness of the scene .

The Host was carried under a dais of which the cords were held by respected citizens , and was escorted by forty Swiss guards . A hundred and fifty censers swung incense on the air . The diplomatic corps watched the procession from the balcony of the Venetian ambassador , even the Protestants bowing or kneeling with the rest . Footnote : Mercier , iii. 78 . Cognel , 101. @# From time to time , through the year , these great ceremonies were renewed , either on a regularly returning day , or as occasion might demand . On the 3d of July the Swiss of the rue aux Ours was publicly carried in procession . There was a legend that a Swiss Protestant soldier had once struck the statue of the Holy Virgin on the corner of this street with his sword , and that blood had flowed from the wounded image . Therefore , on the anniversary of the outrage , a wicker figure was carried about the town , bobbing at all the sacred images at the street corners , with a curious mixture of piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss , but the people of Switzerland , who were numerous and useful in Paris , remonstrated at a custom likely to bring them into contempt ; and the grotesque giant was thereupon arrayed in a wig and a long coat , with a wooden dagger painted red in his hand . The grammarian Du Marsais once got into trouble on the occasion of this procession . He was walking in the street when one woman elbowed another in trying to get near the statue . " If you want to pray , " said the woman who had been pushed , " go on your knees where you are ; the Holy Virgin is everywhere . " Du Marsais was so indiscreet as to interfere . Being a grammarian , he was probably of a disputatious turn of mind . " My good woman , " said he , " you have spoken heresy . Only God is everywhere ; not the Virgin . " The woman turned on him and cried out : " See this old wretch , this Huguenot , this Calvinist , who says that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attacked by the mob and forced to take refuge in a house , whence he was rescued by the guard , which kept him shut up for his own safety until after nightfall .

Each captive was conducted by two angels , to whom he was bound with red and blue ribbons , and the angels carried scrolls emblazoned with the arms of the orders . There was the usual display of banners and crosses , guards and policemen ; there were bands of music and palm-branches . The long march required frequent refreshment , which was offered by the faithful , and it is said that many of the captives and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken angel must have been a cheerful sight indeed . The object of this procession was to raise money to redeem more prisoners from slavery , for the Barbary pirates were still suffered by the European powers to plunder the commerce of the Mediterranean and to kidnap Christian sailors .

For a procession of persons delivered by charity from imprisonment for not paying their wet nurses , see Mercier , xii. 85. @# Nor was it in great festivals alone that the religious spirit of the people was manifested . On Sundays all shops were shut , and the common people heard at least the morning mass , although they were getting careless about vespers . Every spring for a fortnight about Easter , there was a great revival of religious observance , and churches and confessionals were crowded . But throughout the year , one humble kind of procession might be met in the streets of Paris . A poor priest , in a worn surplice , reverently carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plods along in front , with an acolyte to ring the bell , at the sound of which the passers-by kneel in the streets and cabs and coaches are stopped . Louis XV. once met the " Good God , " as the eucharistic wafer was piously called , and earned a short-lived popularity by going down on his silken knees in the mud . All persons may follow the viaticum into the chamber of the dying . The watch , if it meets the procession on its return , will escort it back to its church .

Already they have supplied the markets . They meet only the early clerks , fresh shaven and powdered , hastening to their offices . At nine , the town is decidedly awake .

The waiters from the lemonade-shops are bringing coffee and cakes to the occupants of furnished lodgings . On the boulevards , young dandies , struck with Anglomania , contend awkwardly with their saddle-horses. @# At ten lawyers in black and clients of all colors flock to the island in the river where are the courts of law .

Near him is the wheel of fortune . The wheel is turned , it stops , and a boy with blindfolded eyes puts his hand into an opening in the wheel , and pulls out a ticket , which he hands to the official . The latter opens it , holding it up conspicuously in front of him to avert suspicion of foul play . The ticket is then posted on a board , and the boy pulls out another . The crowd is noisy and excited at first , then sombre and discouraged as all the chances are exhausted. @# Noon is the time when the Exchange is most active , and when lazy people hang about the Palais Royal , whose gardens are the centre of news and gossip .

At quarter past five the streets are full again . People are on their way to the theatre , or going for a drive in the boulevards , and the coffee-houses are filling . As daylight fails , bands of carpenters and masons plod heavily toward the suburbs , shaking the lime from their heavy shoes . At nine in the evening people are going to supper , and the streets are more disorderly than at any time in the day .

Footnote : Ibid. , iv. 148. @# @# CHAPTER XII. @# THE PROVINCIAL TOWNS. @# The provincial towns in France under Louis XVI. were only beginning to assume a modern appearance . Built originally within walls , their houses had been tall , their streets narrow , crooked , and dirty . But in the eighteenth century most of the walls had been pulled down , and public walks or drives laid out on their sites . The idea that the beauty of cities consists largely in the breadth and straightness of their streets had taken a firm hold on the public mind . This idea , if not more thoroughly carried out than it can be in an old town , has much in its favor . Before the French Revolution the broad , dusty , modern avenues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to light and air , but where there is little shade from the sun or shelter from the wind , were beginning to supersede the cooler and less windy , but malodorous lanes where the busy life of the Middle Ages had found shelter . Large and imposing public buildings were constructed in many towns , facing on the public squares . With the artistic thoroughness which belongs to the French mind , the fronts of the surrounding private houses were made to conform in style to those of their prouder neighbors . The streets were lighted , although rather dimly ; their names were written at their corners , and in some instances the houses were numbered. @# But such innovations did not touch every provincial town , nor cover the whole of the places which they entered . More commonly , the old appearance of the streets was little changed . The houses jutted out into the narrow way , with all manner of inexplicable corners and angles . The shop windows were unglazed , and shaded only by a wooden pent-house , or by the upper half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a shelf , from which the wares could overrun well into the roadway . Near the wooden sign which creaked overhead stood a statue of the Virgin or a saint . Glancing into the dimly-lighted shop , you might see the master working at his trade , with a journeyman and an apprentice . The busy housewife bustled to and fro ; now chaffering with a customer at the shop-door , now cooking the dinner , or scolding the red-armed maid , in the kitchen . Footnote : Babeau , La Ville , 363 . Ibid . , Les Artisans , 73 , 82 . Viollet le Duc , Dict. d ' Architecture ( Boutique. ) @# The house was only one room wide , but several stories high . Upstairs were the chambers and perhaps a sitting-room . Even among people of moderate means the modern division of rooms was coming into fashion , and beds were being banished from kitchens and parlors . There were more beds also , and fewer people in each , than in former years . On the walls of the rooms paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light colors , with brightness and cleanliness , were displacing soft dark tones , dirt , and vermin . Footnote : Babeau , Les Bourgeois , 9 , 19 , 37. @# Houses were thinly built and doors and windows rattled in their frames . The rooms in the greater part of France were heated only by open fires , although stoves of brick or glazed pottery were in common use in Switzerland and Germany ; and wood was scarce and dear . In countries where the winter is short and sharp , people bear it with what patience they may , instead of providing against it , as is necessary where the cold is more severe and prolonged . Thicker clothes were worn in the house than when moving about in the streets . Wadded slippers protected the feet against the chill of the brick floors , and the old sat in high-backed chairs to cut off the draft , with footstools under their feet . Chilblains were , and are still , a constant annoyance of European winter . The dressing-gown was in fashion in France as in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last century . Similar garments had been in use in the Middle Ages . They belong to cold houses . Footnote : Babeau , Les Artisans , 123 .

The townspeople dressed in less bright colors than the peasants of the country , but not cheaply in proportion to their means . Already social distinctions were disappearing from costume , and it was remarked that a master-workman , of a Sunday , in his black coat and powdered hair , might be mistaken for a magistrate ; while the wife of a rich burgher was hardly distinguishable from a noblewoman .

We read of a family in a small town of Auvergne before the middle of the century , composed of a man and his wife , with a large number of children , the wife ' s mother , her two grandmothers , her three aunts , and her sister , all sitting about one table , and living on one modest income . The husband and father had a small business and owned a garden and a little farm . In the garden almost enough vegetables were raised for the use of the family . Quinces , apples , and pears were preserved in honey for the winter . The wool of their own sheep was spun by the women , and so was the flax of their field , which the neighbors helped them to strip of an evening . From the walnuts of their trees they pressed oil for the table and for the lamp . The great chestnuts were boiled for food . The bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine of their own grapes. @# In the country towns , among people of small means , a healthy freedom was allowed to boys and girls . There were moonlight walks and singing parties . Love matches resulted from thus throwing the young people together , and were found not to turn out worse than other marriages . But in large towns matches were still arranged by parents , and the girls were educated rather to please the older people than the young men , for it was the elders who would find husbands for them . Footnote : Marmontel , i. 10 , 51 . Babeau , Les Bourgeois , 315. @# Amusements were simple and rational in the cultivated middle class . People in the provinces were not above enjoying amateur music and recitation , and the fashion of singing songs at table , which was going out of vogue in Paris , still held its own in smaller places . A literary flavor , which has now disappeared , pervaded provincial society . People wrote verses and made quotations . But this did not prevent less intellectual pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the card-table . Balls were given either by private persons or by subscription . Dancing would begin at six and last well into the next morning ; for the dwellers in small towns will give themselves up to an occupation or an amusement with a thoroughness which the more hurried life of a capital will not allow . The local nobility , and the upper ranks of the burgher class , the officers , magistrates , civil functionaries and their families , met at these balls ; for social equality was gaining ground in France . The shopkeepers and attorneys contented themselves , as a rule , with quieter pleasures , excursions into the country , theatres , visits , and little supper parties . Dancing in the open air and street shows , in which once all classes had taken part , were now left to the poor .

He dressed poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bread and vegetables formed the solid part of his diet , beans being a favorite article of food . Wages appear to have been about twenty-six sous a day for men , and fifteen for women on an average , the value of money being perhaps twice what it is now , but the variations were great from town to town . The hours of work were long . People were up at four in the summer mornings , in provincial towns , and did not stop working until nine at night . But the work was the varied and leisurely work of home , not the monotonous drudgery of the great factory . Moreover , holidays were more than plenty , averaging two a week throughout the year . The French workman kept them with song and dance and wine ; but drunkenness and riot were uncommon . Footnote : Babeau , Les Artisans , 21 , 34 . A. Young , i. 565. @# The workman ' s chance of rising in his trade was far better than it is now . There were not twice as many journeymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 63 . Perhaps more workmen under Louis XVI . Manufactures on a larger scale were coming in . At Marseilles , 65 soap factories employed 1000 men ; 60 hatters , 800 men and 400 women . Julliany , i. 85 . But Marseilles was a large city . In smaller places the old domestic trades still held their ground . The capital required for setting up in business was small , although the fees were relatively large ; the police had to be paid for a license ; and the guilds for admission. @# These guilds regulated all the trade and manufactures of the country . They held strict monopolies , and no man was allowed to exercise any handicraft as a master without being a member of one of them . The guilds were continually squabbling . Thus it was an unceasing complaint of the shoemakers against the cobblers that the latter sold new shoes as well as second-hand , a practice contrary to the high privileges of the shoemakers ' corporation . Sometimes the civil authorities were called on to interfere . We find the trimming-makers of Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining a regulation which forbids all persons wearing buttons of the same cloth as their coats , or buttons that are cast , turned or made of horn. @# Minute regulations governed manufactures exercised within the guilds . The number of threads to the inch in cloth of various names and kinds was strictly regulated . New inventions made their way with difficulty against the vested rights of these corporations . Thus Le Prevost , who invented the use of silk in making hats , was exposed to all sorts of opposition from the other hatters , who said that he infringed their privileges ; but he overcame it by perseverance , and finally made a large fortune . The regulations served to keep up the standard of excellence in manufacture , which probably fell in some respects on their abolition . They were often made to benefit the masters at the expense of the workmen , who on their side formed secret combinations of their own , fighting by much the same methods as such unions employ to-day . Thus in 1783 the journeymen paper-makers instituted a system of fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body the service of those who resisted them . Footnote : Babeau , Les Artisans , 51 , 108 , 202 , 239 .

He became a manufacturer , a merchant , perhaps even , when he retired on his fortune , a royal secretary , with a patent of hereditary nobility . His children , instead of leaving school when they had learned to read , write and cipher , and had taken their first communion , stayed on , or were promoted to a higher school , to learn Latin and Greek .

No longer a single maidservant , red in the face and slatternly about the skirts , clatters among the pots in the little dark kitchen behind the shop , or stands with her arms akimbo giving advice to her mistress . The successful man has mounted his house on a larger scale , and if the insolent lackeys of the great do not hang about his door , there are at least one or two of those quiet and attentive old men-servants , whose respectful and self-respecting familiarity adds at once to the comfort and the dignity of life . Footnote : Babeau , Les Artisans , 158 , 167 , 181 , 204 , 271. @# It was not within the walls of his own house alone that the burgher might be a man of importance . The towns retained to the end of the monarchy a few of the rights for which they had struggled in earlier and rougher times . Assemblies differently composed in different places , but sometimes representing the guilds and fraternities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took a part in the government of the town . They voted on loans , on the conduct of the city ' s lawsuits , and on municipal business generally . Officers were chosen in various ways , some of them by very complicated forms of election , and some by throwing of lots . These officers bore different titles in different places , as consuls , echevins , syndics , or jurats . They sometimes exercised considerable executive and judicial powers , controlling the ordinary police of the city . Their perquisites and privileges varied from town to town , with the color of their official robes , and the ceremonies of their installation . The cities valued their ancient rights , shorn as they were of much substantial importance by the centralizing servants of the crown ; and repeatedly bought them back from the king , as time after time the old offices were abolished , and new-fashioned purchasable mayoralties set up in their stead .

Comfort , indeed , has been well said to be a modern word for a modern idea . Dirt and smells were so common , even a hundred years ago , as hardly to be noticed , and diseases arising from filth and foul air were borne as unavoidable dispensations of divine wrath . Yet some advance had been made . Baths had been absolutely essential in the Middle Ages when every one wore wool ; the result of the common use of linen had been at first to put them out of fashion ; under Louis XVI. they were coming in again . The itch , so common in Auvergne early in the century that in the schools a separate bench was set apart for the pupils who had it , was almost unknown in 1786 . Leprosy had nearly disappeared from France before the end of the seventeenth century . The plague was still an occasional visitant in the first quarter of the eighteenth , in spite of rigorous quarantine regulations . On its approach towns shut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to cleansing and whitewashing . In 1722 , the doctors of Marseilles went about dressed in Turkey morocco , with gloves and a mask of the same material ; the mask had glass eyes , and a big nose full of disinfectants . How the sight of this costume affected the patients is not mentioned . When the plague was over , the Te Deum was sung , and processions took their way to the shrine of Saint Roch . Footnote : Babeau , Les Bourgeois , 177 . Ibid . , La Ville , 443. @# Schools were established in every town . The schoolmasters formed a guild , the writing-masters another , and neither was allowed to infringe the prerogatives of its rival . The schoolmasters in towns were generally appointed by the clergy , but the municipal government kept a certain control . A good deal of the teaching of boys was done by Brotherhoods , while that of girls was almost entirely entrusted to Sisters . In many places primary instruction was free and obligatory , at least in name . The law making it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bringing the children of Protestants under Catholic teaching ; but this law was not always enforced . In northern France , there were evening schools for adults , and Sunday schools where reading and writing was taught , probably to children employed in trades during the week . A certain amount of religious instruction preceded the ceremony of the " first communion . " As to secondary or advanced schools , they are said to have been more numerous and accessible in the eighteenth century than now , when they have mostly been consolidated in the larger cities . There were five hundred and sixty-two establishments reckoned as secondary in France in 1789 , about one third of them being in the hands of Brotherhoods . There were also many private schools licensed by the municipal authorities . The boys when away from home lived very simply indeed . Marmontel , who was sent from his own little town to attend the school at a neighboring one , has left a description of his mode of life . " I was lodged according to the custom of the school with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisan of the town ; and my father , sad enough at going away without me , left with me my package of provisions for the week . They consisted of a big loaf of rye-bread , a small cheese , a piece of bacon and two or three pounds of beef ; my mother had added a dozen apples . This , once for all , was the allowance of the best fed scholars in the school . The woman of the house cooked for us ; and for her trouble , her fire , her lamp , her beds , her lodging and even the vegetables from her little garden which she put in the pot , we gave her twenty-five sous apiece a month ; so that all told , except for my clothing , I might cost my father from four to five louis a year . " This was about 1733 , and the style of living may have risen a little , even for schoolboys , during the following half century . The sons of professional men and people of the middle class were better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the former were sent to good schools , while the latter were brought up at home by incompetent tutors . It would appear to have been easy enough for a boy to get an education ; harder for a girl . But no one who has glanced at the literature of the time will imagine that France was then destitute of clever women . Footnote : Babeau , La Ville , 482 . Ibid . , Les Bourgeois , 369 . Marmontel , i. 16 . Montbarey , i. 280 . Ch. de Ribbe , i. 320. @# In the eighteenth century great changes were taking place in the national life . Simple artisans presumed to be more comfortable in 1789 than the first people of the town had been fifty years before . The middle class lived in many respects like the nobility , with material luxuries and intellectual pleasures . Yet the artificial barriers were still maintained . The citizen , unless of noble birth , was excluded not only from the army , but from the higher positions in the administration and in the legal profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with alternate familiarity and impertinence by that of the sword or by that of the court . The last held most of the positions which strongly appealed to vanity , many of those which bore the largest profit . Jealousy is possible only where persons or classes come near each other , and before the Revolution the various classes in France were rapidly drawing together. @# @# CHAPTER XIII. @# THE COUNTRY. @# There is perhaps no great country inhabited by civilized man more favored by nature than France . Possessing every variety of surface from the sublime mountain to the shifting sand-dune , from the loamy plain to the precipitous rock , the land is smiled upon by a climate in which the extremes of heat and cold are of rare occurrence . The grape will ripen over the greater part of the country , the orange and the olive in its southeastern corner . The deep soil of many provinces gives ample return to the labor of the husbandman . If the inhabitants of such a country are not prosperous , surely the fault lies rather with man than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French peasant before the Revolution as a miserable and starving creature . " One sees certain wild animals , male and female , scattered about the country ; black , livid and all burnt by the sun ; attached to the earth in which they dig with invincible obstinacy . They have something like an articulate voice , and when they rise on their feet they show a human face ; and in fact they are men . They retire at night into dens , where they live on black bread , water , and roots . They spare other men the trouble of sowing , digging and harvesting to live , and thus deserve not to lack that bread which they have sown . " This description , eloquently written by La Bruyere , has been quoted by a hundred authors . Some have used it to embellish their books with a sensational paragraph ; others , and they are many , to show from what wretchedness the French nation has been delivered by its Revolution. @# The advances of the last hundred years are many and great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three generations a great nation has emerged from savagery . Let us see what part of La Bruyere ' s description may be set down to rhetoric , and to the astonishment of the scholar who looks hard at a countryman for the first time . Undoubtedly the peasant is sunburnt ; unquestionably he is dirty . His speech falls roughly on a town-bred ear ; his features have been made coarse by exposure . His hut is far less comfortable than a city house . His food is coarse , and not always plentiful . All these things may be true , and yet the peasant may be intelligent and civilized . He may be as happy as most of the toilers upon earth . He may have his days of comfort , his hours of enjoyment. @# While the French writers of the eighteenth century find fault with many things in the condition of the peasant , their general opinion of his lot is not unfavorable . Voltaire thinks him well off on the whole . Rousseau is constantly vaunting not only the morality but the happiness of rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps because the people are too rich , and argues that France is not decrepit but vigorous .

We saw many most agreeable scenes as we passed along in the evening before we came to Lisle : little parties sitting at their doors ; some of the men smoking , some playing at cards in the open air , and others spinning cotton . Everything we see bears the mark of industry , and all the people look happy . We have indeed seen few signs of opulence in individuals , for we do not see so many gentlemen ' s seats as in England , but we have seen few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery . What strange prejudices we are apt to take concerning foreigners ! I will own that I used to think that the French were a trifling , insignificant people , that they were meagre in their appearance , and lived in a state of wretchedness from being oppressed by their superiors . What we have already seen contradicts this ; Footnote : Observe that this was written in French Flanders . Note by Dr. Rigby. the men are strong and athletic , and the face of the country shows that industry is not discouraged . The women , too ,  --  I speak of the lower class , which in all countries is the largest and the most useful ,  --  are strong and well made , and seem to do a great deal of labor , especially in the country . They carry great loads and seem to be employed to go to market with the produce of the fields and gardens on their backs . An Englishwoman would , perhaps , think this hard , but the cottagers in England are certainly not so well off ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women with large and heavy baskets on their backs have all very good caps on , their hair powdered , earrings , necklaces , and crosses . We have not yet seen one with a hat on . What strikes me most in what I have seen is the wonderful difference between this country and England . I don ' t know what we may think by and by , but at present the difference seems to be in favor of the former ; if they are not happy they look at least very like it. " @# " We have now traveled between four and five hundred miles in France , " says the same traveler in another place , " and have hardly seen an acre uncultivated , except two forests and parks , the one belonging to the Prince of Conde , as I mentioned in a former letter , the other to the king of France at Fontainebleau , and these are covered with woods .

It will also flourish where the soil is too poor to bear corn , and on the sides of precipices where no animal could draw the plough . " Footnote : Dr. Rigby , 11 , 96 . See also Sir George Collier , 21. @# Let us now turn to the other end of France , and hear another traveler , one generally less enthusiastic than the last . " The vintage itself , " says Arthur Young , " can hardly be such a scene of activity and animation , as this universal one of treading out the corn , with which all the towns and villages in Languedoc are now alive . The corn is all roughly stacked around a dry , firm spot , where great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round a centre , a woman holding the reins , and another , or a girl or two , with whips drive ; the men supply and clear the floor ; other parties are dressing , by throwing the corn into the air for the wind to blow away the chaff . Every soul is employed , and with such an air of cheerfulness , that the people seem as well pleased with their labor , as the farmer himself with his great heaps of wheat . The scene is uncommonly animated and joyous . I stopped and alighted often to see their method ; I was always very civilly treated , and my wishes for a good price for the farmer , and not too good a one for the poor , well received . " Footnote : Arthur Young , i. 45 ( July 24 , 1787 ) . @# These descriptions would give too favorable an idea if they were taken for the whole of France . All peasant women did not powder their hair and wear earrings .

They often went barefoot , and on their way to market carried their shoes on a stick until they drew near the town . They had to be thrifty , and might be seen picking weeds on the wayside into their aprons , to feed their cows . All provinces were not so rich as Flanders . There were vast stretches of waste land in France , given up to broom and heath . Wolves and bears were still a terror to remote farms . There were , moreover , times of famine , which the foolish regulations of the government aggravated , by preventing the free movement of provisions within the country . In some provinces these seasons of famine were often repeated . Then the wretched inhabitants sank into despair . Young people would refuse to marry , saying that it was not worth while to bring unfortunate children into the world . But in general the country people were laborious and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry ,  --  resembling in that respect the English before the Puritan revival rather than the Anglo-Saxons of more modern times .

The people lived partly on chestnuts. @# In the country , as in the towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of King Louis XIV. had been years of depression and misery . External wars , and the persecution of the Protestants at home , heavy taxation and bad government , had reduced the numbers and the wealth of the French nation . But with the accession of Louis XV. in 1715 , a time of recuperation had begun . During the seventy years that followed , the population increased from about sixteen to about twenty-six millions . The rent of land rose also . The natural excellence of the soil , the natural intelligence of the people , were bringing about a slow and uneven improvement . Footnote : Clamageran , iii. 464 . Bois-Guillebert , 179 , and passim . Horn , 1 . The improvement was not universal . Lorraine is said to have lost prosperity from the time of its union with France in 1737 .

By a curious custom ( arising in I know not what form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more disastrous . It was usual to divide not only the whole estate , but every part of it among the heirs . Thus , if a peasant died possessed of six fields and left three children , it was not the custom that each child should take two fields , and that he who got the best should make up the difference in money to his brethren . Perhaps cash was too scarce for that . But every one of the six fields would be divided into three parts , one of which was given to each child , so that instead of six separate plots of ground , there were now eighteen . This process had been repeated until a farm might almost be shaded by a single cherry-tree . Footnote : Sybel , i. 22 . Cherest , ii. 532 . Turgot , iv. 260 . English writers , from Arthur Young to Lady Verney , wax eloquent over the evils of small holdings. @# The class of middling proprietors was very small . The incidents to the holding of land by all who were not noble drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come over the French country during the last hundred years consists , in a measure , in the formation of a class of men owning farms of moderate size. @# A large part of the soil belonged to the nobles and the clergy . The exact proportion can not be ascertained . It has been stated as high as two thirds ; but this is probably an exaggeration . These proprietors of the privileged classes seldom cultivated any very large part of their land themselves , by hired workmen , although certain privileges and exemptions were allowed to such as chose to keep their farms in their own hands . A few of them let their lands for a fixed rent in money . But the greater part of the cultivated soil which was owned by the nobility and clergy was in the hands of metayers , lessees who paid their rent in the shape of a proportionate part of the crops . Sometimes the landlord made himself responsible for a portion of the taxes ; sometimes he furnished cattle or farming implements . His share of the gross crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still common in some parts of France , is considered a good one neither for the landlord nor for the tenant , but is devised principally to meet the want of capital on the part of the latter . Footnote : Young reckons that the price of arable land and its rent are about the same in France as in England . The net revenue is larger in France , because there are no poor-rates and the tithe is more moderate in that country . The price of arable land he calculates to be on an average 20 Pounds per acre ; rent 15 shillings 7d. per acre = 3 9/10 per cent. of the salable value . From this deduct the two vingtiemes and 4 sous per livre ( taxes paid by the landlord ) and other expenses , and the net revenue remains between 3 and 3 1/4 per cent . The product of wheat in France is , however , much worse than in England , so that the proportion obtained by the landlord is greater and that of the tenant less . In France the landlord gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth to one sixth , sometimes only one tenth . A. Young , i. 353. @# We may imagine the country-houses of the nobles scattered over the face of the country so that the traveler would come upon one of them once in two or three miles . Sometimes the seat of the lord was an ancient castle , with walls eight feet thick , rising above the surrounding forest from the top of a steep hill , dark and threatening , but no longer formidable . Within , the great hall was stone-paved . Its walls were hung with dusky portraits and rusty armor . From the hall would open a spacious bedroom , with tapestried walls and a monumental bedstead . Curtains and coverlets showed the delicate embroidery of some ancestress , long since laid to rest in the family chapel . The very sheets had perhaps been woven by her shuttle . This bedroom , according to old custom , was still the living-room of the family . Sometimes the lord ' s house was modern , elegant , and symmetrical ; it was flanked with pavilions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balustrade , on which stood vases for growing plants . Inside the house were high-studded rooms with white walls and gilded mouldings . High-backed , crooked-legged chairs , in the style of the last reign , were ranged against the walls ; and near the middle of the dark , slippery , well-waxed floor , were lighter seats and stools . The grandmother ' s armchair with its footstool stood at the chimney corner , where the fire was religiously lighted on All Saints and put out at Easter , regardless of weather . Through the tall windows that opened down to the ground might be seen the long straight garden-walks , none too well kept , and clipped shrubs , with here and them a marble nymph , moss-grown and broken , or a fountain out of repair . The family did not spend much money in the place . There was little to do except in the season for shooting . Footnote : Taine , L ' ancien regime , 17 . Mme. de Montagu , 59. @# In order that this last occupation may be left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the great detriment of the crops . Poachers are sharply dealt with , and the peasant may not have a gun to protect him from wolves . There are laws enough against the wrongs wrought by landlords and gamekeepers , against the trampling down of young wheat , against vexatious complaints and fines , but the country people say that such laws are not fairly enforced . Especially is the case hard of those who live near the capitaineries or royal hunting-grounds . Here rural proprietors may not raise a new wall without permission , lest the hares be restrained of their liberty of eating cabbages . No crops can be cut until the appointed day , that the young partridges be not disturbed . Deer and rabbits live at free quarters in the cultivated fields . They are the peasants ' personal enemies , and among the first unlawful acts of the Revolution will be their wholesale destruction . Footnote : Olivier , 78 , mentions the laws protecting the crops .

Young , i. 8 ( May 25 , 1787 ) . @# In every village there is a church , sometimes even in small places a beautiful gothic building , oftener modest in size and of plain architecture . Once or twice in a day ' s ride the red roofs and high walls of a convent come in sight , not very different in appearance from a group of farm buildings ,  --  were it not for the chapel and its belfry ;  --  for here in France the farms are surrounded by high walls . The interminable straight roads , fine pieces of engineering , but little traveled , stretch out between the ploughed fields , with rows of Lombardy poplars on either hand , that tantalize the sun-baked traveler with a suggestion of shade. @# The peasants live in villages oftener than in detached farms , and the village itself is apt to have a rudely fortified appearance . The fields that stretch about it belong to the peasants , but with a modified ownership . Over them the lords exercise their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , annual , perpetual , inseparably attached to the soil . It is paid sometimes in money , sometimes in grain , fruits , or chickens , according to deed , or to long established custom . There is the champart , a rent proportional to the crop , also payable to the lord ; and there is the tithe which must be given to the clergy . Should the peasant wish to sell his holding , a fine called lods et ventes , amounting in some cases to one sixth of the price , must be paid to the lord by the purchaser , and on some estates the lord has also the right to refuse to accept the new tenant , and to take the bargain on his own account . Footnote : Prudhomme , 37 , 137 , 515. @# These are the common incidents of feudal tenure . Rights analogous to them may be found in England or in Germany , wherever that system has existed . And the vestiges of a state of things far older than feudalism have not entirely disappeared . The commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural lands were held by a common tenure . Even that tenure itself , with its annual redistribution of the fields , may be found in Lorraine . Footnote : Mathieu , 322. @# There were , moreover , many irksome restrictions on the peasant . In the lord ' s mill he must grind his corn ; in the lord ' s oven he must bake his bread ; to the lord ' s bull his cow must be taken . Days of labor on the lord ' s land might be demanded of him . Ridiculous customs , offensive to his dignity or his vanity , might be enforced . Newly married couples were in some parishes made to jump over the churchyard wall . In other places , on certain nights in the year , the peasants were obliged to beat the water in the castle ditch to keep the frogs quiet . These customs have been considered very grievous by democratic writers , nor were they so indifferent to the peasants themselves as the lovers of the good old times would have us believe . Footnote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of a customary right of banalite . The fee of the four banal was 1/24 of the bread by weight ; the moulin banal , 1/12 of the flour ; the pressoir banal , 1/10 to 1/12 of the wine ; but the fees varied in different places even in one province . It was complained that presses enough for the work were not furnished , and that grapes spoiled in consequence . Mathieu , 285. @# It was not always the lord of the soil who enjoyed and exercised the feudal rights . He had sometimes sold them to strangers , in whose hands they were merely revenue , and who demanded them harshly. @# The origin of these customs lay in a form of civilization that had long passed away . To understand the conditions on which the French peasants held their lands little more than a hundred years ago , we must glance back over many centuries . Feudalism began in military conquest . When the barbarians overran the Roman Empire , the victorious chiefs divided the land among their principal followers ; and the titles thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who received or inherited land was expected to appear in the field with his followers at the call of his chief . The tenant , in his turn , distributed the land among his friends on conditions similar to those on which he had himself received it ; and the process might be indefinitely repeated . Thus there came to be a hierarchy in the state , in which every member was responsible to his immediate superiors and obliged within certain limits to obey the man next above him , rather than the king who was supposed to rule them all . The obligations were various , according to the conditions on which the lands had been granted , but they always involved military service on the part of the grantee , and protection on the part of the grantor . The services being mutual , and the tenure the usual , or fashionable one , most persons who held land in any other way saw fit to conform to the feudal method ; and absolute , or allodial owners , where the tide of conquest had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered their lands to some neighboring lord , and received them back again on feudal conditions. @# But the tenure here described existed only among the comparatively rich and great . When the last feudal division had been accomplished , when the chief had made his last grant to his captains and the soil was divided among them , there still remained by far the larger part of the population which owed no feudal duty and held no feudal estate . The common soldiers of the invading army , the native people of the conquered country and their descendants , inextricably mixed together , remained upon the soil and cultivated it as free tenants , or as serfs . They paid for the use of the land on which they lived in money or in a share of the crops , or in services . They acknowledged the title of the feudal lords over them , and while struggling to make good bargains with their masters , they seldom set up a claim to equality , or to independence . The peasants came to think it the natural and divinely appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lords , with a partial obedience and a limited service . To ask why they were content so to serve , would be to open one of the greatest problems of history . Whatever the reason , over a large part of the world , and through the greater part of historical time , men have consented to obey other men whom they have not selected , and have generally preferred the hereditary principle to any other in determining to whom they would look up as their rulers. @# So the French peasants and their lords went on for centuries , living side by side , rendering each other mutual services , sometimes quarreling and sometimes making bargains . The peasants were called on for military service , but they and their families took refuge in the lord ' s castle when the frequent wars swept over the land . The mill , whose rough machinery was still an improvement on the rude hand-mill , or on the yet more primitive mortar and pestle ; the oven where the peasant could bake his bread without lighting a fire on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s day ; the bull of famous breed in all the country-side , were the lord ' s , and all his tenants must use them and pay for them , at rates fixed by immemorial custom , or perhaps by some long forgotten bargain , made when these conveniences were first furnished to the dwellers in the land . The lord led his peasants to battle , he protected them from the inhabitants of the next valley , he decided their differences in his court , where the more considerable of his tenants sat beside him ; he governed his people , well or ill , according to his character , but on the whole to their reasonable satisfaction . His government , such as it might be , was their only refuge from anarchy . The lord was governed , not very strictly , by a greater lord , who in his turn owed duty to a greater than he ; until , after one or more steps , came the king , or overlord of the land. @# The long struggle by which the kings of France had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost absolute monarchy , is not to be told here . From the tenth century to the seventeenth the combat was waged with varied success . The feudal lords lost much of their power , but kept much of their wealth and many of their privileges . The dukes and counts , whose fathers , in their own domains , had been as powerful as the king himself , retained their titles , and drew their incomes , but they spent their time in attendance on their sovereign . The petty lord still held his court of justice , over which his bailiff usually presided , but its functions had been gradually usurped by the royal judges . The castle , no longer needed for protection , was transformed into a country house . But many old customs and old rights were maintained , although their origin was forgotten . The peasants still worked for several days in the year on the lands of their lord , or paid a part of their crops in rent for their farms , although these had been in the possession of their forefathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , the peasants under Louis XVI. believed to be just , for they did not claim absolute ownership , but they considered the services onerous and degrading . Their ideas on these subjects were not very definite , but of late years a general sense of wrong had been growing in their minds . The long-lived quarrels which ever exist in the country-side were envenomed by stronger suspicions of injustice . It was a common complaint that the last survey and apportionment of rent had been unfair . The lords were no longer so far removed from their poorer neighbors as to be above envy . They were no longer so useful as to be considered necessary evils , as a large part of the community everywhere is prone to think of its governors. @# Let us look at the life of the peasant . His cottage is not attractive ; a low thatched building , perhaps without a floor . The barn is close against it , and the family is not averse to seeking the warmth of the cattle and of the dunghill . The windows are without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the open door . But the house belongs to the peasant , and is his home . He dares not improve it for fear of increased taxes . He cares not much to do so . It keeps him warm at night and dry when it rains ; daylight and fine weather will find him out of doors . If he can hide away a few pieces of silver in an old stocking , he will more readily bring them out to buy another bit of ground , than waste them in useless comforts and luxuries of building. @# The furniture was generally better than the house . A great bedstead , with curtains of green serge , was the principal piece , the centre of family life , the birthplace of the children , the death-bed of the parents . It was made as high as possible , to lift the sleepers above the damp ground . A feather-bed helped to keep them warm . A few cupboards and chests stood about the walls of the room , dark with age and grime . They were made of oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the eighteenth century comfort had much increased in the towns , but the country had seen little change. @# The dress , again , was generally better than the furniture . The costumes of the provinces are often the copy of some long-forgotten fashion of the court , simplified or changed to adapt it to rural skill and country needs . To be well dressed is a sign of respectability ; to be modestly housed may pass for a sign of thrift . On Sundays , bright coats , blue , gray , or olive , made their appearance . The women came out in good gowns and clean caps . There were flowered damask waists , sleeves of white serge , wine-colored petticoats . A gold cross was a sign of comparative wealth , but silver jewelry was common . Leather shoes were worn by both sexes . On week days there were wooden shoes , or bare feet in the southern provinces , and overalls of gray linen . Under Louis XVI. , cotton began to drive out the linen and woolen cloths of former years . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The change was contrary to beauty , but favorable to cleanliness. @# The food of the peasant depended much on his harvest . In good years and on good soils he was well fed ; in bad years and in poor districts , ill . Bread , the chief article of his diet , was cheaper and less good than in England , the wheat flour being mixed with rye , barley , oats , chestnuts or pease . The women made a soup , or porridge , by boiling this bread in water , adding milk perhaps , or a little bit of pork for a relish . Cheese and butter were fairly plenty , for common lands were extensive . Beef and mutton would be eaten at Easter-tide or at the festival of the patron saint , and most at wedding-feasts . Wine appears to have been considered a luxury , but a common one . It would seem that a peasant who did not taste it several times a week was accounted poor ; one who drank it freely but temperately twice a day would have been called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in common use . This description of the food of the country people applies rather to the poorer peasants , or to those whose condition was not above the average , than to those who were best off . In Normandy , good bread , meat , eggs , vegetables , and fruit , with plenty of cider , formed the daily fare in prosperous farm-houses . Footnote : This description of the condition of the peasants is taken chiefly from Babeau , La vie rurale. @# The peasants were not cut off from all social and political activity . Every rural parish formed a separate little community , very restricted in its rights and functions , yet not without valuable corporate powers . Footnote : The parish and the community were generally coterminous , but were not always so . Ibid . , Le Village , 97 . It could hold property , both real and personal ; it could sue and be sued ; it could elect its own officers and manage its own affairs . In the eighteenth century it became the fashion in France , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many parishes still held large tracts in the reign of Louis XVI . The sale of their woods , the letting of their pastures , of fishing rights , or of the office of wine-taster in grape-growing districts , formed the revenues of the rural community . Its expenses were many and various . It repaired the nave of the church , the choir being kept in order at the cost of the priest . The parsonage and the wall round the churchyard were maintained by the parish . The drawing for the militia was at the expense of the community . So were some of the roads . It paid the schoolmaster and the syndic . Then there were incidental expenses , such as the annual mass , the carriage of letters , the keeping in order of the church clock . Sometimes the accounts of a community show a charge for a present to some influential person , capable of helping in a lawsuit , or of effecting a reduction of the taxes assessed on the parish . It was a notable feature of the communal expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poorer neighbors . Into these rural matters privilege did not extend . Footnote : But this was not always the case . See the cahier of the Artignose in Provence , Archives parlementaires , vi. 249 . " Clochers et autres batiments generaux . ( Les seigneurs n ' en payent rien , meme pour leurs biens roturiers , pour les differentes charges des communautes ) . " @# The public meetings of these little communities were held on certain Sundays of the year after mass , or after vespers . Sometimes the meeting took place in the church itself , oftener in front of it , on the green . There the men of the village , streaming from the porch , stood or sat in groups on the grass , under the trees . Their own elected syndic presided . Ten was a quorum for ordinary business , but two thirds of the whole number was necessary to confirm a loan . A fine could be imposed for absence , or for leaving the assembly before adjournment. @# In these town meetings the affairs of the community were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let , repairs of public buildings or of roads were voted . The syndic was elected . A record of the proceedings was kept , and was afterwards submitted to the royal intendant for his approval , without which no action was valid . This system lasted to the eve of the Revolution , but was at that time giving way to another . Under pretense that the public meetings were disorderly , they were gradually obliged to surrender their functions to boards partly or wholly elected . But certain important matters , such as the election of a schoolmaster , were still left to the general assembly . At the same time the right of suffrage was somewhat curtailed . Voters were required to be twenty-five years old and to pay certain taxes. @# The village had its elected head , the syndic , Footnote : So called in the north of France . In the south , consul .

He had to attend to the drawing of the militia , to report epidemics among the cattle , to enforce the laws for the destruction of caterpillars . Beside him were other officers , also elected by the inhabitants , but more directly the servants of the central power than he . These were the collectors of taxes . The syndics and collectors had much work and responsibility , with little pay and no chance of promotion . Honest and capable men were much averse to taking such places and often tried to escape it . The dishonest acquired illicit gain in them , at the expense of their fellow-subjects . Serving the community was considered less an honor than a duty , and service could be forced on the unwilling citizen ; but the inhabitants in easy circumstances often found means to avoid the task , and the syndics and collectors were then chosen from among the poorer and less educated peasants . Some of them could neither read nor write . Footnote : The above description of the political life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village .

A public body that wishes to be well-served must not make public service too disagreeable . France suffered at once from overpaid courtiers , and from ill-treated syndics and collectors. @# The chief layman of the village was the lord ' s steward ( bailli ) , who exercised the judicial functions of his master . He held himself above the common peasants and his wife was called " Madame . " Her kitchen showed a greater array of pots and pans than that of her neighbors ; her linen and her jewelry were more abundant than theirs . The steward and the parish priest were the most important persons in the hamlet . Footnote : Babeau , La vie rurale , 156. @# The schoolmaster came far below the priest , who had over him a right of supervision . The main control of the schools , however , was in the hands of the communities , which elected the masters from candidates approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodoxy than on competence . The position of the village schoolmaster was not brilliant . His house usually consisted of two rooms , one for the school and one for the family ; his books were few , his clothes shabby . He was paid in part by the scholars , at the rate of three or five sous a month for reading , higher for writing and arithmetic . In some cases a tax of a hundred and fifty livres was laid on the parish for his benefit . But school was not held during the whole year ; the scholars would desert in a body early in Lent , and be kept busy in the fields until November . The master might act as surgeon , or attorney , or surveyor ; he might cultivate a plot of ground . He was expected to assist the priest at divine service , to lead the choir , or even to ring the bells . Simple primary schools were abundant in the country , especially in some of the northern provinces . In some villages the boys and girls went together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and the bishops , more familiar with the manners of the court than with those of the village , looked on these mixed schools with disfavor .

Nor was it necessary to confine himself entirely to agriculture . The lower walks of the law and of medicine might be attained by the son of a peasant , and if one generation of labor were hardly long enough to reach the higher , no career , except the few reserved for the upper nobility , was beyond the aspiration of the rising man for his children or his children ' s children .

There were games , ploughing matches , grinning matches . Holidays were frequent ,  --  too frequent , said the learned ; but probably they did not often come amiss to the peasants . On those days they could throw off their cares and play as heartily as they had worked .

And in France prosperity was growing . The peasant ' s taxes were constantly getting heavier , but his means of bearing them increased faster yet . The rising tide of material prosperity , the great change of modern times , could be felt , though feebly as yet , in the provinces of France. @# @# CHAPTER XIV. @# TAXATION .

Young reckons the revenue at the entire command of Louis XVI. at 680 , 664 , 943 livres , i. 575 . See also Stourm , ii. 182. @# The gross amount paid in taxes by the French nation before the Revolution will never be accurately known ; the subject is too vast and complicated , and the accounts were too loosely kept . Necker in his work on the " Administration of the Finances " reckons the sum annually paid by the people at five hundred and eighty-five million livres . Bailly ( whose book appeared in 1830 and has not been superseded ) makes the gross amount eight hundred and eighty millions . But from this should be deducted feudal dues and fees for membership of trade guilds , which Bailly includes in his estimate , and which were certainly private property , however objectionable in their character . There will remain less than eight hundred and thirty-seven million livres as the amount paid by about twenty-six million Frenchmen , in general and local taxation , including tithes ; an average of about thirty-two livres a head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load had been rightly distributed . If we allow the franc of to-day one half of the purchasing power of the livre of 1789 , the modern Frenchman yet pays more than his great-grandfather did . But there can be little doubt that he pays it more easily to himself . In the eighteenth century the Englishman was probably better off than his French neighbor , but his advantage was not undoubted . Grenville , in 1769 , speaks of the comparative lightness of taxes and cheapness of living which , he says , must make France an asylum for British manufacturers and artificers . Young , twenty years later , asserts that the taxes in England are much more than double those in France , but more easily borne . Necker says that England bears as large a burden of taxation as France , in spite of a smaller number of inhabitants and a less amount of money in circulation ; but bears it more readily because it is better distributed . And Chastellux , while arriving at a similar conclusion , remarks that after all the French is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation . Footnote : Necker , De l ' Administration , i. 35 , 51 .

There were differences of places and differences of persons . This is pretty sure to be true of all countries , but in France the differences were very large and were not sanctioned by the popular conscience . In a country which had become strongly conscious of its unity , and which was full of national feeling , some provinces were taxed much more heavily than others , not for their own local purposes , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place came those provinces which were included in the general assessment of taxes . These were divided into twenty-four districts ( generalites ) , over each of which was an intendant . Twenty of these districts formed the heart of old France , extending irregularly from Amiens on the north to Bordeaux on the south , and from Grenoble on the east to the sea . To these were added the conquered or ceded provinces : Alsace , Lorraine , Bar , the Three Bishoprics , Franche Comte , Flanders , and Hainault , forming among them four districts and enjoying privileges superior to those of old France . All these formed the Lands of Election ( pays d ' Election ) . On the other hand were the Lands of Estates ( pays d ' Etats ) , provinces which had retained their assemblies , and with them some of their ancient rights of taxing themselves , or at least of levying in their own way those taxes which the central government imposed . This was a privilege highly prized by the provinces which possessed it . These provinces formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the duchy of Burgundy , Artois , Brittany , and some others . The central administration was so oppressive , at the same time that it was clumsy and inefficient , that every province and city was anxious to compound for its taxes , and to settle them at a fixed rate , though a high one . This was accomplished on the largest scale by the Lands of Estates , but similar privileges , to a greater or less extent , were maintained by most of the cities . We must remember , here as elsewhere , that France had not sprung into being as a homogeneous nation with her modern boundaries . From the accession of the House of Capet in the tenth century , province after province had been added to the dominions of the crown . Many of them had preserved ancient rights . Customs and tolls differed among them , duties were exacted in passing from one to the other . Privileges , the prizes of old wars , rights assured in some cases by solemn treaties , had to be regarded . The wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The end of the period found all Europe full of privileged territories , persons , or corporations . Privileges and rights were regarded as property . Modern struggles have been for ideas , and among the most cherished of these have been equality and uniformity . The sacredness of property and of contract have in a measure gone down before them .

Walloon Flanders was in the anomalous position of forming part of a generalite , but possessing Estates . Bailly , ii. 327. @# Although the Provincial Estates differed in the various provinces which possessed them , they included in almost every case members of the three orders . The Clergy were usually represented by bishops , abbots , and persons deputed by chapters ; the Nobility either by all nobles whose title was not less than a hundred years old , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons , by the mayors and deputies of the towns . The three Orders sometimes sat apart , sometimes together . In the intervals between their sessions their powers were delegated to intermediate commissions , small boards for the regulation of current affairs . There was nothing democratic in such a constitution . Even the representatives of the commonalty were taken from among the most privileged members of their order . Nor were the powers of the Estates extensive . They bargained with the royal intendants for the gross amount of the taxes to be assessed on their provinces . They divided this sum and charged it to the various subdivisions of their territory . They levied it by taxes similar to those of the general government . Footnote : Lucay , Les assemblees provinciales , 111 . Necker , Memoire au roi sur l ' etablissement des administrations provinciales , passim. @# But in spite of all drawbacks the Provincial Estates were much valued by the provinces which possessed them . They were at least a guarantee that some local knowledge and local patriotism would be applied to local affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right essential to good government , both for the information of rulers and for giving vent to the feelings of subjects . This right is , and has long been , so nearly free in English-speaking countries , that it is hard to realize that there are civilized lands where men may not quietly and respectfully express their wishes . Yet in old France , as in a large part of Continental Europe to-day , the citizen who publicly gave an opinion on public matters , or who pointed out a well-known public grievance , was considered a disturber of the peace . Under such circumstances , a body of men who were allowed to discuss and recommend might render a great service to their country by simply using that freedom . The complaints of the Estates of each province were transmitted to the king in council , by a document known as a cahier , and the wishes thus expressed often formed a basis of legislation , or of administrative orders. @# Among the spasmodic efforts at reform made under Louis XVI. were two attempts to extend the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1778 and 1779 . Provincial assemblies were established in those years by way of experiment in two provinces , Berry and Haute Guyenne . These assemblies were composed of forty-eight and fifty-two members respectively , one half being taken from among the clergy and nobility , one half from the Third Estate of the towns and the country . A third of the members of the Assembly of Berry were appointed by the king , and these elected their fellow-members , care being taken to preserve the equality of classes . One third of the members were to be renewed by the assembly itself once in three years . The body was , therefore , in no way dependent on popular election . The assembly met and voted as one chamber . Its functions were almost purely administrative , the assessment of taxes , the care of roads and the management of charitable institutions . All this was done under close supervision of the intendant and , through him , of the minister . The assembly sat only once in two years , for a time not exceeding one month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sessions . The general plan of the Assembly of Haute Guyenne was similar to that of the Assembly of Berry. @# Eight years passed between the establishment of these experimental assemblies and the convocation of the first Assembly of Notables at Versailles ,  --  eight important years in French history . Necker was driven from power , but the two new bodies survived the reactionary policy of his successors , and did some good service . The fallen minister kept his popularity and his influence with the public at large . His great book on the " Administration of the Finances " was in all hands , eighty thousand copies having been rapidly sold . In it he expounds his favorite scheme of Provincial Assemblies , and praises the working of the two that have been established . He points out that they are not representative bodies , empowered to make bargains with the king and to impede the government , but administrative boards , entrusted by the sovereign with the duty of watching over the interests of the people of their districts . The Assembly of Notables of 1787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not completely . They established provincial assemblies throughout France on a plan of their own . One half of the members of these new bodies were to be chosen in the first place by the king ; the second half being elected by the first . But at the end of three years one quarter part of the assembly was to retire , and its place was to be filled by a true election . This , however , was not to be direct , but in three stages . A parochial board was to be created in every village , composed of the lord and the priest ex officio , and of several elected members . These parochial boards were to elect the district boards , ( assemblees d ' election ) and the latter were to elect the new members of the Provincial Assembly . The march of events after 1787 prevented these elections from taking place . But the nominated assemblies met twice , once for organization and once for business .

It was sometimes said that the noble paid with his blood , the villein with his money . But the order of the Nobility had come to include many persons who never thought of shedding their blood for their country ; to include , in fact , the rich and prosperous generally . These were not ( as they are sometimes represented to have been ) , quite free from taxation . Something like one half of the taxes were indirect , and might be supposed to be paid by all classes in proportion to their consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to find ways partially to escape . Some of the direct taxes were deducted from salaries , or imposed on incomes , but it was said that the rich and powerful often succeeded in having their incomes lightly assessed . By way of increasing the inequality of taxation , the government had a habit , when in need of more money than usual , of adding a percentage to some old tax , instead of devising a new one , thus bearing most heavily with the new impost on those classes which were most severely taxed already. @# First among French taxes , both in blundering unfairness and in evil fame , came the Land Tax or Taille , producing for the twenty-four districts a revenue of about forty-five million livres , or with its accessory taxes , of about seventy-five millions . Footnote : Bailly , ii. 307 . Necker , De l ' Administration , i. 6 , 35 , puts the taille at 91 millions , but I think he includes the tailles abonnees , paid by the Pays d ' etats , although not those paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the Middle Ages was paid to the lord by his tenants . In the fifteenth century , however , it had already been diverted to the royal treasury , and its product was employed in the maintenance of troops . It was therefore paid only by villeins , for the nobles served in person , and the clergy by substitute , if at all. @# The exemption of the upper orders from liability to the taille clung to that tax after the reason for such freedom had ceased to exist . The tax itself early grew to be of two kinds , real and personal . The taille reele , common in the southern provinces of France , was a true land-tax , assessed according to a survey and valuation on all lands not accounted noble , nor belonging to the church , nor to the public . The distinction between noble and peasant lands was an old one ; and the peasant lands paid the tax even when owned by privileged persons . Footnote : Turgot , iv. 74. @# Over the greater part of France , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taille personelle was in force . This bore on the profits of the land and on all forms of industry ; but the churchmen and the nobles were exempt , at least in part . Footnote : There appears to have been a limit to the exemption of nobles cultivating their own lands . Owing to its personal nature , the tax was payable at the residence of the person taxed . If a peasant lived in one parish and derived most of his income from land situated in another , he was taxable at the place of his residence , at a rate perhaps entirely different from that of the parish in which his farm was situated . It might happen that a large part of the lands of a parish were owned by non-residents , and that the ability of the parish to pay its taxes was thus reduced . But there were exceptions to the rule by which the tax followed the person , and the whole matter was so complicated as to be a fertile cause of dispute and of double taxation . Footnote : Turgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was peculiar . The gross amount of the taille was determined twice a year by the royal council , and apportioned arbitrarily among the twenty-four districts ( generalites ) of France , and then subdivided by various officials among the sub-districts ( elections ) and the parishes . The divisions thus made were very unequal ; some provinces , sub-districts , and parishes being treated much more severely than others , apparently rather by accident or custom than for any equitable reason . An influential person could often obtain a diminution of the tax of his village . When the work of subdivision was completed , the syndics and other parish officers were notified of the tax laid on their parishes , which were thenceforth liable for the amount . But the taille had still to be apportioned among the inhabitants . For this purpose from three to seven collectors were elected in every rural community by popular vote . The collectors assessed their neighbors at their own discretion , and were personally responsible to the government for the whole amount assessed on the parish . In consideration of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percentage in addition to the taille , for their own pay . Footnote : " Six deniers par livre " = 2 1/2 per cent . Turgot , vii. 125 . Sometimes 5 per cent . Babeau , Le Village , 225 . The whole process was the cause of endless bickerings and disputes , lawsuits and appeals , and the collectors were frequently ruined in spite of all their efforts . They were ignorant peasants , unused to accounts , sometimes unable to read . In some of the mountain parishes of the Pyrenees their accounts were kept on notched sticks to a period not very long before the Revolution . Footnote : Bailly , ii. 159 . Horn , 224 Babeau , Le Village , 222 , 224 . Turgot , vii. 122 , iv. 51 . Encyclopedie , xv. 841 ( Taille ) . A similar practice existed in the English Court of Exchequer , to a later date. @# The liability to the taille was joint . A gross sum was laid on the parish , and if one person escaped , or was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . On the other hand , if one man were overcharged , the burden of his neighbors was lightened . Thus it was every one ' s interest to seem poor . And the taxes were so important a matter , taking so large a part of the yearly income , that they modified the whole conduct of life . People dared not appear at their ease , lest their shares should be increased . They hid their wealth and took their luxuries in secret . One day , Jean Jacques Rousseau , traveling on foot , as was his wont , entered a solitary farm-house , and asked for a meal . A pot of skimmed milk and some coarse barley bread were set before him , the peasant who lived in the house saying that this was all he had . After a while , however , the man took courage on observing the manners and the appetite of his guest . Telling Rousseau that he was sure he was a good , honest fellow , and no spy , he disappeared through a trap-door , and presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bran , a ham , and a bottle of wine . An omelet was soon sizzling in the dish . When the time came for Rousseau to pay and depart , the peasant ' s fears returned . He refused money , he was evidently distressed . Rousseau made out that the bread and the wine were hidden for fear of the tax-gatherer ; that the man believed he would be ruined , if he were known to have anything .

Bois-Guillebert , 191. @# As it was for the advantage of individuals to be thought poor , so it was best for villages to appear squalid . The Marquis of Argenson writes in his journal : " An officer of the election has come into the village where my country-house is , and has said that the taille of the parish would be much raised this year ; he had noticed that the peasants looked fatter than elsewhere , had seen hens ' feathers lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , that I spent a great deal of money in the village for my household expenses , etc . This is what discourages the peasants . This is what causes the misfortunes of the kingdom . This is what Henry IV. would weep over were he living now . " Footnote : D ' Argenson , vi. 256 ( Sept. 12 , 1750 ) . See also vi. 425 , vii. 55 , viii. 8 , 35 , 53. @# The country people had grown to be very distrustful and suspicious wherever officials of the government were concerned . " I remember a singular feature of this subject , " says Necker . " I think it was twenty years ago that an intendant , with the laudable intention of encouraging the manufacture of honey and the cultivation of bees , began by asking for statistics as to the number of hives kept in the province . The people did not understand his intentions , they were , perhaps , suspicious of them , and in a few days almost all the hives were destroyed . " Footnote : De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be induced to pay promptly , lest he should be thought to have money . The tax was due in four payments , from the first of October to the last of April , but the collection of one instalment was seldom completed before the following one was due ; that of one year seldom made before the next had come . The peasants obliged the collectors to wring out the hard-earned copper pieces one or two at a time . The tardy were vexed with fines and distraints . Furniture , doors , the very rafters and floors were sold for unpaid taxes . In the time of Louis XV. , if a whole village fell too much behindhand , its four principal inhabitants might be seized and carried off to jail . This corporal joint-liability was ended by a law passed under the ministry of Turgot , and apparently not repealed on his fall .

Kaufmann , 33 . Notice that the two vingtiemes are constantly spoken of as the dixieme. ) , which , as their name implies , were in theory taxes of five per cent. on incomes . From these the clergy only were freed ( having bought of the crown a perpetual exemption ) . Two twentieths and four sous in the livre of the first twentieth , or eleven per cent. , was the regular rate in the reign of Louis XVI. , and was expected to bring in from fifty-five to sixty million livres a year .

The product of agriculture paid the largest part , but a percentage was retained on salaries and pensions paid by the government , and the incomes of public officers receiving fees was estimated . In spite of the desire to include every income in the operation of this tax , it was generally believed that valuations were habitually made too low , and that unfair discrimination took place . The inhabitants of some provinces , on the other hand , were thought to be overcharged . Attempts at rectification were resisted by the courts of law , the doctrine being asserted that the valuation of a man ' s income for the purposes of this tax could not legally be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in the rights of the upper classes , who shared in the payment of the twentieths , with the indifference manifested to the arbitrary manner in which the common people were treated in levying the Land Tax .

The rules were complicated , giving rise to endless disputes . In theory the very poor were exempt , but the exemption was not very generous , for maid-servants were charged at the rate of three livres and twelve sous a year , and there were yet poorer people who paid less than half that amount . If the poor man failed to pay , a garrison ( garnison ) was lodged upon him . A man in blue , with a gun , came and sat by his fire , slept in his bed , and laid hands on any money that might come into the house , thus collecting the tax and his own wages . The amount levied by the poll-tax and accessories was from thirty-six to forty-two million livres a year . Footnote : Bailly , ii. 307 . Necker , De l ' Administration , i. 8 .

Once in six years the Controller General of the Finances for the time being entered into a contract , nominally with a man of straw , but actually with a body of rich financiers , who appeared as the man ' s sureties , and who were known as the Farmers General . The first operation of the Farmers , after entering into the contract , was to raise a capital sum for the purpose of buying out their predecessors , of taking over the material on hand , and of paying an advance to the government ; for although many individual Farmers General held over from one contract to the next , the association was a new one for each lease . In 1774 , just before the death of King Louis XV. , a new contract was made , and the capital advanced amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed interest on this sum at the rate of ten per cent. for the first sixty millions , and of seven per cent. for the remaining 33 , 600 , 000 livres . This interest was , however , taxed by the government for the two twentieths. @# The rent paid by the Farmers under this contract was 152 , 000 , 000 livres a year , for which consideration they were allowed to collect the indirect taxes and keep the product . This system , which is at least as old as the New Testament , is now generally condemned , but in the eighteenth century it found defenders even among liberal writers. @# The Farmers General in the contract of 1774 were sixty in number , but they did not divide among themselves all the profits of the enterprise . It was the habit to accord to many people a share in the operations of the farm , without any voice in its management . The people thus favored were called croupiers ; king Louis XV. himself was one of them .

The Farmers at first threatened to throw up their bargain , but the Controller told them that if they did so he would not return their advances , but only pay interest on them . In spite of this swindle , the lease turned out on the whole much to the benefit of the Farmers. @# In 1780 , when the lease above mentioned expired , Necker was Director of the Finances . He introduced reforms into the General Farm , cutting down the number of Farmers from sixty to forty , and reducing their gains .
