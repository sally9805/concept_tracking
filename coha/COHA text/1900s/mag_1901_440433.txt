IT was one hundred years ago on the 4th of February since the Supreme Court of the United States first sat in the new Capitol at Washington , that " wilderness city , set in a mudhole , " of whose beginnings we have all lately been reading . The court sat with a new Chief Justice , John Marshall , of Virginia . At that time he was something over forty-five years old , for he was born on September 24 , 1755 . His home had always been in Virginia . The first twenty years of his life were passed in that part of Prince William County which became , a few years after Marshall 's birth , the new , wide-spreading , frontier county of Fauquier , ? so named , after a Virginia fashion , from the new . royal governor of 1758 . He was born in the eastern part of it , and after ten years , or so , lived in the western part , at Oakhill and in the neighborhood , just under the Blue Ridge .

At one time the farm comprised an estate of six thousand acres . Since 1865 it has passed out of the hands of the family . It is beautifully placed on high , rolling ground , looking over a great stretch of fertile country , and along the chain of the Blue Ridge , close by . To this regions , where his children and kindred lived , about a hundred miles from Richmond , Marshall delighted to resort in the summer , all his life long . In the autumn of 1807 , after the Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after the commitment of Colonel Burr for a misdemeanor , I galloped to the mountains . " " lumen the wing , " he writes to Judge Story in 1828 , " for my friends in the upper country , where I shall find rest and dear friends , occupied more with their farms than with party politics . " When Marshall was about eighteen years old he began to study Blackstone ; but he quickly dropped it , for the troubles with Great Britain thickened , and , like his neighbors , he prepared for fighting . ' The earliest personal description of Marshall that we have belongs to this period . It is preserved in Horace Binney 's admirable address at Philadelphia , after Marshall 's death . He gives it from the pen of an eyewitness , a " venerable kinsman " of Marshall . News had collie , in May , 1775 , of the fighting at Concord and Lexington . The account shows us the youth , as lieutenant , drilling a company of soldiers in Fauquier County : " He was about six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion , showing little if any rosy red , yet good health , the outline of the face nearly a circle , and , within that , eyes dark to blackness , strong and penetrating , beaming with intelligence and good nature ; an upright forehead , rather low , was terminated in a horizontal line by a mass of raven-black hair , of unusual thickness and strength . The features of the face were in harmony with this outline , and the temples fully developed . The result of this combination was interesting and very agreeable . The body and limbs indicated agility rather than strength , in which , however , he was by no means deficient . He wore is purple or pale blue hoisting shirt , and trousers of the same material fringed with white . A round black hat , mounted with the buck 's tail for a cockade , crowned the figure and the man . He went through the manual exercise by word and motion , deliberately pronounced and performed in the presence of the company , before he required the men to imitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most perfect temper .. . " After a few lessons the company were dismissed , and informed that if they wished to hear more about the war , and would form a circle about him , he would tell them what he understood about it . The circle was formed , and he addressed the company for something like an hour . He then challenged an acquaintance to a game of quoits , and they closed the day with foot races and other athletic exercises , at which there was no betting . " This , " adds Mr. Binney , " is a portrait , my fellow citizens , to which , in simplicity , gayety of heart , and manliness of spirit , in everything but the symbols of the youthful soldier , and one or two of those lineaments which the hand of time , however gentle , changes and perhaps improves , he never lost his resemblance . All who knew him well will recognize its truth to nature . " In the war , Marshall served , as might be expected , with courage and fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was in the fall of 1775 , at Nor folk ; afterwards he served in New Jet .. sey , Pennsylvania , and New York ; and again in Virginia , toward the end of the war . He was at Valley Forge , in the fighting at the Brandywine , Germantown , Monmouth , Stony Point , and Powles Hook , between 1776 and 1779 . He served often as judge advocate , mai in this way was brought into personal relations with Washington and Hamilton . A fellow officer and messmate describes him , during the dreadful winter at Val . ley Forge , as neither discouraged nor disturbed by anything , content with whatever turned up , and cheering everybody by Isis exuberance of spirits and " his in. exhaustible fund of anecdote . " He was " idolized by the soldiers And his brother officers . " President Quincy gives us a glimpse of him at this period , as he heard hint described at a dinner with John Randolph and a large company of Virginians and other Southern gentlemen . They were talking of Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said , " he relates , " that lie surpasses ! any man in the army : that when the soldiers were idle at their quarters , it was usual for the officers to engage in matches at quoits , or in jumping and racing ; that he would throw a quoit farther , and beat at a race any other ; that he was the only man who , with a running jump , could clear a stick laid on the heads of two risen as tall as himself . On one occasion he ran in Isis stocking feet with a comrade . His mother , in knitting his stockings , hail the legs of blue yarn and the heels of white . This circumstance , combined with his uniform success in the race , led the soldiers , who were always present at these races , to give him the sobriquet of ' Silver-Heels , ' the name by which Ise NVIIS generally known among them . " Toward the end of 1779 , owing to the disbanding of Virginia troops at the end of their term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Virginia to await the action of the legislature as to // raising new troops . It was a fortunate visit ; for at Yorktown he met the young girl who , two or three years later , was to become his wife ; and lee was also able to improve his leisure by attending , for a few months in the early part of 1:80 , two courses of lectures at the college , on law and natural philosophy . This was all of college or university that inc ever saw ; but later he received their highest honors from several universities . Harvard made him doctor of laws in 1806 . Marshall 's opportunity for studying law , under George Wythe , at William and Mary College , seems to have been owing to a change in the curriculum , made , just at that time , at the instance of Jefferson , governor of the state , and , in that capacity , visitor of the college . The chair of divinity had just been abolished , and one of law and police , and another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty voted that , " for the encouragement of science , a student , on paying annually 1000 pounds of tobacco , shall be entitled to attend any school of the following Professors , viz. : of Law and Police ; of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics , " etc . Marshall chose the two courses above named ; he must have been one of the very first to avail himself of this new privilege . He remained only one term . In view of what was to happen by and by , it is interesting to observe that his opportunity for an education in law came , thus , through the agency of Thomas Jefferson . The records of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at William and Mary College , where that now famous society had originated less than a year and a half before , show that on the 18th of May , 1780 , " Captain John Marshall , being recommended as a gentleman who would make a worthy member of the society , was balloted for and received ; " and three clays later lie was appointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of government is more favorable to public vir tue than a Commonwealth . " Bushrod Washington and other well-known names are found among his associates in this chapter , which has been well called " an admirable nursery of patriots and statesmen . " It was in the summer of 1780 that Marshall was licensed to practice law . During this visit to Virginia , as I have said , he met at Yorktown the little lady , fourteen years old , who was to become his wife three years later , and the MO-they of his ten children , ' and was to receive from him the most entire devotion until the day of her death at Christmas , in 1831 . Some letters of her older sister , Mrs. Carrington , written to another sister , have lately been printed , which give no a glimpse of Captain Marshall in his twenty-fifth year . These ladies were the daughters of javelin Ambler , formerly collector of customs at Yorktown , and then treasurer of the colony , and living in that town , next door to the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom , under the name of " Belinda , " Jefferson had languished , in his youthful correspondence of seine twenty years before . The girls had often heard the captain 's letters to his family , and had the highest expectations when they learned that he was coming home from the war . They were to meet him first at a ball , and score contending for the prize beforehand . Mary , the youngest , carried it off . " At the first introduction , " writes her sister , who was but one year older , " he became devoted to her . " " For my Olen part , " she adds , " I felt not the smallest wish to contest the prize with her . . ; . Sine , with a glance , divined his character , .. . while I , expecting an Adonis , lost all desire of becoming agreeable in his eyes when I beheld his awkward , unpolished manner and total negligence of person . How trivial now scene an such objections ! " she exclaims , writing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 332 John , Marshall . admiration of his relations to herself and all her family , and , above all , to his wife . " His exemplary tenderness to our unfortunate sister is without parallel . With a delicacy of frame and feeling that baffles all description , she became , early after her marriage , a prey to extreme nervous affection , which , more or less , has embittered her comfort through her whole life ; but this has only seemed to increase his care and tenderness , and he is , as you know , as entirely devoted as at the moment of their first being mar-tied . Always and under every circumstance an enthusiast in love , I have very lately heard him declare that he looked with astonishment at the present race of lovers , so totally unlike what he had been himself . Ills never failing cheerfulness and good humor are a perpetual source of delight to all connected with him , and , I have not a doubt , have been the means of prolonging the life of her Ise is so tenderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the very end of her life , " another member of his family connection has said . And Judge Story , in speaking of Idol after his wife 's death , described hint as " the most extraordinary lean I ever saw for the depth and tenderness of his feelings . " A little touch of his manner to Isis wife is seen in a letter , which is in print , written to her from the city of Washington , on February 23 , 1825 , in Isis seventieths year . He had received an injury to his knee , about which Mrs. Marshall was anxious . " I shall be out , " he writes , " in a few days . All the ladies of the secretaries have been to see me , some more than once , and have brought me more jelly than I could eat , and many other things . I thank them , and stick to my barley broth . Still I have lots of time on my hands . HOW do you think I beguile it ? I am almost tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must know that I begin with the ball at York , our splendid assembly at the Palace in Williamsburg , my visit to Richmond for a fortnight , my return to the field , and the very welcome recep. tion you gave use on my arrival at Dover , our little tiffs and makings-up , my feelings when Major A. was courting you , my trip to the Cottage the Ambler Ileum in Hanover County , where the marriage took place , ? the thousand little incidents , deeply affecting , in turn . " This " ball at York " was the one of which Mrs. Carrington wrote ; nunl of the " assembly at the Palace " she also gave an account , remarking that " Marshall was devoted to my sister . " Miss Martineau , who saw him the year before he died , speaks with great empha. sis of what she calls his " reverence " and his affectionate respect for women . There were many signs of this all through his life . Even in the grave and too monotonous course of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little gleans of this sort , that lights up the page ; as when he speaks of Washington 's engagement to lies . Custis , a lady " who to a large fortune and a fine person added these amiable accomplishments which . . . fill with silent but unceasing felicity the quiet scenes of private life . " When he is returning front France , in 1798 , Ise writes gayly back from Bordeaux to the Secretary of Legation at Paris " Present nne to my friends in Paris ; and have the goodness to say to Madame Vilette , in my name and in the handsomest manner , everything which respectful friendship can dictate . When you have done that , you will have rendered not quite half justice to my sentiments . " " Ile was a man , " said Judge Story , " of deep sensibility and tenderness ; . . . whatever may be Isis fame in the eyes of the world , that which , in a just sense , was his brightest glory was the purity , toffeetionateness , liberality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army in 1781 , when most of the fighting in Virginia was over ; he began practice in Fauquier County . when the courts were opened , after Cornwallis 's surrender , in October of that year . Among his neighbors he was always a favorite . In the spring of 1782 he was elected to the Assembly , and in the ; tutumn to the important office of member of the Executive Council . " Young Mr. Marshall , " wrote Edmund Pendleton , presiding judge of the Court of i , . , Ap- peals , to Madison , in November of that year , " is elected a councilor .. . . He is clever , but I think too young for that department , which he should rather have earned , as a retirement and reward , by ten or twelve years of hard service . " But , whether young or old , the people were forever forcing him into public life . Eight times he was sent to the Assembly ; in 1788 to the Federal Convention of Virginia , and in 1798 to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1797-1798 , and as Secretary of State in 1800-1801 . Unwelcome as it was to him , almost always , to have his brilliant and congenial place and prospects at the bar thus interfered with , we can see now what an admirable preparation all this was for the great station for which , a little later , to the endless benefit of his country , he was destined . What drove him into office so often was , in a great degree , that delightful and remarkable combination of qualities which made everybody love and trust ! dm , even his political adversaries , so that he could be chosen when no one else of his party was available . In this way , happily for his country , he was led to consider , early and deeply , those difficult problems of government that distressed the country in the dark period after the close of the war , and during the first dozen years of the Federal Constitution . As regards the effect of his earlier experience in enlarging the circle of a patriot 's thoughts and affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascribe my devotion to the Union , and to a government competent to its preservation , at least as much to casual circumstances as to judgment . I had grown up at a time ... when the maxim ? United we stand , divided we fall ' was the maxim of every orthodox American ; and I had imbibed these sentiments so thoroughly that they constituted is part of my being . I carried them with me into the army , where I found myself associated with brave men from different states who were risking life and everything valuable in a common cause , . . . and where I was confirmed in the habit of considering America as my country and Congress as my government . " It was this confirmed " habit of considering America as my country , " communicated by him to his countrymen , which enabled them to carry through the great struggle of forty years ago , and to save for us all , North and South , the inestimable treasure of the Union . After Marshall 's marriage , in January , 1783 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . It was still a little town , but it had lately become the capital of the state , and the strongest men at the bar gradually gathered there . Marshall met them all . One has only to look at the law reports of Call and Washington to see the place that Ile won . He is found in most of the important cases . In his time no man 's name occurs oftener , p ' obably none so often . At first , he had brought from the army , and from his home on the frontier , simple and rustic ways which surprised some persons at Richmond , whose conception of greatness was associated with very different models of dress and behavior . " He was one morning strolling , " we are told , " through the streets of Richmond , attired in a plain linen roundabout and shorts , with his hat under his arm , from which he was eating cherries , when he stopped in the porch of the Eagle Hotel , indulged in a little pleasantry with the landlord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman from the country was present , who had a case coming on before the Court of Appeals , and was referred by the landlord to Marshall as the best lawyer to employ . But " the careless , languid air " of Marshall had so prejudiced the man that he refused to employ him . The clerk , when this client entered the court room , also recommended Marshall , but the other would have none of him . A venerable-looking lawyer , with powdered wig and in black cloth , soon entered , and the gentleman engaged him . In the first case that came up , this man and Marshall spoke on opposite sides . The gentleman listened , saw his mistake , and secured Marshall at once ; frankly telling him the whole story , and adding that while lie had come with one hundred dollars to pay his lawyer , he had but five dollars left . Marshall good-naturedly took this , and helped in the case . In the Virginia Federal Convention of 1788 , at the age of thirty-three , he is described , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , slovenly dressed in loose summer apparel .. . . His manners , like those of Monroe , were in strange contrast with those of Edmund Randolph or of Grayson . " In such stories as these , one is reminded , as he is often reminded , of a resemblance between Marshall and Lincoln . Very different men they were , but both thorough Americans , with unbo ? rowed character and manners , and a lifelong flavor derived front no other soil . At the height of Marshall 's reputation , in 1797 , a French writer , who had visited Richmond lately , in speaking of Edmund Randolph , says , " He has a great practice , and stands , in that respect , nearly on a par with Mr. J. Marshall , the most esteemed and celebrated counselor of this town . " He mentions Marshall 's annual income as being four or five thousand dollars . " Even by his friends , " it is added , " he is taxed withsome little propensity to indolence , but he nevertheless displays great superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary , who praises his force and eloquence in speaking , yet says : " It is difficult to rouse his faculties . He begins with reluctance , hesitation , and vacancy of eye . . . . He reminds one of some great bird , which flounders on the earth for a while before it acquires impetus to sustain its soaring flight . " And finally , William Wirt , who was seventeen years Marshall 's junior , and came to the bar in 1792 , when Marshall was nearly at the head of it , writing anonymously in 1804 , describes bin ; as one " who , without the advantage of person , voice , attitude , gesture , or any of the ornaments of an orator , deserves to be considered as one of the most eloquent men in the world . " He attributes to him " one original and almost supernatural faculty , . .. of developing a subject by a single glance of his mind . . His eyes do not fly over a landscape and take in its various objects with inure promptitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex subject . . . . All his eloquence consists in the apparently deep self-conviction and the emphatic earnestness and energy of his style , the close and logical connection of his thoughts , and the easy gradations by which he opens his lights on the attentive minds of his hearers . " In 1795 he declined the office of Attorney General of the United States , and in 1796 that of Minister to France , both offered him by Washington . When President Adams persuaded him in 1797 to go , with Pinckney and Gerry , as envoy to France , he wrote to Gerry of " General Marshall " ( as he was then called , from his rank of brigadier general , since 1793 , in the Virginia militia ) , " He is a plain man , very sensible , cautious , guarded , and learned in the law of nations . " The extraordinary details of that unsuccess-ful six months ' attempt to come to terms with France are found in Marshall 's // very able dispatches and in the diary which he kept ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered that " a note is worth a cartload of recollections . " His own part in the business was marked by great moderation and ability , and on his return , in 1798 , he was received at Philadelphia with remarkable demonstrations and the utmost enthusiasm . A correspondent of Rufus King , writing from New York in July of that year , says , " No two men can be more beloved and honored than Pinckney and Marshall ; " and again in November : " Saving General Washington , I believe the President , Pinckney , and Marshall are the most popular characters now in our country . There is a certain something in the correspondence of Pinckney and Marshall . . . that has united all heads and hearts in their eulogy . " It is understood that the correspondence was by Marshall . Gerry had allowed himself in a measure to be detached by the Directory from his associates , to their great displeasure . With them , in important respects , he disagreed . It was in 1798 that Adams offered to Marshall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of James Wilson . He declined it ; and it went to his old associate at William and Mary College , Bushrod Washington . Marshall did yield , however , to General Washington 's urgent request to stand for Congress that year ; and apparently it was for a consultation on this question that he went to Mount Vernon , in the summer , in company with the coming judge . On their way they met with a misadventure which gave great amusement to Washington , and of which he enjoyed telling his friends . They came on horseback , and carried but one pair of saddlebags , each using one side . Arriving thoroughly drenched by rain , they were shown to a chamber to change their garments . One opened his side of the bags and drew forth a black bottle of whiskey . He insisted that he had opened his compan ion 's repository . Unlocking the other side , they found a big twist of tobacco , some corn bread , and the equipment of a pack saddle . They had exchanged saddlebags with some traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of borrowed clothes . The election of Marshall to Congress excited great interest . Washington heartily rejoiced in it . Jefferson , on the other hand , remarked that while Marshall might trouble the Republicans somewhat , yet he would now be unmasked . He had been popular with the mass of the people , Jefferson said , from his " lax , lounging manners , " and with wiser men through a " profound hypocrisy . " But now his British principles would stand revealed . The New England Federalists were very curious about him ; they had been alarmed and outraged , during the campaign , by his expressing opposition to the alien and sedition laws ; but they were much impressed by him . Theodore Sedgwick wrote to Rufus King that he had " great powers , and much dexterity in the application of them .. .. We can do nothing without him . " But Sedgwick wished that " his education had been on the other side of the Delaware . " George Cabot wrote to King : " General Marshall is a leader .. .. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . He thinks too much of that state , and lie expects that the world will be governed by rules of logic . " But Cabot hopes to see him improve , and adds , " He seems calculated to act a great part . " In the end , the Northern Federalists were disappointed in finding him too moderate . He held the place of leader of the House , and passed into the Cabinet in May , 1800 ; and on January 31 , 1801 , he was commissioned as Chief Justice . Very soon after entering upon his duties as Chief Justice he undertook to write the Life of Washington . This gave him a great deal of trouble and mortification . It proved to be , an im- 336 John Marshall . moose labor ; the publishers were importunate , and he was driven into print before he was ready . The result was a work in five volumes , appearing from 1802 to 1804 , full of the most valuable and authentic material , well repaying perusal , yet put together with singular lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment . In the later years of his life , he revised it , corrected some errors , shortened it , and published it in three volumes one of them as a separate preliminary history of the colonial period , and the other two as the Life of Washington . This work , in its original form , gave great offense to Jefferson , written , as it was , from the point of view of a constant admirer and supporter of the policy of Washington ; a " five volume libel , " Jefferson called it . Jefferson had a ludicrous misconception as to Marshall 's real character . Referring in 1810 to the " batture " case , in which Edward Livingston sued him , and which was to come before Marshall , he says that he is certain what the result of the case should be , but nobody can tell what it will be ; for " the Judge 's mind is of that gloomy malignity which will never let him forego the opportunity of satiating it upon a victim . . . . And to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to himself and his associate justices in Marbory v. Madison . Not exactly , however . I observe old Cushing is dead . Judge Cushing had died a fortnight before . At length , then , we have a chance of getting a Republican majority in the Supreme Judiciary . " And he goes on to express his confidence in the " appointment of a decided Republican , with nothing equivocal about hint . " Who was to be this decided and unequivocal Republican ? Jefferson was anxious about it , and wrote to Madison , suggesting Judge Tyler , of Virginia , and reminding the President of Marshall 's " rancorous hostility to his country . " Who was it , in fact , that was appointed ? Who but Joseph Story ! ? a Republican , indeed , but one whom Jefferson , in this very year , was designating as a " pseudo-Republican , " and who soon became Marshall 's warmest admirer and most faithful supporter . In those efforts on the part of some of the leaders of Virginia and the South , early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we at the North have never done sufficient justice , Marshall took an active part . The American Colonization Society was organized in 1810 or 1817 , with Bushrod Washington for president . In 1823 an auxiliary society was organized at Richmond , of which Marshall was president , an office which he held nearly or quite up to the time of his death . It is interesting to observe that one of the plans ' for colonization was to have worked out the abolition of slavery in Virginia in the year 1901 . Of slavery Marshall wrote to a friend , in 1826 : " I concur with you in thinking that nothing portends more calamity and mischief to the Southern states than their slave population . Yet they seem to cherish the evil , and to time with immovable prejudice and dislike everything which may tend to diminish it . I do not wonder that they should resist , any attempt , should one be made , to interfere with the rights of property , but they have a feverish jealousy of measures which may do good without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unwise . " As to Marshall 's religions affiliations , he was a regular and devoted attendant , all his life , of the Episcopal church , in which he was brought up ; taking an ac-tive part in the services-and the responses . and kneeling in prayer , we are told , even when the pews were so narrow that his tall form had to be accommodated by the projection of his feet into the aisle . His friend , Bishop Meade , the Episco-pal bishop of Virginia , states that he was never a communicant in that church ; and he quotes a letter from an Episcopal deleted material of the members had smooth , highly polished brass quoits . But Marshall 's were large , rough , heavy , and of iron , such as few of the members could throw well from hub to hub . Marshall himself threw them with great success and accuracy , and often " rang the meg . " On this occasion Marshall and the Rev. Mr. Blair led the two parties of players . Marshall played first , and rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quoit came down plumply on top of Marshall 's . There was uproarious applause , which drew out all the others Irons the dinner ; and then came an animated controversy as to what should be the effect of this exploit . They all returned to the table , had another bottle of champagne , and listened to arguments : one from Marshall for his view , and one from Wickham for Parson Blair . The company decided against Marshall . His argument is a humorous companion piece to any one of his elaborate judicial opinions . He began by formulating the question , " Who is winner when the adversary quoits are on the meg at the same time ? " He then stated the facts , and remarked that the question was one of the true construction and application of the rules of the game . The one first ringing the meg has the advantage . No other one can succeed who does not begin by displacing this first one . The parson , he willingly allowed , deserves to rise higher and higher in everybody 's esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an-other 's back in this fashion . That is more like leapfrog than quoits . Then , again , the legal maxim is , Cujus est sebum , ejus est usque ad aelum . His own right as first occupant extends to the vault of heaven ; no opponent can gain any advantage by squatting on his back . He must either bring ; a writ of ejectment , or drive him out vi et armis . And then , after further argument of the same sort , he asked judgment , and sat down amidst great applause . Mr. Wickham then rose , and made an argument of a similar pattern . No rule , Ise said , requires an impossibility . Me . Marshall 's quoit is twice as large as any other ; and yet it flies from his arm like the iron ball at the Grecian games from the arm of Ajax . It is an iron quoit , us. polished , jagged , and of enormous weight . It is impossible for an ordinary quoit to move it . With much more of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After very animated voting , designed to keep up the uncertainty as long as possible , it was so decided . An . other trial was had , and Marshall clearly won . All his life he played this game . There is an account of a country barbecue in the mountain region , where a casual guest saw an old nuns emerge from a thicket which bordered a brook , carrying a pile of flat stones as high as he could hold between his right arm and Isis chin . He stepped briskly up to the company and threw them down . " There ! Here are quite enough for us all . " Of Marshall 's simple habits , remarkable modesty , and engaging simplicity of conduct and demeanor , every one who knew him speaks . " What was it in him which most impressed you ? " asked one of Isis descendants , now a distinguished judge , of an older relative who had known him . " His humility , " was her answer . " With Marshall , " wrote President Quincy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of Congress , from 1805 to 1813 , played chess with him , and never failed to be impressed with the frank , cordial , childlike simplicity and unpretending manner of the man , of whose strength and breadth of intellectual power I was .. . well apprised . " " Nothing was more usual , " we are told , as regards his life in Richmond , " than to see him returning from market , at sunrise , with poultry in one hand and a basket of vegetables its the other . " deleted material 340 John Marshal . ing , " a good picture . ' I had great pleasure in painting the whole of such a man . . . When I was ready to draw the figure into his picture , I asked him , in order to save time , to come to my room in the evening .. . An evening was appointed ; but he could not come until after the consultation , ' which lasts until about eight o'clock . " It will be remembered that the judges , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a warm evening , " continues Harding , " and I was standing on my steps waiting for him , when he soon made his appearance , but , to my surprise , without a hat . I showed him into my studio , and stepped back to fasten the front door , when I encountered several gentlemen who knew the judge very well . They haul seen him passing by their hotel in his hatless condition , and with long strides , as if in great haste , and had followed , curious to know the cause of such a strange appearance . . . He said that the consultation lasted longer than he expected , and he hurried off as quickly as possible to keep his appointment with me . " He declined the offer of a hat on his return . " Oh no , it is a warm night ; I shall not need one . " The next year , 1831 , was a sad one for Marshall . The greatest apprehensions were felt for his health . " Wirt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , 1831 , " spoke to me , also , in deep concern and alarm at the state of Chief Justice Marshall 's health . " In the autumn he went to Philadelphia to undergo the torture of the operation of lithotomy , before the days of ether . It was the last operation performed by the distinguished surgeon Dr. Physick . Another eminent surgeon , who assisted him , Dr. Randall , has given an account of this occasion , in which lie says : " It will be readily admitted that , in consequence of Judge Marshall 's very advanced age , the hazard attending the operation , however skillfully performed , was considerably increases ! . I consider it but an act of justice , due to the memory of that great and good man , to stale that , in my opinion , his recovery was in a great degree owing to his extraordinary self-possession , and to the calm and philosophical views which he took of his case , and the various circumstances attending it . " It fell to my lot to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited him on the morning of the day fixed on for the operation , two hours previously to that at which it was to be performed . Upon entering his room I found him engaged in eating his breakfast . He received me with a pleasant smile upon his countenance , and said ' ' , yell , doctor , you find me taking breakfast , and I assure you I have had a good one . I thought it very probable that this might be my last chance , and therefore I was determined to enjoy it and eat heartily . ' I expressed the great pleasure which I felt at seeing Into so cheerful , and said that I hoped all would soon be happily over . He replied to this that he did not feel the least anxiety or uneasiness respecting the operation or its results . He said that he had not the slightest desire to live , laboring under the sufferings to which he was then subjected ; that he was perfectly ready to take all the chances of an operation , and he knew there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relieved by it lie was willing to live out his appointed time , but if not , would rather die . than hold existence accompanied with the pain and misery which he then endured . " After he finished his breakfast I administered to him some medicine ; he then inquired at what hour the operation wouldbe performed . I mentioned the hour of eleven . He said , Very well ; do you wish me now for any other purpose , or may I lie down and go to sleep ? ' I was a good deal surprised at this question , but told him that if he could sleep it would be very desirable . Ile immediately placed himself upon the bed , and fell into a profound sleep , and continued so until I was obliged to rouse him in order to undergo the operation . Be exhibited the same fortitude , scarcely uttering a murmur , throughout the whole procedure , which , from the peculiar nature of his complaint , was necessarily tedious . " From the patient over a thousand calculi were taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever return . On Christmas Day of that year , as I have said , his wife died , the object of his tenderest affection ever since he had first seen her , more than fifty years before . It was at this period , in 1831 and 1832 , that Inman 's fine portrait of him , now hanging in the Law Institute of Philadelphia , was painted , for the bar of that city . A replica is on the walls of the state library in Richmond , which Marshall himself bought for one of his sons . This portrait is regarded as the best of those painted in his later life . Certainly it best answers the description of him by an English traveler , who , seeing loins in the spring of 1835 , remarked that " the venerable dignity of his appearance would not suffer in comparison with that of the most respected and distinguished-looking peer in the British House of Lords . " After his recovery , in 1831 , : Marshall seems to have been in good health down to the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " severe contusions " 1 in the stagecoach in returning from Washington . His health now rapidly declined . He went again for relief to Philadelphia , and died there on July 6 , 1835 , of a serious disorder of the liver . He had missed from his bedside his oldest son , Thomas , for whom he had been asking . Upon the gravestone of that son , behind the old house at Oak-hill , you may read the pathetic tragedy , withheld from lois father , that accounts for his absence . While hastening to Philadelphia , at the end of June , he was passing through the streets of Baltimore in the midst of a tempest , and WAS killed by the falling of or chimney in the storm . ' Phe body of the great Chief Justice was carried home with every demonstration of respect and reverence . It was buried by the side of his wife , in the Shocker Hill Cemetery in Richmond . There , upon horizontal tablets , are two inscriptions of affecting simplicity , both written by himself . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mary Marshall , was born the 24th of September , 1755 , Intermarried with Mary Willis Ambler , the 3d of January , 1783 . Departed this life the 6th day of July , 1835 . " The second , thus : " Sacred to the memory of Mrs. Mary Willis Marshall , Consort of John Marshall , Born the 13th of March , 1766 , Departed this life the 25th of December , 1831 . This stone is devoted to her memory by him who best knew her worth , And most deplores he ' loss . "
