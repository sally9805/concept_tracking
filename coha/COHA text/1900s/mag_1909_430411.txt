MANY years ago , on a hot day of September , I came out from the gateway of the Trappist monastery of Staoueli , in Algeria , and wandered along the blinding white road that led toward the prison for military convicts . The sunscorched uplands stretched to the horizon . In the pellucid clearness of the African atmosphere I could see ' very far , and vaguely desiring , perhaps , an object for my walk , I gazed about me . Where should I go now that I was beyond the monastery walls ? Far off , standing absolutely alone , I perceived a low , earthen tower . I left the road and directed my steps toward it . As I drew near to it , I saw almost in its shadow a donkey circling monotonously round , turning a water-wheel , and crouched on the hot earth , with his back against the little tower , a boy of perhaps sixteen , gazing dreamily over the plain with wide , blue eyes . He was a Breton , he told me . A Breton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , so far from his own gray country ? Very simply he told me why . Always , he said , from his earliest youth he had longed to go to the Holy Land , to stand on the sacred spot where Christ had died upon the Cross . He told nothing to any one of his desire , which at last became so keen that secretly he left his home , his native village , and made his way to the nearest seaport . There he saw a ship bound for Algiers . He was so ignorant of geography that he supposed Algiers was a city in Palestine . So he went on board the ship , and presently found himself under the palms of Africa . In Algiers he nearly starved , perhaps would have starved , had he not heard by chance of Staoueli , and of the good Trappists who fed the hungry outside the " gate of heaven . " One day he walked out of the city , and at last , nearly dead with fatigue and hunger , came to the monastery 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The monks took him in , fed him , clothed him , gave him work . And thus it came about that I found him sitting in the shadow of the tower on that burning day of summer . " And what are you going to do ? " I asked him . " Are you going hack to Brittany ? " " No , Monsieur , " he replied . " Some day , when I have saved some money , I shall go on . " " Where to ? " " I shall go to the Holy Land . " He waved his hand toward the far-off horizon ; he gazed out over the plain . " I shall see the Holy Land , " he murmured almost as if to himself . I thought of that boy and his dream as I stood on the upland of Reyak , in Syria one day of the springtime ; for I at last was fulfilling a dream of my own : I was on my way to the Holy Land . And the poor little Breton ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or had he wandered away ? Perhaps we should meet again in the Court of the Holy Sepulcher , or among the kneeling pilgrims of Russia , who come to kiss the stone of unction on which , according to tradition , the body of Christ was laid when Nicodemus anointed it . A warm breeze , which yet hinted that the snows were not far off , blew over the long valley . It caressed the rich , red earth . It stirred the bright , green crops It ruffled the gray-blue feathers of the pigeons perched on the flat , earth-covered roofs of the low , white houses , above the brown-shuttered windows of which the grass was growing . Through the branches of the mulberry-trees , planted in careful rows , it went ; through the silver and green poplars ; over the plain toward the round mountains , gray and brown , with great wine-colored patches , which brought to the mind the colored rags of the Bedouin . A dark boy , whose head was coyered by a white keffieh bound by two cords of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in dusty , rosecolored robes , went by in the sunshine leading aflock of brown and white sheep A Greek priest , with flowing hair and beard , wearing a tall , black hat , strode past me as if in haste , followed by a huge dog with a curly , yellow coat . Out of the distance , mingling with the songs of the birds , there came a tinkle of bells , the pretty caravan music that one learns to love in the far-off countries . Three camels stepped into sight , accompanied by a tall . barefooted man , thin , with fierce eyes , a strenuous gait , a grave and cruel bearing . They passed , flinging out to the air the light melodies of travel . The man shot out at the Christian dog a glance that could come only from the eyes of a worshiper of the Prophet . He and his beasts went on with a soft determination that suggested fatality . Slowly the chime of the bells died on the fragrant air . Tomorrow , perhaps , Damascus would hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden among its woods and dancing waters under the tawny hills not far away . Soon I must follow the bells , but not yet ; for in the fold of this valley , between the two snow-dappled ranges of mountains , the Lebanon and the Anti-Libanus , lay the antique home of Baal worship . And as the hells lost themselves in the airy distance , I put away from me the thought of Damascus , and turned my face toward the Temple of the Sun . A MAGIC OF STRANGENESS So:N7E places in foreign lands seem to the traveler far more foreign than others , full of a sort of magic of strangeness . That day , when I came to Baalbec , the hills seemed strange about it , for the snowfields , broken up by long tracts of chocolate-colored earth , gave to them an appearance almost as bizarre as the appearance of a zebra 's back . Under the rays of the burning sun the frail torrents of white , that seemed sweeping through the orchards to break at the feet of the temples , looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white dust flew up from the horses ' feet . A hard hill , yellow as the skin of a lion ; stared down on the native village . Here and there huge cypresses reared their mournful heads , looking gloomily fantastic , like dignified but eccentric beings in exile , longing for Italian gardens , and aloof from the riot of spring that surged round the Temple of Bacchus . Birds sang everywhere . Among the thin trees hidden children were laughing . A metallic voice cried out some words that I could not understand , and suddenly died away . Three dark , mysterious women went by , shaded by white parasols . And the birds and the children 's voices , and the shadows  | cast by the parasols on the dark faces of women , and the eddies of dust floating toward the orchards , white floating to white , ? and the silhouettes of the cypresses , and the gold and the yellow of ruin and hill , all seemed to me strange , almost magically foreign , that day . There were no travelers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonder of white and gold was not for me alone ; for the people of Baalbec , like Baalbec itself , are strange . Instead of ignoring their glorious ruins with the contempt or the indifference bred of familiarity , they seem actually to love them . They visit them , they spend the shining hours among them , they laugh , they dream , they pipe , they sing their little , twittering songs where Baal once was worshiped in the ancient days of Solomon ; where the Greeks worshiped Helios , god of the sun ; where the Romans worshiped Iupiter ; where Venus had her votaries , and Bacchus his devotees ; where pagans built , and Christians destroy ed ; where Constantine the Great crushed down the ardors of those who adored the gods ; where Timur fought and conquered ; where Arabs came and built a fortress and stayed . The town of Baalbec contains some five thousand inhabitants , about a quarter of whom are Christians . It has a garrison ;  | it is the seat of a bishop of the Greek Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six schools , four monasteries , three hotels , and a Turkish bath : but all these glories lie far enough apart from the ruins to leave their almost matchless dignity and beauty unimpaired . One thinks of them only for a moment , realizes them not unpleasantly , when one sees two soldiers strolling hand in hand down the staircase of the Temple of Jupiter , or comes upon a group of serious Arabs among the pillars of the Temple of Bacchus , or surprises a group of women in shining black beneath the Arab tower to the southwest of the temple , or upon the projecting platform which is thrust out toward the orchards not far from the Cotumns of the Sun finds a bevy of brown and bright-eyed Syrian children smiling down at the fairy revels of the white binssoms in the breeze . Never had I understood how exquisite white can look with gold , fragility with strength , that which has the peculiar loveliness that passes with that which has the peculiar splendor that endures , till I saw the piled golden stones , columns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white flowers of Baalbec 's orchards . Baalbec must be seen , if possible , in spring , and seen at least once not only in the full glory of day , but also when the sun is declining . Then the Columns of the Sun are alive , so it seems , with changing and almost mysterious glories ; walls , architraves , door-posts , capitals , and tangled heaps of broken fragments , hold a romantic beauty of color such as I have not seen elsewhere in unpainted stone . THE STUPENDOUS RUINS AMONG the ruins of Baalbec are remains that can only be called stupendous . So stupendous indeed are they that in former days , as possibly now , many of the peo ple of Syria believed Echmoudi , a demon , had reared them by his magic arts . To this clay there are learned Orientals who declare that Baalbec must have existed before the flood , as only mastodons could have transported from the neighboring quarries the huge blocks of stone which are found there . The walls that are still standing are gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun , ? once there were fifty-four of them , ? are so nobly tall that they look as if they would fain soar to the deity whose glory they celebrate . Nevertheless , the ruins of Baalbec do not almost stupefy the mind as some ruins in Egypt do by their towering vastness . Although composed of the wreckage of many courts and buildings , they are harmonious . The long and slow passage of time seems , in some subtle way not to be defined , to have resolved all the discords once harshly produced by barbarous man and by barbarous nature . These ruins are very calm . They are bringers of peace to the spirit . They do not amaze too much , not do they sadden . Indeed , they rather reassure , as the sun does , hinting at stabilities eternal , rectifying ? how , we do not exactly know ? our pitiful human imaginings , which travel too often toward darkness . It has been stated , and is often accepted as true , that the ruins of the temples of the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian era , but , according to the Syrian writer Michel Alouf , who is a native of Baalbec , and who , with loving assiduity , has devoted an immense amount of his time to the patient study of all documents bearing upon the history of his birthplace , this is not the fact . Inscriptions have been discovered by the German excavators , who have done much good work at Baalbec , which prove that the building of the temples was begun by the Romans in the first century after Christ . John Malala of Antioch was therefore mistaken in attributing all the credit for their erection to Antoninus Pius . The great temple , though identified with the sun-god , was dedicated to all the gods of Heliopolis , the smaller Temple to Bacchus . Before they became ruins , Arabs had turned them into a fortress . " THE WONDERFUL SYRIAN SPRING " BUT the fact which I always loved to keep in my mind at Baalbec in the wonderful Syrian spring was this : that before Greek and Roman times Baalbec was the sacred city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , and that Greeks and Romans , when they had the mastery over the Syrian land , did nothing to interfere with this old , established worship . On the  | contrary , they adored Jupiter the Sun in the Roman empire , and statues of BaalbecJupiter have been found at Niha and elsewhere . Minutely to describe Baalbec would be merely to repeat in other words information that can be obtained in many guidebooks . The effect of it in springtime is extraordinarily beautiful . In the narrow upland valley , some four thousand feet above the level of the sea , between the ranges of mountains , embraced by multitudes of slim and whiteflowering trees , ? the very soul of spring made manifest , ? rise the huge , uneven walls of Baalbec , broken in many places , but majestically solid , as if built to confront and defy not only the mightiest assaults of men , but the insidious action of time ? or even of eternity . They cover a great area , and conceal the courts within ; but they allow one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaning column , and they are victoriously challenged by the six marvelous columns of the Temple of the Sun , the glory of Baalbec , ? the glory , surely , of Syria , which soar above them and hold the eyes and the imagination . Wherever you stand , whether to the southeast , on the dusty road that leads to the village , or among the snows of the pear-trees , or high upon the slope of the yellow hill that calmly watches over Baalbec , your eyes are drawn to these columns . Look down on them from above , gaze up at them from below , it makes but little difference . They dominate you , as if they possessed a powerful soul , as if they possessed the soul of the great nation that once worshiped the sun . At Baalhec , as well as the remains of the two grand temples , and the additions made by the Arabs for purposes unconnected with worship , there is a small , circular Temple of Venus , which stands apart from the other ruins ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateral chambers . In these courts , and everywhere about the remains of the temples , lie masses of fallen masonry ; capitals carved with acanthus leaves and with the heads of lions ; fragments of doorways ; sections of rounded pillars and of friezes ; bits of architraves ; and gigantic blocks  | which look like the foundation-stones of buildings too huge to have been constructed by men . There have been many earthquakes at Baalbec , and these mountainous heaps of stone , flung pell-mell in confusion , suggest some great upheaval of nature rather than any- human violence . Nevertheless , the tremendous confusion everywhere apparent does not call forth any answering turmoil of the spirit . As one wanders through the ruins , noting the irregular outlines of the Propyla'a , shattered giants superb in their decadence ; wondering why the stones of the south tower , which look like a mysteriously solidified and arrested cascade , do not fall upon the turmoil of masonry heaped below like rocks on a seashore ; as one gazes at the very delicate shadows in the arena of the Hexagonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost white stone near the place where once stood a statue of Hercules , at the herbage growing more lustily in the niches that are gray where the sun does not penetrate , a lovely yellow beneath his beams ; as one stands before the deserted chamber of the Roman priests , and listens to the perpetual humming of the happy bees about it , or before the altar in the great court from which an avenue of ruins leads the eyes to the crenelated outer walls , high above , and far beyond which the glittering snows look down ; as one tries to decipher the features of the great god Baal , guarded now by a Roman eagle , or looks up into the face of Diana , beneath whose pedestal four faithful hounds keep watch ; as one falls - half in love with the girl carved on the bath of the Roman priests , who sits with her head thrown hack and a cupidon near her , while close by a woman takes her companion gently by the neck , with a deliciously tender gesture , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly toward them , or is swept to a sterner mood by the sudden vision of helmeted Mars flanked by the heads of bulls ? as one looks , and pauses , and wanders on , a great feeling of calm enfolds him , but of a calm made light and brilliant by the lightness and brilliance of spring . And the beautiful day wears on , and its gradual passing is marked by the stones of Baalbec . They were brought together to do homage to the sun , and the sun has them in possession . Upon the six Columns of Jupiter the Sun one may read the record of dawn , of noon , of the mystic approach of night . The so-called " small Temple of Bacchus " is the best preserved of the ruins of Baalbec , and is perhaps the most perfect ancient building in Syria . Surrounded by fallen splendors , it seems , compared with them , with its grand columns , its splendidly ornamented doorway , carved with flowers , fruits , vine-leaves , cupids hearing hunches of grapes and ears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double frieze , its naos , with graceful , fluted pilasters , its delicately graven , ( lancing bacchantes , cupids , and fauns , eagles , animals , and gods , an almost complete sanctuary , although it is of course but the ornate specter of what it was before earthquakes shook , and Arabs overbuilt , and Turks barbarously- defaced , it . In color it is lovely a rich , warm , lustrous gold , in places deepening to a golden brown . And against this gold and golden brown , as if to emphasize them and to continue here the color scheme of Baalbec in springtime , there is set a white staircase of narrow steps which leads up to the temple 's sanctuary . Upon two pilasters here are engraved figures of women dancing the danse du centre . In the north wall there is a tablet inserted to commemorate the visit of the German Emperor , who encamped within the ruins in the great court when he came to Syria as the guest of Abdul-Hamid . The general effect of this temple , seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and majesty , rather than of sensitiveness and grace . From the northwest it looks specially fine , with the nine upstanding columns . Seen frmn the front , it shows more fearlessly its ruin . One of the most glorious bits is the east portico , with the four close-set columns , two smooth , two fluted . The interior , which is open to the sky , although the outer wall of the temple is connected with the entablature above the columns by a handsome ceiling of carved stone , contains a mass of delicious detail . And here grace and almost tender refinement are happily allied with massive power . iIuclr of the carving of leaf and flower and fruit , of vase and fir-cone and bird , is quite lovely and amazingly intricate and delicate ; and the breaking up of  | the walls into double rows of niches , di vided by fluted pillars , with elaborately carved capitals , produces a singularly rich yet almost austerely pure , effect . This temple stands on a high platform of huge blocks of rugged stone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ! has leaned perilously , so it seems , against the smooth outer wall of the temple , resting on the edge of its base and I looked down at the world beneath Immediately below me was a little orchard of tiny and frail trees , some just springing into leaf , others just breaking into blossoms of virginal white . There was something almost pathetic in this minute vision of half-frightened , half-daring spring , timorously creeping to the foot of the giant mass of stone , as if to shroud its savage strength in a robe of green and white , to baptize it with youthful perfume . Beyond the trees were the mauve , yellowish white , and gray-mauve houses of the town of the sun , with pale-red roofs and arched central windows , backed by low green and brown hills , tranquil and tender in the softening light of the waning afternoon . Some birds that looked like swallows wheeled perpetually in the light-blue sky , and upon the topmost golden stones of a partly ruined wall , raised up by Arabs , wild pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of the winged geniuses , the winged loves , the harmless eagles , not far below them . " THE SIX MIGHTY COLUM NS OF THE SUN " BuT more wonderful than this temple ; than the little Temple of Venus ; than the Arab fortifications of the time of Bahram Schah ; than the trilithon , with its three terrific blocks of stone , each one of them over sixty-three feet in length ; than the Hexagon and Great Courts , sometimes called the Forecourt and the Court of the Altar ? more wonderful indeed than anything else in Baalbec , are the six mighty Columns of the Sun . These columns now represent that vast Temple of the Sun and of the ancient gods of Heliopolis which was once the glory of Syria . The building that belonged to them ? remembering them clearly , I can not say to which they belonged ? is now merely a mass of ruins . According to some writers , these columns are over seventy feet high ; according to others , not quite seventy . The effect of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall which supports them , is that they are towering into heaven . Each of them is of one size from base to capital . The wall on which they are set is considerably higher than the height of a tall man . Three immense fragments of stone go to the making of each column . The capitals are Corinthian , surmounted by a glorious architrave , with entablature , frieze , and cornice . Upon this there is elaborate and very fine carving , showing acanthus leaves and roses , with little lions , and also some heads of lions with open jaws . But it is not detail that you notice , or detail that you love , when first you stand before these columns . They overwhelm you by the sum total of their splendor , which is so extraordinary that it has the blotting-out power peculiar to the tremendous manifestations of man 's creative genius . As you look up at them , you forget everything else in Baalbec . All things around you seem suddenly to fade , to grow thin and pale and unreal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the complete temple stood firm in the ancient days , it was surrounded by fifty-four such columns . The imagination is impotent to conceive what was the effect of a building so hemmed in , worthy to be so guarded . And yet it seems to me not improbable that the present loneliness of these columns enhances the vast impression which they make upon the mind . They are giants in a world that owns no other giants , standing up , as they do , against the wonder of the spring , with no interposing walls to shut away from them the far-off mountains , nature 's giants , as they are man 's . Some ruins completely satisfy as ruins . Others make one sigh for a lost perfection . The Columns of the Sun at Baalbec call up only the secret murmur , " It is enough . " If we compare them with the columns outside the Temple of Bacchus , which have as background the temple wall , we are able to realize , I think , that certain advantages flow sometimes even from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar in shape to those of the sun . They are only some six feet shorter . And yet , grand though they are , how ' almost  | paltry they seem when compared with their desolate neighbors ! For they fall into place as an important part , but only a part , of the noble detail of a building . One can admire them , wonder at them , but one can forget them . Never could one forget the Columns of the Sun . Once seen , they stand out forever in the memory . I have called them golden columns , and I have spoken of the golden stones of Baalbec . Go to Baalbec , and you will recognize the justice of the description . You will see there stone that is white , gray with a grain of black , earth-colored , yellow , yellow-brown . But when the sun is shining , and at certain hours of the day , much of the stone is of a strangely rich and glorious golden color , sometimes with hints of red in it , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives say that it is the prolonged action of the weather ? of wind and rain , of snow and sun ? that has tinted the masonry . And they showed me stone recently released from the embrace of the earth by German excavators . This was pale , indeed , almost white . A quantity of it can be seen in the staircase at the end of the Temple of Bacchus . Compare it with the stone of which the Columns of the Sun are composed , and you will see how blessed it is to be weatherbeaten in Syria . It is as if the sun had resolved to set his seal upon the remains of the building erected in his honor , and not only to set his seal , but also to record each day the fleeting hours of gold . For almost as Eastern carpets change when held in different lights , or when suddenly stretched , and then allowed to fall into deep or shallow folds , these columns change mysteriously in obedience to the variations in the light which falls upon them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are not transparent , but they have something of amber 's loveliness when exposed to a soft yet brilliant radiance ; and they seem to divest themselves of the uncompromising character of stone under the influence of the sun . SUNSET AT BAALBEC WHEN the glory of full day begins to fade along the upland valley , and strange col- ors appear in the sky , do not leave the Columns of the Sun . Go to the right , facing them , mount up a little , sit on one of the fallen slabs of masonry not far from the staircase of Jupiter and the altar of the burnt offerings , and await the slow coming of twilight . Through the spaces between the columns you can see part of the ruined fortress of Sheik Abdullah , eight hundred years old ; to the left is the Temple of Bacchus ; behind are a wall , some low , white houses , some yellow hills , and the snow . A great owl , which seems to make his dwelling-place somewhere in the splendid cornice above the columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining . Slowly and heavily he starts on a journey over the orchards where the Syrian children are laughing and playing . The fires of the sunset increase . The columns glow . The yellow of the stone holds red lights . The gray of the stone reveals bright veins of gold . At this hour the majesty of Baalbec is at its height . Always the cradle of sunworship from the earliest times of antiquity , it is full to this day of the spell of the sun . And do not his worshipers still come there sometimes from far over the seas ? As the evening draws on , the inhabitants of Baalbec go quietly home from the ruins . The twitter of the Syrian pipe is silent , and the worshiper from afar may enjoy a complete solitude . In the gentler , the more tranquil light that pervades the upland valley , the remains of temples and towers , of altars , stairways , portals , and fortifications look more mysterious and more vast . The terrific walls seem to increase in height and in solidity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstructure of stone , like a misplaced section of some battlemented castle such as the castle on the height near Cxsarea Philippi , which frowns above the columns on the left of the portal to the Temple of Bacchus , is no longer merely barbaric . There is something sinister in its dark outline relieved sharply against the sky . The noble doorway in the northeast corner of the Great Court shows an interior blackness that is almost like the blackness of a dungeon , in which the halfseen shapes of fallen fragments of stone seem crouching like things in fear . Above it the tufts of herbage that grow on each LXXIX-22 side of the niche , with its projecting and arched cornice , make soft clouds of delicate gloom . In the hexagonal Forecourt and the Court of the Altar there is still a brightness of day , but the low and wide archways in the surrounding wall of the former contain patches of blackness that seem to have been cut from the garments of night . And from the latter stretches away a wonder of broken beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light and shadow play almost mystically over the vast expanse of the ruined Acropolis . The shadow has taken possession of the Columns of the Sun , is turning their gold to black , but the flat pavement near the remnants of the Basilica of Theodosius gleams with a primrose yellow , and the drab walls have become a somber brown . Looking east , between the Propylxa , the tiny branches of some fruit-trees make a network of jet black against the clear saffron of the sky . Near them a doorway , that in the distance looks like the minute opening in a fairy 's house , holds an oblong of light that suggests the light of heaven . Before the darkness of the swiftly approaching night comes down upon the town of the sun , and the moon and the silence hold it through the hours of sleep , pass once more across the Court of the Altar , between the blocks of masonry , the piles of stone bullets once used by the Arabs as missiles , the broken columns of Assuan granite , and the baths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high platform , or terrace , that commands a great view of the valley . Far down below the white orchards lie . The snows of the Lebanon mountains for a moment are touched with rose . Some stones of the ruins still glow with gold , and some of the nearer hills are a tawny yellow . In the distance the orchards melt away into a dusky green of crops ? barley and young corn . Farther away the green in its turn melts into red browns and into varying shades of yellow that strongly suggest the desert . Very calm are the hills in this evening hour . The valley of Baal seems a protected place , a safe and concealed hermitage hidden away from the world , where the sun-god loves to come secretly to behold the place of his antique worship . But the gold fades from the stones of the temples . All the red lights are gone  | from the Columns of the Sun . Transformed , made almost tragic , they stand up against a sky in which the first star is shining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has died away . Down below , from the shadows , a woman 's voice cries in Arabic , " Come in ! It is time to sleep . " Some little , naughty child is hiding from the veiled mother among the pear-trees . A bell chimes from the village . And the caravan bells ? It is so quiet , so breathlessly still , in the valley of Baal , that I can surely hear them , too , far off in the lovely evening , chiming , chiming by the rushing Barada , between the silver poplars , as the camels go softly on toward the minarets of Damascus . They are calling , and I must follow , to the city of the narghile and the striped sofas , that ancient city which is " the head of Syria . "  |
