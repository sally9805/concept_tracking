There is no assertion , It is noticed , in the bill that Mrs. Eddy is competent to manage her property and its income and disposition .

" As to the suit itself , if , as asserted , It was begun for the sole purpose of protectingMrs . Eddy -s property interests , the ' next friends ' should feel relieved from any anxiety .

Chace , Joseph Armstrong , all of Massachusetts , and Edward ' T. a resident of Chicago , five of the defendants , have issued a statement saying that although their clients are not bound to appear and make answer in this case , nevertheless such serious , unfounded , and unwarranted charges have been made ... concerning them that they decided ' voluntarily to appear and submit to the jurisdiction of this court , and to meet and make answer to such charges , that there might be no unnecessary delay in obtaining a judicial determination and finding with reference to the accusation against them .
