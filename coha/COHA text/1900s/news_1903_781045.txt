txt Deprived of rest , the Pope spent the day which has just ended with a serious depression . It was not until 3 o'clock this morning that he dropped off into a sleep that seemed half coma . The doctors reported a feeble but rapid pulse , which was generally taken to indicate the wearing out of the pad tient 's forces . The favorable symptom recorded yesterday morning of the lowering of the pleurotic liquid was suffia sufficiently maintained to relieve the Pontiff of his painful struggles for breath , which lately have been so frequent . The doctors fear that the gradual sinking Is due to general conditions rather than to the necessity for another operation , which seemed so imminent on Thursday . A sleepless night was succeeded by a day during which the Pope seemed to lack any desire to vary the medical routine by receiving visits from Cardinals or others . Both morning and afternoon he remained isolated from all save the physicians and attendants . The nourishment which the Pontiff took at first somewhat encouraged his entourage , but the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not had any beneficial effect . What is now most hoped for is that the Pope may be enabled to obtain much needed rest . A little after t o'clock this morning he became agitated and nervous from his lack of sleep and called frequently for his attendants . Drs. laapponi , Mazzoni , and Rossona , upon being asked if it was true , as reported , that the Pope has cancer of the pleura and that mortification had set in , all made specific denials of the rumor . Dr. Rossoni answered the query with the following emphatic written state-ment : " Any such news is absolutely false . " PROF . EUGENIO ROSSONI . " Drs . Mazzoni and Lapponl say the alle-gation is so absurd that it does not merit a signed denial . However , Dr. Mazzoni authorizes this statement : " The nature of the Pope 's illness appears in the signed bulletins and in my statement to The Associated Press representative made July 15 . " Dr. Lapponi , when questioned regarding the matter . dictated the following : " The reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleuric liquid nothing specific is found  --  neither the elements of inflammation of the epithelium nor bacillus of any other kind which might reveal the presence of cancer . The cyst for which an operation was performed on the Pope in 1899 has nothing to do with the present illness . It was merely a dermoid cyst in the nature of a harmless tumor . Moreover , the age of the patient is too advanced for him to have cancer . If he had a cancer it would be possible to feel it by objective examination or to discover it by sounding . If the initial disease , instead of being simple pneumonia , had been cancer and had not been treated as such . no amelioration could have occurred , while it is a proved fact that the obtuse pulmonary area has gradually diminished and has now become merely a very small pneumonic nucleus , which probably is identical with the area with which the disease originated . " Among the latest of the many evidences of continued sympathy with the Pontiff in his illness was the arrival at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope by . Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria . Their peculiar medicinal properties , it is asserted . may relieve the secretionary disorders of the Pontiff , which the doctors ' bulletins have announced recently . Several Cardinals , and especially their friends . have utilized the prolonged illness of the f'ope to test the feeling which will prevail at the next conclave . The task is a difficult one , as it is asserted that the Cardinals never have had a chance to show their mettle under Leo XIII. , important questions being deputed to commissions composed of a few Cardinals , after having practically been settled by the Papal Secretary of State . The Philippine affairs . which were inquired into by five Cardinals , are frequently quoted as an instance of the foregoing complaint . Much diversity of opinion and much uncertainty regarding the candidates still exists . Howei " er , the most probable candidates remain more or less those whose names have been mentioned since the Pope first became ill . To Cardinal Got ta Prefect of Propaganda , the objection is made that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of recent events , be considered a challenge to France . Against the chances of Cardinal Rampolla , the Papal Secretary of State , it is urged that Austria will try to exercise her right of veto , as France would in the case of Cardinal Serafino Vannutelli , the Grand Penitentiary , who is considered to be the candidate of the Triple Alliance . Cardinal Svampa , Archbishop of Bologna , has peen dropped because , since his last stroke of paralysis , he speaks with some difficultyCardinal Ferrari , Archbishop of Milan , Is not favored for the apparently trivial reason that he uses a motor car , which Is not considered dignified in a Prince of the Church , Cardinal Agliardi , Bishop of Albano , is p garded as too democratic . Therefore tit less Cardinal Gotti , who has always 14n the most favored candidate , succtflas in overcoming the objection to him , Li/ is likely that some one now Unmentioned will be elected to succeed Leo XIII . The Cardinals themselves naturally maintain the greatest reserve , though they all more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a password , that the " next Pope must be one combining the piety of Pius with the intelligence of Leo XIII . " The Cabinet Ministers have held several meetings to discuss the attitude of the Government in the event of the death of the Pope , and it has been decided that If the Vatican does not notify the Italian Government of his death and does notify the other Governments Italy will not officially participate in any manifestations of mourning , but will limit herself to maintaining public order and insuring full liberty for the conclave , as prescribed by law . In arriving at such a decision the Ministers declared that they had been guided by the wish to protect the dignity of the State and by no lack of respect for the aged Pontiff , toward whom there have been most chivalrous manifestations of sympathy from the King , who postponed his journey to Paris on account of the Pope 's health , and from the whole people , who are participating in the universal feeling of /egret at the Pontiff 's illness , thus forgetting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
