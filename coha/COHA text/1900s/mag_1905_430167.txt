 | THE great State of Pennsylvania ? second in population , first in manufactures , strong in finances , a leader in education , pre-eminent in patriotic history ? is in dire need . It has the form of popular government , but lacks the substance . Its voters register the will of a boss ; its legislators act only as he gives them orders . All this is somewhat ancient history , perhaps ; yet as these words are written the situation presents especial interest and the opportunity for a real man is especially great . When Senator Quay died , his mantle fell on his colleague , Senator Boies Penrose . He now sits supreme as the boss of Pennsylvania , controlling absolutely the political fortunes of the State and bearing heavily upon her material condition . Cold and reserved , a poor " mixer , " he exercises his power upon State legislation through one who is his lieutenant or his , junior partner , I do not know which ? Israel W. Durham , familiarly the good fellow , " Iz " Durham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominal and feeabsorbing Insurance Commissioner , performing no official service whatever in return for his large annual income . He in turn has his political deputies , through whom orders pass to the subservient . So indirect are the methods of Senator Penrose that he has formally " retired " as Chairman of the State Republican Committee , operating now through W. R. Andrews , long an unswerving devotee of the " machine . " The present Governor of Pennsylvania is ex-Judge Samuel W. Pennypacker , elected because of his friendship for and public laudation of the late Senator Quay . He is an incomprehensible personage , uniting obvious vanity and and a total lack of humor ( in respect to public affairs only ? in private he is notably facetious ) with industry , apparent honesty , and a most erratic and contradictory conception of his duty . He has vetoed much vicious legislation , usually of a relatively minor type , and yet , after hearing a tremendous protest from all classes but the machine politicians , has made almost hopeless the possibility of good government in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripper " bills out of four disgracefully passed , which practically destroy the Bullitt Charter . In giving his reasons for his actions , in a grotesque statement , he is almost childishly contradictory and obvivious . Ass I have said , he is inexplicable ; yet his general actions and influence have provided a wholesome restraint to the two Legislatures to which he has been related . So much in the way of a preliminary explanation of the operation of " working " the legislation of a great State to the will of the machine . I can not draw conclusions , for there are all sorts of contradictions in the conditions . I can only tell the actual facts ? or just a few of them ? of the legislative session of 1904 ? 5 in Pennsylvania , which closed its " deliberations " April 13 . In time past , when the Pennsylvania political organization was not the absolutely efficient machine it now is , the meeting of the Legislature was a horror to the people of the capital city , not only because of the rough character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania ? A Man ! 371  | parts of the State , but because of the corrupt " lobby " that infested the city during the session . Legislation was advanced by means of personal contact of the lobbyists with the legislators , and there was thinly concealed bribery by money and by unpleasant forms of debauchery . Now all this is changed ; the lobby , as such , is no more . Legislation is arranged through the " boss " or his agent . and the corruption is of a different character , though no less vicious , efficient . or expensive . One day in February , after the Legislature had been in session some seven fruitless weeks , a messenger from Speaker Walton ( of the House of Representatives ) was heard to say , just before the hour of adjournment at noon , to a man known as " Clate " Erb , " Shall we have a session this afternoon ? " The answer came at once , " No ; let ' em go home ! " And they went home , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is Clate " Erb , you ask , that his word should adjourn Pennsylvania 's deliberative and lawmaking body ? Simply " Iz " Durham 's private secretary and man on the ground ; the representative of the representative of the boss . Not an officer of the Legislature or of the State ; simply one of Senator Penrose 's sub-foremen ! Mr. Erb ? no one at Pennsylvania 's capital would think of putting any " Mr. " to his name ? was " watching things " while his immediate boss , Durham , was at Palm Beach resting . During the four weeks that it was Mr. Durham 's pleasure to enjoy the more agreeable climate of Flori'da , the Pennsylvania Legislature did nothing but mark time " and wait . After organization in January the re-election of Senator Knox followed , with Penrose , Knox , and Durham all in Harrisburg for a day or two . Then all of them left , with orders to the 204 Republicans of the 229 representatives of the people to keep quiet and behave until Durham should come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no legislation that was of any moment to the machine should slip through . In order to avoid any danger of accidental deliberation or progress , many of the committees through which legislation must pass were not even organized . The Legislature , with nothing to do , met barely within the Constitutional requirements as to number of sessions . Occasionally , to keep up a form of business , an easy machine measure or some unimportant bill was allowed to go through . As there was " nothing doing , " many of the really decent but absolutely powerless members stayed at home , and thus the machine was in one instance actually caught napping . A quorum was not present in the House on the final passage of an infamous measure known as the " Puhl Bill , " and , to avoid the bother of waiting , the Speaker calmly had counted as present six or eight men not even in Harrisburg at the time . As the decent press of the State was clamoring against this bill , one of these men who had been recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned . To avoid any further trouble , the boss ordered in the absentees , had the bill reconsidered , and then passed it again with the legal number of votes 1 Simple , was n't it ? A member told me of another of these episodes . " When the Clerk read the ayes ' on the ? Bill , he named among them the man who sits beside me , who had not voted at all , and the man whose desk is on my left . He was home , sick . " On one occasion , while Mr. McLain , the House " whip , " was presiding in the absence of Speaker Walton , he ordered counted as present and voting a rural member not then in the room . Returning before the vote was announced , the member , being told that he had been read as voting " aye , " protested to the Speaker pro tem. , telling of his absence . He was roundly and publicly abused for not " speaking louder " when his name was called , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he actually voted " aye " ! The process of " counting in " was worked through the Clerk , who had his orders to pass or kill legislation . Toward the end of the session , with bills rushing , a curious thing happened . There was on passage in the House a bill forbidding the taking by pawnbrokers of more than six per cent , interest on loans ? a bill offered regularly at each session by  | the Philadelphia members , in order to extract money from those affected for its defeat . The pawnbrokers had failed to arrange the defeat with the machine , but had , apparently , fixed the Clerk who called the roll . He reported but 99 votes in its favor , which would defeat it . Instantly a dozen or more Philadelphians were on their feet protesting , and demanding a verification of the roll call . When thus compelled to " show down , " the Clerk had to add 19 votes to the " ayes , " passing the bill . It was also passed by the Senate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine had been " seen " ? " I have been here for a half-dozen sessions , " said an attache to me , " but I never saw such a decent lot of men take orders so quietly . " He continued , " Why , there are men here who are of much consequence in their own homes , but they are ordered about like dogs by Clate ' Erb ! " A legislator from a district but slightly " under the influence " said to me one day : " I see Erb order around gray-haired men , of personal dignity ; and one day a man whom I knew to have a high position in his home community came to him and asked him about the organization 's wish in regard to a pending bill . He was curtly told to vote ' aye , ' and did it . I wo n't take orders from ' Clate ' Erb or ' Iz ' Durham ; if Penrose wants me , he must send for me . " " Does he ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been down to the Boas mansion twice . If I did n't go , I would n't be able to get a single appropriation for my own county through . I had to vote for the Philadelphia rippers , but I gagged on the Puhl and Ehrhardt Bills . " " Did Senator Penrose give you any reason for voting for these bills ? " I asked , anxious to know what possible arguments would be presented . " Oh , no , " replied my - friend ; " he only said the organization needed them . " The " Boas mansion , " by the way , is the actual seat of the State Government in Harrisburg during legislative sessions . It is a private house , rented by Senators Penrose and Knox jointly , and used by the former as the place from which to issue orders when he is in Harrisburg . After Mr. Durham 's Florida vacation was over , the Legislature sprang at once into great activity . Instead of the least possible number of sessions that would satisfy the Constitutional requiredment , extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the Governor by the score . Mr. Durham 's method of control was simple . He took possession of the Speaker 's room in the House of Representatives , and " Clate " Erb and other lieutenants brought the legislators in to receive their o orders . Occasionally Mr. Durham has gone away without leaving definite orders , and Erb has made a mistake . This happened one day in March , when Erb ordered a bill defeated in the House that was unessential to the " organization " but important to one of the better-grade subleaders . When Mr. Durham was informed of the slip , he simply ordered the bill reconsidered , and then had it passed . There was no trouble about this and very little comment ? it was all a matter of course . Toward the end of the session the machine had some difficulties , as legislators saw pet measures being hopelessly buried , and in some cases only the appropriation lash could bring the whole Republican majority into line . In one case an intrepid Senator , who was with the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , probably as the price of his support of the Philadelphia " rippers . " Two bills pushed though the House of Representatives ? one above referred to as having been first illegally and then legally passed ? were aimed primarily at the Law and Order Society of Philiadelphia . They were known as the Puhl and Ehrhardt Bills . One provided for the publication of the names of members of and contributors to all organizations of the class of the society referred to , thereby , of course , interfering with that secrecy which is essential in the effort to restrain and prevent vice in the great cities . The other act provided that no warrant of arrest would be legal unless indorsed by the police authorities , which , giving warning to a corrupt police , would , effectively prevent the successful " raids " that have in Philadelphia interfered with the business relations of some of the  | machine men , and also laid bare the colonizing of illegal voters in disreputable resorts . So great was the clamor againstthese open attempts to give legal aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the effect of one of the bills in the smaller towns , that the machine had to smother them in the Senate committee . It is unthinkable that Governor Pennypacker would have approved this vicious legislation , though Senator Penrose told a " country " legislator , in urging upon him these bills , that the Governor had promised to sign them . " I thought he was lying , " the member told me . It is not difficult to have meritorious or reform legislation introduced in Pennsylvania . Indeed , the " organization " ( as the machine calls itself ) is glad to have the credit of presenting good bills . sometimes they have been even allowed to pass either the Senate or the House , being then hung up in a committee of the remaining branch , there to die . In this way the vital matter of personal registration , upon which Pennsylvania 's salvation from a corrupt ballot depends , and which has been directly authorized by the people through a Constitutional amendment , requiring only a legislative enactment to put it in force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local option bill was also buried in committee , despite the urgency of large delegations and the general approval of the press of the State . It is reliably stated that this shelving of a measure that would have endangered the liquor interests was arranged in connection with a gift of one hundred thousand dollars to the resourcess of the machine . On the contrary , the judges ' retirement measure , aimed at some upright judges in Philadelphia , was forced through the House , but later killed because of the clamor in the " country . " It would have given the organization control of the judiciary in the larger cities . Death in committee is the convenient and impersonal way in which legislation nor favored by the boss is disposed of . No one can be held directly responsible , no one goes on record , and the proposed bill is painlessly smothered . This was illustrated in regard to an obviously necessary and desirable extension of the park surrounding Pennsylvania 's new four-million-dollar capitol building , now nearing completion . The people of the State were generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , and by the unanimity of the legislators in commending the plan when the session began . Governor Pennypacker had suggested the desirability of the extension in his message . A bill was promptly introduced in the Senate and passed . It went in the House Appropriation Committee while Mr. Durham was at Palm Beach ? and there it expired ! Senator Penrose was said to favor it ; but when it was found that the money required would cut down the balances in some of the machine banks too much , he turned on the chloroform , and the " Fox Bill " perished . This last item touches the mainspring of the power of the machine ? the cash balance of Pennsylvania , theoretically in the State Treasury . For nearly a year the amount in the general and sinking funds has averaged over sixteen millions of dollars , which is deposited in about two hundred banks , all over the State . Five or six " active " accounts are maintained , the remainder of this vast sum of money being ' deposited , absolutely by favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend the boss 's influence . It was the disposition and use of some of this money that the late Senator Quay referred to when he sent his famous telegram to the Keystone Bank in Philadelphia , promising that if certain stocks were purchased and held for him , he would " shake the plum-tree " again , as he had before . The selection of the banks which are to hold the State 's money is legally within the control of the State Treasurer , who is also personally responsible for it . Actually , the organization does the selecting , not only of the banks , but of the State Treasurer . For instance , a flourish of flags and a boom of bands signalized the meeting of the Republican State Convention on April 26 , at which Mr. J. L. Plummer , who had been the serviceable Chairman of the House Appropriation Committee in the Legislature of 1904-05 , was nominated for State Treasurer . There was no enthusiasm except  | that of the bands , no deliberation , no contest , no interest . It had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Harrisburg , and the Boas mansion showed activity for a few hours , while the delegates had a chance to see " the old man . " Thus the perfection of organization is shown ; for here is Mr. Plummer , who was lieutenant of appropriations all winter , now to be made lieutenant of bank deposits . If the State at large , in the improbable event of the nomination by the Democrats of a sincerely capable candidate , should show restlessness , it will only be necessary to enlarge the Philadelphia majority by a few thousand extra ballots , conveniently counted as having been cast by voters whose names are " padded " into the registration lists by wholesale , but who are never present in person . It is not generally known , I believe , that the great majorities produced in Philadelphia by Quaker apathy and by fraudulent voting keep the " machine " in control of the Republican State Conventions . Instead of the representation to these conventions being in proportion to the legislative apportionment , it is related to the Republican votes cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the normal adds to the packing of the next Republican convention , leaving the really honest " country " delegates powerless . The power of the boss is enforced through a modified control of the Federal appointments , a positive mastery of the government and finances of the great city of Philadelphia , with ten thousand city employees , an absolute possession of the State offices , the handling of the forty millions of biennial appropriations , and the swinging of the sixteen millions average State cash deposits , as noted above . The management of the latter is by an interestingly simple system . A bank somewhere in the State needs to use more money than it has . It applies to the State Treasurer for a time deposit of State cash . If the banker is apparently " right , " he gets a deposit ? from five thousand dollars up to a halfmillion , the latter only for a great city bank that has much " influence . " After a while there is a campaign to be conducted , and the banker receives a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He contributes , of course ; and usually he knows just what amount is expected of him . Occasionally even this admirably organized machine slips a cog , as it did in one instance of which a very wealthy banker told me . This time the money , $50,000 , had been deposited in the bank in question without noting the fact that the banker is a Democrat as well as a machine fighter . " We received a request for a campaign contribution , " said my friend , " to which we replied at once that we never made any such contributions . There was no answer , but a week later the State Treasurer took out $10,000 of the money , and he kept taking $10,000 a week until it was all withdrawn . We have had no State deposits since . " The machine error had been corrected ! But there is another way in which the bank deposits help keep things smooth . An acquaintance , whose business I must not mention , for obvious reasons , told me that during the administration of a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commendation at an apparently sincere onslaught the latter was making upon a contractor for State supplies whose methods were notoriously bad . He had also , being intimately acquainted with the work of this contractor , suggested to the Governor how a reform might be effected . and much money saved to the State . " Within a week , " he told me , " after my letter had been courteously acknowledged by the Governor , the banker who held my loans ? which I was not prepared to repay at sight ? sent for me and intimated that I had better mind my own affairs , and let Mr. C ? alone . I made no more suggestions , but I could not help wondering how the banker got to know of the letter to Governor H ? . I had not told any one of it . " How did the banker find out ? The " organization " could answer ! I have spoken of " the appropriation lash . " As all bills introduced into the Legislature carrying money must be acted  | upon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very powerful man , and he is always a highgrade lieutenant of the boss . When an incorruptible member from an outlying county , who can not be coaxed by any ordinary means to vote for legislation of which he does not approve , happens to want something for his home hospital , or desires to advance a piece of legislation he is pledged to by his constituents , he finds himself tied and and foot . The Speaker will seldom recognize him ; he is placed only on unimportant committees that may not even organize , and he is without opportunity or influence . After he has felt the lash , and has seen the session passing without the legislation he must have to satisfy his constituents being considered , he is in the mood to understand a hint that if he will be less intractable there may be a change . He agrees , and , lo ! Speaker sees him , his bills come out of committee , and he is saved ! One of the specious arguments used was repeated to me by an honest meinber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission to the " appropriation lash . " " Why should n't I vote for the Philadelphia ripper bills , " he said , " when every member from Philadelphia is in favor of them ? Surely they ought to know what their own city wants ! " And then , with satisfaction , " I got my hospital appropriation through , and the Governor has promised to sign the bill ! " The appropriation lash is long , and it is swung mercilessly for a month after the Legislature adjourns . This year just five hundred measures , including all of the main appropriations , were rushed through at the last moment , and turned over to the Governor for consideration . Any bill he does nott veto within thirty days becomes law without his signature , and even a hard-working , contradictorily conscientrious Governor like Mr. Pennypacker can be pardoned for finding it almost impossible properly to scan all this mass of legislation . Honestly or otherwise , he played absolutely into the hands of the machine this year in his treatment of this plethora of potential laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approving or vetoing others as his reason or his fancy dictated . This postponement of the final disposal of the appropriations , with the open statement that the machine leaders ? Penrose , Durham , Walton ? had been called to Harrisburg to " consult " with the Governor about reductions considered necessary ( the Governor having power to reduce or to eliminate items in the appropriations ) , gave the final touch of the lash for the session of 1904-05 , and it was used remorselessly . It was said that the appropriations , aggregating over forty-five millions of dollars , must be cut down about five millions to come within the estimated revenue of the State for the next two years . The cut was decidedly oblique , and not horizontal ! For instance , small appropriations for the erection of statues to Generals Scott , Geary , St. Clair , and Hartranft were vetoed in full , while a bill to provide $20,000 for the erection of a statue of the late Senator Quay in the Capitol Park was approved . Thus this archboss , who barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction for shaking the plum-tree " while alive , is to be held up for future generations as a model in enduring marble ! It has been suggested that the statue would be much more interesting if it represented the late but not lamented Senator in the act of shaking the plum-tree . This incomprehensible Governor 's appropriation-cutting is peculiar . To the Historical Society of Pennsylvania , of which he is President , he gave the full $100,000 of the appropriation , but from the five State institutions caring for the indigent insane , fearfully overcrowded and needing extension ( there are poor , demented inmates in these who do not have beds in which to sleep alone ! ) , he cut $532,000 , or 31 per cent . To the Valley Forge Commission he gave the full $115,815-he is fond of history ! But all these items of the doings of the Penrose organization and its crankily honest , vainglorious Governor are written here in shame ( for I love my State ) to point the need for a man ? a man to lead the growing dissatisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , and make it in some measure a self-governing community . That the time is ripe is shown by the unrest among the " country " members of the Legislature during the last session , and by many other signs . A Serious proposal was made to divide the State , a few weeks ago , in order to let Philadelphia rot alone , without further involving five millions of citizens who would do better if they could . The hopelessness of obtaining a personal registration law , and thus giving a chance for a fair ballot , so long as Philadelphia must furnish the majorities to negative the reform impulses of the rest of the State , gives point to this proposition . These " country " members formed an organization for resisting the machine , but , lacking the man to lead it , dissolved under the appropriation lash . That man whom we need , and for whom fame is waiting , must be incorruptible , able , energetic , and wealthy . A poor man can not fight these cunningly disposed millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wise and strong , patient and good-tempered . It is a fight to tempt the right man and to stir the blood of those who think of what it means . The time is ripe , the need is great , and the end in view is noble . Where is the man ? he who is to be savior of Pennsyl-vania ?
