 |p0157  DURING the past year the legislative experiment station of the United States has unquestionably been Texas . Other States , notably Oklahoma , have attracted attention by the manufacture of new laws ; but the Texans , who are more serious and determined than any other of our forty-six American tribes , have not only enacted a brand-new set of laws , but they have done something vastly more difficult ? they have enforced them . At the present time the Texas branch of the Standard Oil Company has not only been fined $1,623,900 , but it has been delivered bag and baggage into the hands of a Federal receiver . The International Harvester Company has been fined $35,000 , not because of any oppressive practices , but merely for the formal offense of being a " combination in restraint of trade . " The money has been collected , and the Harvester Company is now an exile from the State . Also for the crime of being combinations , the express companies have paid fines amounting to $40,000 , the Cassidy Southwestern Commission Company has paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $12,000 . Twenty-three of the largest life insurance companies have voluntarily shaken the sand of Texas from their feet , because of a law which required them to invest three-fourths of their Texas earnings in Texas . And a suit is now in full swing to break in pieces the flour millers ' union , which has more than a hundred members . In Texas the railways are wholly under the control of a State commission , a condition which exists nowhere else in the United States . This commission is not at all a mere inquisitorial or advisory body . It issues its decrees ? six thousand of them in 1907 ? and compels the railroads to obey . It fixes rates on all manner of freight , from squabs to automobiles . It decides where a new depot shall be built , how much it shall cost , and what the style of architecture shall be . It compels the five or six different railway systems to compete , and prevents them from issuing any new securities without its official consent . This harsh supervision has so cowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any open resistance . Their dividends in 1906 amounted to less than $40 per mile of road ? $472,000 . The total earnings averaged less than 5 per cent . Yet one of the Harriman railroads meekly testifies , in one of its latest folders , that Texas has " equitable laws , rigidly enforced . " Taking the Sherman Anti-Trust Law as a starting point , Texas has developed a code of unparalleled severity . against combinations . It defines a " trust " as " a combination of capital , skill or acts by two or more persons , firms . corporations or associations of persons , or either two  |p1058  or more of them , for either , any or all of the following purposes I. To create , or which may tend to create , restrictions in trade or commerce , or aids to commerce , or in the preparation of any product for market or transportation , or to create restrictions in the free pursuit of any business . 2 . To fix , maintain , increase or reduce the price of merchandise , produce or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. 4 . To fix any figure whereby the price of an article , etc. , shall be in any manner affected , controlled or established . 5 . To fix or limit the output of an article . 6 . To abstain from engaging in or continuing business , or from the purchase or sale of merchandise . And so forth , and so forth , for half a dozen pages of the most irascible antitrust legislation that has ever been , anywhere , enacted . According to the letter of this law , so I was informed by an eminent judge in Dallas , no sort of combination is legal , not even the simplest partnership . The penalty for the violation of these laws was at first a sufficiently severe one . The culprit was fined at the rate of from $200 to $5,000 for every offense , and each day of violation constituted a separate offense . This made it possible to levy a fine of a million dollars upon every combination that is eight months old , and there are several hundred such combinations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature of 1907 . An amendment was passed which enacted that every offender against the Anti-Trust Law should not only be fined , but imprisoned as well , for " not less than two nor more than ten years . " Also , it was decreed that any agent , member , employee , officer , director or stockholder of any combination should be held directly responsible and punished by fine and imprisonment . The Attorney-General was given power to pounce without warning upon any suspected company and investigate its books and papers . If he brought suit against any corporation , the State was to have an immediate lien upon the corporation 's property . And upon the collection of the fine , the prosecuting attorney was to receive a liberal share of the money , varying from 10 to 25 per cent . Because of this machinery of enforcement there has come , not only a general feeling of alarm among business men , but also a very serious disarrangement of commercial plans and enterprises . Railroad building has completely stopped , altho a number of new lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactive . The building of a hotel de luxe in Houston by the Equitable Assurance Company has been abandoned . The trade of the International Harvester Company , whose rice binders are indispensable in Texas , has been forced upon a most unsatisfactory basis , so far as the farmers are concerned . In all probability , Texas will pay in 1908 about $150,000 more for its farm machinery than it would if it had not broken up the Harvester Company 's finely organized system of agencies . To use a Rooseveltian phrase , Texas has deliberately " carried to an extreme the national virtue of self-reliance . " Her lawmakers have wholly ignored the evils and wastes of competition , and have begun a campaign of violent disintegration . " We prefer to pay a higher price , or to use a poorer quality , rather than to put ourselves in the grip of a trust , " said the president of a business league in Austin . The Texan 's creed is that every man shall " paddle his own canoe . " He knows little , by experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big unit of production which now rules in the manufacturing world . He can not realize that a modern iron furnace has become the equivalent of a million dollars , or that fully five millions would be necessary to establish a well-equipped harvester company . The one big thing of which he has personal knowledge is the cattle ranch ; and that , he knows , can be broken up into small farms with the best of results to the State . Naturally , therefore , he asks , Why not break up the giant organizations of business ? The animus against " trusts " is as bitter as was the hostility to railroads in the Granger States in 1876 . It is not mainly a political motif , as it is in Kansas . It is deep seated and uncompromising . In one State report I found " trusts " alluded to as " freebooters , " and in the last year-book of the Bureau of Statistics there is a newspaper account of the enormous wealth of John D. Rockefeller , sandwiched in between tables of figures . The basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found , in my opinion , in the history of Texas . The fact that this immense State-226,000 square miles of desert and fertility ? was for ten years an independent republic has had great influence in shaping Texan character and Texan policies . It has naturally taught the Texan to resent the compulsions that inevitably follow an era of organization . He sincerely prefers the hit-or-miss methods of free competition to the orderly methods of organized industry . He believes that the systemization of business has gone too far , and he has virtually become a seceder from the interdependent scheme of things , which has been developed during the past twenty years . As yet , this policy of industrial disintegration and secession has not done what it was intended to do . A few small local factories are being built , but the whole swing of the anti-trust movement is at the present time having the extraordinary result of committing Texas to a program of public ownership . In theory , Texas is the land of uncompromising individualism , but , as a matter of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Union . Texas now makes iron on the socialistic plan at the Rush Penitentiary , and has recently bought three large sugar plantations , 20,000 acres in extent , so that the convicts of the latter prison can make sugar in competition with the Sugar Trust . The endowment of its public schools with a fifty-million-dollar tract of land was in itself an act of unparalleled socialism , tho it is not recognized as such by the Texans themselves . The income from this vast area of school land was last year very nearly two millions of dollars . By the formation of its effective railroad commission it has gone much further toward government ownership of railways than any other American State . It has deprived the railroads of practically every feature of private ownership except the risk . Texas believes , and with good reason , that it has the right to dominate its railways , because it has given them 35,000,000 acres of land enough to make four States as large as Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Jersey and Rhode Island . And the Texan statesmen have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State valuation of railways . Also , the Texans prove that ' they can make exceptions , when necessary , to their general policy of " trust busting . " They have inconsistently inserted an exemption clause , for instance , which forbids their anti-trust law to operate against trade unions , and they openly encourage the farmers to organize " combinations in restraint of trade . " The most conspicuous " trust " in Texas is the " Farmers ' Union , " which has been formed to hold cotton until the price is raised to 15 cents a pound . Meetings are being held to strengthen this combine . Warehouses are plainly marked with its name . Its promoters are regarded with general favor . Every one knows that if the antitrust law were impartially enforced , these organized farmers would be fined $5,000 a day and imprisoned for at least two years : but in the present state of public opinion in the Southwest there is na prospect whatever of any such prosecution . So , while the Texas laws are elaborately designed to push the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce them has placed Texas in the same class with Belgium , New Zealand , Australia and other socialistic countries . The Lone Star State is the most striking example , at the present moment , of that irresistible drift . whether for good or for evil we do not vet know , toward the public control or ownership of all organized industries .
