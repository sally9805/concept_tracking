If each man of intelligence and discernment who voted on November 6 were asked what issue it was that gave victory again to the Republican party by such decisive majorities , he would say that it was the fear of business disturbance in case Mr Bryan should be elected . Whether such fears were well founded or not , whether they were prompted by the threat of free coinage , . t 16 to 1 or by the spectacle of Mr. Bryan as an ogre attacking the foundations of society generally  --  that was the decisive influence which controlled the great mass of doubtful voters Time after time has it been proved that there are enough men unfettered by party allegiance to turn the scales in any election This was shown in the campaigns of 1884 and 1892 , when the Democrats put forward a candidate who commanded the confidence of business men . The result proved in both instances that when they planted themselves on such care foundations , they had at least an equal chance of carrying the country They had the same chance this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result if they had nominated Richard Olney , or Charles S. Fairchild , or some man of that stamp . It is sufficient to say that they would not have been beaten at the start With such a candidate they would have been gaining , instead of losing , votes all the time , and would have been in better heart from day to day The Repu.b11 ; ? ans never could have organized the Sound-Money parade against such a candidate . All business men- would have felt the same confidence in either contingency . The most significant feature of Tues day 's election is the terrible rebuke to Bryanism which has been administered by the States between the Alleghanies and the Pacific . In New York and New England , McKinley majorities have fallen off notably from those of 1896 , largely owing to the fact that four years ago the old Democratic organization in this part of the country was practically disrupted by the action of the Chicago convention , whereas since then a new one has been built up which took measures to get voters to the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn only " went through the motions " of a canvass , while this year both have made a real fight . In C ? nnecticut four years ago the Democrats were in utter despair ; this fall they were hopeful of electing their candidate for Governor , and thousands who stayed at home before , voted the whole party ticket on Tuesday . But west of New York , save as the exceptional conditions in Chicago reduced the Republican plurality in Illinois , Bryanism has shown itself far weakerm1900 than in 1896 The McKinley pluralities have iicreased in the Middle West ; States beyond , like Kansas and South Dakota , which supported Bryan the first time , have rejected him the second , the Bryan pluralities have fallen off tremendously in all the silver States ; and the Pacific Coast is emphatically against the Democratic-Populist candidate . The comparatively small plurality for Bryan in the Borough of Manhattan is a sharp rebuke for Croker When one remembers that the old city of New York gave the Democratic candidate for President more than 76,000 plurality in 1992 , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the fact that Bryan has received less than 30,000 plurality , against the 85,000 which Croker was claiming just before election , must impress even the Tammany boss . Still more impressive in some aspects is the evidence that the Democratic candidate for Governor has suffered severely from having owed bis nomination to Croker Odell runs behind McKinley , of course , because tens of thousands of Democrats voted for the Republican electors , but such Democrats should have supported their party 's candidate for Governor if he had not been objectionable . The fact that Odell does not run so far behind McKinley in 1900 as Black did in 1896 , proves that many Democrats decided to rebuke Croker for his refusal of the nomination to Coler by voting against a Democrat who was objectionable only because he had lent himself to this scheme " McKinley 's reelection will end the war in the Philippines " This has been the burden of endless Republican speeches and soldiers ' letters . Col. Roosevelt himself has assured us , with painful iteration , that the Democratic party and Mr. Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has asked our ballots on the ground that to vote otherwise is to strengthen the hands of the " rebels . " Meanwhile we hear from no less distinguished a statesman than Mr Perry S. Heath , recently Assistant Postmaster-General , and during the late campaign in charge of the Republican National Committee 's " literary bureau , " that Col. Roosevelt and all the leading Republican speakers and newspapers have wholly misled us . On the strength of a notice published in the Madrid organ of the Filipino junta , Mr , Heath as serts that the Philippine Assembly has resolved to surrender its arms the instant it hears of Mr. Bryan 's election , in order to demonstrate that its forces are not fighting against the North American republic , but against the Imperialists . " However , if unfortunately Mr. McKinley should be reelected , " this manifesto goes on , " the war Wilrbe-con -- tinned for four ears . . . unless he should meanwhile recognize our independence . " Naturally Mr. Heath sees the hand of Mr. Bryan and the Democrats in all this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bryan leaders , " he told the reporters , adding that his literary bureau would give this document a " very wide circulation " To the intelligent reader , the whole incident is an illuminating example of the extremities the Republicans have been driven to , in their vain efforts to cover up their complete and melancholy failure in the Philippines , and to suppress the truth as to the situation in the islands . Still another competent foreigner has just given striking testimony as to the completeness of this failure . Mr. de B6-rard , the French consul at Manila , has made an official report to his Government , in which he confirms the views of John Foreman and others that the situation of the Filipinos is worse than it was under the Spaniards Not only has the splendid future predicted by the Americans in 1898 not come to pass , but agriculture is paralyzed , and such industries as have not been ruined can not now be pursued . The great mercantile houses , M de Berard reports , have been unable to transact any business for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , and the country is " overrun by a band of adventurers who have come to exploit the people . " Europeans should not establish themselves except at Manila , Cebu , and Iloilo ; other places are unsafe . But to console intending traders , M. de B6rard says that in eighteen months ' rivalry for the commerce of the Philippines the Americans " have not yet succeeded in conquering the ground which they expected to capture almost entirely without difficulty . " In sending this report to the editor of the Indianapolis Sentinel , M. Valary , a French publicist , writes that he sees no way out of the Philippine muddle for the United States except a treaty of peace on the basis of a protectorate , without any political obligations on the part of the Filipinos , who should , however , give special trade rights to the Americans . This , he thinks , would not detract in any way from American prestige and honor . In the light of these revelations , how pitiful are Mr. Heath 's efforts to shield the Administration he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would end the existing situation if they had the power ! The Evening Post printed on Friday some statistics collected by its Washington correspondent as to the percentage of discharges for disability in our army on foreign service , which should not be overlooked by any- one seeking to get at the true cost , in human terms , of our Imperialistic ventures . Ever since the fighting in the Philippines began , the Evening Post has published every Monday as complete a table of the losses in. battle and from sickness as could be compiled from the official dispatches . But neither the total deaths , 2,939 , nor the number of soldiers reported wounded , 2,451 , comprise all the men disabled , especially as most of the wounded recover sufficiently to return to duty . It now appears that of the regular army more than 31/2 per cent . were discharged invalided during the year ending June 30 , and less than one per cent . of the volunteers . The small percentage of the latter troops is without doubt explained by the fact that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last not until February , so that they were exposed to the Philippine climate for only a comparatively short time . Now that the rainy season is on , the percentage is rapidly increasing , as is shown by the fact that the last three transports to sail from Manila carried 1,000 invalids bound for home hospitals and early discharges . Moreover , officers who have served in the Philippines say that the vitality of a regiment as a whole sinks with each month , and that the longer the regiments stay , the less power they have to resist the inroads of disease . To repair this constant waste , more and more men are sent out to death or disability . Two transports this very week are carrying nearly 1,000 men from this port . Gov . Roosevelt is a fresh illustration of the dangers which beset a politician with a literary past . The latest thing of his own to be flung in his face is an extract from his life of Benton , in which he emitted the perfectly characteristic opinion that , " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a citizen as a duellist . " Malevolent Democrats had been circulating this among Quakers in the doubtful States . What could the Governor do  --  recant or reaffirm ? Neither , but mix the two . Observe , he writes to the troubled Quakers , that the sentence you complain of was " written fifteen years ago , " and though no man must say that I have " altered my convictions in the matter , " " were I now to rewrite the sentence , I should certainly so phrase it that it could not be construed as offensive to the Society of Friends . " In other words , when I wrote it , I never dreamed that I should live to be in need of Quaker , votes . This is a dying fall almost as graceful as the one the Governor executed in the case of another extract rising like a ghost out of his dead past to confront him now . In a magazine article he had said , with gay abandon , that the cowboy , even when drunk , was a more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several ordinary farmers and artisans in the West wanted to know what he meant by that . Why , said the ingenuous Roosevelt , that was written before I had formed my present extensive acquaintance among farmers and artisans , and found out what an extremely fine class of citizen ( each with his vote ) they are . Bryan might envy such supple dexterity . But in the blunt , the forthright , the fearless Roosevelt , it does look a little odd . Mr. Park Benjamin , himself a graduate of the Naval Academy and a writer of standing on naval topics , is the latest to fall foul of the results of the Roosevelt Naval Personnel Bill . In the current Independent , he takes Rear-Ad- miral Melville 's warning of danger to the navy from incompetent engineers ' as his text , and pays his respects very warmly to what he calls the " No Naval Engineers " scheme . Like the Chief Engineer of the Navy , Mr. Benjamin finds that the bill has put " ex-engineers on the bridge and in the pilot-house , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine-room . " He makes light of Rear-Admiral Melville 's suggested remedy of giving the junior line officers engineering instruction , by asking how this can be done when " actual need keeps almost every man of them at sea continuously . " While declining to help haul the discredited advocates of the union of the line and engineers out of the mire they are in , Mr. Benjamin thinks that they may find it best to organize another engineer carps . It would be interesting to hear from Gov . Roosevelt on the failure of the amalgamation , as Mr. Benjamin refers to him and Capt . Evans as the men who gave the " impelling impetus " to the reorganization committee . Gov . Roosevelt , he says , wanted to settle " right here and now " a problem as old as himself . In the meantime , it is plain that the navy engines are falling into the hands of a substitute ; underpaid , and inferior engineer corps of non-commissioned officers , called " warrant machinists . " Greater New York 's budget of expenditures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a fair way to pass in the near future . The proposed expenditure of $98,100 , - 413.43 during the coming fiscal year amounts to more than $30 per capita . In terest upon the city 's debt , and redemption and instalment charges combined , amount to $22,432,379.23 , and this exceeds any other item in the budget . The expenditure Most nearly ' approaching it is that of the Department of Education , $18,512,817.69 . The per-capita debt charge ( interest and sinking fund. ) in the present budget is almost exactly $7 , or 23 per cent . of the total charge . It would be difficult to make any extended comparison with expenditures in past years , owing to the reorganization of the city under its new charter , but an increase of more than seven million dollars in one year indicates that municipal expenditures in this city are still increasing rapidly . In the current number of the Popular Science ffonth/y , 1Vir . Clinton Rogers Woodruff illustrates what he calls the " tremendous advances of municipal government " during the present century by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1899 . The per-capita expenditure increased during this period from 97 cents to $27.76 , due mainly to the fact , thinks Mr. Woodruff , that the city now " does more for the citizen than it did one hundred years ago . " The city certainly has more to do now than it had then , but unfortunately there is abundant evidence that not all the in crease in municipal expenditure , either in this city or in Philadelphia , represents better public service or " more done " for the citizen . It represents more men on the pay roll for doing each thing . That a civil war can rage for a year in a South American republic , involving casualties to the number of thirty thousand , and gain only the slightest attention from our press , is a striking comment on the word Pan-American . If the usurping Vice-President of the Colombian Republic had been a Melanesian prince , if the fierce partisan fighting that has taken place along the Caribbean had been transferred to the Red Sea , it would have been a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own . hemisphere , the return of a Minister or trader brings us the news a month or so late . This time it is the United States Minister to Colombia who comments on the situation . The usurping President , Marroquin , has been recognized by all the Powers except the Papal See , though San Clemente , forcibly deposed last July , still asserts his claim to the Presidency . Meanwhile , each draws a President 's salary , and , as the Liberal rebellion wanes , the Presidents are the freer to fight it out undisturbed , with the odds in favor of Marro- ( Dim Such is a season 's news from Colombia ; all which suggests that , when the smallest kind of an Asian punitive expedition is " news , " and the largest kind of a South American revolution is not , Pan-Americanism is , in the late Senator Ingalls 's words , " an iridescent dream : " Sir Robert Giffen brought out In a recent address some striking facts about civilized " expansion , " past and to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are told , lies out only future hope . A century ago the population of ' European countries and nations of European origin was not more than 170,000,000 . To-day it is 500,000 , - 000 . If the forces which have brought about this great increase persist for a hundred years , our descendants will see a civilized population of 1,500,000,000 or more . In view of such an outlook , what becomes of the " Yellow Peril " ? It will have vanished by mere force of numbers . And what a growing possibility of new markets we shall have at our own . doors , as this peaceful expansion goes on ! We are compassing sea and land and violating all our traditions and principles to find new customers among black and yellow races , when the doubling and quadrupling of demand from advanced races is going on before our eyes . The most valuable part of the letters of Dr. Morrison , the Pekin correspondent of the London Times , is that in which he gives extracts from the official publications of the Chinese Government during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no mistake . Dr. Morrison may be prejudiced in. his opinions ; it would be strange if a man could be wholly without bias against people who had been shooting at him for forty days . Sir Robert Hart 's extreme pessimism about the future of China may , similarly , be a result in part of having been under fire and on short rations for so long . But what appeared in the official Gazette of the Government is the htera scripta which remains beyond dispute , and it is indeed a terrible exhibition of the duplicity and treachery of the responsible authorities at Pekin . After reading them , no one can doubt that it was the deliberate purpose of the Dowager Empress , or whoever was in supreme control , to expel or kill all foreigners , and to give native Christians the alternative of recantation or death . Direct encouragement of the Boxers is shown . Baron von Ketteler was murdered on June 20 , but no official cognizance of the crime was taken until July 18 . On that day an imperial decree recited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us deep grief . We ought vigorously to seek the murderer and punish him . " A very late repentance , and a tardy resolve which , it is needless to say , was never carried out . Perhaps the finest example of a Chinese state paper is the decree published on August 2 ( the relieving forces in sight ) . It spoke of the " disturbances " in and about the capital , and proceeded : " It was a duty to protect the envoys of the foreign states residing at Pekin , and the Princes and Ministers of the Tsung li-Yamen addressed frequent letters to them , inquiring after their welfare . " These letters may have been enclosed in the bombshells which the Princes and Ministers also frequently addressed to the envoys . The reports of German brutalities in China , which continue ' to appear from day to day , are notsurprisingin view of the Emperor 's bloodthirsty speeches and Germany 's record as a colonizing Power . Only the other day Lieut . Prince Prosper von Arenberg was resentenced to fifteen years ' imprisonment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in German South Africa on the suspicion that he was an English spy . Nor is this an exceptional case . One after another , Germany 's officials in her oldest colony have come home to be punished more or less lightly for inconceivably cruel crimes committed upon native men and women . Reports from Kiao-Chou do not indicate a much more sympathetic treatment of the Chinese who have come under German rule against their will . The truth is , that the magnificent German army is a machine built up on blind obedience and brute force . It is practically impossible to punish a cruel officer unless he commits murder , and their complete power over their men leads to inevitable moral deterioration on the part of the officers . The whole spirit of the army  --  of militarism at its height  --  is a menace to the development of the people along lines of civilization and humanity , and its results alone are a fearful price to pay for the satisfaction of having a better army than some other nation . When officials trained in this school are placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of miles from the social , legal , and moral restraints of the Fatherland , there is only one outcome to be expected- Aside from the need of shortening sail , which a man at Lord Salisbury 's age must feel , there is an excellent reason , in the nature of the case , why he should no longer unite in his own person the two offices of Foreign Secretary and Pre . no:er . Too much power of too momentous a character is put thereby into the hands of a single man . A Foreign Secretary is bound to consult the Prime Minister ; but this has been , with Salisbury , merely letting his left hand know what his right hand doeth . There remains , of course . the sovereign , without whose consent not even the Premier would venture on any far-reaching measure of foreign policy . Queen Victoria has always taken a keen interest in foreign affairs . When the inner history of her reign comes to be written , it will be found , we believe . that her opinion and influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she played in averting war between France and Germany in 1875 is not known , but it was a great one . The Queen , however , is now aged , and necessarily unable to follow the details of foreign complications with her former attention and judgment .. Thus it has come about that the most important questions touching the relations of Great Britain to other countries have practically been left , for one brain to decide . Salisbury may consult his Cabinet , or may His reference of affairs-to-the-Queen is more and more-perfunctory . It is his single hand which has held all the threads . This is a dangerous power for any man to wield under a Constitutional Government , and Lord Salisbury is wise in surrendering it . Of course , as Premier , he will really retain control of British foreign policy . The Marquis of Lansdowne , the new Foreign Secretary , will submit all major matters to the Prime Minister , who will thus rid himself of the dust and drudgery of the Foreign Office without , however , divesting himself of the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office has been long and varied . When he first took the position in 1878 , resigning the office of Secretary of State for India , Lord Lytton wrote him from Calcutta , " I feel sure you are destined to be one of England 's greatest Foreign Ministers . " This might have passed at the time for the language of flattery . Lytton 's style scarcely needed an Oriental touch to make it exuberant . But the prophecy does not seem so far wrong when we look back at it after twenty-two years . Salisbury 's first period of Russophobe activity is , indeed , rather melancholy in the retrospect . He himself has frankly confessed that England " laid her money on the wrong horse " in all that business . But he was the man who told her how to lay it . In recent years , however , particularly during his latest term of office , he has some particularly brilliant and at the same time beneficent achievements to point to . His old friend the Turk thwarted him in the Armenian affair , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Chamberlain so free and reckless a hand in the South African dispute ; but , when all is said , Salisbury 's agreement with France and Germany in all that respects the future of Africa , his better understanding with Russia in the Orient , crowned only now by the Anglo-German agreement concerning China , show diplomacy at its highest and best . In none of these farsighted arrangements has Lord Salisbury been a Jingo , or a raw-head-and-bloodybones Englishman . He has , in fact , repeatedly spoiled the plans of the Forwards and the Fighters of his own party . He has labored for peace and the future , and , in so far , has been of the number of statesmen whose work will abide and be their best memorial .
