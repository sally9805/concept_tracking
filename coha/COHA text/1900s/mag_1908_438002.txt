THE humble and hard-working scientific investigator , when occasionally he looks up from his microscope or dissecting-table , is apt to perceive ? sometimes in reality , at other times in imagination ? a supercilious individual , not invariably a college president , asking , " What 's the use ? " At the moment he may find this simple query somewhat disturbing to his nervous system , and he is to be congratulated if he can think of a suitable retort before it is too late . Franklin 's apt reply , " What 's the use of a new-born baby ? " ? so brilliantly justified by the later developments of electricity ? was a spark off the wheel of genius , and no such fire is at the command of the ordinary plodder along scientific paths . I have acknowledged a certain irritation upon bearing the query , " What 's the use ? " and yet , upon reflection , I must confess that it is a very proper question ? one which must be answered if science is in any sense to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test of everything , from our human standpoint , and we can conceive of no other . What , then , is the use , the value , of scientific research ? The question is a metaphysical one , and science , as such , gives no answer . Science may show that such and such a research has ' produced , or has assisted to produce , in the course of years , turnips , or sugar-beets , or oranges ; or has saved the lives of so many people ; or has prevented railroad collisions ; or has , if you please , lodged rascals in jail and set the innocent free . All these things and many others science may do , but then ? what 's the use ? Regarded from the standpoint of pure science , what atom is better than another , or what combination of atoms ? Do we feed 728you , clothe you , house you , from day to day ? What then ? why are you , as an individual walking the earth , better than the clay of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equally wonderful , equally obedient to what we call the laws of nature , ? is , in short , what it is , ? and is that by reason of everything else . The cosmos is a unit , equally indispensable in all its parts , ? for and by itself . What is the use of God ? No answer is thinkable , to the monist or monotheist . Nevertheless , the man who recognized no use , or value , would be insane . There is a practical dualism which lies at the very foundation of our nature , makes our lives worth while , and enables us to respect those of others . We are ends in ourselves : a moment of pleasure , of intellectual or spiritual insight ; of love , ? even of anger or hate , ? is its own justification , is the culmination of the so-called blind forces of nature in sight , Thus it may be said that those things are of value which , entering the field of human consciousness , serve to enrich it . Science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct and indirect , or contributory , values . The idea of causation , or the necessary sequence of events , leads us to perceive that certain things which at the time were quite unknown to us , or if known did not impress us as valuable , were antecedent to some of our most precious experiences , and that the latter directly resulted from the former . These indirect values began to come into prominence in the intellectual field as soon as science was systematically studied , and to-day they are perceived to be as numerous , in relation to any particular direct value , as our ancestors in relation to ourselves . To Biology and Human Progress 7 ' " useful " posterity ; but the lay mind is apt to be as skeptical as we might be if requested to let a notorious burglar out of jail , on the ground that he might prove , in the sixteenth generation , to be a necessary ancestor of some great man . This , however , is true only when the lay imagination is required to be unduly stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value it has is of a contributory nature . Yet we do not accuse the public of inability to appreciate money , for all that it is not even the father of any direct value ( unless cupidity be one ) , but at most its grandfather . The unscientific will go back even farther than this , and see value in the crop which may be sold for money , ? even in the land and seed , which brought together will produce the crops . Somewhere , however , we come to the beginning of things as understood , to the " This is the house that Jack built ; " and back of that the story does not tell . Perhaps , then , I should say that the first , and in some ways most important , use of scientific research , and a knowledge of its results , is to enlarge the imagination . The eye of the mind must be taught to see and understand . How ninny follies , how many crimes , are committed from lack of imagination ! Alas , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which would not be tolerated for an instant , did we but have the insight , the imagination , to see what it all means and is likely to mean for coming generations ! The story is told that , on a recent Antarctic expedition , " the voyagers started with a train of dogs to drag their sledges , to penetrate as far as they could the frozen hills . They were reduced to very small rations of food , and the dogs , though willing and friendly enough , began to collapse and fail with fatigue and want of nourishment . They were obliged to kill them one by one . Each of the party in turn had to lead the dog that seemed most exhausted away from the camp , put him to death , and return with his body , which was presently eaten by the other dogs . The poor creatures at last grew to understand that when , in the evening , one of the sledge-party left the tents accompanied by a dog , it meant a speedy prospect of food . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excited barking from the rest of the troop . The victim himself always shared in the excitement and accompanied his executioner wagging his tail and uttering joyful barks , under the impression that he was specially favored by being led to the source of the desired food . " It is well for the dog , thus about to perish , to have no anticipatory terror ; but for ourselves , we have been provided , for good or for evil , with the power to anticipate and prevent many misfortunes , and damned are we if we do n't use it . The " knowledge of good and evil " is indeed a two-edged sword , and to be unskillful in its use is to endure the severest penalties ever meted out to living beings . Yet , how like we are to the dogs in the story before the event ; how unlike , in our remorse and misery after it . how cheerfully , to avoid a little trouble or expense , do we submit to poisoned food , foul water , the contamination of our blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death , of hereditary incapacity , of crookedness , ? when they affect us directly . Without disparaging the other sciences , it must be claimed for biology that , since we are living creatures , it is of the first importance for the understanding of our vital problems , for the cultivation of that foresight which we are bound by our contract with the Almighty to practice . As a means of culture , I hold it invaluable for the development of that type of mind which is ready to connect series of facts , and so perceive the danger before it is at the door , the advantage before it The Gate of Death , 1000 , p. 220. has passed by . From this point of view there is a positive gain.to the individual in any scientific research pursued in a sufficiently broad and open-eyed way . It is not necessary to prove that the study of a particular group of beetles or centipedes will eventually " mean money ; " it is fruitful at the very moment in cultivating an alert attitude of mind ; provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too narrowly construed . That it also has a direct value , only to be properly appreciated by those who have received it , is a different but no less important consideration . The scientific imagination is not merely of value for the purpose of connecting facts , but also for that of disconnecting fiction . To believe an impossible thing does not usually require much imagination , but the reverse . Thus , to the simpleminded people of old it seemed quite possible that the sun " stood still in the heavens " on an occasion narrated in history . To the scientific man it is apparent that for this to happen either the earth would have to cease revolving on its axis , or else the sun would be obliged to proceed with fearful speed out of its usual path , to keep opposite the same terrestrial point . Either of these things seem to him less likely than the hypothesis that the story is a poetic fiction . It is because he can imagine the implications of the statement , that he does not believe it . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " nature and nurture ; " in other words , heredity and environment . They are , therefore , problems for the biologist ; or , if not exclusively for him , at any rate largely of his concern . To what extent can we , by our educational methods , affect the character of the individual ? To what extent is it legitimate or desirable to do so ? Education , in a broad or biological sense , does not begin in school ; it does not even begin at birth , but long before . It may be defined as being the provision of the best means for developing the several characteristics or abilities of the individual to the best personal and social uses . In this sense it includes adequate nourishment on the one hand , adequate stimuli on the other . Do we yet know enough about these things , or apply what we know ? Most assuredly not . A number of years ago Dr. II . M. Vernon made some experiments with the eggs of sea-urchins to determine the effect of various kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ova for an hour to a temperature of about 8 ? C. at the time of impregnation , instead of the normal temperature of about 19 ? C. , produced an average diminution of 4.1 per cent in the size of the larvae . Temperatures a few degrees above the normal acted even more unfavorably , one of 25.5 ? producing an average diminution of 5.9 per cent . It was thus evident that the ova were extraordinarily sensitive to changes in temperature at this early period , and , as it was also found that they were very sensitive to changes in the salinity of the water , Dr. Vernon inferred that practically all changes in the environment would affect them . Among the higher animals , Professor Ewart made experiments with rabbits . He constructed an artificial slum in the basement of a house with little light or air , and there permitted a doe rabbit to live and give birth to litters of young . The effect was disastrous in the extreme . Many were born dead others were so weakly as to be scarcely able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , and her offspring were all that could be desired . Biology teaches , then , that living organisms are very easily affected in the earliest stages of their existence ; and if we find such gross and palpable effects as have just been described , it may reasonably be assumed that there are others of a more subtle nature , perhaps not less serious in the long run . Indeed , it may fairly be questioned whether it is not a lesser evil to destroy the potential individual at the beginning , than to cause him to go through life handicapped by some frailty resulting from early injury . Those who oppose the demolition of the slums sometimes accuse their opponents of sentimentalism . How can you cure , say they , something which has its root in the vicious habits of the people ,  --  and , incidentally , subserves great commercial interests ? Well , we have this to say , that it is absolutely certain that , given any human stock this world ever produced , it would deteriorate in the slums ; the individuals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ; they would fare like Dr. Vernon 's sea-urchins or Professor Fwart 's rabbits . Who and what are the causes of the conditions permitted to exist in all great cities ? Where should we assign the blame ? The past can not be undone , but we are responsible for the future , because we are able to bring about a change . That the slums could not be destroyed in a few years , . if the people of this country really wished it , is impossible to believe . The trouble is , that we either hold property ( if it belongs to us or our associates ) to be more valuable than life or health ( if they belong to others ) , or else we do not recognize the true causes of the existing evil . In the latter case science and education should help us , in the former we justify revolution . Nor is it merely a matter of altruism . The conditions which obtain in all crowded centres of population weigh heavily upon every one of us . The great cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption and rascality which they foster and shelter have become a menace to the state . Boulder , where I write , may be taken as a type of the town of the future , at least in its better features . With natural surroundings of extraordinary beauty , as good a climate as might be desired , and a population no worse than the average , there seems a possibility of main- taining indefinitely such conditions as are suitable for human beings . Yet there are many good men and women who would sacrifice the best of all this ; who would fill our streams with filth and our air with smoke and gapes , would crowd our streets with the poor and miserable , would have us even as Denver or Chicago is to-day , ? all for the sake of that form of prosperity represented by commercial profit ! But stop , you say , ? the world 's work must be carried on . We must have cities and factories , and mills . Where would you be if all these things suddenly ceased to exist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does not our very civilization depend upon them ? To all this , so plausible but so shortsighted , the biologist can have but one answer . Nothing is right which interferes with the normal healthy life of human beings ; nothing so interfering is justifiable if preventable . You have already accepted this doctrine in relation to your chickens , your cattle , yes , even your pigs ; but when you come to your own species , there you stop . It is true , indeed , that the world 's work must be carried on . The social organism must be maintained ; we desire neither anarchy nor savagery . But at present it is suffering from chronic indigestion in an aggravated form , and without some change of habits , the doctor can not help . The biologist has observed that , when a country is nearly uniform from one end to the other , the animals and plants will show a similar uniformity ; but that when it is broken up into mountains , or consists of islands , several races of many genera will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian and the sociologist have made similar observations . The British Islands , the mountains of Switzerland , the peninsulas of Greece , Italy , and Scandinavia , have been the homes of the finest races the world has known . In a certain sense , the United States and the Federation of the World are magnificent conceptions , ever to be upheld ; but please observe , these are Stales which are united , and the world is to be a Federation , not a monarchy . The best peoples have been the offspring of mixed blood , living under stable and characteristic conditions for long periods of time . It may be that the intermixture of new blood is necessary for racial vitality , but it is absolutely certain that the lack of a reasonable degree of stability is fatal to high culture , which always means racial and personal individuality . By stability I do not refer to political or intellectual conditions , which should always exhibit progressive change , but to racial constancy sufficient to call forth abilities suited to the peculiar genius of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peoples now going on should give us a sort of dull uniformity of mediocrity , stamping out " provincialism " altogether . We are Americans , to be sure ; but we should also be living examples of the peculiar and unique virtue which emanates from our own half-acre . I should welcome the adoption of some particular sign ? some feather in our cap that would mark us as coming from a special state or town , if it were indicative of real characteristics such as we ought to possess . Provincialism , of the right sort , is a virtue , not a vice ; we who live in this place , not quite like any other in the world , should live the lives and think the thoughts adapted to it , ? not indeed in ignorance of the beyond , but as men who are able to use that which Providence has bestowed upon them . If the migratory habits of Americans in general constitute a certain danger to our culture , what is to be said of the injection of apparently unlimited quantities of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese , Slays , and others are more or less desirable as citizens than those who already occupy the country , what is to be said of the indiscriminate mixture 1 Supposing that some one were to intro duce miscellaneous blood into the choice herds of cattle in Colorado , without so much as consulting the owners , what would be said and done ? But nobody asks , apparently , what the Coloradoan of the future is likely to be , as the consequence of the intermixture of half a dozen alien races . I do not pretend to know how it will all work out , but the matter is open for investigation and no little evidence is already available . In the mean time , the horse will doubtless be over the horizon before we think of closing the stable-door . It is well known to the biologist that all living organisms vary , the several individuals not being exactly alike . It is also recognized that this variation follows certain general laws ; so that , for instance , examples of extreme difference from the average are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further that the race inherits certain types of variability , so that if individuals of a certain kind appear now , they may be looked for in the future . Arguing from such general considerations , which are of course supported by innumerable specific cases , we may infer that the white population of Colorado ought to produce a certain percentage of ability of various kinds . Just what the maximum poetic ability ? for instance ? of any race or stock may be , we can not say , since it is probable that no circumstances have ever arisen which would utilize and develop all the potential poets of a nation . Possibly the conditions existing in ancient Athens at her best were the most favorable that have ever prevailed for securing the maximum possible output of certain kinds of ability ; and it may well be that these will never be repeated , ? for the one reason , among others , that modern human society necessarily scatters its intellectual energies much more , having a far wider field . The proper intellectual output of a country , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated only in a general way and in the bulk ; nor would it be desirable that all those capable of work in certain intellectual fields should be directed thereto , any more than would be the case with manual occupations . Nevertheless , we have the right to expect a certain average performance ? a certain minimum of distinction ? in every race , and if it is not forthcoming , the biologist , at least , knows that something is wrong . Professor J. McKeen Cattell of Columbia University has lately been gathering some very interesting statistics regarding the distribution of American men of science . lie gives figures showing the origin and present whereabouts of a thousand of the most successful or best known . It is curious to note that , whereas some states have to-day about as many as were born within their borders ( for example Pennsylvania , sixty-six born , sixty-five present ) , and thus may be said to have retained the talent they produced , others show notable gains or losses . Ohio , for example , gave birth to seventy-five of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four . California gave birth to eleven , but has fifty-three , as might be anticipated from the youth of the state and the rapid increase of population . Colorado , for similar reasons , while giving birth to only three , is now credited with eight . The three , however , was over 87 per million of the population in 1860 , while the eight was only 14.8 per million in .1900 . The latter figure shows a higher percentage than most states without universities of the largest size , and is about ten times as favorable as the figures for the South Central states . While the selection of Professor Cattell 's thousand shows a great many individual anomalies and oversights , yet it does very well to bring out such general facts as have just been mentioned . It is to be wished that the same might be done for the other fields of activity , so that we might see how far each state was taking advantage of its own native ability . Biology has something to say about the purpose and scope of republican institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most brilliant and fruitful conceptions of the world . Long before mankind knew anything about Galtonian curves or polygons of frequency , it was discovered that there existed in every society certain exceptional individuals , capable of being put to exceptional uses . This discovery is not peculiar to man , of course , but he has been able to give it new meanings and uses . " The Divine Right of Kings " is not an empty phrase , but may be taken to mean that it is wise and therefore right for those capable of leading to assume this office . The pro test of the republican was against the abuse rather than the use of this high function ; and it is a singular and significant fact that under the guise of republicanism we have given our temporary monarch more power than the King of England . Just now , some of us are inclined to complain that this individual is using too freely his peculiar opportunities ; a protest singularly ill-timed , since he is the first of a considerable series to show any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the powers and functions of a President of the United States , or of any other president ? The biological formula is a simple one : he should be allowed to do whatever he can do with advantage to those he serves . He should not be allowed to appoint postmasters in every village in the United States , because it is beyond human possibility that he can do this intelligently ; he should be permitted to express his opinions on public questions , especially when , from his position , he has special knowledge of them . If he has been wisely selected , he represents , not merely the material interests , but the best ideals , the honor , of his country . He may and should stand for the integrity of these against all corners , even as David stood against Goliath . Yet it should be open to the humblest citizen to criticise his words and actions and to drive his criticisms home if he can . The ideal republic must be a union of more or less kindred spirits , with more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the free play of human activities . Where is it to be found ? Nowhere so clearly , I think , as in the field of science . In the Republic of Science there is the necessary common bond , while its citizens are scattered in the four corners of the earth . There is the common language of scientific terms . There is the full recognition of authority , with the equal recognition of the right of any one to question that authority . There are no artificial sanctions or , if there are , they count for little . There is a reasonable balance preserved between the authority of custom and the right to change it . There are , of course , places encrusted over , needing to be broken by violence ; there are little whirlwinds of anarchy ; perfection has not been reached , but , take it all in all , the Republic of Science is the best of modern republics , and to be a citizen of it is in itself an education in the science of government . I wish to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded in the most general way . Any group of living beings , arranged in respect to the development of any particular character , may be represented by a diagram , thus : Each dot may be taken to represent one individual : A is the point of the minimum , B of the maximum development of the character . Of course , the sharpness of the corners of the figure will differ much according to the species and character chosen , but the general principle will remain unaltered . Dimorphic forms will of course give a more complicated figure , but these need not be considered at present . It will be seen at once that , as our common experience would sug- gest , there are many more individuals midway between the extremes than at either end . Thus , there are more persons of ordinary height , or approximately so , than Goliaths or Tom Thumbs . Suppose now that the group is not stationary , but shows progress in the direction indicated by the arrow , that is , toward the increase of the given character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , his representative in a later generation , moves forward so much , the second also , and in short the whole group advances one or two places . Tliis is illustrated very well by the pro- congress of political opinion in such a country as England . To-day the Conservative party stands where the Liberals of former days stood ; the Liberals are semi-socialistic in their aims , socialism has become a force in practical politics , while , on the other hand , the old-fashioned Tory is practically extinct . It is evident from the diagram that vox popidi is not , from an idealistic standpoint , vox del . It would be , if the population had reached perfect equilibrium , so that any change or " progress " was undesirable . Few of us , I imagine , consider that any civilized nation can afford to rest on its laurels today , even for the briefest time . Hence , in respect to any particular movement , there must be men who are more enlightened than the majority , ? men who , having advanced farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who profess to have this advantage are looking at the wrong road , does not alter the fact that there are some who are fitted to lead and who should be followed to the extent that they are right . Here , however , comes a difficulty . How is the mass of mankind to know the front of the phalanx from the rear ? How is it to distinguish true from false guides ? Has it not always stoned the prophets , and can it well avoid doing so ? I venture to suggest that there are ways of escaping from this difficulty , or at least of mitigating the evil . It is un- doubtedly true that those in the middle of the group can rarely see the foremost , or understand his description of the road . But the second can understand the first , and interpret the message to the.third. and so along the line , until even those in the rear have some glimmering of what 's about . Formerly , the advantages of education , including especially contact with leading spirits , were confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and the press , they are spread broadcast . The indications are that these increased advantages do not benefit men of the first ability so much as those of the second and lower grades . The result is , that the whole shape of the figure may be changed and it becomes " skew , " as the biometricians say : ? Thus , the mass is closer to the leaders and better able to understand the trend of progress and the reasons therefor . The " great men " no longer stand out so prominently , so totally apart from the rest of mankind ; but perhaps their influence is greater . Another and most potent cause of progress among the masses is of course the sense of direction already taken . If we have advanced so much toward certain ideals , we are the more ready to take additional steps , even without reference to those ahead . This , however , is true only when some advance has already been made , and is not a means of initiating reform . It also , unfortunately , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of leading a nation over the precipice , rather than to the summit of the mountain . It will be observed that I have made the last diagram kite-shaped and have spoken of it as " skew . " It could be made so , and often has in past times , by a process quite different from that just suggested , namely that of cutting off the heads of the more advanced . This would lead to a similar homogeneity , but without the factor of progress , or rather , with progress backwards . It will also be remarked that the tail behind does not necessarily result from the process of education ; that this process could affect the worst advantageously and , while the whole group would become more compact , it would not become skew . This is an exceedingly debatable point ; but I have ventured to assume , as indeed I believe , that the advantages of education would be felt most by the " average man , " and that the very poor minds would fail to be similarly affected , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would straggle even more than before , and we might have an increase of crime and lunacy , for the very reason that more persons were out of joint with the world . This would be a disadvantage , but certainly with this compensating advantage , that the worst minds would not have so much influence to the detriment of the mass . Finally , we have to ask , what are the real causes of progress after all ? If reformers cause reform , it is equally true that reform causes reformers . In other words , the existence of the leader is , biologically speaking , absolutely dependent on the mass behind .. He is but the nose on its face , as it were . Progress in human society may come about in two ways , which in actual fact will be combined . It may result from variation of the germ-plasm , that is to say , actual and fundamental change in the make-up of the individuals ; or it may result from acquired characteristics . That the germ-plasm varies , with resulting variations in the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this variation is the normal cause of change or progress . Among domesticated and cultivated forms , the selection of suitable variations has been most potent in transforming races , so that the cabbage and the turnip , for instance , have little resemblance to their wild ancestors . Ilas progress of this sort occurred within historic times in the human species ? It certainly has , in respect to certain diseases . owing to the elimination of the unfit . It has , also , as the result of the mingling of races ; the English nation is no doubt a conspicuous example of it . These , however , are secondary considerations , comparedi with the effects of the accumulation of ' social wisdom and the resulting possibilities in the way of education . It is impossible to say if , and how much , the average newborn child of America to-day is better than the new-born children who were its ancestors in the tents of the ancient Britons , the Gauls , or the Goths . One may suspect that the difference , after all , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very few . While so much has been done by selection to improve domesticated animals , the king of " tame creatures , " man , has been left to go his way unheeded . There has , no doubt , been a large amount of selection of a kind , ? that which takes place whenever man and woman wed , as the result of their own free choice , There is a preference for the fit , leaving the unfit often childless , and even coeducation may subserve good biological ends by bringing together the best intellects of the day . Yet all this is often erratic enough , owing to false social standards and poor ideals ; so we must welcome especially the better education of women , in the hope that they will raise the rougher sex by establishing new values . However , whatever may be said of the choice of the fit , there is little doubt that the most conspicuous and practicable advantages will result from the elimination of the unfit . This will be one of the great issues of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an axiom that insanity , imbecility , hereditary disease , and the like , shall not be increased by breeding . In that remarkable skit , Erewhon , it is related that the Erewhonians regarded disease as we regard moral faults , and persons showing signs of it were locked up , while those very severely affected were liable to be executed . We may never reach precisely the Erewhonian point of view , but with all kindness and compassion we shall find it necessary to see that those conspicuously defective , while having the best lives they are capable of without harm to society , do not continue their defects into the next generation . The slowness and difficulty of the alteration of our fundamental natures ? if such can be said to have taken place at all in recent times ? serve to emphasize the importance and value of acquired characteristics , ? in a broad sense , of education . Education , in the hands of man , aided by " social inheritance , " has made our modern civilization out of barbarism , and gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that it can do everything ; and no doubt it is so far from having reached the limit of its possibilities that we can not form any idea what those may be . Yet , there must be a limit somewhere , given mankind as it is to-day ; and the only way to get more tether will then be to improve the race itself . Already , it does not take sharp eyes to see clogs on the wheels of progress , and it will require the utmost wisdom at our command to prevent an ultimate stoppage or breakdown . In all this , much depends upon our ideals . It is difficult to explain why some of us look forward to endless progress and think of stable equilibrium as a catastrophe . It arises no doubt largely from the fact that progress is all we know ; still more from the psychological fact that all consciousness , all real life , as we understand it , is the accompaniment of change . It is curious to recall that the old idea that man was created once for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , was the fruit , not of idealism , but rather of the lack of it ; and the picture reminds us altogether too much of the happy condition of the oyster to-day . And is not the oyster happy ? Satisfied , practically the same from cretaceous times , it lets the tide of progress flow on , while it is founded on a rock . It is a success , from one point of view , but that is not ours . In our complicated modern society no citizen , however active , can guard all his interests , much less those of his children and fellows . As Professor Ross has recently well said , there is an ever shifting but wide margin of opportunity in which the criminaloid disports himself , and it is not for the common man to catch up with him . It becomes increasingly necessary to delegate numerous duties to special individuals , and nobody knows this better than the biologist . It may be true that the law gives John Smith power to prosecute the man who puts formalin in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovers it . He can no more keep a private scientific library and laboratory for the purpose of detecting all infringements upon the integrity of the things he buys than he can keep a private policeman to take care of the wandering burglar , or a private arsenal to warn off the belligerent foreigner . Even if he is well trained in science , he can not chase the criminaloid around every post ; he must delegate this work to others specially trained for its performance . The time will come , I have no doubt , when every county or municipality will employ a considerable staff of scientific men . Some will look after the food-supply , others will examine the water , others the clothing offered for sale , with particular regard to its origin and manufacture . There will be those who will make a study of the children and determine the conditions under which they should work in school ; others will investigate trades and manufactures and report anything detrimental to the workers . ' Phere will be statisticians and mists , students of production and distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human labor . All of these , at the same time , will endeavor to guard the public honor and it will not be tolerated that some are underpaid and overworked because of their necessity , others overpaid and underworked because of their positions of vantage . All this , I hope , will be done more locally than nationally ; partly because a national system is apt to become too inflexible , too little responsive to special needs , and partly because the average , as represented by the nation , will never be so good as some of the parts , and the more progressive and enlightened communities should be able to take full advantage of their good qualities . On the other hand , it will doubtless be considered justifiable for the nation or the state to step in and clean up localities which are especially backward or corrupt , regarding them as public nuisances . While all this is going on in every township , there will be other scientific men employed to work on the general problems which underlie all the practical applications just indicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations , others will be more brief or circumscribed ; but all will redound to the intellectual and material prosperity of , the people . Facilities for work of all kinds will be freely provided , and the rich man will be , not he who has most , but he who can use most , and to the best ends . The revivification of science will go hand in hand with the new birth of the arts . With leisure on the one hand and imagination on the other , men will come to a fresh appreciation of beauty ; new values will be created and human life immeasurably enriched . Envy , hatred , and malice will not be destroyed , but most of the wickedness of modern life will perish from lack of motive or opportunity . When or how this will all come about , we do not know ; say , if you please , that it is but a golden dream ; I reply that it is at least a dream worth dreaming .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
