txt The New Jersey State Board of Pardons is being subjected to a great deal of pressure in the case of Barney O'Neil , a young man now in the State Prison here . Powerful influence has been brought to bear to bring about his release , but great pressure has also been used to keep him a prisoner . The Judge who sentenced him , the jurymen who pronounced him guilty , politicians , two Bishops , and clergymen have tried to secure his release , but influence once exerted in his behalf hits been withdrawn upon pressure by others , and the man is not even allowed the benefits of the State 's parole law . Letters which have ' now become public show that this pressure is great enough to make a United States Senator and also the Governor of . .. a State change their minds after once strongly requesting New Jersey 's Executive to set the man at liberty . A physician whose patient the prisoner was at the time the crime of which he was convicted was committed says the man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time making : an absolute impossibility . The doctor denounces the trial as a " diabolical farce . " Other papers in the case have also become public . The foreman of the jury , in a letter on file with the Clerk of the Court of Pardons , admits there was prejudice against the prisoner and admits convicting the man because the jury was divided and out a long time . Bernard O'Neil , better known as " Barney , " was a driver for the StandardaCab Company of Philadelphia . One night early in the Summer of 1895 he was set upon by two men who had a grudge against him , in a resort in Philadelphia , and was so badly beaten with an iron bar that he lay for days unconscious while a Magistrate was always within call to take his ante-mortem statement . O'Neil had three broken ribs and one of his arms was bandaged to his side so that the ribs might knit . While O'Neil was in this condition , according to his physician , on the night of Aug. 13 , 1895 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother , Isaac R. Davis , were assaulted with considerable violence , the assailant showing great strength . For this assault O'Neil was convicted and is now in the State Prison . That this was the condition of O'Neil is set forth in the statement of the physician , Dr. E. H. ' Bell of 739 Spruce Street , Philadelphia . O'Neil was under his care during the months of June and July , 1895 . On the day before the crime was committed , r says , ' O'Neil was in his office " in a feeble and weak state , " and he advised him to go to Atlantic City . Ile was much surprised wheitlie read that 0 ' 14611 had been arrested for a crime committed in Atlantic City on the night following his visit to his office . In his statement Dr. Bell says : " I am satisfied that O'Neil was physically unable thirty-six hours after ' leaving ' my , office to commit ' the crime he ' Was tried and convicted for . He simply did not have the strength in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret to say that it was the most diabolical farce I ever witnessed . " JUDGE AND JURY PLEAD FOR HIM . Judge Joseph Thompson , who presided at the trial and sentenced O'Neil to eighteen years in the State Prison for ' assault and battery with intent to kill , wrote to the Rev. A. M. Fish of the State Prison on Dec. 18 , 1897 , that he had never been satisfied that O'Neil was guilty , but that " there was nothing else I could do but to inflict a heavy sentence as he had been convicted by the jury . " The Judge hoped the mistake he believed to have been made would be rectified . The foreman of the jury which convicted O'Neil wrote to Gov . Foster M. Voorhees on May 12 , 1898 , as follows : As foreman of the jury in Atlantic County which convicted the prisoner , Barney O'Neil , I desire to say that I was one of the jurymen who voted and held out until midnight for his acquittal , never being satisfied that the evidence produced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I consented to a verdict of guilty , and as time and further knowledge of the matter lead me to believe that a grave mistake has been made and that there was entirely too much prejudice against the prisoner to gain a fair and impartial trial , I write you this , in the interest of justice and humanity , and further desire to correct any error that I may have made . E. A. WILSON. ? The jury was out nineteen hours . Mr. Wilson united with nine others of that jury in a petition to the Court of Pardons for the release of O'Neil . Bishops and Scarborough , after inquiring into the case , wrote to Gov . Voorhees urging the pardon of O'Neil on the ground that he was innocent of the crime . Priests and ministers , public officials in Atlantic County , where O'Neil was convicted , and in Philadelphia . including the Chief of Police and several lieutenants , wrote to the same effect . J. E. P. Abbott , the present Prosecutor of the Pleas in Atlantic County . wrote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony , and despite the identification by the prosecuting witness . the evidence pointed so strongly to O'Neil being somewhere else at the time that he had always entertained grave doubts of the guilt of the man convicted . S. E. Johnson . who was Sheriff of Atlantic County at the time of the trial of O'Neil , wrote : I was Sheriff of Atlantic County when Barney O'Neil was arrested ; also , heard all the facts of his trial , - and also believe him to be an innocent man . The movement for O'Neil 's release , either on pardon or parole , began more than three years ago , but has never been acted upon . During his five years in prison he has not had one bad mark against his name . He is the prison 's librarian . He was in prison once before in Erie County , N. Y. , for a short time . INFLUENCE FOR HIM WITHDRAWN . A year ago strong influences were brought to bear on behalf of O'Neil . United States Senator Boles Penrose of Pennsylvania wrote urging Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania , in October 1899 , wrote as follows : I understand that this defendant was convicted on circumstantial evidence and that the Judge was never quite satisfied of his guilt . There are quite a number of extenuating circumstances , and I do not hesitate to urge his claims upon you for Executive clemency . I shall be very glad , indeed , if you can pardon him . Shortly after this counter efforts began to keep O'Neil in prison . Charles Gibbons Davis , brother of the victims of the assault , wrote to Capt . John P. Green of Philadelphia on Dec. 15 , 1899 , alleging that Gov . Stone had been misinformed as to the facts in the case , and requesting as a personal favor that he protest against any consideration of O'Neil 's application for pardon . Capt . Green thereupon wrote as follows to United States Senator Sewell of New Jer-sey : No doubt you remember ' this case , and that Barney O'Neil is the scoundrel who nearly murdered our friend . Charles Davis 's sisterI trust you will say to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as pardoning this man . I am rather surprised that Gov . Stone and Attorney General Elken should have interfered in his behalf , but it certainly must have been - under some misapprehension . which I will try to correct . Gen. Seweil 's action on this letter is not disclosed . On Dec. 18 , 1899 , Senator Pen -- rose - wrote to Gov . Voorhees as follows : , I desire to call your attention to , the : fact that I have been . called upon by , Mr. . I. R. Davis , one - 0P : . - 111e. - VIctitna.of O'Neil's- assault , who has reauest  --  ** you that he la strongly opposed to the recommendation for clemency in this case . Two days later Senator Penrose telegraphed to Gov . Voorhees : On investigation of the case , I withdrew my recommendation in behalf of Executive clemency in the case of Barney O'Neil . Ten days later Gov . Stone wrote as follows : Further inquiry concerning Barney O'Neil leads me to the inclination that my letter recommending and requesting his pardon was written without correct knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to withdraw for the present my recommendation for his pardon . Senator Penrose wrote on Feb. 7 , 1900 , to J. D. Shick of Bordentown , N. J. , who had been working for O'Neil 's pardon , saying : I was compelled- to withdraw my recommendation for a pardon for O'Neil because I found I had stirred up quite a commotion among the friends of the prosecutor in the case . The prosecutor called to see me , and I received many letters of protest against O'Neil 's pardon , some of the persons being influential citizens of Philadelphia . I will advise your friends to try to appease the prosecutor in the case .
