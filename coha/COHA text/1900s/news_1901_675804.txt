txt The village and Miss Helen Miller Gould are arrayed on one side of a dispute , while John T. Barron , a well-known and wealthy broker of New York , is the opposing principal in a dispute over a roadway in the village , which , after some months of quiet argument , is about to be brought to a settlement . Miss Gould and the village maintain that the street in question is a public street , while Mr. Barron maintains the said street is private property . The street which may be a street or a private possession is known as Millbrook Avenue . It connects Meadow Street , in the settled part of the village , and White Plains Road . It forms a short cut by which Miss Gould 's employes come and go from their homes in the vilage . Mr. Barron lives on White Plains Road , and for 200 feet or so owns the land on both sides of the disputed strip . He claims that the deeds for his property show that the strip claimed to be a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right along that the strip has been used as a street since early in the seventies at least . Henry C. Griffin , a local lawyer , who was engaged to investigate the standing of the strip , says that ( finless Mr. Barron has a deed which is not on record he does not own the strip of land . The dispute was waged quietly for some time , but Mr. Barron to establish ownership and place ' Miss Gould , who desires that the street remain open , and the village , which sides with her , on the defensive , built a fence across the disputed property shutting off travel and forcing every one to take a roundabout way . Miss Gould ordered the Superintendent of her place to open the street , and Mr. Barron 's fence was hauled down and the sections piled up on his land . Having made an effort to establish his claim , Mr. Barron held that he was not obliged to maintain a fence if the village did not give him protection , and therefore he had a case at law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession . The dispute continued with unsatisfactory results to any one , so Mr. Barron made another effort to force the matter to a legal adjudication . He had his own envployes haul a quantity of big boulders to the street and barricade it with them . Miss ? Gould stood ready to have them removed for the village , but this time the Trustees directed the work done and the corporation employes rolled the boulders over onto Mr. Barron 's property , where they now rest . 1 The street is once more passable . It is now rumored that Mr. Barron will next build a stone wall of cemented bouldera across the street at both ends of the strip . The Villages Trustees last night took the matter up , and it now looks as if the dispute would be pushed to a conclusion . The temper of the Trustees seems to be to stand by Miss Gould in her fight to have the street kept open . As a prelitninary to anything dentine , the board directed Francis J.
