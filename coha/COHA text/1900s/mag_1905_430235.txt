 |p751  EVEN at the present day we are still in the habit of talking of the five continents , as if no other could be supposed to exist on the globe . A dim notion has , it is true , been entertained for some considerable time past that there might be in the remote south a body of land which , by reason of its vast dimensions , would deserve the name of continent ; it has , however , been reserved for the exploratory enterprise of the past few years only to lift a small corner of that veil of mystery that still enshrouds the southernmost portion of the globe , and to introduce to the sum of our knowledge an area of the earth 's surface which , for all who desire to know whatever is to he learned about the earth on which we live , must be of absorbing interest , not only from its vastness , but , much more , on account of the peculiarities which mark it as wholly distinct from the other continents with which we have long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course when serious attention began to be paid to the grand problem of the exploration of the South Polar Regions . The extent of total area to be investigated was too vast for the efforts of one country or of one expedition to be adequate . Our generation has , moreover , learned the value of earnest co-operation in pursuit of great ends , so that when three European countries , Eng - land , Germany and Sweden , each equipped and dispatched in 1901 an expedition to explore the Antarctic continent , there was no rivalry between them , no jealous desire to get furthest south toward the Pole . An amicable arrangement was made whereby the field of operations was parceled out between the three expeditions , and it was clear from the start that each one had a sphere of action which would present features of  |p752  special interest , and also points of special difficulty to be coped with and overcome . The objective common to all three was , in noble emulation , to put forth unsparingly every effort to bring back home the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Swedish expedition under my leadership set forth on board the " Antarctic , " a boat built specially for polar navigation . The destination assigned to us was the region south of South America and the Atlantic Ocean . From a scientific point of view , this was , perhaps , the most interesting section of the three , not least from the circumstance that it lies nearest to , and by its nature exercises the greatest influence upon , that part of the globe which we inhabit . At the same time there was reason to entertain an apprehension that we were destined to experience greater difficulties from the accumulations of ice in the waters we had to navigate than would fall to the lot of either of the other expeditions , and that proved only too truly to be the case , as we have every cause to remember . Hardly ever , surely , has a scientific expedition gone through stranger vicissitudes than ours . Tho we were the last of the trio to get under weigh , we had the advantage of the other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; consequently we found ourselves already in sight of the far South Polar Lands by January loth , 1902 . The arrival within the region of our quest was the signal for strenuous work to commence , and during the very first few days we were rewarded with a number of most interesting finds and discoveries . We could not , however , afford to tarry , but hastened to arrive at our real destination , where the chief part of our work was to be carried on , a point on the eastern coast of the land region . January 15th was a day of mark in the history of the expedition , for early on the morning of that clay we sailed into the Antarctic Ocean proper , through a broad strait , which , if ever those waters come to be regularly traversed by trading craft , will certainly be one of the most important and frequented fair ways of the whole region . To that strait I gave the name The Antarctic Sound , in memory of our gallant and devoted ship , the " Antarctic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some few miles to the south . On the western shore of this strait I observed a small bay , which , together with its remarkable surroundings , aroused my earnest attention . I saw before me mountain peaks soaring loftily above a sheet of what evidently was perpetual ice , while between the hights extended a defile whose content consisted of a superb glacier of a typical configuration such as is rarely to be seen . Along by the shore there stretched an extensive plain , bare of snow , and eminently adapted as a locality upon which to establish a wintering station . As we passed I was at pains to notify on the map the spot , registering it by the name of Depot Valley , for it seemed possible that we  |p753  might be glad subsequently to deposit stores there and use it as a refuge in case of need from our work in the south . Thence we proceeded eastward , skirting the south coast of Dundee Island . On our way there rose up far away in front of us from out of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now extinct , volcano . It was the small island known as Paulet Island , and that was our immediate destination . On reaching it we went ashore , and beheld the most thickly inhabited spot which it was my privilege to see in the whole of the Antarctic region . So far as the eye could see in every direction the ground , as it sloped down to the water 's edge , was densely covered with penguins , those strange birds which are incapable of flying , but can swim like fish , and which when on shore strut about with upright gait , looking , with their diminutive , arm-like stumps of wings and their irresistibly comic appearance in general for all the world like small-sized , crippled people . In all there must have been hundreds of thousands of them in view . At that time they had the young birds to look after , and they showed only too plainly in numerous ways how little they appreciated the intrusion of strange visitors . We on our part , tho we gazed upon them . with wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were only too pleased to withdraw from the busy throng that we might escape as speedily as possible from the far from agreeable sounds and scents by which we were assailed while we stayed in their vicinity . The same evening we continued our course , our objective now being Seymour Island . That island is about 30 square miles in area , and is , perhaps , the largest piece of land in the Antarctic continent that is free from snow . For me it had a special interest as being the only locality in the South Polar Regions where any trace , however slight , of fossil remains had up to that time been found . Little could I guess at that juncture what a momentous part the three places just named were destined to play in the subsequent fortunes of our research party . The present paper does not profess to give any description in detail of the scientific investigations upon which we were engaged or of the results to which they  |p754  lead . It will , therefore , suffice to say , that during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and wide , without , however , being able to discover any spot further south that seemed suitable for winter quarters , and hence , in the middle of February , I was fain to determine to return to Snow Hill Island , which is situated directly south of Seymour Island , at a latitude of 64% ? south , where we landed such material and stores as were requisite for the purposes of a winter sojourn . That well accomplished , the hour speedily arrived when I found myself standing on the shore with five companions watching the gradually fading hull of the " Antarctic " as she battled with the blocks of ice that impeded her progress on her voyage northward once more . We had before us , as we then imagined , one year of solitude , but also of abundant and enthralling work . We had no means of conjecturing the surprises that were in store for us , that we should be detained in our improvised home twice the span we were reckoning upon , and that the good ship we had just seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling and observatories we set about the tasks before us . During the following twenty months we took observations , for the most part once every hour both day and night , relative to climate and to the other phenomena that came within our purview , and the data of a specially interesting kind , from a scientific point of view , which we were able to register proved to be very numerous . Thus , marvelous fossils were found , relics of a period when these regions , which can not at the present time boast of a single blade of grass , and scarcely of the most insignificant tuft of moss , were verdant with the most luxuriant woods . Then , again , the meteorological record we kept affords items of information of great general interest , being readily comparable to the figures for places with which we are already familiar . Our station was not more than 500 miles from Tierra del Fuego , where evergreen woods abound . It was , therefore , a priori to be imagined that the winter weather we were likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction were doomed to be grievously disappointed , for we were subjected to a series of very disagreeable , albeit scientifically important , surprises . It was not actually the severity of the cold , tho the thermometer went down to - 43 F. , of which we had cause to complain so much as the violent and terrible storms that visited us . They would rage for weeks at a time with such fury that it was an impossibility to stand upright in the open ; moreover , these storms were accompanied by the intensest cold of any which we experienced . I am unable to recall that in any of the literature of the Polar Regions mention is made of any climatic conditions which would seem so entirely to preclude all thought of human beings ever being able permanently to support existence under them as did these of which I am speaking . In order to investigate the natural features of our immediate surroundings we made a number of short excursions , and when spring came round I set out , accompanied by two of my companions and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . In thirty-four days we covered upward of 400 miles , and should have been able to get much further had we not got in for a very severe storm period , which necessitated our return , and which lasted all the time we were on our way back . At one time we were constrained to remain for five whole days and nights ensconced in our sleeping-bags , while on another occasion the wind played such havoc with our tent that we were in imminent peril of losing our lives . Nevertheless , we succeeded in making several interesting and unexpected discoveries . The period of the year had now arrived when the temperature ranged highest , the summer so-called . What we were treated to was snow and mist and a climate more rigorous than the normal winter of southern Sweden , and also than that summer which the Nansen expedition spent drifting amid the pack-ice in the vicinity of the North Pole . The inquiring and searching lookout , which we kept from the loftiest point in our neighborhood , for the vessel which we were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel in the sheet of ice through which she might find her way to our relief , proved all in vain . By degrees  |p755  the truth became patent to us that we were doomed to spend another winter in our then quarters . Under those circumstances it behoved us to busy ourselves about securing some seals , that we might be provided with blubber for fuel , and about laying in a stock of penguins and sea-birds to serve as food during the long months before us . The winter came and went , bringing fresh storms in its train , tho luckily not such violent ones as its predecessor . We The Winter Station at Snow Bill were by no means at a loss for employment , yet all our scientific work , ingrossing as it was in itself , did not entirely suffice to set at rest our feelings of uneasiness and anxiety as we meditated upon the future and wondered as to the fates that had befallen the rest of our expedition and the vessel upon which they were embarked . By this time we have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter and after having dispatched , as good luck would have it , all our valuable collections to Europe , the " Antarctic " had turned south once more , in November , 1902 . She had not proceeded far , however , on her course before it became evident that the season was going to prove an exceptionally unfavorable number , under the leadership of Dr. J. G. Andersson , should leave the ship and attempt to establish communication with us by proceeding in sledges over the ice , while the vessel itself , under command of her master , Captain Larsen , should be steered , as best she might , through the impeding masses and fields of ice , if perchance a channel could be forced , to enable her to accomplish the desired end and bring us succor. one as regards the state of the ice . The attempt to penetrate as far as our station had to be postponed , and in lieu thereof interesting scientific studies were taken in hand . The summer began , however , to slip away , and it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fate at our wintering station , the most active measures must be resorted to . It was thought advisable to make a division of the party in such a way that three out of the total Neither of the two schemes thus determined upon proved capable of realization . The " Antarctic " availed herself of every opportunity that presented itself to make some advance ; wherever any open water appeared , there she endeavored to find a way through . All she succeeded in doing , however , was to get  |p756  hopelessly wedged in the ice at a point from which there was no retreat and from which nothing was observable but one vast area of drift-ice and icebergs . When she thus lay a complete prisoner and unable to do aught in her own defense a violent storm arose , which forced the ice landward . For some considerable time the vessel 's hull withstood the iron grip of the stern incoming ice . Inch by inch she was raised out of the water , until the process could go on no longer , for she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most vulnerable point , the keel . It was smashed off , the bottom timbers were staved in and the stern-post was crushed to pieces ? in a worcl , the trusty steamer had become a wreck . For more than a whole month after that event all hands on board put forth superhuman efforts to keep afloat this cherished vessel , wherein lay our sole means of returning home , and which , moreover , was the storehouse of our collections and provisions , which we could so ill afford to lose . All was , however , in vain , for on February 12th , 1903 , those on board were obliged to leave the ship , and in short space beheld , as they stood on an ice-floe in melancholy silence , how she gradually sank beneath the surface until the very top of the mast , where the Swedish colors still flew , vanished evermore from sight . What they now had to do was to endeavor to reach the nearest land as best they could , taking with them such things as they had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulet Island . known as the resort of numbers of penguins and seals . The task of getting there , however , proved a very formidable one indeed ; sixteen days and nights were spent on the journey , the mode of progression being by boats , which were dragged for the most part over the rough ice , while the drifting seaward of the ice-floes they were on often carried them farther away from their goal in a day than they were able to advance by their own efforts . By the time they finally found themselves safely landed on shore a very considerable part of the goods rescued from the ship had had to be abandoned or had got lost on the ice . The penguins of Paulet Island were regarded in quite a different light now by the twenty shipwrecked men who had landed there , bringing with them food which would last them barely one month . Had it not been , indeed , for the penguins their lives must have been lost from hunger in a very short space of time . As these birds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a natural enemy , no great amount of skill or ingenuity is required for possessing one 's self of them and killing them . Some 4,000 sufficed amply to feed the party throughout the winter . Boiled penguin and penguin soup , flavored with some pieces of seal blubber , and with seawater to supply the needful saltness , constituted the standing menu . Nor could  |p757  any complaint be reasonably lodged against that diet , save that there was not always as much of it as was desired . What there was the greatest shortage of was fuel , and in order to husband the blubber to serve in that capacity restrictions were placed upon its use for food ; consequently on some days only one meal was served . The house they erected for their abode during the winter had double stone walls , with a packing of penguin guano between ; the roof was of sealskin . By great good luck there happened to be among the things saved from the ship a couple of portraits , framed with glass , still intact . Out of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so to secure the admission at any rate of some light in the daytime . The space within the house was very limited for as many as twenty persons , and they had to spend eight long weary months of winter packed together along the walls in anything but comfortable fashion . What they had to endure was of a certainty more trying than the somewhat similar experience of the North Polar expedition , for the Antarctic climate is much worse by reason of the terrible storms , which render it practically impossible to stir out of doors during quite half the winter . While they are raging the only expedient is to huddle one 's self together in one 's bed-bag and adopt every means for keeping the cold out that one can devise . Unfortunately there was one member of the party , one of the ship 's hands , who was not able to withstand the hardship of the life they had to lead ; he succumbed to disease quite early on in the winter . The others , howeved , fared much better and kept so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get vigorously to work on devising means for their own safety and upon prosecuting scientific work . The lot that fell to the other three , who had started forth to try and reach us at Snow Hill by sledges overland , was in no sense preferable or less grievous to endure . As the ice was covered with a layer of water , and as open channels occurred here and there in their path , they found it an impossibility to make any headway and had finally to determine to return to the spot where they went ashore , and where they had deposited such stores as they had with them from the ship . That spot was no other than the one we had sighted on our first arrival , to which I had given the name of Depot Valley . At a distance the place had seemed inviting , and on a closer acquaintance it proved indeed to be so , for there were discovered a large quantity of penguins there , almost as many as on Paulet Island , and to their pres- ence the three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set about working , taking observations , etc. , in the confident hope that the " Antarctic " would heave in sight before very long . As time passed , however , and each day grew perceptibly shorter than its predecessor , evil forebodings began to assert themselves , and lucky for them it was , that , acting upon their fears , they commenced to build a shelter for the eventuality of their being obliged to remain over winter there , while yet the ground was comparatively soft . It must be borne in mind that these three men were unprovided with tools , clothes or stores in sufficient quantity to enable them to face a winter sojourn . As it turned out , they were reduced to spending the dreary winter months in a stone hut they managed to improvise , which the snow for several days had so obliterated that the penguins unconcernedly used to pace over it quite unaware of its presence , while the inhabitants lay weather-bound within . Under such depressing conditions , with no form of diversion and not a line of print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Whenever the weather allowed of it they went out to fish and hunt , and they never lost sight of the scientific work for the prosecution of which we had come . When we were reunited once more this party of three had numbers of very remarkable proofs to show of the fertility of ingenuity which so often has stood men in good stead in the hour of need . Tho it is evident that the larger party at Paulet Island station were better off in many particulars , yet the others at Depot Valley had one advantage in that they never ran short of food . They had laid in a sufficiently large supply of penguins , and tho the seals they procured were not very numerous , yet they lasted them for fuel through the winter . In spite of all their difficulties and hardships they never lost heart , and so the bay on the shores of which they perforce tarried so long now fittingly bears the name of the Bay of Good Hope . It is strange to contemplate how near the three sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far off , through that memorable winter . Whenever the weather was clear enough to admit of our doing so we would ascend the hights at Snow Hill and gaze longingly northward . In the far distance could be discerned both Paulet Island and the hills above the Bay of Good Hope . Our thoughts were often with our good ship and her complement ; often and often we wondered what Larsen and Andersson and all the rest were doing and what had become of them , but it never entered our heads that they were actually within sight , tho cut off from all means of communicating with us . Had we only known of their whereabouts it would have been comparatively easy for us , with our dogs and other equipment , to have got to them . Strange tho that state of things was , the mode of our ultimate reunion was yet stranger . For over a week I had been away on a sledging expedition and had reached an unfamiliar archipelago , the islands and straits of which I was busy studying and mapping out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the consciousness that one is in the presence of scenery never yet looked upon by mortal eye . The date was October the 12th , and as yet it was too early to hope for the arrival of any vessel from the outer world to our relief . All of a sudden I became aware of some black objects in the distance , which revealed themselves through my field-glasses as human beings . How can I describe my feelings on making that discovery ? Or how shall I depict my almost greater astonishment at the picture they presented , these black-looking , unrecognizable objects , when I obtained a closer view of them ? In appearance they were more forbidding in uncouthness than the Esquimaus of Greenland . Not , indeed , until they had told me who they were could I realize that they were , in very truth , my own comrades , and it was a long while still before I was able to grasp the details of the marvelous tale they had to tell . We were still , all of us , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but we had no reason , as far as we knew , to despair of her return . The weeks that followed were busily employed in work . for we were confidently expecting that  |p759  our time there was drawing to a close . One evening , on the 8th of November , as I was sitting indoors , some one came rushing in with the news that there were some strangers visible , approaching across the ice . Great was the rejoicing ? they could , we thought , be none other than our comrades from the ship . Not until the strangers had reached us and introduced themselves as two naval officers from Argentina , and told us that no news was at hand as to the fate of the " Antarctic , " did our high spirits desert us , but then to give place to the utmost despair . Were we then never to see our brave comrades again ? Most miraculous coincidence ! While we were thus cast down and in dread for the safety of our comrades there were some of their number at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced packing up some of our possessions , now that rescue had reached us , when , in the dusk of that summer night , whom should we see ' appear but Captain Larsen himself with five of the others mounting the rising ground up to our house . Here they were , arrived , after untold difficulties , just at the right moment to participate in the glad event of relief having come . Tho the story they told us aroused feelings of sympathy and sorrow , yet the joy we naturally felt at being restored to each other and at the prospect before us of being able now to return home at last was stronger upon us , and we could not but consider that the results we had secured , more valuable from the very fact of our being stationed apart from each other and from the protractedness of our stay , most outweigh the losses we had sustained . It will be some years before the results obtained can be made public . The Swedish Government has allotted a sum of money for the work preparatory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition is to appear very shortly . Hence those points are not touched upon here . In conclusion it may , however , be stated that our knowledge of the South Polar Continent has been materially modified by the results of the expeditions which have now returned . We now form a picture of it , that land of the terrible forces of nature , as a region tinder a mantle of perpetual ice , possessed of a wondrous , antediluvian fauna , with a summer of short duration and colder than our winter , and with those continual storms lasting through the long months of winter there . Not an attractive picture , certainly , and yet how much there is to be learned from a study of those remote and uninviting lands . We are able as yet only dimly to conjecture the importance that these researches really possess . It can not be doubted that the nature of the South Polar Lands makes its influence perceptible all the world over .                 @ @ @ @
