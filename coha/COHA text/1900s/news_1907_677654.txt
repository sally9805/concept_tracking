txt The failure of the country to respond to the Presidential candidacy of Senator Knox has proved a serious disappointment to the anti-Roosevelt politicians . Not an echo has been heard front the West , and the Eastern newspapers apparently have not regarded the Knox boom more seriously than if any other State in the Union had sougnt to compliment its Senator . It was broadly intimated in Washington before the Pennsylvania Convention formally launched the Knox candidacy that the New England States would all fall in line . In absence of an understanding in New York as to the candidacy of Hughes , the Empire State was.also counted for the Pennsylvania candidate . It possibly is true that many of the New England leadets who hold-Congressional seats are favorably inclined to Knox . the rank and file of the New England voters are with Roosevelt , and so far as they have indicated any choice for the Republican nomination other than Roosevelt it has been for Taft or Hughes .
