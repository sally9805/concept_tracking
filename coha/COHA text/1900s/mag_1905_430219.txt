 |p1237  IF it be true , as recently stated by a competent authority , that upward of ten thousand books and papers have been written about fishing , it would seem that but little remained to be said . Our fishing to-day , however , is in many particulars diametrically opposite the angling familiar to the older living anglers . When we recall the many lakes and streams which we knew when they were full of fine bass and trout , and which were completely fished out , we cease to wonder at the demand of the anglers for a change which has come about . It seemed for a time that our fishing and our shooting were destined to come to a sudden ending . A few years ago we had no game laws . We now have many , some of which are past the comprehension of the average layman . A glance at the laws indicates that the season for taking the game fishes has been much shortened in most of the Northern States , and fishing is now distinctly a summer sport . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late spring or early summer and ends on or before the coming of cold weather . In most of the Southern States , however , there are no fish laws and one may fish the whole year through . In addition to shortening the season and protecting the fish during the spawning season and in winter , nearly all of the States which have fish laws limit the number of fish or pounds of fish per diem . In Nebraska and North Dakota , for example , the catch limit is 25 fish per diem . In Iowa the catch limit is 40 ; in Michigan , 5o ; in Oregon , 125 . In Colorado the limit is 25 pounds of trout and 50 pounds of other fish per diem . In New Hampshire the limit is only ro pounds . In New York and Indiana the solitary fisherman has an advantage , since in the former State he may take 24 bass in a day , while two in the same boat may take only 36 . A similar law in Indiana permits the " lone fisherman " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat may take only 30 . Many States now have sweeping provisions prohibiting the taking of fish in any way except by angling , which is defined to be fishing with rod and line with one , or possibly two or three , hooks . The laws also limit the size of the fish to be taken , and the angler is usually required to return all undersized fish at once to the water with the least possible injury . It would seem necessary nowadays to fish with a footrule at hand , in order to measure all doubtful fishes . Such laws appeal to the conscience , like many laws regulating our shooting , and their execution is often defeated by the elastic conscience of the angler . In many States it is now unlawful to fish in the night season , to take fish in nets or on " trot lines , " or " snag hooks " stretched on lines across the lakes or rivers , to poison or dynamite the streams , to fish through the ice , to take fish near a dam and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish therein at one full swoop when stranded on the bottom . The true angler , however , has little fault to find with the laws regulating his sport . He has been the originator and promoter of many of them . There is a growing sentiment in favor of a small catch , the returning of the little fish to the waters , and against the many outrageous methods of capture which came near to ending the game . The writer recalls an invitation to go fishing in Kentucky , when the performance consisted in following by boat a long line stretched across a river , upon which were suspended innumerable baited hooks . The line had been set at night and a great number of fish of many kinds were found suspended by the many hooks . Upon another occasion ,  |p1238  when angling properly for bass upon a little stream in Indiana and just at a time when the sport was most lively and every rod in the party was busy , a crowd of men came down the stream , entered our pool with a net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all the fish of every size and description and walked off with the best of them , leaving the others to rot upon the bank . There was nothing to be said . Their rights were equal to ours , and as to might making right , their party was the stronger . It was not unusual for the farmers as well as the people of the towns to own large nets and use them on the small streams and lakes . The use of dynamite and poison and the draining of the-ponds and streams were , of course , immensely destructive , and the wonder is that a fish remains . It would be idle to catalog the laws regulating fishing , if space permitted , since our laws are made , amended and repealed with such rapidity that the catalog would be out of date before it was fairly finished . But a glance at the recent legislation indicates that the average bass must not be smaller than 8 inches and the average trout not smaller than six . The number of fish varies greatly , from 125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer number elsewhere . Autho one would hardly expect to find much that is entertaining or amusing in the reading of dry statutes I have been both entertained and amused at the evident compromises which indicate the attentive ear of the legislator when listening to the voice of his constituency . In Vermont , for example , it is illegal to fish through the ice for trout , but not more than fifteen tended lines may be used through the ice for bass . In the same State , while a general slaughter of fish with the shotgun is prohibited , there is an exception in favor of shooting pickerel , with a gun held at the shoulder . Heavy artillery seems to have been driven off of all angling waters . In Maine one may use five lines through the ice . In the Iowa law we find a provision that owners may take fish " as they see fit . " Here we have a direct legislative  |p1239  acknowledgment of the importance of game preserving and a discrimination in favor of the rich which will , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise in the law prohibiting fishing unless by hook and line . " Any person , " so the statute reads , " may , between the 15th day of May and the 15th day of November , use not more than one trot line , in streams only , and extending not more than half way across . " It would seem necessary to have a wicked partner to complete the deviltry . Those interested in fish preservation may take some solace in the thought that a snag or anchor is not always handy in mid stream . In Iowa fishing through the ice is lawful , but the fisherman shall not have while so engaged , " any house , shed or other protection against the weather , or have or use any stove or other means for creating artificial heat . " You may fish , men of Iowa , but you must shiver ! This , no doubt , seems too bad just now that small oil stoves are so portable and so cheap . This provision against shelter and heat brought to mind a living picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each seated behind a comfortable screen or wind-break , and beside a small fire which burned brightly on the crystal surface of the lake . But North Dakota has now abolished this form of angling altogether . In some States which prohibit night fishing we find provisions extending the time until an early bed-going hour and permitting a start an hour or more before sunrise . In Colorado the fishing ends at 8 p.m . Here we note also an important law , which provides that the public shall have the right to fish in any stream stocked at public expense , subject to actions in trespass for any damage done property along the bank . There were loud objections in several States not long ago to the preservers getting most of the State fish for the exclusive use of clubmen . The laws were at the outset but little observed . So long as the sale and export of the game fish were legal the temptation to evade the laws remained . Laws putting an end to the sale of game fish have everywhere put an end to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except from the operation of the laws against the selling of fish , all fish caught on private preserves or brought in from other States . Such exceptions , of course , destroy the efficacy of the laws , for who can tell where a fish was caught ? The export laws are numerous and  |p1240  varied . Some provide that the legitimate sportsman , who has taken his fish by fair angling with rod , line and single hook , may take a few fish home even if he lives beyond the confines of the State ; in some States he must attach a tag to his small bunch , bearing his name and address , and carry his fish openly , so that all may see how many he has and who it is that has caught the fish and from whence he came . In other States a limited number of fish may be sent home by express , with a tag stating the contents of the package and other particulars as to person , place , etc . In many States the non-resident angler is not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish guarded for those at home . In the matter of license the non-resident angler has the advantage of the shooter . In most of the States a substantial sum is now exacted from the latter for the privilege of shooting , but the modern angler may fish without payment in all of the States but one or two . It has been the writer 's good fortune to see much fishing at its best , altho often carried away from it by the whir of the grouse , the whistle of the woodcock and by the tracks of deer and elk and bear , " when the United States was a free country , " as one complainant put it in writing to a magazine , complaining about modern game laws and game preserves . The change from old fishing conditions to the new has been rapid and startling . Streams where a few years ago we used an oatsack for a creel and took enough trout before breakfast to supply the open air appetites of our military escort , privates as well as officers , have been fished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at will at any season and take quantities of fine fish are now not worth a visit , or are owned by clubs or individuals who warn the public away with the untruthful statement on many signs that there is " no fishing here . " Fish there are in abundance in such places , but they are for the few . Much of our best fishing , like much of our best shooting , is found to-day on the preserves , where the supply is annually kept up . In one instance which I recall the ponds and streams were filled so full of overfed fish that a distemper appeared and a great loss followed . One need go no further than the north roads on Long Island to learn how much of the good fishing is now closed to the general public . The public has felt the restraint , and a few homicides are charged to the laws against trespassing on the preserve . While Iowa , as we have observed , seems to openly favor the rich , who may take fish " as they see fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any preserve at will which contains a stream or lake stocked by the State . In one of the States , I forget now which , all ponds containing more than a few acres are declared to be public waters . There are many other changes than these enumerated which have taken place in many parts of the country . The writer fancies he sees a change in the appearance of the modern angler . Certain it is that there is often a trace of golf in the costume of those who fish in pleasant places strictly in accordance with many rules of conduct , self-imposed and in advance of the statutes made to govern fishing . While the brooks murmur and placid lakes reflect the image of the sky and forests the sport of angling will endure . " Men may come , " different in many ways from those depicted as good fishermen in Walton 's time , and " men may go , " but the sport , like the brook , goes on forever .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
