txt The Court of Appeals handed down a decision yesterday which may result in the saving of $7,000,000 to the taxpayers of the City of New . York . A litigation nearly as long as the famous Dickens case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been partly decided . The final determination of the court of last resort in the State of New York is that the then Corporation Counsel , Francis M. Scott , had This judgment was confessed on the last day Corporation Counsel Scott held that office . He has since been elevated to the Supreme Court bench . The Supreme Court Judges in New York City decided that Corporation Counsel Scott had the right to saddle $700,000 on the taxpayers , as he was the lawyer for the city . When Controller Coler took office his first fight was against the confession of judgments by Corporation Counsel Whalen of certain claims against the city . Then the claims of O'Brien &; Clark and Howard &; Brown for $700,000 were presented to Controller Coler for payment , and Controller Color at once decided that the confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , and he refused to pay the awards . Corporation Counsel Whalen , who was then in a bitter fight with Controller Coler over his right to confess judgments , held that his predecessor had that right . Then came the legal battle which ended yesterday . Controller ' Coler declined to pay the awards of $700,000 to O'Brien &; Clark and other contractors , and told them to seek whatever legal redress they desired . The result was that a peremptory writ of mandamus was served on Controller Coler on Dec. 2 , 1899 , signed by Jus  --  lee Truax . Controller Coler procured Irving T : Bush of Brooklyn to bring a cult restraining him from paying the aqueduct claims , and to set aside the judgments obtained against the city by . O'Brien . &; Clark for $700.000 . The restraining order was ' signed by a Justice of the Supreme Court in Brooklyn . The case was transferred to New York by Justice Dickey . Corporation Counsel Whalen abandoned all attempts to save the city from being mulcted for the Croton Aqueduct awards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers . paid their fees , and took up the fight . The result is that the decision of the Appellate Division of New York has been reversed , and Controller Coler and his lawyers , Kellogg &; ' Beckwith , have been sustained in their legal contentions . Controller Coler had to pay the judgments of $700,000 or go to prison for contempt of court . The sum was paid under protds ? ?  - -  -  Now the-Court of Appeals holds that Controller Coler was right , and allows the City of New York to bring suit for the recovery of the $700 ; 000 wrongfully paid to the aqueduct contractors . THE AQUEDUCT CONTRACTS . The contracts entered into by the Aqueduct Commission were let by sections . The work was done and charges for alleged extra work outside of the specifications were piled up to the amount of $7 , - 000,000 . Suits were brought for this money . Controller Coler when fighting the claims said about this litigation : " I  --  am confirmed in the belief that these claims are unjust . The defeat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments confessed by a Corporation Counsel in the aqueduct claims should be a startling lesson to the taxpayers of New York . The city litigated these claims in the Court of Appeals five or six years ago , employing at large expense the most eminent lawyers in tile city , and succeeded in finally defeating them on their merits . After this decision Corporation Counsel Scott confessed judgment to the sum of $700,000 on the ground that by doing so the city avoided the possibility of having to pay a larger amount by the passage of relief bills by the Legislature . " In other words , the consideration of what would otherwise be a simple gift of the city 's money was fear of future legislation adverse to the interests of the City of New York . Such a power as this should not be allowed to rest in the hands of any one man . " If the Court of Appeals should finally decide that the Corporation Counsel possesses the power to confess judgments in unlimited amounts without the consent and against the protest of the Controller . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the courts , upon such flimsy pretexts as fear of what future Legislatures might enact , it is certainly time that such powers should be limited by an amendment to the charter . No single defect in the charter possesses such threatening possibilities as this . " After making this statement Controller Coler had his lawyers apply for an injunction before Justice Bookstaver restraining the payment of the $7001000 in judgments . Justice Bookstaver decided that no injunction should issue . An appeal was immediately taken to the Appellate Division , and a further motion was made for an order preventing the collection of the $700,000 in judgments until the case could be heard . Justice Truax denied this motion , and under threat of punishment for contempt of court the sum of $700,000 was paid over to the Aqueduct contractors by Controller Coler . The Appellate Division affirmed the decision of Justice Truax , but Justices and Patterson held that the majority were wrong in their decision , and handed down a dissenting opinion . CONTROLLER COLER SUSTAINED . Frederic R. Kellogg , on the direction of Controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attorneys who appeared for the Aqueduct contractors were Kellogg , Rose &; Smith . They contended that the Aqueduct contractors were entitled to the money on the confession of judgment by Corporation Counsel Scott . Frederic R. Kellogg held that the Aqueduct contractors were entitled to no sums of money , and that Corporation Counsel Scott had no authority to confess judgment for the city . The judgment handed down yesterday sustains in every particular the claims of Controller Coler and his lawyers . Frederic R. Kellogg , in a statement yesterday , said : " The decision establishes the contention of the Controller in his long controversy with Corporation Counsel Whalen , which resulted in the passage by the last Legislature of the Confessions of Judgment bill , prohibiting the Corporation Counsel from taking such action without the consent of the Controller . The effect of this decision is to , permit Ithe taxpayer , Irving T. Bush . who started the litigation , to prosecute the action for the purpose of recovering the money which the Controller was compelled to pay to the judgment creditors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to nearly $7,000,000 . O'Brien &; Clark , Brown &; Howard , John C. Rogers , and a dozen other contractors started the suits against the city . The work done by these contractors was certified to by the engineers , and by all the officials connected with the job . An exposure of the system , however , took place , and fights were begun against payment of the extra claims . On the last day of Mayor Strong 's administration Corporation Counsel Scott decided that it was better for the city to pay $700,000 as a settlement of the Aqueduct awards . The Court of Appeals had already decided that the Aqueduct contractors had no right to charge the city a dollar for the alleged extra . work . Corporation Counsel Scott had already been nominated and elected to the Supreme Court bench on the Tammany ticket , although he was the Republican Corporation Counsel under Mayor Strong . " Corporation Counsel Whalen said about the matter yesterday : " I have not seen the decision . The . Court of Appeals has decided ' that the Aqueduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counsel . This has been my idea from the start . A bill passed by the Legislature has effectively disposed of ' this matter so far as future actions are concerned . I believed all along that the Corporation . Counsel had no right to confess judgment in these matters . " Alfred C. Petty of . the firm of Kellogg , Rose &; Smith-said yesterday : " This is 4pparently  --  a knock-out blow , but we will now be able to go into the courts on the facts ' of the case . - Up to the present time the law points have been decided . The litigation has not been ended as yet . We can have the issue tried out in court , and we can bring in evidence to show that the work was done and that the contractors are entitled to the . money . "
