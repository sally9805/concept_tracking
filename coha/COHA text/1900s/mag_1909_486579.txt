CHA TEATJBRIAN D. Chateaubi land and His Court of Women . By Francis Gribble . With six photogravure portraits . New York- Chas . Scribner 's Sons $3.75 net . " There is no adequate life of Chateaubriand in any language , and there is no life at all in English , " writes Mr. Gribble in his preface . His conclusion is that the times are ripe for " a synoptic view . " It is , then , with the obvious purpose of supplying our lack in furnishing that " synoptic view " that Mr. Gribble offers us this book ; and the work is to be judged on higher ground than that suggested by the lure of its hero 's amorous passages . That higher ground proves over-slippery , even for Mr. Gribble 's nimble wit . His man was a greater one than he represents him ; but one may let that pass and proceed to specific issues . Much has been written about Chateaubriand , and Mr. Gribble has no doubt read a large part of those writings : what use has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subject 's American adventures , he has , seemingly , listened to the too skeptical Professor , Bedier of the " Etudes critiques .

Charlotte Ives is the type of unsophisticated maiden , or first love ( later she reappears as a widow with three sons ) ; there is the consumptive Pauline de Beaumont , forgotten for Delphine de Custine , " Queen of Roses " ; and Natalie de Noailles-Mouchy , the Duchesse de Duras , Madame de C the Marquise de V ? , have each her chapter , and her photogravure . As for Hortense Allart de Meritens , to say that she was a Roussellian blue-stocking is sufficiently to condemn her . Mr. Gribble makes no effort to lend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recamier . He is an Englishman , and there is , perhaps , not a line in his book to shock the squeamish ; and yet his very punctuation has a sinister squint ; his . . . are prurient , and his dashes pander . There is , in all this , something of the naughtiness of a Sterne without the allurement . One can not accuse Mr. Gribble of wanting a certain sprightliness . What one must not , expect of him is valuable literary criticism of Chateaubriand , or even an informing account of Chateaubri and 's journalism and political course . This is neither the " synoptic " nor , the " ultimate " biography . Early Church History to A. D. 313 . By Henry Melvill Gwatkin , Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge . Two volumes . New York : The Macmillan Co. $5.25 net . " The history of the Church of God is in its widest compass co-extensive with the history of the universe itself . " This is an extraordinary sentence with which to begin a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scientific character of the work . A little farther on the author continues : If then the Gospel is a revelation of the eternal through facts of time , it can not be treated simply as one religion among others . Given the revelation of God , comparative religion may help to show us how the forces of human nature clothed it with religions of men ; but the application of comparative religion to the revelation itself is a fundamental error . We therefore start from the position that church history is simply the spiritual side of universal history , just as economic history is its economic side . ? cieties which trace their origin to him ; and this is the common use of the term . By thus limiting the subject we give it more unity and cut off some of the isolated matters which few students can discuss at first hand . That it is only convenience or custom which makes church history a history of the church instead of an account of the religious life of the world at large or of the dealings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightfully na  --  ve and archaic ! We are carried - in imagination out of the garish light of modern science into the sacred ? and cloistered shades of a medheval school of theology . If by chance we have taken up the book because interested in the history of the early church , we shall probably lay it down at this point , for , however edifying it may be , it can certainly have no historical value . " But if we read further we shall find that it is a mistake to judge the work by its open-Pig pages . The theologian soon becomes the historian , and the result is on the whole a very respectable history of the early church . The work is not of the highest class , to he sure . It displays little historical imagination , constructive genius , real insight , or apprehension of the great controlling forces which made the Christian movement what it was . Moreover , the apostolic age , to which only twenty meagre and unsatisfactory pages are devoted , is treated in an altogether uncritical and conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theological disciplines , to say nothing of the dogmatic views of the theologians , should lead to so sharp a division between the apostolic and the post-apostolic age . The latter can not possibly he understood apart from the former , and such a summary as is given in chapter iv is worse than useless , for it only obscures the significance of the period of beginnings . The long chapter on Gnosticism is far from satisfactory , and the results of recent investigations receive scant attention . This last is , in fact , a notable fault of the book which appears at many . points . There is throughout too much dependence on the work of certain Cambridge scholars of the older school , as the singularly defective bibliographies at the close of each chapter only too pointedly suggest . Less than justice is done to Ignatius , Bishop of Aritioch , the greatest genius of the sub-apostolic age , when it is said " his words are rather sparkles of intense conviction than utterances of any profound thought " ( p. 99 ) . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Harnack . Ire-limns , too , fails to come th his full rights , for there is no recognition of the remarkable service he performed in combining the legal and mystical principles of the early church , and laying down the framework of Catholic theology for all the centuries to come . Professor Gwatkin , however , is not alone in thus overlooking the significance of the old Bishop of Lyons . He has rarely received the credit which belongs to him as the most widely and permanently influential theologian of the ancient church . On the other hand , Origen , Tertullian , and Cyprian are admirably handled , and Bishop Callixtus of Rome , who has all too commonly been unqualifiedly condemned in accordance with the judgment of his enemy Hippolytus , receives due recognition for his important services to the Western church . The chapters on the Christian Life , the Churches and the Church , Montanism , and Discipline Questions , are also very good . In fact , while the work has many glaring defects and is sadly lacking in unity , there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taken as a whole , the book , in spite of the apologetic emphasis of the early chapters , is commendably free from party spirit , and though by an Anglican clergyman , is not marred by the bias of a high and narrow ecclesiasticism . American Inland Waterways . By Herbert Quick . New York : G. P. Putnam ' ' s Sons . $3.50 net . In Mr. Quick 's new book we have a rather impassioned and somewhat visionary study of our inland waterways in their broadest aspects , particularly in their relation to the national welfare , to the railways , and with respect to their restoration , extension , and maintenance for all the purposes involved in the present-day conservation movement It was Bacon who said that three things are necessary to make a nation great and prosperous . " a fertile soil , busy workshops , and easy conveyance for men and commodities . " Mr. Quick observes , in calling attention to this statement , that we have the first two of these prime requisites ; but whether we shall make the most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a large de gree , upon the facilities which are available for carrying our products to the world 's market . Attention is directed to the strenuous efforts which other nations our industrial and commercial rivals , - have made in the past and continue to make in developing their inland waterways as an instrument in reducing transportation charges . In this connection , the work which has been accomplished in European countries is detailed More particular reference is made to the activities of the Canadians in improving the St. Lawrence in order to turn toward Montreal an increasingly large volume of commerce , to the detriment of New Yoik . We are reminded also of the other waterways now in construction , or projected , which promise added advantages to other Canadian cities , in the heart of the continent How the United States is to meet this situation , is the present writer 's theme . Enthusiasm seems to have carried him far beyond the realm of possibilities , for he proposes a scheme which , even though it were practicable , would involve the expenditure of considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a purpose prior , at al ' events , to the completion of the Panama Canal . Briefly , the inland waterways should be developed as a single system with uniform depths and widths of channels , so that vessels of a standard draft may be used . Under such conditions , barges could be billed to any point on the national system of waterways just as railway freight cars may be billed to far distant stations , provided the connecting lines are of a uniform gauge . But the waterways must also be conserved to meet other needs . The writer looks forward to the time when the burning of coal will be permitted only when it can be shown that water-power is not available for the desired purpose ; when a " muddied " stream will constitute proof of crime in the district where the silt originates , and when the land will be dotted with reservoirs whose contents will furnish the water necessary to make the channels of all rivers sufficiently deep for navigation purposes in time of drought : In those days the " blight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , Great Falls on the northwest , and Sackett 's Harbor on the northeast , down to the Gulf , will run the new seaboard , and the same ships will ply the lakes in summer and carry cargoes ' to the tropics in winter . This volume is the latest addition of the publishers to their American Waterways Series . It is profusely illustrated , and , so far as workmanship is concerned , is of exceptional excellence . Notes . Prof. Wilbur Cross 's book on " Tbe Life and Times of Laurence Sterne , " only recently issued , is to be followed by a biography of Sterne by Lewis Melville Early in the new year the Putnams will publish a book by Julius Chambers entitled " The Mississippi River , " which will be included in the American Waterways Series Here one may look for an account of the great river from its sources to the sea , ' if its place in romance , in religion , in diplomacy , in war , and in peace D G Hogarth is the author of a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title " Accidents of an Antiquary 's Life " The author is a well-known English traveller and explorer , . and Dr. Arthur Evans 's successor as keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford . The new book will deal with adventures in . Greece and Asia Minor and will be fully illustrated The Charities Publication Committee of New York announces for early issue in 1910 ' " Our Slavic Fellow Citizens , " a study of Slav immigration both abroad and in - the United States , by Prof Emily Greene Balch of Wellesley College Another promised volume is a handbook on housing reform by Lawrence Veiller , former deputy commissioner of the Tenement House Department , and the full findings of the well-known Pittsburgh survey will be brought out by the committee in six volumes as publications of the Russell Sage Foundation For those persons who still believe that Thackeray was a naughty cynic  --  hard , cold , and unfeeling  --  we can think of no better fate than to receive " The Sense and Sentiment of Thackeray " ? being selections compiled from his works and correspondence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , this will be no punishment , but is it not the season of peace and good will ? Thackeray is reputed to be one of women 's severest judges , his cruelty toward the cruel sex is often alleged against him by suffragette-critics . Mrs Fairbanks has brought together here a series of passages in praise of woman which quite convince us that Thackeray was as other men . And if Eve had not eaten of that apple , he writes in a " Letter to His Mother , " and her children " had gone on living forever quite happy in a smirking paradisiacal nudity , it would n't have been half the world it lei " The " Poems of Winthrop Mackworth Praed , " selected and arranged by Ferris Greenslet , forms the latest issue of that delightful series of special editions printed at the Riverside Press for Houghton Minn Co . It happened by chance that the writer of this note had just read through Praed 's works in the standard two-volume edition when this selection came into his hands . He was struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praed by this expurgation of the feeble and faulty ; The failures of a great poet may have their value , but in the case of a writer whose only strength is finesse , every dull page , every flat line , is a distinct diminution of the reader 's pleasure Praed as he stands after Mr Greenslet 's winnowing is pure gold , without a redundancy and with nothing lacking Possibly the tale of " The Red Fisherman " is not so impressive as the editor believes , and the present writer would hesitate to give it a place in preference to " The Eve of Battle " , but its omission would have left the collection without an example of the tales , and it has at least a pleasant savor of " Ingoldsby . " The editor was certainly wise in including all five of the " Every-Day Characters " and in setting them at the head of the volume . There is nothing in English more perfectly charming in their kind than " The Vicar " and " Quince . " Here Praed is something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blends easily with " The County Ball " and " Good Night to the Season , " which are the very quintessence of the genre .
