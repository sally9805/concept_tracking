 | WITHOUT , the day was waning , the soothing spell of twilight lay upon the restless city . Along the grim y streets throngs of stern toilers passed onward to their homes . Behind them , a day 's labor , before them , leisure and repose . Within , the magic game was at its start . Massive oven doors swung open and riotous rainbow flames leaped from their caverns to dance across the low-brewed cave . Over huge copper caldrons stalwart men brewed mystic spells . At long troughs young Titans hurled rude elements into living manna . Silent they were and swift in this giant kitchen . All night they must toil at furnace and at bench , for when the dawn broke a thousand hungry families would be clamoring for food . An intimate acquaintance with the disillusionizing details of a great enterprise has been powerless to break the spell of that first startling glimpse into the shop of a big bakery . Modern and scientific the industry may be , robbed of the homely setting of our grandmothers ' time , divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day housewife , but for all that pervaded with a mystery , a picturesqueness , a dramatic force which carries it out of the realm of the real , back into the age when myth and fable dwelt upon the land . When the Editor and I discussed an investigation of a family bakery of the better class , he demanded that no detail which might excite the interest of an intelligent housewife should escape my eye ? method and customs I must discover . technical lore acquire , possible scandals unearth , and general workings scrutinize until I could qualify as an honorary member of the Ancient Order of Domestic Bakers . Whereupon I gayly sauntered forth , determined to enter some prosperous first-class bakery in the humble guise of an apprentice , and while kneading bread and cutting cookies , watch the mysterious wheels of a shop which turned out the baking for a thousand families instead of for one . To my dismay I discovered that no woman 's hand aids in the mixing of morning rolls or the filling of layer cake , so I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work is all done by men prepared in Germany by a three or four years ' training . During my investigation , I did occasionally find a baker who had learned his trade in this country , but it was the rare exception . The apprentice system has never grown up here , probably because most states forbid the night labor of boys under eighteen , and at that age bright young fellows are already launched on some economic pursuit . The large cracker factories and wholesale bakeries do employ women for the mechanical routine , but institutions which cater to the family trade use women only in the store . Out of seventy employees on the pay roll of one of New York 's best equipped bakeries , only six are women . That an art which is the very crux of home-making should be wrested from its rightful wielders was a bitter blow . When I protested openly against this embezzlement to the bread foreman of a bakery to which I had gained access , he declared : " Ach hintmel ! Tonight my six men bake 1200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , it would , ke her a lifetime . By 1 o'clock all will be done ; the bread and rolls ready . Only strong men , giants can do it . ' . ' No woman 's work It was , even as Herr Baumgarten said , no woman 's work , and the mere physical demands might well have appalled an athlete . Strong as they were and accustomed to the work , the bench men would issue from their battle at the mixing trough more exhausted than a laundress after a day 's wash . At this bakery , when the night staff came on , the foreman consulted his order blank to discover the magnitude of his work . During the day whenever a customer gave . a delivery order to any of the saleswomen , she made out the slip and put it on the file of the wagon man in whose district it fell . From then on , he was responsible for it . If Mrs Anton Jones failed to get her five-cent order of rolls in time for breakfast , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe was called up , and the cause of the accident reduced to its  | lowest terms with apologies on one hand , and reprimands on the other . Along in the afternoon , each driver went over his slips and put down his order on the big yellow sheet which hung in the office . Then the head clerk added her demands for the store and the manager sanctioned it with his 0 K , so that when Herr Baumgarten pulled on his cap and tied on his apron , he had a very definite task before him . Thirteen different kinds of bread , seven of rolls , three of buns and a coffee cake comprised his extensive repertoire . Though some of the distinctions were wrought by baking instead of mixing , the bread alone demanded six different doughs . By some strange freak of the baker 's art , the unit of measurement in his operations was a sixteen quart pail . The cake men at the same bakery had for their norm , the quart . Twenty-two quarts of doughnuts meant 175 dozen . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor flour , but eggs . Ordinarily twenty eggs make a quart , but they vary so , that it is not safe to reckon them by numbers . The mixing troughs , twelve feet long , would hold three barrels of flour apiece ? each barrel was good for 260 loaves . These were rolled out of the store room unheaded , and sifted by the cub on the staff , commonly known as the " pan eraser , " later when the oven fires were going well , and the roll mixtures had been superintended , the foreman himself presided at the trough . Water heated on the doughnut stove was poured into the waiting trough . Salt , yeast and lard , apportioned by weight instead of by the giant teaspoonful , were dissolved in the wetting . The most accurate of apothecary scales were employed for this , so that the deviation from time to time would be infinitesimal . One-half a pound of salt was allotted to ten quarts of water . Compressed yeast , bought in the pound package , vanished at the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two tierces of butter disappeared weekly . This accuracy I found was the source of great pride in baking circles . The cake foreman said to me. ' one day , when I was watching him weigh his spices for ginger cookies : " Good luck ? Nein , nun . It is always to have it exact . For forty years I have made it just so , and never do I have a mistake . But the housekeeper , some time she use one cup , some time another . Some time she think she knows it all , and she guesses . Then when it is not perfect , she weeps and says bad luck ! ' " However overconfident the housewife might become it was a fault unknown in the bakeshop . Nothing was taken for granted . Although the bench man who cut off the loaves of bread with his swift , sharp scraper was so exact that his portions . rarely varied an ounce , every loaf was weighed that it might not exceed or fall short of the prescribed one pound , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer , but it rendered the second proving an exact science . All the ingredients safely in , three sturdy " bench men " took their place at the trough . With sleeves rolled up above the elbow , they plunged in their arms and with a long snaky swing , mixed the mountain of flour into the pool of wetting . As they worked , the flour flew , and unless throat and nose were well protected , they were forced to stop at intervals for a breath of pure air . It was a fascinating process to watch . The great muscles stood out in welts on the men 's arms as they churned the unwieldy mass into submission . With the strategic skill of a football player , they hurled it one to the other . With irresistible force they waltzed it gayly up and down the trough . All the figures of the lancers they taught it . When it begged for mercy they added more flour from a pocket at one end and stiffened it yet more , cutting it apart with a scraper and wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreman cried " Genug , " ( enough ) they packed it with heavy blows into the bottom of the trough , covered it with a board and left it , not to rise , for the baker 's vocabulary holds no such word , but to prove . This term is probably a transcription of the German word probers , which has a much wider significance than its English derivative . The foreman told me that in his early days when the hours were longer , though the work less exacting , he used to stretch out on the board and sleep until the rising dough rolled him off and warned him that it was ready to be molded . Scarcely less strenuous than the kneading was the exciting moment when an oven full of bread was ready for release . Two hundred and fifty loaves that must be simultaneously wrenched from the brick floor of a heated cave under penalty of ruination , if delayed , was a situation for prompt and efficient action . Strange to say , the ovens were more  | nearly related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day adjunct of the kitchen range . They were merely broad , shallow caverns in a solid wall of brick , high enough from the floor to be used without stooping over . On a grate in one corner , a raging fire sent its many colored flames to the remotest crack . When the top of the oven was burned white , the fire was raked off , the oven washed out with a hose , and for six hours it was ready for the family baking . An oven ordinarily consumed coal at the rate of a ton a week . Except for the Vienna oven , their extreme simplicity was in ludicrous contrast to the complicated function they performed . There , however , a set of flues at the rear forced in steam which softened the bread and kept it from crusting too rapidly . So hot was it with its 525 degrees Farenheit that the steam was completely vaporized and absolutely invisible , but once when I held my hand in front of the door for a moment , it became dripping wet . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all hands left their work and lined up by the foreman with the ceremony of a crew passing through Hell Gate . With a dextrous stroke he thrust a broad thin blade on a fifteen foot pole into the opened oven , shuffled eight or ten pans on it and with a quick backward movement drew them forth and dumped them on the floor where a cloth had been spread to receive them . With all the excitement of a crowd of children under a shaking chestnut tree , the six aides rescued the falling loaves , unpanned them and packed them eighteen to the box , into a tier arranged with a view to ventilation . By 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning , the night staff at most bakeries have finished their labors and have gone home through the silent streets . The bread and rolls they take from the shop and pack in the store room . Here huge racks , which contain a dozen or fifteen boxes , line the wall . The boxes will hold seventy-five or more loaves of bread apiece . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls , the delivery men must arrive well before 3 in the morning , pack up their orders and be off by 3.30 . The owner of a well-known bakery told me that now his six wagons never varied ten minutes in starting , for the only customers he had ever lost had left him on account of delayed orders . By 4 o'clock the cake men are in possession of the shop and their labors last BAKERIES 201 until 2 in the . afternoon . Much more complicated are their labors , though less arduous than their bread making brothers . A bakery which scorns style and is noted for its substantial wares has on its order sheet a dozen different kind of pies , thirty cakes , forty cookies and tarts and fifty fancy cakes . Most of the loaf cakes have for their basis a simple butter , eggs and milk composition which is called the wine cake mixture , though why wine no one knows . The cake men use huge wooden bowls instead of the big mixing trough . In the newer bakeries , the cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a movement on foot among the better institutions to raise the shops to the first floor . The rolling boards are huge shelves , often stretching across the end of the shop . An electric motor is sometimes called into play to help stir cake . The big bowl is fastened into place on a shelf and a huge egg beater is let down and turned around at a rapid rate by the motor . One bakery had grown tired of flavoring its cakes with prune juice , burnt sugar or petroleum instead of vanilla extract , so it always kept on hand $300 or $400 worth of the homemade article . It buys 35 pounds of vanilla bean at a time , at $3 to $8 a pound , puts it in spirits for six months and harvests fifty gallons of the best extract on the market . Tricks of second-class bakeries While the bakeries that I chose for investigation were all of a high type , they catered to the intelligent , conservative housewives , rather than to the ultrafashionable . It was with interest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility for the secondrate bakery on the careless housekeeper . " There are lots of women who 'll buy bread and rolls made out of compound , " I heard more than one baker say , " when they would n't think of using the stuff in their own kitchen . Just because the baker is near they go to him ; and when the rolls taste queer , they blame it to bakeries in general , instead of to their own man . You can spot a compound as far off as you can see it , and there is no excuse for an intelligent housekeeper ever having a loaf of bread made out of it . We 've never had an ounce of it in this shop and never will . " When a bakery spends $8000 a year on lard and eggs , and $1200 on flour , as many of them do , much may be saved by using cheaper materials . Lard at wholesale costs ten cents a pound , while compound but seven cents , so the unscrupu-  | lous baker finds it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurious material unmolested . This compound is made out of stale lard and refuse matter , rendered into a product not unlike the genuine article in appearance . It lacks however , the pure , dead white of the real product , and taints everything it is put into with a flat , greasy flavor . Bad butter I found was another source of profit to the second-rate baker . Of course oleomargarine can be employed as a substitute and the untrained housewife be none the wiser . But a law which prohibits its being colored has greatly diminished its use . Process or renovated butter , which as a matter of fact ranks lower in the scale , I discovered , was in more common use . The renovated butter is made out of all the rancid , dirty , tainted scraps of refuse packing stock which have grown unsalable on a grocer 's hands . This is deodorized and melted ; the fat is drawn off , mixed with milk or cream , if necessary treated to a preservative and then rechurned . While its appearance is greatly improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishment by the process , and is the same rotten stuff . Laws in almost all of the states now demand that process butter shall be so labeled , and impose a penalty fine of from one hundred to five hundred dollars , and an imprisonment of from sixty days to one year . Unfortunately the average housewife , even of the better class , knows nothing of this scandal in the butter family . If her grocer features the stuff as excellent butter whose patent method of production reduces its price , she prides herself on her good bargain . For this reason , probably , in spite of unfavorable legislation the manufacture of renovated butter is on the increase . While the Washington authorities report that 30 per cent of the factories fell off in 1905 , the production for that year was 61,366,400 pounds against 55,747,736 pounds the preceding year . Scarcely a day passed , one baker told me , that he was not approached by a food crook offering an undetectable substitute that would make his fortune . One Chicago firm besieged him with catalogs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheese and fruits . They declared that if used according to directions these discoveries would not violate any pure food law . The milk and butter preservative they stated had the same effect as ice , and only differed in the temperature it produced . The meat preservative was a superior antiseptic discovered by an eminent German chemist and used throughout Germany not only by the first-class dealers but in the army and navy as well . This last was one too many , and he sent post haste for samples of these marvelous elixirs and turned them over to a municipal chemist . There followed illuminating discoveries . The milk medicine at one dollar a quart , turned out to be 95 per cent water and 5 per cent formaldehyde gas , costing the producer about four cents . A pound of the German chemist 's discovery which sold " at the cutrate price of fifty cents " consisted of less than ten cents ' worth of boric acid and salt . The Chicago firm received a letter which had the desired effect of striking his bakery from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dapper young gentleman call at this store in the interests of " Baker 's Discovery , " a substitute for butter . This greatest living wonder of the age was a sickly looking oleo product pressed into hard cakes which disintegrated into flakes . The glib salesman urged the baker , his entire staff and myself to attend a special demonstration of this marvel at the factory , where we would be convinced of the superior results attained by using this product . Incidentally Baker 's Discovery cost fourteen cents a pound against the nineteen cents wholesale price of butter , and went much further . . When the proprietor , Mr Hardy , remained stolid under these inducements the persevering salesman performed a feat in mental arithmetic and informed him that on 36,400 pounds of butter , a year , he could save in actual expenditure $1820 , a tidy little sum which would buy him an automobile , a trip around the world , educate his children , or build a library in his native town . Whereupon Mr Hardy hurled the sample into the gutter , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-whipping was to clear out of his office , and pasted a notice over his desk forbidding entrance to all agents of quack goods . Some ingredients of bread The miracle of the resuscitated egg I heard from a saleswoman with whom I worked for a season . She had been employed by a big wholesale bakery and knew much of crooked methods . This practice she told me was also in vogue among many of the domestic bakeries whose standing was questionable . At hair , and clean as to hands and nails . It is part of the code . It was genial old Mr Hardy who shed the only light on the tribulations of the baker with unreasonable customers . His peers maintained a significant reticence . " Of course I could tell you stories that would n't reflect to the credit of womankind , " he said , " but it is n't the way in our trade to speak badly of our customers . With us it is n't like the dry goods or the hardware business where twenty-four hours do n't make any difference delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dot , or somebody 's dinner is spoiled and their temper upset , an it means a hot time for us . But we try to be as particular about a fivecent loaf of bread as if it were a fiftydollar purchase . That 's why our business has grown so . Lots of families who would n't touch a bit of baker 's stuff ten years ago , are our regular customers ? though some of them are so proud they ask us to send the order round by a boy instead of in the cart . But you see , in these days of servant troubles , lots of women would have to stay in the kitchen all day long , if it were n't for us . With al its up and downs , it 's a wonderful business . " Bad bakeries greatly predominate So much for the bakeries whose standing is unquestioned , whose methods can survive investigation ; whose owners are business men of the highest integrity . There are such ; they are to be found for the searching in every city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is paralleled all over the country . Out of its 2740 bakeries perhaps 10 per cent belong to a class whose watchword is cleanliness and purity . Unfortunately the intelligent housekeepers do not necessarily confine their patronage to the white list . With the increasing magnitude of the domestic service problem the business of the family baker has grown a hundred per cent in the last ten years . But to the shame of American home-making , the average housekeeper knows little of the conditions under which her morning rolls are produced . But the good shop among the half a dozen bad ones in her neighborhood can be determined by a process of elimination . In New York state the factory inspectors ' report of sanitary conditions can always be obtained from the state department of labor . Irrespective of any report , however , a dirty shop with goods exposed to flies and dust is an excellent indication  | that cleanliness is not the first care of the producer . An odor of grease and rancid oils , which often pervades the poorer class of shops , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , is an excellent guide . The palate which has been trained on good home cooking can easily detect compound in bread or rolls . The recipes in the reputable bakers ' journals call for the use of alum and ammonia in cakes and breads , and no consumer should be in doubt where her baker stands on that crucial point . Egg and milk powder . egg substitute , preserved eggs and patent butters proclaim their presence by the dull , lifeless taste they impart . This last class of food products is not absolutely deleterious but lacks the nutrition of the genuine substances . Further than that the state and government experiment station is only too willing to assist the interested housekeeper . A note sent to the secretary of agriculture at the state or national capital , asking him for the latest pure food bulletins of his department will bring without charge an interesting budget of literature . The experiment station will test any suspected baker 's product for ammonia , phosphate , glucose , aniline dyes , and petroleum , and no housewife need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A producer who has passed these fiery trials can safely be put on the preferred list , and if more minute investigation is desired , held over for a class in food analysis . In our sentimental moments we all long for the good old days when every family brewed its own ale , spun its own flax , and baked its own loaf ; but in this age of the division of labor , and of cooperative enterprises , these delightful practices have given way to the brewery , the factory and the bakery . Whether she will or not , the housekeeper of today must reckon with the big bakery which turns our bread by the thousand loaves and unlimited rolls and biscuits .
