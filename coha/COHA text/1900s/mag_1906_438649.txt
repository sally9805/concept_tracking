A it the time I made the trip to Yellowstone Park with President Roosevelt in the spring of 1903 , I promised some friends to write up my impressions of the President and of the Park , but I have been slow in getting around to it . The President himself , having the absolute leisure and peace of the White House , wrote his account of the trip nearly two years ago ! But with the stress and strain my life at " Slabsides , " ? administering the affairs of so many of the wild creatures of the woods about inc , ? I have not till this blessed season found Mc time to put on record an account of the most interesting thing I saw in that wonderful land , which , of course , was the President himself . When I accepted his invitation I was well aware that during the journey I should be in a storm centre most of the time , which is not always a pleasant prospect to a man of my habits and disposition . The President himself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such abounding energy and ceaseless activity that he sets everything in motion around him wherever he goes. ? But I Um , he would he pretty well occupied on his way to the Park in speaking to eager throngs and in receiving personal and political homage in the towns and cities we were to pass through . But when all this was over , and I found myself with him in the wilderness of the Park , with only the superintendentand a few attendants to help take up his tremendous personal impact , how was it likely to fare with a non-strenuous person like inyself , I asked ? I had visions of snow six and seven feet deep where traveling could be done only upon snowshoes , and I had never had the things on my feet in my life . If the infernal fires beneath , that keep the pot boiling so out there , should melt the snows , I could see the party tearing along on horseback at a wolf-hunt pace over a rough country ; and as I had not been on a horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be likely to fare with me there ? I had known the President several years before he became famous , and we had had some correspondence on subjects of natural history . His interest in such themes is always very fresh and keen , and the main motive of his visit to the Park at this time was to see and study in its semi-domesticated condition the great game which he had so often hunted during his ranch days ; and he was kind enough to think it would be an additional pleasure to see it with a nature-lover like myself . For my own part , I knew nothing about big game , but I knew there was no man in the country with whom I should so like to see it as Roosevelt . Some of our newspapers reported that the President intended to hunt in the Park . A woman in Vermont wrote me , to protest against the hunting , and rutitt Cam piny with l'reNiderit le , oscrell hoped I would teach the President to love the animals as much as I did , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is founded upon knowledge , and because they had been a part of his life . She did not know that I was then cherishing the secret hope that I might he allowed to shoot a cougar or bobcat : but . this fun did not come to me . The President said , " I will not lire a gun in f he Park ; then I shall have 110 explanations to make . " Yet . once I did hear inn say in the wilderness , " I feel as if I ought to keep the camp in meat . Ialways have . " I regretted that he could not do so on this occasion . I have never been disturbed by the President 's hunting trips . It is to such men as he that the big game legitimately belongs , ? inen who regard it from the point of view of the naturalist as well as from that of the sportsman , who are interested in its preservation , and who share with the world the delight they experience in the chase . Such a hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is from night ; and as for his killing of the " varmints , " ? bears , cougars , and bobcats. ? the fewer or these there are , the better for the useful and beautiful game . The cougars , or mountain lions , in the Park certainly needed killing . The superintendent reported that he had seen where they had slain nineteen elk , and we saw Where they had killed a deer , and . dragged its body across the trail . Of course , the President would not now on his hunting trips shoot an elk or a ( leer except to " keep the camp in meat , " and for this purpose it is as legitimate as to slay n sheep or at steer for the table at home . We left Washington cm April 1 , and strung several of the larger Western cities on our thread of travel , ? Chicago , Milwaukee , Madison , St. Paul , Minneapolis , ? as well as many lesser towns , in each of which the President made an address , sometimes brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I c gave himself very freely a lid h. , in in to the people wherever he went . II , easily match their Western eent. , 0t , and good-fellowship . Wherever hid ' - ni ? stopped , crowds soon gathered , or had already gathered , to welcome hind Ills advent made a holiday in each tint n visited . At all the principal stop- the usual programme was : first , his reel ? ' tan by the committee of citizens appointed to receive him ; they usually boarded his private car , and were one by one introduced to him ; then a drive through thc town with 0 concourse of carriages ; den to the hall or open air platform , where he spoke to the assembled throng ; then to lunch or dinner ; and then back to the train , and off for the next stop , ? a /amid of hand-shaking , carriage-d riving , spas h-making each day . He usually spoke from eight to ten times every twenty-Mar hours , sometimes for only a few naiades from the rear platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more in some large hall . In Chicago , ' Milwaukee , aril St. Paul , elaborate banquets were given him and his party , and on each occasion he delivered a carefully prepared speech upon questions that 1/1VOIVed the policy of his administration . The throng that greeted him in the vast Auditorium in Chicago  - -  that rose and waved waved again -- -was one of the grandest Inman spectacles I ever witnessed . In Milwaukee the dense cloud of tobacco smoke that presently filled the large hall after the feasting was over was enough to choke any speaker , but it did not seem to choke the President , though he does not use tobacco in any form himself ; nor was there anything foggy about his utterances on that occasion upon legislative control of the trusts . In St. Phut the city was inundated With humanity , ? a vast human tide that left the middle of the streets bare as our line of carriages moved slowly along , but ( lull rose up in solid walls of town and prairie humanity on the sidewalks and city door-yards . IOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point I spied in the 1 the curbstone a large silk begu-n ' , bore my own name as the title of I presently SftW that it was by halt it dozen anxious and ex- ? , : , ant looking schoolgirls with braids their backs . As my carriage drew hem . they pressed their way through ILr lining . and threw a large bouquet of fi , , u , ? 1 , into my lap . I think it would be hard 1 , , say who blushed the deeper , the ; irls , a. myself . It was the first time I had cr had flowers showered upon me in pchlic : and then , maybe , I felt that on , t1 ? 11 at occasion I was only a minor side issue . and public recognition was not caked for . But the incident pleased the President . " I saw that banner and those Mincers , " he said afterwards ; " and I was dcli ? dded to see you honored that way. - lint I fear I have not to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pretty attention . The time of the passing of the presidential train seemed well known , even on the Dakota prairies . At one point I remember a little brown schoolhouse stood nut far off , and near the track the school-ma'am , with her flock , drawn up in line . We were at luncheon , but the President caught a glimpse ahead through the window , and quickly took in the situation . With napkin in hand , he rushed out on the platform and waved to them . " Those children , " he said , as he came back , " wanted to see the President of the United States , and I could not disappoint them . They may never have another chance . What a deep impression such things make when we are young ! " some point in the Dakotas we picked lip the former foreman of his ranch , and : mother cowboy friend of the old clays , and they rode with the President in his private car for several hours . He was as ' nippy with them as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight all over . The life which those men represented , and of which he had himself once formed a part , meant so touch to him ; it had entered into the very marrow of his being , and I could see the joy of it all shining in his face as he sat and lived parts of it over again with those Inge , that day . lie bubbled with laughter continually . The meal thought , seemed a little embarrassed by his openhanded cordiality and good-fellowship . Ile himself evidently wanted to forget the present , and to use only in the memory of those wonderful ranch days ,  - -  - that free , hardy , adventurous life upon the plains . It all came hack to tact with a rush when he found himself alone with these heroes of the rope and the stirrup . Zloty much more keen his eqpreciation was , and how much quicker his memory , than theirs ! Ile was constantly recalling to their minds incidents which they had forgotten , and the names of horses and dogs which had escaped them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ranch days , seemed to have made it more vivid by contrast . When they had gone , I said to him , " I think your affection for those men very beautiful . " " HOW could I help it ? " he said . " Still , few men in sour station could or would go back and renew such friendships . " " Then I pity them , " he replied . He said afterwards that his ranch life had been the making of him . It had built him 11 , and hardened him physically , and it had opened his eyes to the wealth of manly character among the plainsmen and cattlemen . Had he not gone West , he said , he never would have raised the Rough Riders Regiment ; and had he not raised that regiment and gone to the Cuban War , he would not have been made governor of New York ; and had not this happened , the politicians would not unwittingly have made his rise to the Presidency so inevitable . There is no doubt , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but without the chain of events above outlined , his rise could not have , been so rapid . Our train entered the ) lad lands of North Dakota in the early evening wilight , and the President stood on the rear platform of his car , gazing wistfully upon the scene . " I know till this country like a book , " he said . " 1 lane ridden over it , and hunted over it , nail tramped over it , in all seasons and weather , and it looks like home to ate . My old ranch is not far off . We shall soon reach Mcdora , which was my station . " It was plain to see that that strange , forbidding-looking landscape , hills and valleys to Eastern eyes utterly demoralized and gone to the bad , ? flayed , fantastic , treeless , a riot of naked clay slopes , ehimney-like buttes , and dry coulees , ? was in his eyes a land of almost pathetic interest . There were streaks of good pasturage here and there where his cattle used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prong-horn used to linger . When we reached Medora , where the train was scheduled to stop an hour , it was nearly dark , but the whole town and country round had turned out to welcome their old townsman . After much handshaking , the committee conducted its down to a little hall , where the President stood on a low platform , and made a short address to the standing crowd that filled the place . Then some flashlight pictures were taken by the local photographer , after which the President stepped down , and , while the people filed past him , shook hands with every man , woman , and child of them , calling many of them by name , and greeting them all most cordially . I recall one grizzled old frontiersman whose hand he grasped , calling him by name , and saying , " How well I remember you ! You once mended my gun lock for me , ? put on a new hammer . " " Yes , " said the delighted old fellow ; " I 'm the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more , and the pleasure of the meeting was very obvious on both sides . I heard one of the women tell him they were going to have a dance presently , and ask him if he would not stay and open it ! The President laughingly excused himself , and said his train had to leave on schedule time , and his time was near ly up . I thought of the incident m Ranch Life , in which he says he 1,1a , opened a cowboy ball withh the wile of a Minnesota man , who had recenth shit a bullying Scotchman who dancol oN ? , site . He says the scene reminded hint of the ball where Bret Harte 's heroin , " went down the middle with the man that shot Sandy Magee . " Before reaching Madera he had told me many anecdotes of " Hell Roach/ ; Bill Jones , " and had said I should se , . him . But it turned out that Hell 1 ? oaring Bill had begun to celebrate the eon , Mg of the President too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was Ina in a presentable condition . I forget now how he had earned his name , but no doubt he had come honestly by it ; it was a part of his history , as was that of " ' the Pike , " " Cold Turkey Bill , " " Bash Knife Joe , " and other classic heroes of the frontier . It is curious how certain things go to the bad in the Far West , or a certain pm-portion of them , ? bad lands , bad horses , and bad men . And it is a degree of had , ness that the East has no conception of : land that looks as raw and unnatural us if time had never laid its shaping and softening hand upon it ; horses that , when mounted , put their heads to the ground and their heels in the air , and , squealing defiantly , resort to the most diabolically ingenious tricks to shake off or to kill their riders ; and men who amuse themselves in barrooms by shooting about the feet of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride along the street and shoot at every one in sight . Just as the old plutonic fires come to the surface out therein the Rockies , and hint very strongly of the infernal regions , so a kind of satanic element in men and animals ? an underlying devilishness ? crops out , and we have the border ruffian and the bucking broncho . The President told of an Englishman on a hunting trip in the West , who , being an expert horseman at home , scorned the idea that he could not ride any of their ? ? lss-fed ponies . " So they gave him a h. , broncho. l le was soon lying on , round , much stormed . When he speak , he said , " I should not have ha , hal him , you know , but ' e ' ides ' is At place in Dakota the train stopped is he Water while we were at lunch . A mash soon gathered , and the President cui out to greet them . We could hear voice , and the cheers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him say , Well , good-by , I must go now . " Still lir did not come . That WC heard more to I kiiig and laughing , and a /roller " goodhv , " : 1111 vet he did not come . Then I went out to see what had happened . I found the President down on the ground shaking hands with the whole lot of I hem . SOITIC one had reached up to shake his hand as he was about withdrawing , and this had been followed by such eagerness 011 the part of the rest of the people to do likewise , that the President had instantly got down to gratify them . I lad the secret service men known it , they would have been in a pickle . We probably have never had a President who responded more freely and heartily to the popular liking for him than Roosevelt . The crowd always seem to be in love with him the moment they see him and hear his voice . And it is not by reason of any arts of eloquence , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartiness and sincerity , and his genuine manliness . The people feel his quality at once . In Bermuda last winter I met a Catholic priest who had sat on the platform at some place in New England very near the President while he was speaking , and who said , " The man had not spoken three minutes before I loved him , and had any one tried to molest him , I could have torn him to pieces . " It is the quality in the man that instantly inspires such a liking as this in strangers that will , I am sure , safeguard him in all public places . I once heard him say that he did not like to be addressed as " His Excellency ; " he added laughingly , " They might just as well call me Ilis Transparency , for all I care . " It is this transparency , this direct , out unequivocal character of him that is one source of his popularity . The people do love transparency , ? all of them but the politicians . A friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nistakt he had made in one of his appointments . " My dear sir , " replied the President , " where you know of one mistake I have made . I know of ten . " ' How such candor must make the politicians shiver ! I have said that I stood in dread of the necessity of ollOWshoeing in the Park , and , in lieu of that , of horseback riding . Yet when Ise reached Gardiner , the entrance to the Park , on that bright , crisp April morning , with no snow in sight save that on the mountain tops , and found Major Pitcher and Captain Chittenden at the head of a squad of soldiers , with a fine saddle horse for the President , and an ambulance drawn by two span of mules for me , I confess that I experienced just a slight shade of mortification . I thought they might have given me the option of the saddle or the ambulance . Yet I entered the vehicle as if it was just what I had been expecting . The President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear , were soon off at a lively pace , and my ambulance followed close , and at a lively pace , too ; so lively that I soon found myself gripping the seat with my hands . " Well , " I said to myself , " they are giving me a regular Western send-off ; " and I thought , as the ambulance swayed from side to side , that it would suit me just as well if my driver did not try to keep lip With the presidential procession . The driver and his 1711110S were shut off from inc by a curtain , but , looking ahead out of the sides of the vehicle , I saw two good-sized logs lying across our course . Surely , I thought ( and barely had time to think ) , lie will avoid these . But he did not , and as we passed over them I was nearly thrown through the top of the ambulance . " This Is a lively send-off , " I said , rubbing nly bruises with one hand . while I clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowboys scrambling up the bank as if to get out of our way ; then the President on his fine gray stallion scrambling up the bank with his escort , and looking ominously in my direction , as we thundered by . " Well , " I said , " Ibis is indeed a novel ride ; for once in my life I have sidetracked the President of the United States ! I an given the right of way over all . " On sir tore , along the smooth , hard road , and did not slacken our pace till , at the end of a mile or two , we began to mount the hill toward Fort Yellowstone . And not till we reached the fort did I learn that nor mules land run away . They hail been excited beyond control by the presidential cavalcade , and t he driver , finding he could not hold them , had aimed only to keep them in the road , and we Very soon had the road all to mu-selves . Fort Yellowstone is at Mammoth Hot Springs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Park , ? huge , boiling springs with their columns of vapor , and the first characteristic odors which suggest the traditional infernal regions quite as much as the boiling and steaming water does . One also gels a taste of a much more rarefied air than he has been used to , and finds himself panting for breath on a very slight exertion . The Afammoth Hot Springs have built themselves up an enormous mound that stands there above the village on the side of the mountain , terraced and scalloped and fluted , and suggesting some vitreous formation , or rare carving of enormous , many-colored precious stones . It looks quite unearthly , and , though the devil 's frying pan , and ink pot , and the Stygian caves are not far off , the suggestion is of something celestial rather than of the nether regions , ? a vision of jasper walls , and of amethyst battlements . With Captain Chittenden I climbed to the top , stepping over the rills and creek 's of steaming hot water , and looked at the marvelously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit . ? , try seemed as unearthly in its beauty purity as the gigantic sculpturing that held it . The Stygian caves are still faith , up the mountain , ? little pockets in fiat rocks , or well-boles in the ground it your feet , filled with deadly carbon dk We saw birds ' feathers and quills in all of 01 ( 011 . The birds hop into them , path . ably in quest of food or seeking shelter , and they never come out . Wc saw the body of a martin on the bank of ow hole . Into one we sank a lighted fond , and it was extinguished as quickly as if we had dropped it into water . Each nave or niche is a death valley on a small scalk Near by We came upon a steaming or lakelet , of an acre or more in extent . A pair of mallard ducks were swimming about in one end of it , ? the Cool end . When We approached , they swam slimly over into the warmer water . As they progressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks ' discomfort was evident . Presently they stopped , and turned Inward us , half appealingly , as I thought . They could go no farther ; would w , . please come no nearer ' As I took another step or two , up they rose and disappeared over the hill . Had they gone to the extreme end of the pool , we mild have had boiled mallard for dinner . Another novel spectacle was at night , or near sundown , when the deer came lain from the hills into the streets , and ate hay a few yards from the officers ' quarter , , as unconcernedly as so many domestic sheep . This they had been doing all winter , and they kept it up till May , at times a score or more of them profiting thus on the government 's bounty . When the sundown gun was fired a couple of hundred yards away , they gave a nervous stark but kept on with their feeding . The tintelope and elk and mountain sheep had not yet grown bold enough to accept Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the freedom and solitude possible while in the Park . so all newspaper men and other strangers were excluded . Even the secret service // nil his physician and private secremm left at Gardiner . Ile craved more to be alone with nature ; he evidently hungry for the wild and the ? a hunger that seems to upon him regularly at least once a and drives him forth on his hunting for big game in the West . We spent two weeks in the Park , and i .. id fair weather , bright , crisp days , : mil freezing nights . The first week cue three camps that had been lire-pared. or partly prepared , for us in the oortheast earlier of the Park , in the tegion drained Icy the Gardiner River , where there was but little snow , and which cc reached on horseback . The second week we visited the geyser r'di , which lies a thousand feet or mare higher , and where the snow was still five or six feet deep . This part of the journey was made in big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the horseback excursion , which involved only about fifty miles of riding , we had a mule pack train , and Sibley tents : mil stoves , with quite a retinue of camp laborers , a lieutenant and an orderly or two , and a guide , Billy Hofer . The first camp was in a wild , rocky , and picturesque gorge on the Yellowstone , about ten miles from the fort . A slight indisposition , the result of luxurious living , with no wood to chop or to saw , and no hills to climb , as at home , prevented ate from joining the party till the third day . Then Captain Chittenden drove me eight miles in a buggy . About two miles from camp we came to a picket of two or three soldiers , where my big bay was in waiting for me . I mounted him confidently , and , guided by an orderly , took the narrow , winding trail toward camp . Except for an hour 's riding the day before with Captain Chittenden , I had not been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not spent as much as a day in the saddle during my youth . ' Chat first sense of a live , spirited , powerful animal beneath you , at whose mercy son are . ? you , a pedestrian all your days , with gullies and rocks and logs to cross , and deep chasms opening close beside you , is not a little disturbing . But my big bay did his part well , and I did not lose me head or my nerve , as we cam Mandy made our way along the narrow path on the side of the steep gorge , with a foaming torrent rushing along at its foot , nor yet when we forded the rocky and rapid Yellowstone . A misstep or a stumble on the part of my steed , and probably the first bubble of my confidence would have been shivered at once ; but this did not happen , and in dim time we reached the group of tents that formed the President 's camp . The situation was delightful , ? no snow , scattered pine trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , ample , trinity waters of the Yellowstone . The President was not in camp . In the morning he , had stated his Wish to go alone into the wilderness . Major Pitcher very na tiffany ( Nil not quite like the idea , and wished to send an orderly with him . " No , " said the President . Put me up a lunch , and let me go alone . I will surely come back . " And back he surely came . It wasabout five o'clock when he came briskly down the path from the cast to the camp . It came out that he had tramped about eighteen miles through a very rough country . The clay before , he and the major had located a band of several hundred elk on a broad , treeless hillside , and his purpose was to find those elk , and creep up on them , and eat his lunch under their Very noses . And this he did , spending an Incur or more within fifty yards of them . Ile Caine back looking as fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the big camp fire , related his adventure , and talked with his usual emphasis and copiousness of many things . Ile told me of the birds he had seen or heard ; among them he had heard one that was new to him . From his description I told him I thought it was Townsend 's solitaire , a bird I much wanted to see and hear . I had heard the West India solitaire , ? one of the most impressive songsters I ever heard ,  --  and I wished to compare toot Western form with it . The next morning we set out for our second camp , ten or a dozen miles away , and in reaching it passed over much of the ground the President had traversed the day before . As we came to a wild , rocky place above a deep chasm of the river , with a few scattered pine trees , the President said , " It was right here that I heard that strange bird song . " We paused a moment . " And there it is now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitaire singing from the top of a small cedar , ? a bright , animated , eloquent song , but without the richness and magic of the song of the tropical species . We hitched our horses , and followed the bird up as it flew from tree to tree . The President was as eager to see and hear it as I was . It seemed - very shy , and we only caught glimpses of it . In form and color it much resembles its West India cousin , and suggests our catbird . It ceased to sing when we pursued it . It is a bird found only in the wilder and higher parts of the Rockies . My impression was that its song did not quite merit the encomiums that have been pronounced upon it . At this point , I saw amid the rocks my first and only Rocky Mountain woodchucks , and , soon after we had resumed our journey , our first blue grouse , ? a number of them like larger partridges . Occasionally we would come upon black-tailed deer , standing or lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the first thing to catch the eye . They would often allow us to pass within a few rods of them without showing alarm . Elk horns were scattered all over this part of the Park , and we passed several old carcasses of dead elk that had probably died a natural death . In a grassy bottom at the foot of a steep hill , while the President and I were dismounted , and noting the pleasing picture which our pack train of fifteen or twenty mules made filing along the side of a steep grassy slope , ? a picture , A he has preserved in his late volunt. ? , 0 atDose Pastimes of an American IL 1116. r ,  - -  - our attention was attracted by pi:tinny , . musical , bird-like chirps that rose fent , the grass about us . I was almost certain it was made by a bird ; the Presitleto wan of like opinion ; and I kicked about is the tufts of grass , hoping to flush the bird . Now here , now there , arose this sharp . but bird-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a species of gopher , whose holes we soon discovered . What its specific name is I do not know , but it should be called the singing gopher . Our destination this day was a camp on Cottonwood Creek , near " Hell Boning Creek . " As we made our way in the afternoon along a broad , open , grassy valley , I saw a horseman come galloping over the hill to our right , starting up a band of elk a s.11e came ; riding across the plain , he wheeled his horse , and , with the military salute , joined our party . II , proved to be a government scout , called the " Duke of Hell Roaring , " ? an educated officer from the Austrian army , who , for some unknown reason , had exiled himself here in this out-of-the-way part of the world . He was a man in his prime , of fine , military look and bearing . After conversing a few moments with the President and Major Pitcher , he rode rapidly away . Our second camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the woods on the banks of a fine , large trout stream , where ice and snow still lingered in patches . I tried for trout in die head of a large , partly open pool , but did not get a rise ; too much ice in the stream , I concluded . Very soon my attention was attracted by a strange note , or call , in the spruce woods . The President had also noticed it , and , with me , wondered what made it . Was it bird or beast ? Billy Hofer said he thought it was an owl , but it in no way suggested an owl , and the sun was shining brightly . It was a sound such as a boy might make by blowing in the neck of an empty bottle . Presently , 11 ? i1,11.11 it beyond us on the other side of de creek , which was pretty good proof th.tt Me creature had wings . " Let ' s go run that bird down , " said do President to me . So oil we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward the woods be , mil it . We soon decided that the bird ( 1 : ? s on the top of one of a group of tall . peaces , Vier much skipping about over logs and rocks , and much craning of our necks , We made him out on the peak of a spruce . I imitated his call , n hen he turned his head dossm toward us , bat we could not make out what lie " Why did we not think to bring the glasses ? " said the President . -1 will run and get them , " I replied . - No , " said he , " you stay here and keep that bird treed , and I will fetch them . " So off lie went like a boy , and was very soon back with the glasses . We quickly inade out that it was indeed an owl ? the pigmy owl , as it turned out ? not much larger than a bluebird . I think the President was as pleased as if we had bagged some big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughout the trip I found his interest in bird life very keen , and his eye and ear remarkably quick . He usually saw the bird or heard its note as quickly as I did , and I had nothing else to think about , and had been teaching my eye and ear the trick of it for over fifty years . Of course , his training as a big-game hunter stood him in good stead , but back of that were his naturalist 's instincts , and his genuine love of all forms of wild life . I have been told that his ambition up to the time he went to Harvard bad been to be a naturalist , but that there they seem to have convinced him that all the out-of-door worlds of natural history had been conquered , and that the only worlds remaining were in the laboratory , and to he won with the microscope and the scalpel . But Roosevelt was a man made for action in a wide field , and laboratory VOL. 97- NO. 5 conquests could not satisfy him . this instincts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting expeditions , and , in a large measure , I think , prompt them . Certain it is that his hunting records contain more lice natural history than any similar records known to me , unless it be time of Charles St. John , the Scotch naturalist-sportsman . The Canada jays , or camp-robbers , as they are often called , soon found out our camp that afternoon , and no sooner had the cook begun to throw out peelings and scraps and crusts than the jays began to carry them off , not to eat , as I observed , but to hide them in the thicker branches of the spruce trees . How tame they were , mining within three or four yards of one ! Why this species of jay should everywhere be so familiar , and all other kinds so wild , is a puzzle . In the morning , as we rode down the valley toward our next camping-place , at Tower Falls , a band of elk containing a hundred or more started along the side of the hill a few hundred yards away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , as usual , when I saw the President wheel his horse off to the left , and , beckoning to me to follow , start at a tearing pace on the trail of the fleeing elk . He afterwards told use that he wanted me to get a good view of those elk at close range , and he was afraid that if he sent the major or Hofer to lead Ism , I would not get it . I hurried along as fast as I could , which was not fast ; the way was rough , ? logs , rocks , spring runs , and a tenderfoot rider . Now and then the President , looking back and seeing what slow progress I was making , would beckon to me impatiently , and I could fancy him saying , " If I had a rope around him , he would come faster than that ! " Once or twice I lost sight of both him and the elk ; the altitude was great , and the horse was laboring like a steam engine on an up-grade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke over a la , I saw the President pressing the elk up the opposite slope . At the brow of the hill he stopped , and 1 soon joined him . There on the top , not fifty yards away , stood the elk in a mass , their heads toward us and their tongues hanging out . They could run no farther . The President laughed like a boy . The spectacle meant much more to him than it did to Inc . I had never seen a wild elk till on this trip , but they had been among the notable game that he had hunted . Ile had traveled hundreds of miles , and undergone great hardships , to get within rifle range of these creatures . Now here stood scores of them , with lolling tongues , begging for mercy . After gazing at them to our hearts ' content , we turned away to look up our companions , who were nowhere within sight . We finally spied theist a mile or more away , and , joining them , all made our way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four miles across . It was high noon , and the sun shone clear and warns . From this lookout SVC saw herds upon herds of elk scattered over the slopes and gentle valleys in front of us . Some were grazing , some were standing or lying upon the ground , or upon the patches of snow . Through our glasses we counted the separate bands , and then the numbers of some of the bands or groups , and estimated that three thousand elk were in full view in the landscape around us . It was a notable spectacle . Afterward , in Montana , I attended a council of Indian chiefs at one of the Indian agencies , and told them , through their interpreter , that I had been with the Great Chief in the Park , and of the game we had seen . When I told them of these three thousand elk all in view at once , they grunted totally , whether with satisfaction or with incredulity I could not tell . In the midst of this great game amphitheatre we dismounted and enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he loafed for nearly an hour , ? stretched himself out in the sunshine upon a flat rock , as did the rest of us , and , I hope , got a few winks of sleep . I am SUN , I did . Little , slender , strips chipmunks , about half the size td were scurrying about ; but I its all tin other wild thing save the elk . From here we rode down the , ; Ay tw our third camp at Tower Falls , ; s.opp , nt : on the way to eat our lunchetol ott washed boulder beside a creek . 1 lii this ride I saw my first and only badger ; Id stuck his striped head out of his hole the ground only a few yards away front us as we passed . Our camp at Tower Falls was acid the spruces above a caftan of the Yellowstone , five or six hundred feet deep . It was a beautiful and impressive situation , ? shelter , snugness , even cosiness , ? looking over the brink of the awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think one might have landed in the river at the bottom of the great abyss , and in doing so might have scaled one of those natural obelisks or needles of rock that stand up oat of the depths two or three hundred feet high . Nature shows you what an enormous furrow her plough can open through the strata when mowing horizontally , at the same time that she shows you what delicate and graceful col umns her slower and gentler aerial forces can carve out of the piled strata . At the Falls there were two or three of these columns , like the picket-pins of the elder gods . Across the canon in front of our camp , upon a grassy plateau which was faced by a wall of trap rock , apparently thirty or forty feet high , a band of mountain sheep soon attracted our attention . They were within long rifle range , but were not at all disturbed by our presence , nor hod they been disturbed by the road-builders who , under Captain Chittenden , were constructing a government road along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not the sheep could get down the almost perpendicular face of the chasm to the river to drink . It seemed to me impossible . Would they try it while we were there to see ? We all hoped so : and sure enough , late in the afternoon the word came to our tents that the sheep a. re ... Mug down . The President , with t and a towel around his neck , rhs shaving . One side of his face was halt shaved , and the other side lathered . Hofer and I started for a point on the hriak of the canon where we could have 0 heifer view . " lie dove , " said the President , " I hust see that . The shaving can wait , and the sheep wo n't . " So on he , came , accoutred as he was , r.oritless , listless , but not latlwrless , Ma ' towelless . Like the rest of us , his only thought was to see those sheep do their " stunt . " With glasses in hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to point , findiug a foothold ' where none appeared to oar eves , loosening fragments of the crumbling rocks as they came , now poised upon some narrow shelf and preparing for the next leap , zigzagging or piling-ire. ; straight down till the bottom was reaehed , rrwl not one accident or misstep amid all that insecure footing . I think the President was the most pleased of us all ; he laughed with the delight of it , and quite forgot his need of a hat and coat till I sent for them . In the night we heard the sheep going back ; we could tell by the noise of the Idling stones . In the morning I confidently expected to see some of them lying dead at the foot of the cliffs , but there they all were at the top once more , apparently safe and sound . They do , however , occasionally- meet with accidents in their perilous climbing , and their dead Ladies have been found at the foot of the rocks . Doubtless some point of rock to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent , or fell upon those in the lead . The next day , while the rest of us went lishing for trout in the Yellowstone , three or four miles above camp , over the roughest trail that we had yet traversed on horseback , the President , who never fishes unless put to it for meat , went off alone again with his lunch in his pocket , to stalk those sheep as he had stalked the elk , and to feel the old sportsman 's thrill without the use of firearms . Is do this involved a tramp of eight or ten miles down the river to a bridge and up the opposite bank . This he did , and ate his lunch near the sheep , and was back in camp before we were . We took some large cut-throat trout , as they are called , from the yellow mark across their throats , and I saw at short range a black-tailed deer hounding along in that curious , stiff-legged , mechanical , yet springy manner , apparently all four legs in the air at 011M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , affording a very singular spectacle . We ' spent two nights in our Tower Falls camp , and on the morning of the third day set out on our return to Fort Yellowstone , pausing at Yancey 's on our way , and exchanging greetings with the old frontiersman , who died a few weeks later . While in camp we always had a big fire at night in the open near the tents , and around this we sat upon logs or camp stools , and listened to the President 's talk . What a stream of it he poured forth ! and what a varied unit picturesque stream  --  anecdote , history , science , politics , adventure , literature ; bits of his experience as a ranchinan , hunter , Rough Rider , legislator , Ciyil Service commissioner , police commissioner , governor , president , ? the frankest confessions , the most telling criticisms , happy characterizations of prominent political leaders , or foreign rulers , or members of his own Cabinet ; always surprising by his candor , astonishing by his memory , and diverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has that rare type of memory which retains details as well as mass and generalities . One night something started him off on ancient history , and one would have thought he was just fresh from his college coarse in history , the dates and names and events Caine so readily . Another time he discussed palm-ontology , and rapidly gave the outlines of the science , and the main facts , as if he had been reading up on the subject that very day . lie sees things as wholes , and hence the relation of the parts comes can to him . At dinner , at the White House , the night before we started all the expedition , I heard him talking with a guest , an officer of the British army , Who was just back from India . And the extent and variety of his information about India and Indian history and the relations of the British government to it were extraordinary . It put the British major on his mettle to keep pace with him . One night in camp he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just written him from some place in Arizona . The Rough : Riders , wherever they are now , look to him in time of trouble . This one had come to grief in Arizona . Ile was in jail . So he wrote the President , and his letter ran something like this : ? " DEAR COLONEL , ? I am in trouble . I shot a lady in the eye , but I did not intend to hit the lady ; I was shooting at my wife . " And the presidential laughter rang out over the treetops . To another Rough Rider , who was in jail , accused of horse stealing , he had loaned two hundred dollars to pay counsel on his trial , and , to his surprise , in due time the money came back . The Ex-Rough wrote that his trial never came off . " We elected oar district attorney ; " and the laughter again sounded , and drowned the noise of the brook near by . On another occasion we asked the President if he was ever molested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with whom he had often come in contact . " Only once , " he said . The cowboys had always treated him with the utmost courtesy , both on the round-up and in camp ; " and the few real desperadoes I have seen were also perfectly polite . " Once only was he maliciously shot at , and then not by a cowboy nor a bona fide " bad man , " but by a " broad-hatted ruffian of a cheap and commonplace type . " He had been compelled to pass the night at a little frontier hotel where the barroom pied the whole lower floor , and in consequence , the only place whew flue guests of the hotel , whether druids sober , could sit . As he entered the he saw that every man there was being terrorized by a half-drunken ruffian wha stood in the middle of the floor with a revolver in each hand , compelling different ones to treat . " I went and sat down hirliiml stove , " said the President , " as far from him as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that I wore glasses , together with my evident desire to avoid a fight , apparently gave him the impression that I could be imposed upon with impunity . He very soon approached me , flourishing his two guns , and ordered sae to treat . I made no reply for sona ; moments , when the fellow became so threat en ing that I saw something had to Iv done . The crowd , mostly sheep-berth , and small grangers , sat or stood bath against the wall , afraid to move . I was unarmed , and thought rapidly . Saying , ' Well , if I must , I must , ' I got up as if to walls around him to the bar , then , as I got opposite him , I wheeled and fetched him as heavy in blow on the chin-point OS could strike . He went down like a steer before the axe , firing both guns into the ceiling as he went . I jumped on him . and , with my knees on his chest , disarmed him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me , and we hog-tied him and put him in an outhouse . " The President alludes to this incident in his Ranch Life , but does not gio ; the details . It brings out his mettle very distinctly . He told us in an amused way of the attempts of his political opponents at Albany , during his early career as a member of the Assembly , to besmirch his character . His outspoken criticisms : 111,1 denunciations had become intolerable to them , so they laid a trap for him , but be was not caught . His innate rectitude and instinct for the right course saved hint saved him many times since . I do not think that in any emergency he to debate with himself long as to the rizht course to be pursued ; he divines it lw kind of infallible instinct . His mot re so simple and direct that he finds - firtielit and easy course where another mac , whose eye is less single , would th.un , lcr and hesitate . ' 11 , c President unites in himself powers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has both physical and moral courage in a degree rare in history . Ile can stand calm and unflinching in the path of a charging grizzly , and he can confront With equal coolness and determination the predaceouseorporations and 1111011y powers of the country . Ile unites the qualities of the man of action with those of the scholar and writer ,  --  a nodal ' very rare combination . Ile unites the instincts and accomplishments of the best breeding and culture with the broadest democratic sympathies and affiliations . He is as happy with a fooitiersman like Seth Bullock as Siith a follow Harvard man , and Seth Bullock is happy , too . Ile unites great austerity with great good ature . He unites great sensibility , all great force and will power . He loves solitude , and he loves to be in the thick of the fight . His love of nature is only equaled by his love of the ways and marts of mem Ile is doubtless the most vital man on tile continent , if not on the planet , to-day . Ile is many-sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy ; the pressure is equal all around . His interest is as keen ins natural history as in economics , in literature as in statecraft , in the young poet as in the old soldier , in preserving peace as in preparing for war . And he can turn all his great power into the new channel on the instant . His interest in the whole of life , and in the whole life of the nation , never flags for a moment . His activity is tireless . All the relaxation he needs or craves is a change of work . He is like the farmer 's fields , that only need a rotation of crops . I once heard him say that all he e111,1 about being President was just the hig work . " During this our through the West , lasting over two months , he made nearly three hundred speeches ; and yet on his return Mrs. Borisevell told nut he looked as fresh and unworn : IS When he left home . We went up into the big geyser region with the big sh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big snow bank had to be shoveled through for ns before we got to the Golden Gate , two wiles above Mammoth Hot Springs . Beyond that we were at an altitude of about eight thousand feet , on a fairly level course that led now through woods , and now through open country , with the SHOW of a uniform depth of four or live feet , except as we neared the " formations , " where the subterranean warmth kept the ground bare . The roads had been broken and the snow packed for us by teams from the Fort , otherwise the journey would have been impossible . The President always rode beside the driver . From his youth , he said , this seat had always been the most desirable one to him . When the sleigh would strike the bare ground , and begin to drag heavily , he would bound runt nimbly and take to his heels , and then all three of us ? Major Pitcher , Mr. Childs , and myself ? would follow suit , sometimes reluctantly on my part . W'alking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to keep pace with such a walker as the President is . But he could not sit at his case and let those horses drag him in a sleigh over bare ground . When snow tintsreached , we would again quickly resume our seats . As one nears the geyser region , he gels the impression from the columns of steam going up here and there in the distance ? now ' from behind a piece of woods , now from out a hidden valley that he is approaching a manufacturing centre , or a railroad terminus . And when he begins to hear the hoarse snoring of deleted material Lirvis . Iii the grove about the barns there wsa eassit number , the most attractive 1 , , ore being the mountain bluebird . Th , birds we saw in all parts of the rad , . and at Norris 's there was an unii , a1 mother of them . How blue tires  --  breast and all . In voice and anniner they wore almost identical with ear bluebird. ' rite Western purple finch was a hand:Int here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an occaW , tern robin . A pair of Wild were feeding in the low , marshy croaml not over one hundred yards from us. but when we tried to approach nearer they took wing . A few geese and ducks saem to Winter in the Park . ' rile second morning at Norris 's , one of our teamsters , George Marvin , suddenly stropped dead from some heart affection , just astir ; had finished caring for his team . 11 was is great shock to us all . I never - iris a better non with a team than he was . I had ridden on the seat beside him all the day fires-ions . On one of the " formations " our teams had got mired in the soft , put tv-like mud , and at one time it looked as if they could never extricate themselves , awl I doubt if they could have , had it not been for the skill with which Marvin managed them . We started for the Grand Carlon up the ' Yellowstone that morning , and , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clear , frosty air , I set out a little while in advance of the teams . As I did so , I saw the President , accompanied by one of the teamsters , walking hurriedly toward the ham to pay his last respects to the body of Marvin . After we had returned to Mammoth hot Springs , he made inquiries for the young woman to whom he had been told that Marvin was engaged to be married . Ile looked her up , and sat a long time wills her in her borne , offering his sympathy , and speaking words of consolation . The act shows the depth and breadth of his humanity . At the Carlon Hotel the snow was very deep , and had become so soft from the warmth of the earth beneath , as well as from the son above , that we could only reach the brink of the Canon on skis . The President and Major Pitcher had used skis before , but I had not , and , starting out without the customary pole , I soon came to grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon in an awkward predicament . The more I struggled , the lower my bead and shoulders went , till only my heels , strapped to those long timbers , protruded above the snow . To reverse my position was impossible till some one conic , and reached me the end of a pole , and pulled me upright . But I very soon got the hang of the things , and the President and I quickly left the superintendent behind . I think I could have passed the President , but my manners forbade . lie was heavier than I was , and broke in more . When one of his feet would go down half a yard or more , I noted with admiration the skilled diplomacy he displayed in extricating it . The tendency of my skis was all the time to diverge , and each to go off at an Stelae angle to Illy main course , and I had consnintly to be on the alert to check this tendency . Paths hart been shoveled for ins along the brink of the Canon , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Carlon was nearly free from snow , and was a grand spectacle , by far the grainiest to be seen in the Park . ' rite President told us that once , when pressed for meat , while returning through here from one of his hunting trips , he had made his way down to the river that we sass ' rusting along beneath us , and had caught some trout for dinner . Necessity alone could induce him to fish . Across the head of the Falls there was a bridge of snow and ice , upon which we were told that the coyotes passed . As the season progressed , there would come a day when the bridge would not be safe . It would be interesting to know if the coyotes knew when this tune arrived . The only use thing we saw in the Callon was an osprey perched upon a rock opposite us . Near the falls of the Yellowstone , as at other places see hail visited , a squad of soldiers bad their winter quarters . The President always called on them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their housekeeping arrangements , and conversed freely with them . In front of the hotel were some low hills separated by gentle valleys . At the President 's suggestion , he and I raced on our skis down those inclines . We had only to stand up straight , and let gravity do the rest . As we were going swiftly down the side of one of the hills , I saw out of the corner of my eye the President taking a header into the snow . The snow had given way beneath him , and nothing could save him from taking the phinge . I do n't know whether I called out , or only thought , something about the downfall of the administration . At any rate , the administration Was down , and pretty well buried , but it was quickly on its feet again , shaking off the snow with a boy 's laughter . I kept straight on , and very soon the laugh was on me , for the treacherous snow sank beneath me , and I took a header , ton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . The spirit of the boy was in the that day about the Carlon of the ' Venom:tune , and the biggest boy of us all was President Roosevelt . The snow was getting so soft in the middle of the day that our return to the ' Mammoth Hot Springs could no longer be delayed . Accordingly , we Were 111 , the morning , and ready to start no the home journey , a distance of twenty by four o'clock . The : MOW bore up the horses well till mid-forenoon , when it began to give way beneath them . But by very careful in:wage/tient we ladled through without serious delay , and were back again at the house of Major Pitcher in time for luncheon , being the only outsiders who had ever made the tour of the Park so early in the season . A few days later I bade good-by to the President , who went on his way to California , while I made a loop of travel Is Spokane , and around through Idaho and Montana , and had glimpses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon forget .
