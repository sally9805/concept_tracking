... now promises Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings , Which time shall bring to ripeness . W HY do the mockers call it the " Woolly West " ? This is a question that must go unanswered , for no answer is to be found in any mind . A woolly man is not unknown in any of the haunts of men , and some professors have met him in the class-room . " Explain the pessimism of Ecclesiastes , " said the professor of a not fardistant university . " I do not understand the question , " answered the football giant . " What is the difficulty ? " " I do n't know what the question means . " " You know what Ecclesiastes means ? " " Oh yes , " said the captain of elevens ; " it is a book in the Bible . " " Then it must be pessimism that troubles you , " suggested the amazed ( he was young ) professor . " That 's it ; that 's it , " bubbled. the catapult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ignorant of that . You know the words pessimism and optimism , do you not ? Pessimism and optimism , optimism and pessimism ; you certainly know what they mean ? " " Oh yes , " replied he of the wellgreaved shins ; " I know what they mean , but I ca n't tell them apart . " Now here was intellectual wool ; but you will not find . its like in the farreaching West , ? or if you do , its victim will be on his way back East with pessimistic views of the possibilities of the new country . The prevailing element of the intellectual atmosphere of the West is ozone . It is in this far region that we find the adventurous colonists of the country . Individual and social traits in Voa . CIX , ? No , 650. - 25 this land of at least outward equality are atmospheric and geographical . They may be realizations of our Western visions , accentuations of proclivities not wholly unfamiliar to us , but with us they are not traits , as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apparent misuse of the word Western , but it was deliberate , for we of the Atlantic fringe especially are of the Western habit of nearest Europe , while they of the plains and mountains are , to some extent , our Orientals . When we go among them we visit our dreamers of dreams , differing , from the nature of their blood , from the star-gazers of the real East because the best among them dream things that they can do . When we turn our hacks upon the " twin cities " or upon Duluth , we leave the meeting of the sections . Emigration within our boundaries , as they say in the newer part of the country , has moved by jumps . First went the New-Englander and the western New-Yorker into that Northwestern territory which is ours ? and this can not be too frequently emphasized ? by the gracious desire of Lord Shelburne to do his best for reconciliation with the conquering colonies , and against the strong opposition of Vergennes . This is well to think of when we are erecting statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in peace , we would now be contemplating the possibility of the adoption of Chamberlain 's hostile tariff policy by the people dwelling on what would have been , if France had prevailed , Canadian lands , but which now constitute the States of Ohio , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , and Wisconsin . These broad , rich States were settled from the farthest East , and are the better for it , as the East is better for the projection of its stock into the middle of the land . When the time came , the movement westward made a new leap , and this time the children of the Middle West took the step forward . It is interesting , however , that in the midway of our national life , when the seething of adventure was in the young blood of the East , the youth of New England and of its neighbors sailed round the Horn , or toiled in prairie-schooners over the mountains , to the gold - fields of the Pacific , so that these and their descendants coming inward toward the Rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England kin settled on the plains and ranges which had been skipped by the eager hunters for the gold of California . Nowhere better than in Duluth is illustrated this meeting of the sections . In one end of the town , which , years ago , began the race so joyously , fell heavily , gathered itself up and went forward so bravely and so successfully , ? in one end of this young community are the houses and shops of the East , the temples to the so-called Anne , the shop-windows shining with the colonial mahogany of Grand Rapids , Michigan , or behind which are displayed the most recent additions to the joys and comforts of life ; where also , as in. the older parts of the country , you may find the most talked-about novel of the minute , " just in " or " just out . " In the other end of the same town are the beginnings of settlements . The first part being graudiloquized as " residential , " after the manner prevailing in Woolet and elsewhere , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the houses in this part are home-made , constructed out of flotsam and jetsam , while the aspect of the spot as a whole is that of new countries generally , suggestive of such haste to get to work that there has been no time for building homes , the earnest " developers of the country " being content with shelters . There are other indications of the mixing , for meeting thus always comes in the end to mixing ; this , however , is the indication afforded by the look of the town . These two parts constitute its features , The dividing-line is very distinct , but the seed of culture is germinating in the shop-windows . Here we catch , among the people who are laying out the territory of the great Northwest , a glimpse of a social phenomenon that is sure to grow on us as we wander farther on toward Asia . The leaders and lieutenants of industry in the smaller towns have not only great conceptions of enterprise and Oriental dreams of future magnificence , but they are possessed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? like in size ? of the more thickly settled , the more finished parts of the country . Indeed , it is just because the smaller town in the East is rounded out and complete , as it were , and has got through with the disfiguring process of growth , that people there begin to fit their minds and habits to their simple environments . It is the impatient custom to call these people of the rural town of the elder land human vegetables , perhaps because it is pleasant to resort to them after a too rich dish of the red blood of the money-market or of the ranches . At any rate , throughout this Northwest country we find the city man in evidence , usually managing the bank , " making the advances , " and , in a large , general way , keeping up the connection of farms and mines , of railroads and of " bunches " of cattle , with the investors of capital . Usually he is the kind of mail whom we expect to see back in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of man who will suddenly appear as the owner of a box at the Metropolitan Opera House , having plunged into the society which is stretching out its hands in welcome to all the millions that are willing to come its way . It seems to be much easier to a man at , say , Butte to grab a " grip " and to board a train for Chicago or New York than would be even the contemplation of such a journey to a man at Keokuk , or at Dayton , or even at Elmira . Tf the Butte man wants a million dollars for an enterprise , he takes a train for the most likely lending centre . He carries his dreams with him as security ; usually the dreams take , and often they materialize . Let it not be understood that dreams as security are always to be classified with the visions of Colonel Sellers . These dreams make our West our Orient , and investment in them has enormously increased the wealth of the whole country . Besides , there is calculation behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ; moreover , there are the character and credit which have been gained by the dreamers whose dreams have come true . If the man from Keokuk or Royalton wants to borrow $100,000 , his desire alone is quite likely to give him pause , and he is noticed by his neighbors for many days at a time figuring on the backs of envelopes . Then be does a deal of letterwriting , some cautious telegraph-sending , breaking out at lest with a telephone message . When he goes to the bank for the loan , he takes good , substantial securities with him . printed on bond-paper , and on his return he very likely tries to make on his borrowed capital one or two per cent . in excess of the rate which he must pay , while the Far - Western brother is hoping for something more than a paltry doubling of his borrowed capital . The air is full of the stimulus and the mystery of chance . It can not be escaped . One is not inclined to fly from it , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the dusty road between St. Paul and Minneapolis is the wagon of the fortune-teller ? the selfsame gypsy who used to and to the mystery of our childhood 's Eastern woods , but now he is near cities ; and in the railroad yard in Duluth we find the rich blue private car with its silvered letters announcing that it is the palmist 's car , and that the palmist will tell his visitor where to strike for fortune , " between the hours of 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. " Still , these plungers into the dark mysterious things , these snappers-up of every offered opportunity for wealth , are but the restless and often the unsuccessful . The dreams that go back East as security are not likely to be as unsubstantial as the fortune-teller 's prediction . They are the visions of men who know what is ? who have imaginations which not only tell them what they may expect , but they also convince the man back in the Atlantic seaport who wishes his idle dollars to be doing something . There is nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements of the men who are building up the West , and who are really making the empire west of the Mississippi . We have heard of the " pioneers who go out into the wilderness , and whose brawny arms have transformed dark forests into sunny and smiling farms . " Poetry has been written about these pioneers , imaginative pictures have been painted of them , speeches have been made to them , and votes have been coaxed from them ; but the pioneer of our time is not the pioneer of the seventeenth century who sought religious and civil liberty on the shores of Massachusetts Bay . There is a vast difference between a migration and a raid . There is a distinction , which is to be observed , between the man who moves with his family to a new home and the man who goes out alone in the excitement of a new discovery of gold or silver to get his share and to bring it back , or the man and the woman who go out with the hunters after gold to bunt them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " pioneer " has gone by in most of the Far-Western country , although some of his habits remain . The men who do the American country good are the same kind in the Far West and in the Middle West . In the Middle NiTt the pioneers were the seekers after new homes , but in the farther country most of the Americans who first travelled out were not of the settling or of the settled class . They who went to build homes stopped on the plains of Dakota , and many of them were foreigners . They who went to the mines carried in their company the attendant . vices . They who went to herd cattle had the stir of adventure , often of thriftlessness , in. their blood . The vices went with them also , for they fasten on the nomadic , and the vicious pitched their tents for faro and bad whiskey and other temptations where they might he within easy reach . As the railroads moved their tracks out , the dens faced the railroad track ; and once , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrive in a sage-brush country , I saw , at the side of the train , on the board walk which ran between the station and the saloon , a faro-table which was presided over by a lady with golden curls , red cheeks , and a pink Mother Hubbard . These things have changed in older and better days , and though a red shade now and then flutters in the wind of the main street , the second lot of Americans have been received , and these are the real builders of the empire . These decent Americans do not care to dwell and to bring up their children in the midst of an immorality which is so prevailing as to make the social atmosphere of the community , and therefore the tough and his companions are moved off quickly by a vigilance committee , or else they slink back into slums , thereby increasing the slununiness . The process of human betterment has not been entirely completed . Time is required to bring about all that civilization demands , without counting the luxuries which it may bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved to wrath by the obstreperous viciousness of a town that is a division headquarters , sent word to it that unless it mended its morals he would take his shops away from it ? which in reality meant that he would move away most of the population . It is impossible , apparently , that there shall be a frontier , or anything like it , without the youth who have wildness in the blond . It is the fashion to call the life of the ranches and of the mining towns free and unconventional . The idea that is hoped to be conveyed by this overtaxed word unconventionality is , as the mundane says , fetching , for it means relief from restraining artificialities ; but experience teaches us that there is no decent . community without its conventions , only these conventions differ in different places . There are , indeed , artificial restraints which are irksome , and apparently arbitrary and meaningless , but it is a great deal better , for the community and for the individual , that they be observed . Unrestrained freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that of the beer-cellar in Bohemia or of a dance-hall in the Far West . The young man who seeks in the Northwest liberty from all the sedate checks of civilized public opinion , including those which deserve the disdain of the intellectual , has before him varied oppor tunities . How he is to come ant is the problem of his own nature . He may become a cattle-thief or a steady " puncher " ; he may take to liquor and gambling or he may become a " leading citizen " ; he may become a politician or a maker of politicians ; he may graduate as a typical cowboy nuisance , wear queer clothes , shoot off pistols and strange oaths to frighten tenderfeet , or he may become a real ranchman ? a " builder-up of empire , " to use one of our newest phrases , ? with a strong hankering after churches , schools , broadcloth , and other conventions from which in his youth he fled . The tendency of good Americans and of good American communities is in this direction ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire respect in others by respecting one 's self . it is the Americans , the sons of Americans , who impress themselves upon the far-out lands , as the same people have put their stamp upon the institutions of the Middle West . The foreigners who come to anything in the one as in the other part of the country reach their climacteric of citizenship by becoming Americanized . Politics is perhaps queer , to say the least , in the newer parts of the country ; buL while , by reason of the hammer of the reformers , who love their country with a much stronger and more unselfish passion than do the self-dubbed optimists , the public is making up its mind to improve politics , still we can not say that pnlitical vagaries , in municipal affairs , for example , are peculiar to the Far West . We continue to possess our " halls " and our " organizations " in the fringe along the Atlantic , even if it is true that in some respects , where there has been exposure and where penalties have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it used to be . Perhaps it may be said that the East is gradually waking up to the fact that party politics may afford virtuous occupation and be beneficial to the state , while a perceptible part of the men of the Northwest , or the Far West , are still regarding government , with its resources and its powers , as a quarry ? and this virtuously , it may he . A quarry it is in sooth , to all parts of the country . There are three ways of looking at politics in our dear victimized land . In the East the tendency of the class is to take an office for " the money in it . " although there are some men , who have arrived or who have inherited , who like to do the work of real statesmanship , or of something nearly akin to it . There are also those most dangerous enemies of the public weal , mere opportunists . It is true that all , or nearly all , democratic progress is made through compromises , but there are compromises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compromises looking toward securing a reelection at the cost of the good cause ; the latter are made by the mere opportunists . In the Middle West , men who have made firm their place in the community and who want greater advancement in the esteem of their fellows , having played the game of business to a successful end , strive for the honors of public office , spurred by their lifelong desire to win . It is true that the spirit of winning is essentially an American spirit , and that its excesses blemish other activities than those of intercollegiate athletics ; but in endeavoring to draw between the sections a distinction as to motives for the avocation of politics one can not intend a sharp distinction , but can only hope to catch the prevailing instinct . In the Middle West there seems to be a trifle more of the personal element in the political rage ; the man who is at its head is the party . In the East it is likely to be the mart who is the most adroit captain of the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader is usually the man who can get the most out of the nation for the good of his neighbors , or of his own town , or of his State , or of his section . These , more or less , are sectional idiosyncrasies . Out in the Far West men go into political life for the advantage of their own community . They live in that part of the country which , more than any other , is possessed of the colonial spirit ; they are the children of the nation ? and the favored children . When the adventurous , good and bad , had filled the land behind them with the glory of the great territory beyond the Mississippi , then the real builders went out , and with these came real exploitation and real business . For twenty years the great Northwest has been growing in such a way that its endeavors , covering this brief distance in the pathway of the nation , have added so many new States to the Union that in a few years more the dominant power in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of population . This is a prosaic fact , but full of significance to the States whose capital is seeking pecuniary progeny on these plains and under these mountains . The vision of these people is very far ; their dreams have the right to soar higher than the dreams of other people ; their own achievements , discoveries , " strikes , " justify their belief that under the soil and in the soil is wealth the like of which no land has yet produced . They tell the nation that the welfare of the whole country depends upon their welfare , and that it is the duty of the nation to pour its money into railroads , into irrigation , into a thousand and one works which will aid their commerce . The commercial spirit is set on fire by the bigness of the plains and of their seeming opportunities . It appears to the makers of this empire as though it " would pay " the whole world to turn its saved-up millions into canals for the conveyance of fruitful streams from the mountains to the brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commerce and " output " become rhythmic , melodious , harmonious , sounding in great and inspiriting measures . Alfalfa 's three annual crops grow to the sound of six-footed verses , and the stream from the irrigation ditch babbles a golden tune to the fruit-trees that stagger under their rich and luscious burdens , growing out of land which but for those nourishing streams would still be blown sand held together by the roots of sage-brush . What could not the great government do if its people in the East would but tax themselves more heavily for this land of miracle and prodigy ! The individual , however , has worked these wonders . The railroad that has justified its building with profits from the beginning of its existence is the railroad which has never received a dollar of given money or an acre of public land from the government . Other railroads have become incomebreeders since they ceased to regard the beneficence of the great father at Washington as sufficient for their day and generation . " It is too big for private citizens and for private enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequent adoption of enterprise by the paternal government has invariably brought injury to the enterprise itself . The politics of the Northwest is for the Northwest , because the people out there believe in their land , and the politicians are of the people as well as the servants of the people ; but the Northwest itself is , as it stands ? to use the vernacular ? the work of the earnest , eager , sound reasoning , sane American citizen . To none other , not even to his government , is the glory due . He has made it , and the fact that the government anticipated him in the matter of fostering a railroad may be a pure accident . His life-giving enterprise found the capabilities of the land , and its development , its fruitage , is his and his alone . Its great railroads tell the tale as they run their courses . They leave the waters of the Mississippi and the lands whose crumbling iron ore helps to make us the richest country in the world . What wonder is it that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the gypsy tells fortunes midway between the twin cities , to the wondering and helpless multitude who dwell near the most magical of nature 's storehouses , where the forest is cut into millions of dollars only to leave behind a far greater number of millions under the tangled roots of its stumps ! Leaving this abode of wealth behind it , the road runs through the wheat-lands of the Red River , the cattle plains , the copper and silver , the varied agriculture west of the mountains , on to the great timber of Puget Sound . And in running thus through these varied gifts of nature , the railroads have nourished industry , have stimulated the arts of production , have taught the unready and have aided the ready , in obedience to the great and universal law that one who would serve profitably to himself must serve profitably to others . In twenty years , since Mr. Villard 's company of distinguished guests crossed the continent to see and participate in the completion of the first of the great northern roads , well-built towns have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of nature itself has been changed . The once brown plains , whose many unfenced acres were seized perhaps in obedience to the law of seeming necessity ? for necessity is oftenest seeming ,  - -  but contrary to the law of legis/atures , are greening under the influence of irrigation , and the husbandman once more , as in all times past , is moving on the herdsman and is driving the cattle into smaller and richer fields , to the betterment of all . All this that we see , the growing splendor of the land , is the work of the individual man , either alone or in voluntary association with others . Together men have led the mountain streams to the arid sage-brush plains , and alone man has made green and fruitful squares from forbidding bits of territory . These green oases in the Great American Desert are the fine achievements of the Western men who are , let us remember , Eastern men and sons or grandsons of Eastern men , working with their own and with the capital of other Eastern men who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these achievements are tributes to the individual and a great sustainer of the old-fashioned faith in individualism . It ought not to be possible to look upon the wonderful gains of this wonderful region without the reflection that the individual has ventured millions and succeeded , where government has granted thousands and partly failed . This is not the place for the discussion of the fundamental difference between those who want the government to try to do more than they have done and those who think that the private citizen will continue to do better and more wisely than the political power can ever do , but there is room for such discussion , which , however , as in almost all human problems , will doubtless be settled in the end by hard experience ; but this is now the truth , that , whatever may be done in the time to come , men unaided by government , or despite the efforts of government to aid , have created a rich empire out of lands once ridiculed as the " Banana Tract , " and that men =cherished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the manufactories of the Fast , the corn and wheat prairies of the Middle West , the cotton-plantations of the South , across the plains to the Pacific coast , gold and timber bearing , and that , farther still , the pathway is going on across the Pacific , so that this marvellous Western empire of ours is looking onward with wise prescience into mysterious and still undeveloped Asia . Can government , with its little warfleets and its pampering Laws , which , like all pampering , weakens character , expect to do as much for the welfare of the world of men as the men of the world have done for themselves and their fellows ? the men whose fleets of peaceful commerce far outnumber destructive and protective squadrons ; the men whose wealth is greater , whose intelligence is keener and is better instructed , and whose wisdom in these affairs is larger than the wisdom which government has manifested in the management of its own ? Very little of what the Far West has grown to be is due to Congress , or to Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with the administration of public business peculiarly interesting to that big and reaching part of the land . The government has , indeed , accomplished something through its scientific men of the Geological Survey ; it has , however , wasted its public lands , although some of them have gone cheaply to worthy citizens whose enterprise has stirred the pulses of life in seemingly dead lands , and who have thereby added to the country 's wealth . The government has been preyed upon by the seekers of fortunes , and much of its land has been stolen . It has act a bad example to those pioneers who should be thrifty but who hope only to be lucky . It has not conducted its affairs in a businesslike manner , but has invited people to cozen it . Politics has been mixed up with the land business and with the cattle business . This , however , is to say as slightly as possible the word which must be said by one writing of the Far West . Bad men and women always go in the early trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth while , the men of character and of achievement go after them and send the others to their holes . This is what is happening in the West . The good and conservative citizen who acts with wisdom as well as with energy is on the plains and in the mountains and forests . He has developed the riches of the empire and he has improved its character ; but it should always be borne in mind that the empire looks watchfully to Washington as to its parent . The nation built these States , while in the East the States built the nation ; therefore much of the paternalistic sentiment entertained by men who have nevertheless worked wonders without aid , and who will work all the greater wonders in the future if they are left to their own wisdom and their own courage . Besides , paternal aid is invariably accompanied by paternal restraint . This great West has its difficulties , as have other sections . Cities growso rapidly that they are compelled , for their grownup necessities , to run in debt so largely that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more years than they ought unwatered and unpaved . Moreover , the good men are so busy attending to the great affairs which increase the wealth of the nation and of the community , as well as reward the adventurous with fortunes , that they have no time for public improvements or for local politics . Therefore we have tho dusty streets and the rude sidewalks ; therefore we have the distinguished and eccentric criminals . Still , these small evils adjust themselves in the end . The troubles are what one sees on the surface of life , but when one rubs the dust of the unpaved streets out of one 's eyes , and looks about him at the dwellings in which men and women live , and when one enters there , the virtue and force of the individual 's effort and of his character are evident once more , as they have been in the work which he has accomplished in the material world . Collectively , the people of Seattle , for example , may leave their streets unpaved and unwatered , but individually they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights , force green lawns with abundant water , and plant along the borders of the street the planes , the elms , the maples , and the red-berried mountain-ash . These leaders of great hosts of activity in business , in industry , in mining , in transportation , in the thousand walks out-of-doors , may not yet have had time to study and to act upon municipal and police problems , but they have had time not only carefully and surely to work out the gigantic problems of their imaginations , but to make a within - doors most attractive and most stimulating . In time this American individual who has built the empire and has made himself a home will be comprehended in his just proportions . There is no wool in the Western mind , and there is no decadence in the Western conscience .
