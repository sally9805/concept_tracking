txt It will not be necessary for gas consumers who have changed their addresses - since May , 1906 , to fill out claim blanks in order to get their share of the $12,000 , - 000 gas rebate ? fund . In cases where a Consumer has moved a , check will be sent to his or her old address to cover the amount of rebate accruing on gas used at the old address . If the branch Post Office of his old address knows his new one he will receive his check . So , if he has any doubt of the Post officcs knowledge he can notify the gas company of his change of address . This splitting up of checks is making the work of the auditors and others in charge of the refunding complicated , as it materially increases the number of checks which have to be sent out . On this question of changed addresses , 1-lenry 3 . Cochran , the auditor appointed by Commissioner Shields . has sent this letter to THE TIMES : To the Editor of The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gas rebates in this morning 's Thema I Was quoted as saying that in cases of change In address consumers will have to till out a separate form , stating the time they lived ' in another location , and these blanks are being provided upon application at any of ? the branch disbursing bureaus . I fear this may be misleading to your readers and might cause bome of them to take unnecessary trouble . When a consumer has changed address during the period of overpayment , refund checks will go to each address for the overcharges at such address without his filling Irp any blank ; although If the change has been made BO far back that the Post Office Is not likely to forward mail from his old address to his new one , it might be well for him to notify the company by letter or postal card of such change , Yours very truly , 11E'NRY Z. COCHRAN , Auditor . March 9 , 1909.                    @
