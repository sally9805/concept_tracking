IN presenting the first study of Matthew Harris Jouett , Kentucky 's masterpainter , * I promised a second article , upon Jouett 's Kentucky Children : for I know of no American painter , and of few European ones , who have so completely captured the beads and hearts of these little people , and transfixed both permanently to canvas . Jouett possessed to a remarkable degree the faculty to delineate child life successfully , that is , truthfully . This ability is most rare , and requires an artist whose heart is as simple and gentle and pure as the infant he paints . Only by the possession , in smile degree , of the endearing qualities the child possesses can an adult get near enough to a child 's life to bring forth spontaneously the child 's instinct , and without this such delineation of children as we have from the hand of Jouett would be impossible . Jouett did not paint children as diminutive men and women , or as young bodies with old heads , as most painters have done . Nor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the case even in otherwise good work , but each one is a portrait with its own separate entity . He put the child mind on the canvas ; he worked from the inside out , and gave us the child 's individuality , * flarper'N Magazine for May , 1599. feeling , and naturalness , just as Vandyck has given them in his famous picture , in the Turin Gallery , of the children of Charles the First , where the little Duke of York , in a blue silk frock and infant cap , with an apple in his hand , is the acme of child portraiture . How rare this quality is , even among the great old masters , will come to the mind of every one as he or she runs over , in memory , the ninny paintings of the Virgin Mary with the infant Christ . The face of the child Christ may be radiant with divinity , but it seldom beams with infantile innocence and trustfulness. instead it has mature self - reliance , And that is why so many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not absolutely disappointing . Of course it goes without saying that to portray child life truthfully is one of the most difficult accomplishments of high art . - Were it not so we should not see so many dismal failures . Simplicity is the key-note of success , and it is the quality most wanting in picture-making ? and a good portrait is essentially a picture . A child 's temperament , too . is almost . a caprice , varying- with the changing thought , and therefore it is all but impossible to fix its reflex upon canvas . One secret . of Jouett 's success in painting children was the intensity of his love for them , which enabled him to understand them and be one with them . At the age of twenty-four Jouett mar-vied Miss Margaret Henderson Allen , and is hen the artist died , fifteen years later , he was the father of eight chil-dren . Jouett loved his home , and it was a sore trial for him to leave it each win-ter , as he had to do , to seek his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on es his th oughts were always with them , and lie writes to an old friend , Law-rence Leavy. from on board the Mississippi boat , as he was re-tu ? ning From New Or-leans , in April of 1823 : " For years I have not known what it was to enjoy this life to the brim 's full . When at home I have been perpetually ad-monished , by my em-barrassments , of the necessity of leaving objects I will not say how dear to me . I go from home and lo-cate for months . Tile ! ' come increasing rest-less longings for the little home where are garnered up the price-less treasures of my Heart . 1 do not verily believe that there lives - under the sun a being whose thoughts burn more upon any sub-ject than mine do upon my wife and children the combined result , I am sure , of their worth and my extreme weakness . The Christian turns not eye of faith and hope oftener upon his Maker and Redeemer than I do bend my thoughts upon those little divinities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They bow me down under prosperity . Sometimes they are for me ? sometimes against me . They unite the opposite qualities of patron saint and temptation 's devils . " A fortnight later he writes to time same friend : " I had JOUETT 'S KENTUCKY CHILDREN . the happiness to find my little establishment in as good condition as I could wish or ever contemplated . My part-. nor cheerful , beautiful , and well , and six little ones with health on every cheek , joy in every eye , and a tale of affection upon every tongue . " Another equation , that must be given its full value in Jouett 's make-up to successfully master children , as an artist , was his abundant spirits . He enjoyed to romp and play with them as though he were their own age . His sprightliness shows itself when he writes : " Little Miss Mary is a sweet girl , and bids fair to make one of the prettiest , charmingest little creatures in the world . When she left Kentucky she seemed without form . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it he to this most ripening climate . One thing is certain ? she is budding now almost perceptibly to the eye . I question whether the bodice of the morning will last until her unlacing at night , so fast is she blooming into form and womanhood . " Although written in a playful mood , these words show the faculty of keen observation , noting every little change , which is so essential in the delineation of child life , and particularly perceptible in Jouett 's pictures of Mary Wickliffe and of Mary Barry , and of Humphrey Marshall and of the Mitchell children . But in no work of Jonett are his close observation and facility of expression more conspicuous than in a slight penand-ink sketch of his wife and two children ? a drawing that any master might be proud to have produced , so imperative is the speaking power of the line . One can almost see the slippery soap the mother-hand is fishing for in the bowl the little daughter holds , to wash the hands the truant boy holds out . The expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole palette of paint could hardly do more . It seems , indeed , as though the simple line must have reached its limiton this little bit of yellow paper five inches square . That Jouett found good subjects in his own household is further shown by a superb picture of the painter 's wife holding her first-born child . The subject fixes the date of the painting early in the artist 's career , about 1814 , when Jonett was twenty-four . And a child 's portrait could not be painted more truthfully than this one . The simplicity of the composition , the directness of the execution , the beauty of the pose , the strength of the drawing , the charm of the color , and the dexterity exhibited in the use of pigments , all contribute to make Ibis a great picture . George Payne Jouett , the eldest child of our painter . inherited both the artistic and the fighting qualities of his father . He fell leading his regiment on the Federal side at the battle of Perrysville , Kentucky , October 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , and abandoned both law and art ( he having shown decided ability as a modeller ) to go forth to serve his country . In the sympathetic portrait of little Mary Barry ( the daughter of Jackson 's Postmaster-General , for whom the office was elevated to a cabi n et position ) , painted when she was seven , we see dolma 's power of insight into the child life be paints . She was a great sufferer from hip-disease , and &mett; has caught , in a masterful way , the sweet , sad , yet unusually lovely expression of the poor child 's face , which bespeaks a spirit worn and chastened by suffering , and which was yielded up to her Maker soon after Jouett limited her portrait . Her character was reflected in her face ? as some lines written on her death puts it , " She carne to earth to show us what the angels are . ' Particular reference is made in my former article to Jouett 's portraits of the Wickliffe children , and promise given of the reproduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wickliffe mansion in Lexington , where three of Jouett 's finest works hung three years ago , when I saw them , was for half a century noted for its dignified hospitality and for the many distinguished guests it had entertained . Tiro bead of the house was known as " the Duke . " from his wealth and aristocratic bearing , and for loin Jouett , who was his personal friend . painted eight portraits , including his three daughters , Mary , Margaret , and Sarah . These pictures were painted in 1825 , when the subjects were respectively eight , ten , and eighteen years of age . Mary became the wife of John Preston , Margaret married ' William Preston . minister to Spain under the Buchanan administration , and Sarah was Mrs. Woolley . These portraits are of particular interest as show -- ing Jouett 's care in individualizing : each child has the family traits well defined , and - yet each child has its separate entity strongly marked . The portrait reproduced of little Mary Wickliffe ( Mrs. John Preston ) , with her fair skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue sash , and in her hands a pet dove , thrown against a delicate blue backg ? ound , could easily be mistaken for one of Greuze 's best works , an light is its tone and so chaste its effect ; while there are an animation and expression in the face that raise it above the general prettiness of Greuze . The background , that rock which all artists dread , is a skilful lay ing on of blues in imperceptible gradations , the entire color scheme of the picture being subtle and tender and refined . This panel should find an abiding-place in a public gallery where it could be seen and studied . Jouett 's pencil has handed down more portraits of girls than of boys , owing riot so TV uch to the greater vanity of the fair sex as to the greater partiality parents naturally have to perpetuate the beauty of their girls . It can be seen , however , from the portrait of Humphrey Marshall . that sex had no controlling power over Jouett 's pencil , and that lie was as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . The little fellow had just been snatched from a bed of fever when Jouett was called in to limn his portrait. , and thus we have this interesting early portrait of a son of Kentucky who was destined , later , to be heard much of in the halls of national legislation and from the fields of fratricidal strife . For this boy became the noted General Humphrey Marshall of the Confederacy , in the %vat. between the States , having previously served several terms in Congress . Katherine Praither was a lovely girl , and grew to be a most attractive woman . She married the Reverend Doctor Edward P. Humphrey , of Louisville , a Presbyterian divine with more than a local reputation , and her dainty portrait , by Jouett , at the age of six , is the treasured possession of her son . It has , as usual , the Jouett quality of severe simplicity , no striving after effects , and is painted with a directness that makes one feel , If it is as easy as it looks , why do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children from the hand of Kentucky 's master-painter are Louis Marshall , the younger brother of Humphrey , at the age of two , in a little white garment , holding a shell to his ear ; Archibald Dunbar when a boy of twelve , in a scarlet jacket , and with a large rock for a background ; Frances Paca Dalian ) , now the venerable widow of Doctor Robert . Peter , of Winton , near Lexington , Kentucky , at the age of twelve , with her younger sister , Elizabeth Meredith , painted on one canvas , both ' dressed in white muslin , the elder 's frock being relieved by a scarlet belt , and the younger 's by a light blue one . Mrs. Peter also owns a picture by Jouett , of her mother , with a quaint old-fashioned baby in a white dress and cap and pink sack , with a finger in its mouth , sitting on the lap . Jouett painted a S I ilar composition of Mrs. Theodosia Griffith with her daughter Mary , now owned in Natchez , Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jouett is his unfinished panel of Martha and Alexander Kitchell . It is rich in sentiment , character , and grace , beautiful in drawing and in color , yet for it there was only one sitting . For this last reason it is technically of great interest , as it is by his unfinished work and careful study-sketches that an artist 's instincts and methods can best be studied and understood . They really teach more to those qualified to understand them than finished pictures do , for they show what leads up to the completed work . The modern character of this study-sketch is very remarkable . It recalls the work of Couture , or of his pupil William Hunt , more than of a master who lived before these artists were born . The subjects were niece and nephew of Jouett 's wife , and the picture was begun only a short time before the painter 's hand was at rest . That the same man could paint the John Grimes and the Mary Wickliffe , the Mrs. Irvine and the Mitchell children , appears to border on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandyck and Couture , all in one man . And this , remember , too , without what to-day is looked upon as indispensable for the American Who wants to paint ? foreign influence and instruction . Forturiately Jouett was riot able to have foreign influence and instruction , or he might have been spoiled , as so many have been since his time . Doubtless the ready answer to this will be , " But all who can paint are not gifted with the divine spark of genius . " True . But without genius how many good capable men , who have shown creditable work , with American feeling and virility , come back from the study of art abroad bereft of these good qualities , and with their individuality smothered ! Nothing takes the place of what they have lost , and they become mere servile imitators of their foreign roasters .
