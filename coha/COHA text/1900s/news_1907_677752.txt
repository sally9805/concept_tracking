txt " The great financial promoters , organizers , executives of America. , are worthy of recognition and reward . They work as hard as any of us , and their work is ' absolutely necessary to the full production of the riches out of which are paid here in America the highest wages in the world . " These words were used by Mr. HEARST in his Jamestown speech on Labor Day . Mr. HEARST had more to say in praise of captains of industry , and in defense of the wealthy , whose fortunes , " called their own , " are " seldom spent in extravagance and luxury upon themselves , but are put back into new Industries , to produce more wealth , and give employment to more men . " Mr. IlnansT 's defense of his class Is not so surprising and gratifying as his expression of it . We regret that we can not equally approve Mr. HEARST 'S defense of labor 's demands upon capital . Essentially it Is the same as Mr. Gomrens 's theory that the time to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. HEARST agree that the chief source of prosperity is the consumptive demand for goods created by the disbursement of a large wage fund , and contrariwise that the decline of prosperity is due to the decrease of consumption characteristic of a decreasing reward to labor . Hence , if goods are left in stock the way to move them off the counters is not to reduce prices and attract buyers , but to raise wages , and enable consumers to pay perpetually rising prices . We are not now concerned with the fallacy of the general proposition , but rather with the error In Mr. HEABsT 's exposition of it . Brick , iron , concrete , lumber , all rose In San Francisco , he says , and there was no criticism of that , because it was recognized that , prices are subject to supply and demand . " But the union laborer did live in San Francisco , and was subject to the trying conditions there , and the price of his labor was also subject to the law of supply and demand . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , land a imighty cry against the unreasonable " demands of the unions . " It is absurd to compare the price of labor with the price of commodities in ' responsiveness to supply and ' demand when any one is free to buy or not to buy everything except labor , and when attempts toward freedom in making large wage contracts are followed by such disorders as were reported from San Francisco as occurring there at almost the exact hour Mr. HpAnsT was speaking at Jamestown How " canMr . HEARST assert that the price of labor is subject to supply - and deinand when those who supply it and those who Wish to employ it , are argued with by - bind-  i geon and , pistol ? Did Mr. HzAns , r'ever hear of anyrtrust promoting its market in this way ? The San Francisco unions did such acts of violence , and their extortionate wage schedules were maintained in no other way . Did Mr. HEARST not know that the very membership of the unions themselves was limited in order to maintain an arti- ficial scarcity of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
