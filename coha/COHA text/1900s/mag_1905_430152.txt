The Other Side of the Lantern , ' by Sir Frederick Treves , Sergeant-Surgeon to H. B. M. , Edward VII. , more than justifies its sub-title as being ' an account of a commonplace tour round the world . ' The route was usual enough ? the Mediterranean , the Suez Canal , the Red Sea , and India , British China , and Japan . The return was across the Pacific Ocean and the American continent , but Sir Frederick found Hawaii ? he calls it the Sandwich Islands , with fine British conservatism ? and the Yosemite Valley and the Grand Cation of the Colorado the only scenes under the American flag worthy of his pen . But the point of view is that of a cultivated man of the world who is able to set his impressions down in excellent English , and the result is thoroughly readable . India was gorgeously resplendent to the eye of this traveller , but it is Japan that holds his attention longest . The following story relates to a. scene at the shrine of Bunzuru , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . seemed to have travelled far , for there was a dazed look in his face . He led by the hand a boy , whom I supposed to be his grandson , and who was suffering from wide-spread ringworm of the scalp . It is  | probable that the learned in the village had wrought their best upon the lad 's head , but without effect , for the malady is obstinate . The old man had evidently journeyed to Kyoto to seek the aid of the famous healer of Kiyomizu . He rubbed the bare wood on Binzuru 's head vigorously , and then he rubbed the boy 's head until he giggled . He repeated this ritual many times , and then left with great faith in his heart . The next applicant was a worried woman bringing with her a bald-headed boy who was evidently mentally deficient . I think she hoped to convey to her son 's brain some of that bright sense and that power of learning which dwelt beneath the brow of the patient divinity . She rubbed the two heads ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant had displayed . The boy laughed uproariously , but the mother was very grave . Whether in the course of days a brighter intelligence dawned in the lad 's dull eyes I know not ; but I have little doubt that in its appointed time ringworm appeared upon his scalp . Women are patient ; still there is trouble in the learning that the growth of a parasite outside the skull is no cure for a lack of activity within . ' Sir Frederick was privileged to meet two rulers on his journey , the Mikado of Japan and the President of the United States . Though far too long to be reproduced here , his contrasted impressions of these two men are assuredly worth careful reading . Especially valuable at this moment is the following statement regarding one of the vital questions of the day : The visitor to China is likely to make early enquiry from prominent European residents in the matter of the " Yellow Peril " . It will be with some disappointment that he learns that the " Yellow Peril " does not exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands in devastating hordes like the Goths and the Huns . They are fired by no desire for conquest , nor for new territory . The wish dearest to their hearts is to be let alone . The cry of the people is " China for the Chinese " , and the extreme bitterness of this cry has led from time to time to trouble , in the form of risings , riots , and indiscriminate murder . On each of these occasions the Chinese worm has turned , and turned unpleasantly . . . . The prayer of the Chinaman is for peace , not for power to run riot over the earth ; for remunerative work , and not for the privilege of filling the dramatic part of a Peril , yellow or otherwise . ' The author 's photographs taken on the journey have been reproduced by his publishers with unusual delicacy . It is difficult to do justice to such a book as Dr. and Mrs. William Hunter Workman 's Through Town and Jungle . ' At the cost of great self-sacrifice the writers forsook their favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian plain , probably the hottest portion of the thickly populated earth . On heavily laden bicycles , which occasionally had to be pushed by hand over long stretches of sand , they visited not only all the ordinary show places of the peninsula but numerous out-of-the-way spots heretofore unknown to readers of travel books , their quest being generally for specimens of Indian architecture , Buddhist , Brahman , Jain , and Moslem . After accumulating several hundred photographs of temple and village scenes , a flood left them as poor as before , and most of the journey was made over again in order to replace , at least in part , their lost negatives . Java and Ceylon , though not portrayed in this large volume , the authors had explored thoroughly in the architectural sense some time before , and the learning thus acquired is constantly placed at the reader 's disposal . Yet , in spite of all the descriptions and discussions of the text and the hundreds of reproduced photographs , the reader 's resulting impression regarding the Indian art of building is confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts being lost through lack of systematic setting forth . The series of tours are put down in chronological and geographical order , quite regardless of the particular class of architecture , and it is made evident that there is vastly more remaining than has been seen . Nor can it be said that the recital of experiences among the natives adds to our knowledge of that vast congeries of human souls , exceeding the population of the United States fivefold . The inhabitants of higher caste of course declined all intercourse with the wayfarers , and the rest were too oppressed by the weight of taxation and overpopulation to be of service in most cases . Such religious observances as were seen have been fully described by others . There were no adventures except the most prosaic . European convention excludes reproduction of many of the most interesting photographs . In fine , the book is quite the dullest that has come from Dr. and Mrs. Workman 's hands . On the other hand , it would be most unfair to deny the value of the material , both textual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the fact that no other recent work on India gives any such general impression of the Indian peoples and architectures . And certainly the list of minor difficulties surmounted is sufficiently appalling , taken in the mass , to make it unlikely that any one less devoted than this congenial couple will feel inclined to emulate their tour . Nor should the suggestions to Western architects regarding the almost virgin field of the Indian art be dismissed lightly by those to whom it is chiefly addressed . Mecca and the details of the orthodox pilgrimage enjoined upon devout Mohammedans have been made known to the Kaffir world through the courage and self-devotion of many Europeans , notably Englishmen ; but never before has there been an account written from the point of view of a follower of the Prophet , however sceptical the Persian author of With the Pilgrims to Mecca ' may be . The interest of his  | account is further heightened by the magnitude of the pilgrimage three years ago , when a quarter of a million souls from all quarters of the Eastern world visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose name is composed entirely of terms of dignity , is a putative devotee in a sect unbeloved of the orthodox , and has been brought by an English education to thoughts still further remote from orthodoxy ; but he did not fail to renew the devotional feelings of his youth when brought into contact with such myriads of his co-religionaries , and his state of mind when passing through the intricate and prolonged ritual was as fervent and unquestioning as could be desired . He describes the most sacred object in Mecca thus : At first the Stone was whiter than milk , but it grew to be black , either by the touch of a certain class of woman , by the sins of mankind , or by the kisses of the pilgrims . All believers , whatever may be the cause to which they attribute the change of color , agree that the defilement is purely superficial , the inside of the Stone being still as white as the driven snow . Let us hope that the same thing can be said of the hearts of the Faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodestone of theirs a transformation so miraculous . The silver box wherein it lies is about twenty inches square , and is raised a little more than five feet from the ground . A round window having a diameter of some nine inches is kept open on purpose to enable the pilgrims to kiss or to touch the treasure within , which is known as " the right hand of God on earth " . This year the act of osculation was not performed by more than ten pilgrims out of every hundred that attempted it , the crowd being utterly undisciplined in its zeal . It must be confessed that I owed my good fortune to main strength , for I shoved my way through the excited mob and examined the Stone curiously while kissing it . In color it is a shining black ; in shape , hollow like a saucer , presumably the result of the pressure of devoted lips . A pilgrim , if he fail in touching the Stone , must make a reverential salam before it , and then pass on . Certain prayers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to many who look upon Islam in the conventional Western manner the elevation of its thought and ethics will come as a surprise . It is the ability to sympathize with these religious essentials that gives the book its chief value , since it is a real interpretation of perhaps the greatest of all the world 's existing rituals in the number of its devotees and in the effect it has upon them and their fellows . No portion of the book lacks interest for the curiously inclined , and it is admirably and graphically written . Miss Edith Durham 's book , The Burden of the Balkans , ' would , single-handed , redeem her sex from the accusation of a lacking sense of humor . The author 's wanderings took her through Montenegro and the Albanian provinces of Turkey in Europe , part of the time in furthering the relief work the British had set on foot , the remainder in a veritable dash through the realms of the Sultan . She was brought into intimate contact with the little known races that inhabit ( and infest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely with sympathy , but with an ability to laugh at every annoyance they caused her . The earlier chapters are given up to a consideration of racial problems , in which a fine contempt is shown for the artificialities of those European statesmen who seek to partition the land with little or no relation to the Slays , Bulgars , Serbs , Greeks , Vlahs ( Wallachians ) , Albanians , and others , who constitute essentially different peoples , with varying traditions , histories , tongues , beliefs , and political aspirations and ideals . At present we have a free Servia , a free Bulgaria , a free Greece , a but half ruled and wholly disaffected Albania with no Eastern frontier , and a no man 's land of mixed population , which each race hopes ultimately to possess , and over which the Porte has yearly less and less control . The Turk 's death is now considered so imminent that the chief concern of each race is how to keep him alive until each has made its own claim clear to Europe . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durham takes pains to remind those who complain of the lack of twentieth century refinement in the Balkans that " Humanity " was not invented even in England till the beginning of the nineteenth century , ' following this with another pregnant statement of fact : ' When a Moslem kills a Moslem it does not count ; when a Christian kills a Moslem it is a righteous act ; when a Christian kills a Christian it is an error of judgment better not talked about ; it is only when a Moslem kills a Christian that we arrive at a full blown " atrocity " ' . While working in the Ochrida hospital Miss Durham became thoroughly familiar with human nature as it exists in those parts , and she leaves this amusing record of her native assistants : ' If I dropped in at an unexpected hour , I almost always had to " tell them that they must not " . Then they said , first , that they had not been doing it ; secondly , that it was what they always did ; thirdly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not do what had been ordered ; and , lastly , that they had been just about to carry out the orders when I had arrived . Then we all laughed , for they did not in the least mind being found out , and the original order was fulfilled in the end . ' It would be pleasant to quote further incidents of similar vein from this most instructive and amusing book , did space avail . At least a parting tribute must be paid to Miss Durham 's nervous and idiomatic English , characteristically that of an educated and refined woman , unspoiled by grammars . As correspondent for the London Daily Mail , ' Mr. Edmund Candler was attached to Colonel Younghusband 's column in its invasion of Tibet , and he has preserved an account of the  | journey in his volume called T'he Unveiling of Lhasa . ' No small part of the book deals with politics , the events leading up to the expedition and the events likely to follow it , and here Mr. Candler seems to be flatly apologetic and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this expedition as weak and abortive , ' meaning thereby that Tibet was allowed to mind its own business and compelled the British to mind theirs . All the disputes arose through Tibetan unwillingness to establish commercial relations , and it once more appears that the rights of a race in regard to dealing with foreigners are based upon no principle of justice that a stronger nation is obliged to respect . Something is said of Russian influence , but the book fails to reveal anything of the sort , ? though why the Tibetans should not have the same right to deal voluntarily with Russia as with Great Britain under compulsion is not apparent to the non-British mind . For the rest , the story is surprisingly tame . Mr. Candler bears forced tribute to the bravery of the natives with whom the superior arms of the British engaged ; but he nowhere succeeds in investing his accounts of the fighting with any vividness or sense of reality . Lhasa itself was profoundly uninteresting in the main , though the religious rites were not without elements of aave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the services in the great Jokhang , or cathedral : Service is being held before the great Buddhas as we enter , and a thunderous harmony like an organ peal breaks the interval for meditation . The Abbot , who is in the center , leans forward from his chair and takes a bundle of peacock-feathers from a vase by his side . As he points it to the earth there is a clashing of cymbals , a beating of drums , and a blowing of trumpets and conch shells . Then the music dies away like the reverberation of cannon in the hills . The Abbot begins the chant , and the monks , facing each other like singing-men in a choir , repeat the litany . They have extraordinary deep , devotional voices , at once unnatural and impressive . The deepest bass of the west does not approach it , and their sense of time is perfect . ' One does not gather from Mr. Candler 's pages that the Tibetans are in any sense barbarians , and their religion has certainly preserved them from development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So charming are the late George Gissing 's anecdotes and reminiscences of travel on the eastern coast of southern Italy , collected under the alluring title of By the Ionian Sea , ' that if is respectfully suggested that more novelists be persuaded to travel in little known corners of Europe and bring back a sheaf of realities . Mr. Gissing is in love with antiquity , and Latin and Greek are still real to him . It is in the full classical ind historical spirit that he wanders from the beaten path of modern days and takes up the tale where it was interrupted by the barbarian centuries ago . He did not always find local appreciation , ? as when he sought the ancient home of Cassiodorius at Coscia di Stalletti . I had just begun to explain my interest in the locality , and I mentioned the name of Cassiodorius . As it passed my lips the jovial fellow a local guide burst into a roar of laughter . " Cassiodorio ! Ha , ha ! Cassiodorio ! Ha , ha , ha ! " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely delighted to hear a stranger utter a name in familiar local use . He ran out from the cave , and pointed up the valley ; yonder was a fountain which bore the name , " Fontana di Cassiodorio " . Thereupon , I tried to discover whether any traditions cling to the name , but these informants had only a vague idea that Cassiodorius was a man of times long gone by . ' Illness , bad food , occasional extortion , and vast ignorance were not permitted to outweigh the delight Mr. Gissing found in localities consecrated by age and association with happier times , and he has conveyed his enjoyment to his readers with undiminished force . The volume contains some wood engravings by way of pictures , ? a welcome departure from the almost universal half-tone . Many books have been written of our far northern possessions , and from them it might be possible to obtain most of the information brought together by Mr. J. S. McLain in his volume entitled Alaska and the Klondike . ' But Mr. McLain resorted to no such device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company with a sub-committee of United States Senators , who searched the country to learn its needs and report thereon to their colleagues . Every advantage was offered , therefore , to see both the dark and bright side of life on the edge of and within the arctic zone , and the result is a most informing volume . Some novel impressions will be gained by the reader , as when the author says : I do not care to be regarded as a believer in large agricultural possibilities for Alaska , but I am impressed with the probability that in the interior of that remote country , where food supplies from the States must always be expensive , it will be practicable and profitable to produce meat and dairy and poultry and garden products in such quantity and at such prices as to solve the problem of development of large areas of gold-bearing gravel . ' Nearly every part of Alaska was visited , and the book should serve for a long time as books go in these rapid days ? in the capacity of an authoritative reference work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bible Lands ' is an unpretentious work made up of letters written home during the author 's journey through England , Germany , Austria , Turkey , Palestine , and Egypt . What with picking blackberries on the site of the great temple of Diana at Ephesus and eating icecream frozen with the snows of Lebanon , the  | sojourner in distant lands seems to have enjoyed himself . After seeing the dancing dervishes in Constantinople , this member of the Society of Friends writes , One comes away with a , new sense of the kinship of humanity , and , if he has any sympathy with mysticism , he departs with the feeling that , strange as are the practices of these people , it is possible to understand the root from which they spring . ' There is a charm in such self-revelations as these that redeem the book from commonness.  |
