Time  --  the present  --  eight o'clock a winter evening . Scene  --  FRANK WARE 'S living room in an old house in lower New York . There is a door at center back leading into hall . One at left leading into sleeping room . A wide window cuts off the upper right corner diagonally Another window is down right . At left a large old-fashioned fireplace of white marble . Low open book shelves fill the wall spaces . In the upper corner left is a large round table on which are magazines , a lamp  --  a box of cigarettes and a bowl of red apples . At left center a very large upholstered davenport facing the fire at a slanting angle . Below the fire a large armchair . At back a baby grand piano stands right of the door center  --  the keyboard facing the window  --  a single chair before it . Below piano a small round table holding books and a work basket  --  a chair at left of this table . Well out from the window right is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk holds a student 's lamp  --  magazines , newspapers , brass desk furnishings  --  and a great quantity of mss. , letters , etc . On the book shelves are vases , several busts in bronze and white  --  old bowls , a large Victory in white , and a great quantity of pictures on the walls  --  water colors , oils , sketches  --  all good . The walls and ceilings are done in faded , old frescoes  --  and there is a center gas chandelier of an old-fashioned design . The furniture is all old , but solid and the general air is that of past elegance grown shabby and invaded by up-to-date comfort and cheerfulness . At curtain  --  KIDDIE WARE , a sturdy boy of seven , is lying full length on sofa looking into fire . After a slight pause he rises  --  punches pillow and sulkily crosses to piano . With one finger he plays Can you come out tonight boys three times , with one note always wrong . He then crosses to window and looks eagerly out into the street . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the rap is repeated . KIDDIE ( Lifelessly ) Come . p. 3 BAHN ( Opening the hall door ) Wie gehts . Hello . KIDDIE ( Without turning ) Hello !

( Going to piano he begins a German song  --  extravagantly  --  after first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune . WELLS and EMILE bang on the door and enter arm in arm singing . ) TREVOR For heaven 's sake , ca n't you hear anything but your own voice . p. 6 GRIMEAUX Que faites  --  vous ? Oh , la , la , Tenez ! Ou est la divinite ?  --  Ou est Divinite ? ( WELLS TREVOR is a happy go lucky young American , good looking and goodnatured . He wears a shabby lounging coat . EMILE GRIMEAUX is a small Frenchman of the unmistakable artist type . He wears a blue working blouse . ) TREVOR Where 's Frankie ? Kiddie ? KIDDIE She has n't come home yet . BAHN ( Rising from piano and going to WELLS thumping him in the ribs ) It 's too early all ready . Do n't you know anything ? GRIMEAUX Um  --  he knows nossing .

I have had ze most wonderful  --  TREVOR Here you are . ( Finding the article ) The Beaten Path is the strongest thing that Frank Ware has ever done . Her first work attracted wide attention when we thought Frank Ware was a man , but now that we know she is a woman we are more than ever impressed by the strength and scope of her work . She has laid her scenes this time on the East side in the wretched poverty of the tenement houses , and the marvel is that any woman could see and know so much and depict crime and degradation so boldly . Her great cry is for women  --  to make them better by making them freer . It is decidedly the most striking book of the year . ( KIDDIE with a heavy sigh goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 8 BAHN It 's a bully good book . TREVOR You bet it is . Where does she get her stuff , anyway ? After all , that 's the point ! How does she get it ? GRIMEAUX Sere iss only one way . ( Rising and stretching himself complacently , standing with back to fire ) A woman only gets what a man gives her . ( FRITZ draws KIDDIE away from the window and sitting right of desk , takes him on his knee . ) TREVOR ( Still lying on couch ) Lione says the man is Gaskell . GRIMEAUX Zut ! Gaskell has not ze romanse  --  ze mystery  --  ze charm for a secret love . BAHN ( Attracting KIDDIE 's attention from the others by showing him a trick with his fingers ) Can you do dot ? It iss not so easy . Un ? TREVOR I 'm hanged if I can tell whether it is Gaskell or not  --  but if it is  --  why the devil wo n't she marry him ? I tell you Malcolm Gaskell 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip on this newspaper all right , all right , and he 's not going to let go till he 's got a darned good thing . p. 9 GRIMEAUX Zat would be nossing to her . She wants ze love of ze poet  --  ze artist . It is not  --  BAHN Wat are you talking about ? It is not dis  --  it is not dat . It is not nobody . GRIMEAUX Oh , la , la ! She is a very brilliant woman , but she can not do what is impossible . She can not write like a man unless a man help her  --  and no man could make her write like zat unless she love him . BAHN ( Frowning fiercely and shaking his head at EMILE , takes up picture to show KIDDIE ) Mine gracious ! Look at dis beautiful ladies . KIDDIE I do n't like ' em . BAHN Ach Gott ! Der is Fraulein Keppel who used to sing wid dot beautiful voice when I played in the orchestra in Berlin . KIDDIE There ai n't anything funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster Brown every day ? BAHN Ach no . They have to keep Buster so we can tell ven it iss Sunday . TREVOR ( In a lower voice to EMILE ) You ca n't see beyond the love idea . Frank is n't a Frenchwoman . What if there is a man helping her  --  it might be only a business deal . p. 10 GRIMEAUX Oh  --  mon enfant ! BAHN ( Rising quickly as he puts KIDDIE to the floor ) You are two big fools . ( To KIDDIE ) Kiddie , why do n't you go down to the lower hall and wait dere for Frankie mutter ? KIDDIE ( Going up to hall door ) I 'll stay by the door and when she comes in , I 'll jump out at her . ( He goes out . ) BAHN ( Going out into hall after him ) Oh my ! Dot will be so funny ! She will jump so high . GRIMEAUX ( At fireplace ) Au revoir , mon mignon . TREVOR So long , old man . KIDDIE ( Calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banisters . BAHN ( In the door way ) Do n't break your neck , all ready . I vill watch ! Ach Got ! Be careful ! Der you go . ( He closes door and goes down center . ) So you  --  her friends  --  are talking too . p. 11 GRIMEAUX Oh  --  la  --  la ! BAHN You have listened to de gossip , de  --  TREVOR ( Throwing down paper and sitting up ) Oh , come off , Fritz . Do n't get excited . I say I do n't know whether it 's a love affair or not . If it is Gaskell  --  BAHN If  --  if  --  if ! Why do you always use dot mean little " if " ? Are you cowards ? Are you afraid to say it is a lie ? GRIMEAUX She does not deny it . BAHN She would not stoop to deny it . TREVOR I think Frank has had some grand smash up of a love affair sometime . I do n't know whether Kiddie 's her child or not  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's had the courage to adopt the boy , and refuses to explain who he is  --  after she 's made people respect her and accept the situation  --  I ca n't see for the life of me , why she lets another thing come up for people to talk about . BAHN There is no other thing ! That iss a lie . GRIMEAUX How do you know ? BAHN You know  --  you know it iss a lie ! Why do n't you kill it ? p. 12 GRIMEAUX How can you kill a lie about a woman ? BAHN Wid de truth . GRIMEAUX Mais ! What is ze truth ? BAHN De truth iss  --  that she is a good woman and you are too small too liddle  --  too  --  too  --  too bad in your mind to know wat dot means . GRIMEAUX ( Following him to center ) Prenez-garde ! I am a Frenchman ! BAHN Yah , dot iss yust it . You do n't know a good woman when you see one . GRIMEAUX " Good ! " I said nossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who make her bad . You say she must live like zis or like zat  --  or like one little way you think  --  or she iss bad ! Bah ! What is bad ? She iss good because she has a great heart  --  a great nature . She is brave enough to keep ziz child wiz her  --  and snap ze fingers at ze world . She is kind as an angel  --  she is free  --  she is not afraid  --  but she must love because she is too great to live without love . Does zat make her bad ? Allons donc ! Because she does not tell who ze lover is does zat make her bad ? Bah ! It is you who are too small  --  too little too bete  --  too German to understand . p. 13 BAHN Oh , yah ! yah , yah . You can talk wid your French talk . You mix up de good and de bad like you mix your black and white paint till you get a dirty something and say it iss beautiful . You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , " and you damn her wid dat nasty liddle shrug of dat nasty liddle shoulder . GRIMEAUX Wat do you  --  BAHN You can not do dat wid me . You are her friend or you are not her friend . You know dat she is what I know she is , and if you do n't stop winking and wiggling and smiling  --  I vill  --  GRIMEAUX You will ? What will you ? It is not to you to tell me what I sink of her . You are only jealous . You say zer is no ozzer man because you are crazy wiz ze jealous . Hein ! If you was ze man you would not care what I zink  --  ( FRITZ rushes at EMILE . ) TREVOR ( Springing up from couch and going between them ) Drop it , you fools ! KIDDIE ( Bursting into the room and getting behind the hall door ) Do n't tell ' er where I am . WARE ( Coming in with a rush ) Oh , I 'm so frightened ! Something jumped out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiddie man to save me ? Where is he I say . p. 14 GRIMEAUX Il n'est pas ici . I do not see him . TREVOR Did n't you see him ? He went down to meet you . ( KIDDIE and FRANK both cautiously peer near edge of the door which is between them until they see each other and KIDDIE springs into FRANK 's arms . ) WARE ( Catching KIDDIE to her and covering his face with kisses ) My Kiddie man ! Was I long ? I tried so hard not to be late tonight . I must have a bigger hug than that . KIDDIE ( With a bear like hug ) You was awful scared  --  was n't you ? WARE ' Deed I was  --  all to pieces ! KIDDIE She jumped awful high , Fritz ! BAHN Yah , I told you . WARE Well , how are you ? You 're lucky dogs to be so poor that you do n't have to work . ( She smiles at them all with the frank abandon of being one of them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman at the height of her development . Her clothes are simple and not new  --  but have a certain artistic individuality and style. ) p. 15 GRIMEAUX Zen why do you kill yourself to get rich ? WARE I have to get rich for my Kiddie , do n't I ? See what you think of that , boy . ( Giving him a small package ) BAHN ( Helping FRANK off with her coat ) Have you had some dinner ? WARE Yes , I had a bite down town , but I 'm hungry . BAHN ( Putting her cloak on piano ) I will get you someding . TREVOR No , I 'll chase out and get it .

( To KIDDIE who is struggling with the toy ) Ca n't you make it go , old man ? Wind it up for him , Fritz . ( EMILE having taken the gloves off goes back of couch and takes off her hat . FRITZ takes the toy and sits on the floor tailor fashion . KIDDIE sits in front of him with his back to audience . There is a long pause . WELLS , peeling and slicing the apple sits on the left arm of couch , holding the slices out to FRANK on the end of the knife . ) What 's the matter with you all ? Anybody had bad luck ? You 're a cheerful set . Why do n't you talk ? Amuse me . What are you good for ? You look as cross as sticks , Fritz . Have you had a fight ? p. 16 GRIMEAUX Oui . We have had a grand fight . WARE What about ? GRIMEAUX About you . WARE That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all on your side , only in ze different way . WARE What 's your way ?

BAHN ( Reaching for the toy which has run away from him ) I have been gifing a five dollar violin lesson for a dollar fifty . TREVOR Cash ? BAHN Yah . TREVOR Then you have n't got any kick coming . WARE Go and see that thing , Kiddie . Do n't you like it ? ( KIDDIE goes to sit on the floor again . ) BAHN ( Winding the toy ) One of his legs is a liddle longer than he really ought to be . KIDDIE Make him go . WARE What are you doing in your glad rags , Fritz ? You ought not to be sitting on the floor so dressed up . p. 18 BAHN I am going to play Lione 's accompaniments .

( FRITZ plays a tender little German song , singing a strain here and there . WELLS whistles . FRANK closes her eyes listening . ) Um  --  sweet . I could tell that was Fritzie 's in the moon . Come and listen , Kiddie . ( KIDDIE runs to kneel on couch by FRANK with his head on her shoulder . LIONE 's voice is heard singing the song from the hall . She throws open the hall door on a high note . WELLS and EMILE applaud her with good natured guying . LIONE BRUNE is a tall woman with rather striking beauty of a bold type , emphasized by her black gown which is very low and long . ) TREVOR Bravo ! Bravo !

So are we all  --  because we have n't got anything else to sell . It 's only genius that forgets money . Only the glory of creating that compensates for being hungry . No  --  no  --  talent wants three meals a day  --  genius can live in spite of none . p. 25 TREVOR Well , by God  --  I guess you 're right . Frank , I want to sell  --  and I 'm going to hang on . I think I 've got a chance  --  not because my plays are any good  --  but because other people 's are so damned bad .

You are making it all up . BRUNE Do n't you say that to me . I not only believe what I say  --  but something else . p. 30 BAHN What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of anyone ? BAHN What do you mean ? BRUNE I 'll tell you some day  --  when I 'm sure . BAHN I do n't understand you . ( He turns sharply and goes to lower window . She follows him . ) BRUNE You 're a fool ! a fool  --  a fool ! I 'm only trying to save you . Now you 've made me angry , Fritz , and I wo n't sing well . BAHN Oh , yes , you will . You are very beautiful tonight . BRUNE You only say that to  --  ( Lifting her face to him ) Do you really think I am , Fritzie ? BAHN I tink it , yah . Und I tink it iss time to go already . BRUNE Come on then  --  I 'll get my coat . BAHN You get your coat und I come . BRUNE You want to see her . Stay with her then . I do n't want you to go with me . BAHN I will come as soon as I  --  p. 31 BRUNE Stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BAHN I vill come in ten minutes . BRUNE I do n't want you . ( Rushing out and closing the door with a bang ) BAHN ( Calling ) I will come . ( FRITZ sighs and going to piano , plays again as FRANK enters . She goes quietly to her desk  --  drawing pen and paper towards her . FRITZ goes to stand at left of desk . She smiles up at him with comfortable affection . ) BAHN You are tired tonight , yah ? Un ? WARE A little Fritz . BAHN Und you must work yet ? WARE I 'm going out later . BAHN Oh , no . Do n't do dot ! WARE Oh , I must . If I get what I 'm after tonight I 'll have a fine study . I 'm going to have supper with a girl from the East side . BAHN I vill be back . I vill go with you . WARE Indeed you wo n't . BAHN But , I do n't want you to go  --  alone  --  at night . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get fidgety  --  BAHN Oh  --  but de talk  --  de talk  --  I ca n't stand it for you . When you go out like dis people do n't believe it is for your work . They say you have a lover  --  they say he writes your books . WARE That 's very flattering . It means that they think they are too good for a woman to do . BAHN But you see you make dem talk when you do foolish things . WARE Foolish ? You mean going out alone ? Good Heavens ! You do n't suppose I 'm going to give up all my chances of seeing and knowing and understanding just because a few silly people are talking about me ? BAHN But you are a woman . You must not expect people to trust you  --  too much . WARE I 'm not going to spend my life explaining . BAHN ( Sitting at left of desk ) No  --  but you  --  WARE Oh , Fritz , do n't . You 've been so nice and so comfortable . And now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been for both of us if I 'd never told you anything about myself and about Kiddie. p. 33 BAHN Do n't say that . You have to talk to somebody  --  sometimes . Do n't say you are sorry you told me , dot was de most natural ting I haf ever seen you do . WARE Natural ? Surely , I am nothing but natural . I 'm a natural woman  --  because I 've been a free one . Living alone with my father all those years made me so . He took me with him every possible place . BAHN Ah  --  but he was with you to protect you . WARE I did n't need much protection . Dad wanted me to see  --  to know  --  to touch all kinds of life  --  and I surely did . He developed all his stories by telling them aloud to me . He used to walk up and down the little library and talk out his characters . So I began to balance men and women very early  --  and the more I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . BAHN Something has made you bitter to men . WARE Kiddie has made me bitter . Poor little nameless fellow ! I shall never forget the night his mother came to us . I did n't know her very well  --  she was only one of the hundreds of American girls studying in Paris  --  but she came to me because she wanted to get away from her own set . We kept her and she died when Kiddie was born  --  and then we kept him  --  because we did n't know what else in God 's world to do with him  --  and then we loved him  --  and after father died  --  some how that poor , little , helpless baby was the greatest comfort in the world to me . I could n't bear Paris without dad , so I came back to America . Kiddie was two then , and we set up house in this old place three years ago  --  and here we are  --  and it 's nobody 's business who he is . I do n't know who his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but my name is better for the boy than his  --  for mine is honest . p. 34 BAHN I tink it iss a too bad ting to be a woman wid a big mind , a big soul . Yah , I tink it . But I am glad you are one already . WARE Dear old Fritz ! BAHN I only wonder wat vill be de end . WARE Kiddie will be the end of everything for me . BAHN No  --  he vill not . Someday you vill lof a strong man  --  and he vill change it all . WARE You do n't believe me of course . But , it 's Kiddie  --  Kiddie I am living for . Everything I believe about men and women has been so intensified by him that he has become a sort of symbol to me of what women suffer through men  --  and he 's given me a purpose  --  something to do . BAHN I tink Malcolm Gaskell has cut me out wid  --  Kiddie . WARE Nonsense ! Nobody could do that . BAHN I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything he want  --  if he try . WARE Why do n't you like him , Fritz ? BAHN He is n't de kind of a man dot every body knows all about and can trust de first time you see him . p. 35 WARE Yes , he is . That 's just what Gaskell is . Whatever his faults may be at least they 're honest , right out from the shoulder ! BAHN I am not  --  so sure . ( A pause ) Do n't be sorry tomorrow that you haf talked a liddle tonight . It 's gute for you  --  und do n't tink I do n't understand . Gute nacht . ( Giving her his hand ) WARE Good night , Fritz . ( FRITZ goes up to table by piano and picks up his violin case and overcoat . There is a knock at hall door . ) WARE Open the door . ( FRITZ opens door and MALCOLM GASKELL stands in the doorway . He is a tall , powerful looking man , about forty . The face is strong and reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old boy himself . GASKELL Hello , Bahn , you here ? Good evening , Miss Ware . WARE Good evening , Mr. Gaskell . BAHN Yah  --  I am here  --  but I am going . She is very tired and very busy . GASKELL You must have stayed too long . ( To FRANK ) Why did n't you send him away ? p. 36 BAHN She did . GASKELL That 's good . I came to borrow a book . WARE Help yourself . GASKELL ( Going to table up left and selecting book he sits carelessly on couch . ) Thanks . ( FRITZ still stands by door watching GASKELL . ) You do n't seem to be going ? BAHN No , I 'm holding the door open for you . GASKELL I 'd rather you 'd shut it for me . BAHN Vell  --  I haf done my best  --  you see he is going to stay . ( FRANK watches both men , much amused . FRITZ starts to go as LIONE appears in doorway . She wears a long coat and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , I thought you were coming for me . BAHN Yah  --  I am just coming . BRUNE I am not in the habit of going after my escorts . BAHN Ach  --  Lione . BRUNE It 's frightfully late . Of course some people are such sirens . ( With a withering glance at FRANK ) Oh  --  Mr. Gaskell  --  too . You 're so popular . Frank . p. 37 WARE I am with some people . You do n't appreciate me , Lione . BRUNE At least I understand you . I 'm ready , Fritz . ( She sweeps out  --  FRITZ following meekly , nodding to FRANK as he closes door . ) GASKELL You ought to look out for the stiletto under that Italian cloak . I am sure she 's got it ready for you . WARE Do n't laugh . GASKELL ( Rising and going center ) Why not ? WARE It is n't a joke  --  poor girl . GASKELL It is decidedly a joke to see that big tempestuous Lione bow down to the little pink and white Fritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink and white . GASKELL He could n't be that and love you , I suppose ? WARE ( Sitting sidewise in the chair at left of desk ) What did you come for ? GASKELL Your book . I want to read it again . You have n't given me a copy . WARE Why do n't you buy one and help the sale ? p. 38 GASKELL I did buy one  --  but I threw it away  --  it irritated me . WARE Then you do n't need another one . GASKELL No  --  I do n't need it  --  I admit , but I want it . I want to read it again . I want to see why people are talking about it . WARE You do n't see then ? GASKELL I do n't see why they say it 's so strong . It 's clever as the deuce and it 's got a lot of you in it  --  but it is n't big . Our paper gave you a darned good criticism . Did you see it ? ( Handing her a paper from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from desk she goes to couch . ) Yes , I saw it . Much obliged to your paper . GASKELL ( Following her ) Your story 's all right  --  a man could n't have done it any better  --  your people are clean cut as a man 's . WARE Oh , thank you . GASKELL ( Standing with his back to fire looking down at her ) But  --  it 's only a story . You have n't got at the social evil in the real sense . You could n't tackle that . It 's too big for you . You 've taken the poverty and the wrongs of the woman on the East side as an effective background for your story , and you 've let your daredevil profligate girl rail against men and the world . She says some darn good things  --  more or less true  --  but  --  you do n't get at the thing . You keep banging away about woman  --  woman and what she could do for herself if she would . Why  --  this is a man 's world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! ( Smiling ) GASKELL Man sets the standard for woman . He knows she 's better than he is and he demands that she be  --  and if she is n't she 's got to suffer for it . That 's the whole business in a nut shell  --  and you know it . WARE Oh , do n't begin that again . I know your arguments backwards . GASKELL How did you happen to come here anyway ? This is n't a good place for you to live . WARE Why did you ? GASKELL Oh , this is all right for a man . WARE Rather good for me too . The house is filled with independent women who are making their own living . GASKELL And you also have a little court of admirers here  --  all more or less in love with you  --  all curious  --  most of them doubting and all of them gossiping about you to beat the band . Do n't you know that ? WARE Let 's talk about something else for a change . GASKELL Hang it ! Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you do and do the things you do  --  without running your head into a noose  --  just as any other woman would . p. 40 WARE I do n't know why you take the trouble to say all this . GASKELL I do n't know why I do myself , for Lord knows , I would n't stop you in anything you 're trying to do . I like your pluck . I say go on . I understand you  --  but you need n't think for a moment anybody else does . I do n't question you . I take you just as you are . I suppose you think this Dutchman understands you ? WARE He is n't impertinent to say the least . GASKELL No , I suppose not . He would n't dare to disagree with you . WARE Oh , yes he would . Fritz has a mind of his own and a very strong character . He is a genius besides . If he only had a chance to be heard . I wish you 'd do something for him , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence in that direction . Do n't you want to ? GASKELL Do you really want me to ? WARE Oh , awfully . He has the real thing  --  you know he has . Do n't you know it ? GASKELL Oh , I suppose so ,  --  the real thing is fiddling  --  but that 's not much for a man . WARE He 's here without friends  --  without money . He ought to be heard . p. 41 GASKELL What do you want me to do ? WARE Talk him up to somebody . He ca n't do that sort of thing for himself . He 's too sensitive and too fine . GASKELL Sensitive and fine  --  be hanged . That wo n't get him any where . WARE ( Rising to go back to desk with the clipping ) I hate you when you say things like that . GASKELL ( Catching her hand as she passes him ) Do you hate me ! Do you ? WARE Then do n't be so  --  GASKELL So what  --  ? Do n't you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . WARE I think you do n't mean half you say . GASKELL Oh , yes , I do . And a good deal more . You do n't mean half you say  --  they 're only ideals . WARE Oh ! GASKELL You 'll acknowledge it some day  --  when you care for a man . You wo n't give a hang for anything you ever believed then . WARE Oh , yes , I will  --  and I 'll care what he believes . p. 42 GASKELL ( Bending close to her ) You 'll believe that you 've got to live while you are young and you 'll believe that love is the only thing that counts much for a woman . WARE No  --  no  --  no ! GASKELL It is . Women are only meant to be loved  --  and men have got to take care of them . That 's the whole business . You 'll acknowledge it some day  --  when you do  --  love somebody . WARE It would only make me feel more  --  more than ever the responsibility of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him while she speaks . ) GASKELL ( After a pause ) Come out after awhile and have a bite of supper with me . Will you ? WARE Oh , could n't  --  possibly . ( Sitting at her desk and drawing a MS. towards her ) GASKELL Please . WARE No  --  really I ca n't . I have to work . GASKELL Well  --  get to work and I 'll come back for you  --  any time you say . p. 43 WARE Ca n't . I 'm going out at twelve anyway . GASKELL Oh , that 's different  --  if you 're going out to supper anyway . WARE I 'm going to have supper with a girl from the East side . GASKELL Why in the name of heaven are you going at twelve o'clock ? WARE She is going to bring her sweetheart for me to see and he ca n't get off any other time . GASKELL I 'll go with you . WARE No , you  --  GASKELL Yes , I will . WARE Indeed you wo n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tragic story and this fellow knows all about it and is going to marry her . She is helping me a lot in my club for girls over there  --  she can get at them because she 's been through it all and has come out a fine , decent woman . GASKELL I ca n't see for the life of me why you go banging around over there  --  wasting your time  --  getting into all sorts of disagreeable things . What 's the use ? WARE What 's the use ? I call it some use to get hold of about a dozen girls a year and make them want to lead decent lives . p. 44 GASKELL ( After a pause ) Are you going to let your Fritz go with you ? WARE Of course not . GASKELL Thought perhaps you would . He makes a pretty good watch dog trotting around after you . Does n't he ? WARE He makes a pretty good friend . ( Rising ) You must skip now . I 've got to get to work ! GASKELL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They walk together to door . ) GASKELL ( Standing in the open door ) You 're awfully hard on me . WARE Poor you ! GASKELL That 's right . You do n't know how nice I could be if you did n't fight with me . WARE You always begin it . GASKELL Will you come to dinner tomorrow night and see a show ? Will you  --  will you ? ( After a pause she nods smilingly . ) Good . ( Taking her hand ) And we wo n't fight ? ( She shakes her head . ) Not a bit ? p. 45 WARE ( Drawing her hand away ) Not a bit . GASKELL If you were only as kind to me as you are to  --  everybody else  --  I 'd be  --  WARE You would n't like me at all . GASKELL Try it . WARE I could n't . Nobody could get on with you without fighting . GASKELL Oh , do n't say that . WARE It 's the truth . You 're a headstrong , domineering  --  GASKELL Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other fellows do . Do you hate me ? WARE You said that before . Skip now . Goodnight . GASKELL ( Taking book out of pocket ) Are you going to give me this ? WARE I said no . GASKELL But I 've got it . WARE ( Putting her hand on the book ) But I have n't given it to you . GASKELL You 'll never give me anything . I 'll have to fight for it . ( He snatches her hand and kisses her wrist and arm and goes out  --  closing the door . Hesitating she puts her hand over the arm where he kissed it and puts her arm on the door hiding her face in it . ) CURTAIN @x Scene  --  a room in the same house , occupied by CLARA and LIONE . Long double windows at back . A single door at left leading into hall . A single door at right opening into a closet . An old-fashioned fireplace below closet at right . Down right below the fireplace a large hassock . Before upper end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at back a couch bed  --  covered with a dark cover , and holding two pillows . Before the windows are two screens for holding pictures . They have only a single panel and stand on spreading feet , and are made of a plainwood and brown canvas . To the left of windows is a washstand , with bowl , pitcher , etc. , of flowered china . Above the door at left is a bureau crowded with toilet articles , a small china bowl , a few books , cigarettes , matches , etc . Half hiding the bureau and washstand is a large screen of four leaves . Below the screen an upright piano , and at left center a good sized round table with a chair between it and the piano . A chair to right of table , and one below it to the left . At left below the door is another couch bed , covered with a dark cover , and holding several pillows . On the table center are a brass tea service and a dozen teacups and saucers of various kinds  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles of music and a small clock . The mantel holds a brass candle stick , a few ornaments and a great many photographs . The furniture is old-fashioned , heavy black walnut . The walls are covered with a dull faded paper  --  which is badly torn above the couch at right . There are a few effective pictures  --  watercolors , prints , etc. , on the walls . Time  --  four weeks later , two o'clock in the afternoon . At curtain  --  LIONE , with the front of her skirt turned up and a towel pinned over it as an apron , is sitting on the couch down left , polishing a brass candle stick with a flannel rag . CLARA wears a skirt and shirtwaist , which do not meet in the back , and a much besmeared painting apron . The same lock of hair of act one is constantly falling over her face and she mechanically pushes it back . OAKES ( Going to take a workbasket from the table to put it on bureau at left ) Oh , dear ! I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one of her headaches at the last minute and not come at all . She 's really awfully pleased with her miniature . It flatters her horribly . I do want to be honest and true in my work , but what are you going to do ? No woman will accept a miniature unless it does flatter her . p. 48 BRUNE I hope to goodness somebody gives you an order after this affair . I 'm ruining my hands cleaning these things . OAKES Do n't do them well . We 'll never be ready by four o'clock . It 's two now . ( Taking hat from armchair and dropping on her knees before the couch up right . She draws a hatbox from under the bed and puts the hat in it . ) BRUNE If your cousin does n't come , I 'd never speak to her again in all my life , if I were you . OAKES ( Getting flat on the floor to reach a dress box under the bed ) Oh , pooh ! She would n't care whether I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snob  --  that 's what she is . OAKES ( Taking a shabby afternoon gown from the box ) Oh , she does n't mean to be . She 's just like everybody else in her world . ( Examining the gown ) BRUNE I hate ' em . Ignorant , idle , society women . That 's all they are . OAKES You 'd give your ears to be one though . BRUNE ( Rising and leaving candles on couch , as she goes to look at herself at bureau ) I would n't . I would n't give up my career for anything on earth . p. 49 OAKES Yes , that 's what I used to think  --  but somehow , I 'm not so keen about my  --  Goodness , this is mussed and shabby ! Absolutely the only rag I 've got to wear . ( Hanging the gown on the chandelier below the fire-place she pushes the box back  --  and arranges the cover on couch . ) Oh , I must get the rest of the miniatures up . Here 's Kiddie 's picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRUNE I think Frank 's got an awful nerve to let you display it at all . OAKES Why ? BRUNE Why ? Because people will ask who he is . OAKES Oh , well , I 'll just say he 's a little boy that Frank Ware adopted . BRUNE ( Going to put a candle stick on mantel ) Yes , that sounds well . OAKES Well , it 's plausible . ( Putting the miniature on the screen and standing back to see how it looks ) BRUNE Not to me . The men say she is n't in love with Gaskell . Why , she is , head over heels  --  and sometimes I think  --  OAKES What ? BRUNE Sometimes  --  I think  --  ( Going to CLARA )  --  he is Kiddie 's father . p. 50 OAKES What ? Oh , horrible , Lione . She never saw Gaskell till she came here . BRUNE Yes , so they say . Let me see Kiddie 's picture . Frank used to live in Paris , and so did Gaskell . OAKES Oh , Goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Going to sit at right of table and looking closely at miniature ) Several times I 've thought  --  OAKES You 'd better keep on working . The tea table is n't ready at all . I hope to goodness nobody looks behind this screen . BRUNE ( Starting as she looks at picture ) It is n't imagination . I do see it  --  as true as I live . OAKES What 's the matter ? BRUNE Look ! Come here . BAHN ( Calling as he knocks ) Can I come in ? OAKES Yes , come . ( FRITZ enters carrying a screen like the others . He is in his shirtsleeves . ) Oh , you angel ! Put it over there . The screens are perfectly splendid . I 'm so grateful . Really I am . You 're so clever to have made them . I never could have afforded to have them if you had n't  --  p. 51 BAHN ( Putting screen near the others ) I like to do it . OAKES You 're a genius , Fritz . BAHN Yah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dat iss my trouble . OAKES ( As they adjust the screens ) You ought to stick to your violin . That 's where your genius is . BAHN Yah . But de great American public does n't seem to know it . OAKES Yes  --  I know  --  I know . Is n't it awful ? I hope to goodness somebody gives me at least one order from this exhibition . BAHN Oh , yah , you get some . OAKES I wish I were as cheerful as you are . Did you ask Emile if I could have his tapestry for this afternoon ? BAHN Ach du lieber ! You ask him . He vill not gif it to me . Dot tapestry is de apple core of his eye . OAKES I 'm going to ask him now . It wo n't hurt it a bit and I want it awfully to put above that couch over there  --  to hide the hole in the paper . ( She goes out . ) BAHN ( Going to look over LIONE 's shoulder ) What are you looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . BAHN Let me see . BRUNE I 've just decided something . Something I 've halfway believed for a long time . BAHN What is dot ? BRUNE I do n't know that I 'll tell you . BAHN Please . BRUNE I 've found out something and you 'll pretend not to see it . BAHN How do you know that unless you tell me what it iss ? BRUNE Because I know you . BAHN Tell me , please  --  please . You have very pretty eyes . BRUNE Had you forgotten that ? BAHN No . BRUNE It 's the last woman who comes along with you , Fritz . BAHN Every woman keeps her own place in a man 's heart . BRUNE What I do n't understand about you is  --  how can you let a woman flirt with you when you know she is crazy about another man . p. 53 BAHN You mean Frank ? She does not flirt with me . She iss a friend . BRUNE Will you admit that she 's in love with Gaskell ? BAHN She do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that what she tells you ? BAHN No  --  no  --  she tells me nodding . Dat iss what I tink . BRUNE You do ? Well , you 're about as wise as a kitten . I know she 's in love with Gaskell and I think she always has been  --  that is  --  long before she came here . BAHN Ach ! Why ? Why you tink dot ? She never know him . BRUNE ( Lifting the miniature ) Whom does Kiddie look like ? BAHN What do you mean ? BRUNE Look . BAHN No , no  --  I will not look . BRUNE ( Catching his arm ) Why wo n't you look ? Are you afraid to ? BAHN No  --  no  --  I am not afraid . Why should I be ? BRUNE Why you are so excited ? p. 54 BAHN I am not excited . BRUNE You are . Oh ! You see the resemblance too , do you ? BAHN What resemblance ? I do n't know what you are talking about . BRUNE Do n't you ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He iss like himself . BRUNE ( Holding the picture before him ) It 's Malcolm Gaskell ! BAHN ( Closing his eyes ) Ach Gott ! What do you mean ? BRUNE You know what it means . Frank came here alone with this child . There is a mystery about her  --  then Gaskell comes  --  they 're in love with each other and pretend not to be . I 'll bet anything you like , Gaskell is this boy 's father . BAHN You have made it all up . BRUNE You either know it 's the truth or you 're afraid it is . I 'll tell her that I know . BAHN No . BRUNE I will  --  I will  --  I will . There 's no reason why I should n't and there 's every reason why I should . p. 55 BAHN Listen to me . If you will promise to keep still  --  if you will promise to say nodding to anybody about it , I will tell you what I tink . BRUNE ( Looking at him keenly ) What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman who died . BRUNE Yes  --  but who is the father ? BAHN She do n't know who de fadder was . But when Gaskell first came here I see dis resemblance and I believe he is de boy 's fadder . Maybe he do n't know it  --  maybe he do  --  but Frank do n't know it . I am as sure of dat as I am standing here . BRUNE Fritz , you must think I 'm an awful fool . Of all the cock and bull stories I ever heard  --  that 's the worst . BAHN It might  --  it might be . Dis iss a strange und funny old world . BRUNE But it is n't as funny as that . Oh , Fritz , I want to save you from this woman , from her influence . BAHN She iss de best influence dot efer came into my life . BRUNE What 's going to come of it ? BAHN Nodding . p. 56 BRUNE You love her ? BAHN You are two women , Lione . You and I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , Lione , you haf someding great in it . I like to play for you when you sing . You are so jolly and so sweet when you  --  when you are nice . Why ca n't it always be so ? Why ca n't we always be friends ? BRUNE She 's changed everything . She 's spoiled everything . She 's ruining your life  --  and I 'm trying to save you . BAHN No  --  Lione  --  you do n't  --  BRUNE I 've wasted my friendship on you  --  wasted it  --  wasted it  --  ! OAKES ( Opening the door ) Yes  --  yes  --  if I get an order from this exhibition I 'll blow you all to a supper . ( EMILE follows . He is in his blouse and carries a large tapestry over his shoulder . WELLS comes next carrying a quantity of curious daggers , foils , Indian weapons , etc . ) GRIMEAUX Where will you have it ? OAKES There  --  over there .

Ahem ! Clara , Clara 's giving a show , She makes miniatures , you know ; She gives you cake , she gives you tea , She 's polite as she can be . But do n't just eat her cake and tea , She would like some cash you see . Do n't say just  --  " How charming dear . Oh , how quaint and sweet and queer ! " But let her paint your pretty faces With a rose bud and the laces . Then the checks that you have sent Will pay our Clara 's board and rent . ( The others laugh and applaud . ) TREVOR ( Suddenly seeing CLARA 's gown hanging below fireplace , and springing back ) Great Heavens ! Is that your astral body ? OAKES No , it 's my last year 's body . GRIMEAUX Where did you say to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this . It will cover the hole . GRIMEAUX Mais ! Mon Dieu ! Ze tapestry will not show . It belong to Napoleon . p. 58 TREVOR ( Holding out Indian hatchet ) This belonged to George Washington . OAKES Get up there , Emile . You take the other end , Wells , and I 'll get you some tacks .
