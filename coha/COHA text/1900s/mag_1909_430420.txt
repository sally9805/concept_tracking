AN earthquake such as the recent one at Messina is a catastrophe of the first magnitude . It will be recorded in history as one of the world 's greatest disasters , though viewed geologically it represents a sudden displacement of probably only a few inches in the earth 's crust and is of less importance than other earthquakes during the last decade . As a geologist I have always had a desire to witness the results of an earthquake , if not at the time of occurrence , then directly afterward , so as to see not only the geologic changes , but the vast destruction to the surrounding country , as well as its effect on the inhabitants . So the opportunity to visit Messina through the courtesy of the Board of Managers of the National Geographic Society was gladly accepted . I reached Sicily the middle of February and spent a week there . No accommodations being available in Messina , it was necessary to go to Taormina , just an hour 's ride by train , and a remarkable contrast it was to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most glorious garden spot in all Italy . Before discussing the disaster , however , let us first glance through our Baedeker to learn something of the cities and their population ; also of the industries and commerce of this part of the Mediterranean . Those who have been fortunate enough to visit the north of Sicily will remember the indescribable charm and fascination of that entire section . Towering peaks rise from each side of the straits of Messina to elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet , and dissecting their gradual sloping sides are canyon-like valleys which broaden into wide flats at tide water . On these gravel flats , or benches , above sea-level the cities of Messina and Reggio are situated , and higher up the valleys many villages are scattered . In these valleys and on the flanks of the hills orchards of lemons , oranges , and pomegranates are cultivated ; also almond trees and vineyards , which , when in blossom , refresh the whole land with their fragrance . MESSINA IS THE BEST HARBOR OF ' ITALY Messina , now known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast corner of Sicily . The approach by steamer is of remarkable beauty , the  | city rising amphitheater-like from the sea with a dazzling whiteness of houses along the water front , which present a picturesque contrast to the dark , rocky hills capped with castle ruins and forts in the background . The harbor , which is shown in the general view of Messina , is the largest and safest in the kingdom of Italy . It is over 30 fathoms deep , spacious , well furnished with quays , and defended by a fort and citadel . As many as 5,000 vessels call here annually . bringing wheat , cotton , wool , hardware , etc. , and taking away cargoes of lemons , oranges , almonds , silks , wine , essence , oil , etc . In the city itself , which contained about 15o,000 inhabitants , were several wide , handsome streets , including Corso Garabaldi , Cavour , and Vittorio Emmanuele , all of which are paved with granite blocks and ornamented with statues and fountains . Interspersed between the houses or occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the Duomo ? a Palazzo Reale and Palazzo Municipali ; also a large hospital ( Ospedale Civico ) , a custom-house , ( Dogana ) , and a theater in which Aida was sung the night before the catastrophe . It was a live city , the harbor and pier being usually full of boats and people , and every hour brought a trainload of freight to be ferried across the straits or loaded direct for shipment to foreign ports . its historical record of over 2,000 years includes bombardments during the Punic and Roman civil wars ; also by the Goths and Saracens ; a loss of 40,000 inhabitants by plague in 1740 ; an almost complete destruction by earthquake in 1783 , with a death roll of 29,515 and property loss of $26,000,000 ; another bombardment in 1848 and another loss of 16,000 by cholera in 1854 . In a memoir by Deodat de Dolomien , published in 1784 , this earthquake is described as follows : " The destructive shock of February 5 , 1783 , was sudden , instantaneous ; nothing preceded it , nothing announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ; it did not give time for flight ; . . . a larger part of the misfortune of Messina can be attributed to the lack of solidity in the structure of the buildings . " Both of these and many more of Dolomien 's statements are equally descriptive of the recent disaster . Subsequent violent earth tremblings occurred in 1894 and 1896 , the last important one being on September 8 , 1905 , and causing a death roll of 529 . On the opposite side of the straits is Reggio , a seaport of Calabria , 10 miles southeast of Messina . It , too , was a flourishing , opulent city of 45,000 inhabitants , with spacious streets and beautiful buildings and a history similar to that of Messina . Scilla , Faro , San Giovanni , Catona , Pellaro , Terresa , and Scallita are other towns which border this luxuriant shore-line and which also suffered destruction .  | THE CATASTROPHE CAME WHEN EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP The earthquake occurred on Monday morning , the 28th of December , at 5.23 , while it was still ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still sleeping . It came without warning ; the shock was intense and widespread ; it lasted 35 seconds , and during this small space of time most of the stupendous destruction of life and property took place . For several weeks preceding it slight shocks were felt in the vicinity of Messina , and subsequent shocks of considerable magnitude occurred on January 2 , at 9.40 p . M. , and January 5 , at 12.10 p. m . The intensity was greatest at the north entrance to the straits , and its amplitude became rapidly less with in:reasing distance from this central point . The vastness of the catastrophe in loss of life has hardly a parallel in the history of earthquake tragedies , and it is difficult indeed to conceive such an overwhelming disaster in so short a time . The submarine cable was broken and all telegraphic communication was cut off , so that the first news of the disaster was dispatched at the time by one of the torpedo boats lying in the harbor . It immediately got up steam and raced up the Calabria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale might be told and the call for aid given . All this took time , and it was night before Rome learned of what had happened in the southern portion of her peninsula . The terrible news then traveled to all parts of the world , but they were only first reports and believed by most readers to be much overestimated . Headlines then appeared in the newspapers giving impossible accounts of the disaster ; the whole coast line was reported to have been altered and adjacent towns swept away ; it was said that deep chasms appeared in the city streets ; that entire areas were overturned ; roads and railways twisted and bridges uprooted . A grand eruption of Etna and the disappearance of the . Xolian Islands were also vividly pictured and the subsequent tidal wave and destruction by fire exaggerated . But in view of these mythical statements that of the great destruction of people , the most heartrending of all , was , alas , not falsely reported . Though it is not possible even now to state accurately the loss of life , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach 100,000 , that of Reggio 20,000 , and of San Giovanni and other villages 30,000 . One survivor told me that he was suddenly awakened by a loud rumbling , with the sensation of being lifted up and swayed back and forth in the air , only to be let down again by jerks and jars . Another , who was on the street at the time of the earthquake , said that he first heard a low , whistling sound in the distance , which gradually grew louder and louder , and finally broke forth into a roar . The earth seemed to move in all directions at once , and it was impossible to stand . Soon after this bewildering blow , which was accompanied by thunder-like rumblings of the earth and the crushing noise of falling towers and buildings , a dead silence spread over the city , only to be broken later by the shrieks of the wounded . It was pitch dark , and even the corner street lights were extinguished because of a breaking of the gas pipes . It was raining and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , but knew not which way to turn , and stood about helpless and often without clothes . THE TIDAL WAVE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY DESTRUCTIVE Directly after the shock the sea receded a short distance from the shore , but soon advanced again in the form of a foaming tidal wave 8 feet high at Messina and 12 to 15 feet high at Reggio . At Messina it washed over the neck of land forming the harbor , destroying the breakwater , leaving small boats stranded high above the shore-line and dashing a Russian steamer of 2,000 tons from its berth in the dry dock back into the bay ,  | where it sank . It flowed over the city quay , washing away small cargoes of freight and many crates of lemons , and even extended into the buildings along the water front . A few people who happened to be along the quay at this early hour were hurt , and it is possible that some were carried away by the water . At Reggio still greater damage was done by the waves . Freight cars standing ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf wrecked even more seriously than at Messina . Leaving this immediate area , the wave traveled southward to Taormina . Catania , and Syracuse , even reaching Malta , where it arrived 115 minutes after the earthquake . Fire also broke out in several places about Messina , being caused principally by the breaking of the gas pipes , but there was little to burn , so that this terrible agent of destruction , so evident in the San Francisco earthquake , had a remarkably poor field to gain headway . The Palazzo Municipale , the Hotel Trinacria and other buildings scattered about the city caught fire and smouldered THE AREA OF DEVASTATION The area of maximum destruction , as indicated on the accompanying map , extends from Terresa to Faro , on the Sicilian side , and from Lazzaro to Scilla , on the Calabrian side of the straits . In all , about 20 towns and villages were wrecked to a greater or less extent . Within this area , however , the damage was not uniform , as many villages up the valleys , and even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities of Messina and Reggio rows of houses are standing which at first sight appear to have been saved , but behind these facades they are a total wreck . Probably the best example of this is the beautiful Palazzato , which was the pride of Messina . On the other hand , some buildings are only deprived of tfieir front walls , leaving exposed to view the interiors of the rooms with overturned chairs and wall pictures slightly out of adjustment . Libraries , manuscript , letters , all kinds of furniture , including grand pianos and oil paintings , lie scattered throughout a debris of rubble and plaster , and buried beneath it all lie the bodies of those who gloried in these possessions . The shock , of course , was felt at Taormina , Catania , Palermo , Syracuse , and other towns within a hundred-mile radius , awakening and frightening the inhabitants , but the buildings themselves were not damaged . Nevertheless , the effect of the earthquake on the beautiful cities of Sicily , dependent as they are on the tourist trade , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their means of livelihood . The world of travelers has been frightened away from this glorious island at this critical moment when it needs them most . The hotels are empty and the guide or cabman can not earn his lira nor the flower girl her soldo . WORK OF ' RELIEF AND AID TO SURVIVORS The torpedo boats and the battleship Piemonte of the Italian fleet were in the  | harbor at the time of the earthquake , and their crews , with the few panicstricken soldiers of the city , were the first to lend assistance to Messina . The next morning at daybreak the Theropia , a North German Lloyd boat , sailed into the harbor and soon after it came the Russian warship Admiral Makaroff . The crews of both ships turned immediately to the task of rescue , and that afternoon the Theropia , laden with wounded and refugees , weighed anchor for Naples . On the 30th the English man-of-war Sutliedge and others were dispatched from the fleet at Malta to join the rescuing parties , and Italian warships were sent from Naples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer in charge and worked quickly and heroically , some losing their lives in the endeavor to save others . Help did not arrive at Reggio until two days after the disaster , its fate being unknown even in Messina , as both telegraphic and railway communications were destroyed . Twenty-four hours after hearing of the calamity the King and Queen of Italy departed for this scene of disaster , and their presence alone gave courage and hope to the distracted , while their personal assistance in relief work inspired others to do their utmost to succor the wounded and starving . Troops were also sent in from Catania , Palermo , and from the mainland as far north as Genoa , but without sufficient food supply for themselves , and many suffered because of it , though all showed courage and endurance . Hardly a building was left in Messina fit for shelter , and the rain and winds added much to the severity of the suffering . As every minute meant a life , all else save rescue was neglected , even to the burying of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , often without food or shelter . The wounded were removed from the city as fast as possible by boats to Naples and by train to Palermo and Catania , where they were cared for in the hospitals , hotels , and private houses . Systematic relief work was not inaugurated until a week after the misfortune , when the city was divided into three sections , each in charge of a detachment of soldiers , who camped in the public parks . Food and clothing were distributed to the survivors belonging to each section , but the main work of the soldiers was to assist in digging out those still under the ruins alive , and , worst of all , to guard the places and people against thieves . The earthquake opened the prison doors , and many of Italy 's greatest criminals were liberated . They immediately set to work robbing the dead and the dying , so as to leave the city with full pockets . This shameless looting was soon put to an end when the soldiers were in full charge , the offenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are said to have been kilned . In regard to the survivors , it is said that they behaved like children , running about the streets , aimlessly seeking food , and too stupid to leave the town for the country , where they could have found both food and shelter . One of the striking features which I could not help noticing was the apathy of the sufferers , their ( lazed expression and amazing resignation . Many doubtless are bearing their sorrows bravely , but some seem to be mentally benumbed . Little of the actual suffering will ever be known , and lucky were those who were instantly killed . As some were brought alive out of the ruins after two weeks , there were many probably who withstood torture and starvation for at least a week before they were relieved by death . BURIED ALIVE FOR 18 DAYS Francesco Minissale , a young lad of ten , shown in the picture on this page and his two sisters , Giovannina and Nataline , 14 and 16 years of age , probably had the most remarkable experiences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board a freight steamer through the kindness of its captain . This is their seemingly incredible tale : " We were sleeping in a large room on the ground floor . Our house collapsed , . killing our mother and imprisoning us . Providentially , in the same room there was food which we had purchased for the New Year 's feast ? figs , cookies , a bag of onions , a bottle of vinegar , and besides these there was a small barrel of water into which a large bottle of oil had tumbled and been broken , but the oil was not lost . On these provisions we lived , . but were never very hungry . Fresh water and fresh air were what we wanted most . The room was quite dark , and although we were there for 18 days it hardly seemed more than four . Finally Francesco began pounding the plaster wall with a cobble-stone , breaking it down bit  | by bit , until there was an opening large enough for him to scramble through into the adjoining room and up over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer . He told his incredible tale and we were all rescued . " Their father was in New York at the time , and after learning of their safety he wrote that he would start on the Republic , the fate of which they learned later . They had not had further news from him , but anticipated his arrival every day . Each survivor had his own tale of woe , and many of these have been presented in recent magazine articles . A great sorrow , but not one of suffering , was the death of Dr and Mrs Cheney . The search for their bodies was begun by Italian soldiers , who were relieved later by American sailors . Both bodies were found on January 15 in bed , and death had evidently been instantaneous . Though the American war ships did not arrive in the vicinity of the earthquake until January to , somewhat late to lend any great assistance , still the effect of the sympathy expressed by the President , the magnitude of the sum appropriated by Congress , the prompt offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of Ambassador Griscom in the relief work in Rome and that of the American Red Cross , all inspired creditable comment in the Italian newspapers and gratitude in the hearts of the people . Since the clay of devastation the Italian army has done noble work in accomplishing the task before it , and both the soldiers and sailors deserve great credit for their bravery and endurance . COMPARISON WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE OF 1906 In San Francisco the earthquake caused little loss of ' life from falling structures and the houses left little debris . The main problem was fire-fighting , securing order and safety of life and property , supplying food and water to 350,000 and shelter to 175,000 people . Telegraphic and railway communications , were not destroyed and notification of disaster to the rest of the world was prompt . The army and navy in and near the city were unhurt , and with then supplies were made available and promptly distributed . At Messina and Reggio the initial shock caused the principal damage , and the loss of life was due mainly to falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and railway communication was cut off and assistance had to come by sea . The army and navy in the vicinity suffered heavily , Messina losing two-thirds of her garrison and all supplies . The problem was to rescue and care for the wounded , to establish order and safety to life and property , to dispose of the dead , and give food and water to the living , a tremendous task , indeed , when one views the vast area of destruction . Thus we find that while the buildings in San Francisco were more properly constructed to withstand shocks , those in Messina were better able to resist destruction by fire .  | WRETCHED TYPE OF BUILDINGS Architecturally many of the buildings of Messina were superb , the effect of strength being emphasized by massive walls and columns . But when one investigates the details of construction and of material used both features are found to be deficient . A worse type of structure within an area frequented by earthquakes is difficult to imagine . The houses , which were from two to four stories high , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor mortar which is sadly lacking in strength ; even the walls are not bound together , the cross-beams for a floor being set in rows of indentations left in the wall at the time of construction . On these crossbeams , which are often only wooden poles , the tiled floors are laid , and the roofs , too , are generally covered with heavy tiles . The effect of the earthquake is quite evident ; the walls of the buildings cracked readily and spread sufficiently to permit the heavy floors and roofs to drop to the ground ; the walls thus being freed , subsequent shocks caused them to tumble on top of the already partially wrecked building , completing its destruction . Thus they collapsed amid suffocating clouds of dust into a hideous conglomeration of rubble , mortar , and furniture , forming regular deadfalls for man . HOW WILL MESSINA BE REBUILT In the Italian Parliament a week after the disaster it was said that " Messina shall rise again . " This bold proposition was applauded vigorously and initial appropriations were immediately made . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor . Over three months have passed since the disaster with no attempt to rebuild . A commission , consisting of seismologists , geologists , and engineers , was formed to determine the questions when , where , and how reconstruction could best be accomplished . They are still debating and it may be months before any definite steps will be taken . Messina is one of the essential ports of the world , both from commercial and military standpoints . Its strategic position , like Gibraltar , commands a ship 's highway and in its harbor a whole fleet may hide in safety . Any one knowing its situation can not doubt but that the risk will be taken and a new city built . As to " when " reconstruction shall begin there is little difference of opinion , the answer being " as soon as possible . " The first necessity will be to remove the present debris , which is estimated to amount to I , 000,000 tons . From this mass of wreckage there are still about 40,000 bodies to be recovered and buried before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare the present site so that construction work could begin will take at least a year and probably longer . The second question , " where , " can not be answered until careful scientific investigations of the entire area now in progress have been completed , and even then the selection of a site will necessarily be governed by the military and commercial requirements . I have heard suggested for a possible site the area just south of Gazzi , about 3 miles south of the harbor , as here the gravel bench is not deep and the buildings did not suffer as much damage as those at Messina . The slopes of the mountains where solid rock foundation occurs and where small villages were unhurt have also been suggested , but such a site would not be practicable from a commercial viewpoint . This selection of a new site is a perplexing task , and in the end the propertyowners and the sentiment of the people may prompt the rebuilding of the city on its present location . This second question decided , then the third , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How should the city and towns along this unstable coast line be rebuilt ? To begin with , the streets of the city should conform with the direction of the straits , which is said to be parallel with the direction of the seismic wave , for it was noted that buildings along streets which run diagonally to this direction were more greatly shattered . It was also noted that buildings p 391 of one and two stories were much less damaged than those of three and four stories , and that many houses were traversed by cracks running north and south . To determine the character of the construction to be employed , the engineers have the reports on the San Francisco , the Japanese , and other earthquakes , which discuss fully the effect of an earthquake on all the varied types of structure . - With these and their present knowledge of the structures in Messina there is every reason to believe that they will decide upon an individual type especially adapted to this region that will give great resistance to earthquake shocks . To the government will fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . With buildings properly constructed the destruction by earthquakes to life and property will be minimized , so that cities and towns along the straits will be much safer to live in . WHAT EARTHQUAKES ARE Earthquakes are tremors or shakings of the ground naturally produced . They are superficial phenomena resulting from a subterranean shock which is transmitted as an elastic wave through the material of the earth 's crust . From points of initial disturbance these waves pass out in all directions . They are caused by volcanic explosions and accompany the development of mountain structure . With the contraction of the earth 's crust and adjustment of land masses powerful strains , consisting of terrestrial pressure or tension , are developed , and wherever and whenever such strains suffice to overcome the elasticity of the rocks involved , either viscous flexure or rupture must result . A dislocation or tectonic earthquake , therefore , is simply the jolt or jar produced by a sudden movement of the crust along a fault  | plane or system of planes and its sudden arrest . The sudden dropping of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause excessive jarring of the ground . Earthwaves or undulations are caused by these jarrings , which are transmitted outward from the center or centers of disturbance . The rate of propagation is relatively fast through rock masses , but the waves are much impeded in rate and increased in amplitude when they traverse beds of gravel , sand , or clay . It is therefore found that the most destructive effects are confined to areas where the surface is occupied by unconsolidated materials , while on adjoining tracts , where solid rock forms the foundation , the buildings often escape injury . The rock formations which constitute the mountainous masses of the Calabrian province and the northern part of Sicily consist essentially of crystalline schists and gneiss , intruding which are granitic rocks exposed in the northern portion of the area ( see map above ) . The low lands and bottoms of the valleys , on the other hand , are occupied by slightly indurated shales and sandstones of Tertiary and Quaternary ages , and along the shore lines are bench deposits of unconsolidated gravels of recent age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lava flows and tufaceous beds . POSSIBLE CAUSES OF ' THE EARTHQUAKE The Straits of Messina occupy a deep channel between the two ancient mountain ranges and are bordered by rock formations of relatively recent age . That isostatic readjustment between these two land masses is taking place is believed by many , though whether the crustal movement is due mainly to the transfer of molten rock magma from points below the solid crust , the evidence of which is expressed in the volcanic eruptions , whether there is a sufficient transfer of material on the surface due to erosion to cause excessive local strains in the crust because of this transfer of weight , or whether it may be attributed to some other cause are hypothetical questions . The occurrence of fault planes has been conjectured to be along the bottom of the straits , and , though they have never been seen , there is sufficient geologic and seismographic evidence to believe that they exist , though whether the movement is along one plane or whether it has been taken tip by a system of fracture planes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the straits changes occurred , and portions of the quays both in Messina and Reggio were faulted below water level , the local displacements being from i to 6 feet . Along the coast are benches of gravel and sand sloping gradually toward the straits and extending a short distance out under tide water , where they end abruptly , and just beyond these the channel has a depth of I , 000 feet , and toward the center it is 2,500 feet below the surface . The earthquake caused a local landslipping of these partially submarine benches , thus producing the displacements observed ( see page 393 ) . The greater local sinking at Reggio than at Messina may be attributed to the greater depth of the channel close to the shore , thus causing a greater fall . If there has been any considerable displacement between the opposite sides of these straits , it must have been a horizontal one , as there has been little or no general vertical change in elevaton of either shore line . This possibility of a horizontal movement of the Sicilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the direction of the throw at the time of the earthquake . Most of the towers and chimneys in and about Messina were thrown to the southeast , while in the vicinity of Reggio towers were thrown locally to the north , though on this side of the straits the general direction of the . throw was poorly expressed by the structures . Imagine now local landslides , largely submarine , occurring each side of the straits practically at the same instant ; this alone would be sufficient to make the sea recede and cause the tidal wave which followed the earthquake . Theories attributing it to changes in depth of the bottom of the straits must be proven by soundings , and it is doubtful if any perceptible change will be found . The answers to the questions whether the region may now look for respite or whether it is becoming unfit for human habitation can only be based upon careful consideration of the causes of earthquakes and the history of past earthquakes in this vicinity . ' That there will be future disasters of this character here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement inaugurates a long era of comparative repose . It is gratifying to know that present studies in seismology are in the direction toward the prediction of place and time of both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions . The malloseismic areas are being outlined , the underlying formations are . being studied in detail , past records carefully considered , and thus tracts of special !  | instability are becoming known . The determination of the time such malloseismic disturbances will be active within these specific areas is a far greater problem , and though many hypotheses based on rhythmic recurrence , alternation between different parts of a district , precipitation , etc. , are being developed , still solution of this vital question , the forecasting of earthquakes , belongs to the indefinite future . Thus the areas of peril may be definitely known , and though the time is indefinite , necessary precautions in the construction of earthquake-proof houses within such areas will insure both life and property against the great losses caused by these destructive forces .  |            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
