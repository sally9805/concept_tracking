 |p519  IT seems probable that the history of these times will have something to say about William Randolph Hearst , the conditions which made him useful , the men who opposed him , and the results that he achieved . History usually asks , and gets unsatisfactory answers to , the following questions concerning a man of interest : What conditions made him important ? What kind of a man was he to look at ? eyes , size , clothes ? What was his temperament ? What did he actually accomplish ? What did he plan to do ? There is interest in these questions to-day . For Hearst is more generally discussed than any other man in the country . There will be interest in these questions many years from now , for conditions , combined with Hearst 's good ambition and his power to influence public opinion , must make him , barring accident , an important force in the present stage of national and world-wide development . What opportunities do present conditions offer to a man of Hearst 's character and resources ? Conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of original thought and strong character as great as any the world has seen . Human laws and happiness are based upon material conditions , largely upon commercial and industrial conditions . The world is undergoing a great change , competition has been replaced by organization , the importance and the opportunity of the individual are disappearing . The selfish career of " the little man for himself " is soon to be a thing of the past . The world offers marvellous opportunities to a man of force who can see what is happening and what is needed . The world  |p520  needs balanced men with minds open to new truths . Our system of organized industry , replacing on strictly feudal lines an earlier military feudalism , gives an opportunity to progressive men . Folly and thoughtlessness seek to-day , as ever in the past , to go backward . There are foolish minds that talk of " smashing the trusts , " as there were foolish stage-coach drivers that talked of smashing the early locomotives . The world offers a chance to the man who can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first a menace , and then a blessing . Men have seen the seat of power transferred from the stone castle on the hill to the steel bank in Wall Street . They know that the new power will endure until some higher shall come to replace it . They are anxious to know whether they see in Hearst a man able to take advantage of conditions , clear-headed enough to realize that the new economic development must be employed for the people , ? intelligent enough to know that the talk of destroying and of going back is folly . What sort of a man is William Randolph Hearst to look at ? He is a big man ? an excellent thing , since it gives him the strength to stand the worries of many newspapers , and the worries of many faithful followers and foolish enemies . He is more than six feet two in height , very broad , with big hands and big feet , a strong neck that will stand up for a long time under a heavy load . His hair is light in color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for concentration . His dress of late has been the usual uniform of American statesmanship , combining the long-tailed frock coat and the cowboy 's soft slouch hat . The first impression that Hearst gives is one of bigness . And the second is that of being a listener . Those who see him invariably talk to him a great deal more than he talks to them . When the meeting is over Hearst is apt to know more about the other man than the other man knows about him . Mr. Hearst has a great deal of nervous as well as physical strength . This enables him to be patient with many men , and many employees , that constantly demand his personal attention and personal answer . He is able , when necessary , to do with little sleep . And his mind works normally at all hours . He has well developed the power , without which no man succeeds as a political leader , of concentrating his energies on one thing .  |p521  Hearst has good-nature and cheerfulness , even under trying conditions . The men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him especially , because when things go wrong he takes the blame on himself . A man owning nine newspapers and a number of periodicals published in five different cities from the Atlantic to the , Pacific Ocean , is certain to have a great many foolish things done and said in his name . The public holds Mr. Hearst responsible for all the foolish things that his editors think of . Mr. Hearst fills his position well . He knows how to make his men useful , and to keep them useful by tabng always more than his own share of the blame . Hearst , as I have said , is silent , and he can listen . He will sit stooping over on his chair , drumming with his fingers , looking up earnestly at the face of the man who is talking . He is able to recognize with the first few words the fact that the man is n't going to say anything , and after that he does n't even hear him talk . It is an admirable display of politeness , free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interests , and therefore his vitality , are , not scattered . There is absolutely nothing that he cares for except his family , his newspapers , and his public work in politics . He never goes to a race-track , the racehorses that he inherited with his father 's property were turned out to amuse themselves on a ranch . He takes absolutely no interest in financial speculation , cares for money only because of the power that it gives to reach the public , and to scatter ideas through newspapers . It is impossible to interest Hearst at all in any mere money-making scheme . A well-known American financier once said , " That man Hearst is a queer and foolish young fellow . I waited three hours outside of his office to persuade him to take ten thousand shares of at ten dollars a share , and could not see him . " The stock mentioned had since gone above 100 , and the Wall Street man was amazed that he had been unable even to talk to an editor who might have made more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seems important , for while it is difficult to conceive that a man of any intelligence should be interested in money except for the work that can be done with it , we know that the best energies of our country at this moment are diverted to aimless money-making.  |p522  Those who would understand the hostility of other newspapers to Mr. Hearst must know the effect that he has had upon the pocketbooks of those newspapers . The Hearst newspapers have constantly advocated good wages and the eight-hour day . Unionism rules in all mechanical departments of the Hearst undertakings . Since his arrival in New York , Mr. Hearst has frequently and voluntarily added greatly to wages in the mechanical departments of his newspapers . The result has been that the other newspapers have been compelled to pay the wages that Hearst paid voluntarily . His refusal to join in any association planned to keep down wages has been painful to his fellow newspaper-owners . Very important in Hearst 's temperament is the fact that he does not take himself too seriously . For that reason , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There must be an indefinite extent to his energies and struggles in public life , because nothing that he could achieve ? however important ? would seem to him really worth being proud about . Hearst has in his mind a clear view of history ? of which he is a constant and passionate student . He is able to review at a glance the progress of human beings from their primitive origin to this present primitive condition which we call civilization . What has Hearst done thus far ? He has created what was essential to his work , a powerful machine for influencing public opinion . He has built his newspapers up to a daily circulation of two millions . And that circulation is increasing constantly . Every day Hearst is able to talk with two million American families scattered everywhere in this country . His newspapers are published in Boston , New York , Chicago , San Francisco and Los Angeles . And they will soon be published in many other cities . With this enormous circulation Hearst is able every day to spread the truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to misrepresent him fail , for his voice reaches farther than the voice of any other man in the country . There has never before been assembled in this world an audience such as that which Hearst commands , and therefore it is safe to say that there has never been a man possessing his peculiar influence and power for good . The building up of this tremendous engine of publicity is his  |p523  greatest accomplished work , undoubtedly . And with that engine his real work is still to be done . He has made dishonest wealth disreputable throughout the nation . He has convinced the people that the rule of organized capital is not American government or honorable government . He has been the greatest creator of intelligent dissatisfaction , the basis of improvement , this country has seen . Hearst has made innumerable fights in the interest of the people at his own expense , with great expenditure of money and of personal energy . Various trusts have been fought by him through the courts and up to the Supreme Court . He certainly has the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country than any other man in it . A mere enumeration of the lawsuits that he has begun and prosecuted on behalf of the public welfare fills out a considerable pamphlet . Mr. Hearst is already the greatest awakener and director of public opinion and of public anger against injustice that the country has seen in many years . In the way of actual good , Hearst has accomplished much by his influence in increasing the distribution of money . He has sided with workmen in just fights against corporation employers and has helped them to win . This means that additional money has been divided among the families of working people instead of being added to dividends on watered stocks . Tens of millions a year are added to the incomes of wives and . mothers in this country because of Hearst 's activity in promoting the legitimate distribution of wealth . What are Hearst 's plans for the future ? He means to be a useful man in his country , working within the law for the betterment of conditions . His confidence is in the general intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand just now is to make universal suffrage a reality , an expression of the public will . Hearst will prove to be a creative as well as a corrective force in this country . It will not satisfy him to be known merely as a rich man who was unselfish , honest , just and fearless . He is among those who realize that a country which could comfortably support two thousand millions of beings ought surely now to support in plenty and free from worry all men willing to work . Those who oppose Hearst are largely corporation men , who  |p524  allow their pocketbooks to think for them , who are influenced by the selfish dread that Hearst 's plans for making others better off might possibly spoil their plans . The honest business man , the man of fortune honestly acquired , has no need to worry about the political activities of Hearst . Hearst is a believer in the American system . He realizes that human beings work in obedience to the instincts within them , and that one of the strongest human instincts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human society must be a reflection of human nature , and can not be based on repression . He himself is a large owner of property . His newspapers represent an enormous investment . He is compelled to pay out for labor and material more than fifteen millions per year to keep them going . He owns more than a million acres of land ; he is engaged in agricultural pursuits on a very large scale ; he is an owner of mines . Through his newspapers he is interested in the success of every business man . The advertising patronage of successful business men alone makes the existence of his newspapers possible . His newspapers depend also upon the good-will of the people . Every day of his life he is subjected to " the referendum , " the power of recall about which the radicals talk so much . Two millions of men who buy his newspapers each day can stop buying any day they please , and make an end of the Hearst newspapers . It is greatly to his credit that he has travelled so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can truly be said of him that the property which he owns has not in any way controlled his opinions . His opinions have controlled his property . Hearst represents unselfishness in public life . In need of nothing personally , he is not satisfied while others fail to thrive as they should in a country such as this . He is ambitious , without personal conceit . He is extremely tenacious . He is absolutely temperate , free from fondness for dissipation of any kind . He is a man of unusual physical and mental strength . He has a great machine of publicity with which to work . His chance , therefore , of achieving real reputation in the annals of our slow progress toward civilization seems good . The attacks and slanders aimed at Hearst have been conceived by dull minds and have been inevitably ineffective . It is true that he is not an easy man to attack . But those who have at/ tacked him because he menaced their plans for plunder have gone about their work with incredible stupidity . In his enemies he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one was convicted of manslaughter , a third of national repute is openly accused of blackmail and offers no defence . Hearst does not drink any alcoholic stimulant . He does not smoke ? he neither lashes nor stupefies his faculties . But he combines a realization of the rights of others with temperance in his own life . A man influential in the New York State Prohibition party telephoned from the Prohibition Convention , asking if Hearst would accept their nomination for Governor . He replied : " I feel greatly honored by the suggestion because of the high character of the men in your party . But I could not properly present myself as a leader of Prohibitionists , for while I am individually a total abstainer , I do not advocate prohibition . I believe that drunkenness must be fought by argument , and especially by better material conditions . Prosperity , in my opinion , is the enemy of excessive drink . And poverty is the direct muse of drunkenness . " That is typical of Hearst 's attitude toward men in general . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he has succeeded in the newspaper profession . Unlike many others in politics he is independent of the bosses , independent of organized capital , independent of everything but the final judgment of the people . He has power to appeal every day to that judgment , and to wipe out falsehood as fast as it is written . There is no doubt that Hearst will be elected President of the United States if he lives . He represents intelligent , conservative protest against the usurpation of national power by corporations . The only real strength opposed to him is that of dishonest organized capital , and that can not permanently control the people . Hearst has already triumphed over his unscrupulous enemies . He is the most popular individual in the United States to-day . Many men will live to be ashamed of slanders invented or circulated concerning Hearst . It is not possible now to name a recognized public enemy , without naming at the same time one of Hearst 's enemies . Soon it will not be possible to mention an intelligent good man without mentioning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst .
