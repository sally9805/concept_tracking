txt What to- do to remedy the present American system of banking and currency was the general subject which the American Academy of Political and Social Science chose for the opening session of its annual meeting tonight . Those who spoke were William B. Ridge , . ly , Controller of the Currency ; Charles H. Treat , Treasurer of the United States ; Frank A. Vanderlip , ex-Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and Vice President of the National City Bank of New York ; Jacob H. Schiff of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. ; Isaac N. Seligman of J. W. Seligman &; Co. , and William ' A. Nash , President of the Corn Exchange National Bank etNeW York . Schiff Gave Early Warning . Special expectation wan centred upon Jacob Schiff 's address , because of the fact that just eleven months ago he gave warning of the crisis that has of late overshadowed the country . It was recalled that he then used these words ? " There is no disaster now upon us , but this is the time to prepare for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York money market condition which would be nothing less than a. disgrace to any civllizeil country . There must be a cause for such conditions . It can not be the condition of the Country itself , for wherever you look there is prosperity  --  prosperity as we never had Et before . It is true that our prosperity may be a contributory condition , It can not be that the speculation which prosperity ; always brings forward can be the sole reason for the conditions which we have witnessed and are still witnessing . Other countries have had wider speculation than the United States . " The cause 15 in our insufficient circulating medium , or the insufficient elasticity of our circulating medium . " This was the keynote of Mr. Schiff 's argument to-night . The speakers were the guests of the Provost of the University of Pennsylvania , C. C. Harrison . at dinner prior toosthe meeting . Prof. Leo S. Rowe . President of the Academy , introduced Frank A. Vanderlip as the Chairman of the evening . Chairman Vanderlip 's Address . Mr. Vanderlip said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our political history when there was a greater necessity than there is now for a broad educational movement relative to financial affairs . The causes of this remarkable disturbance are more or : ess obscure , at least men who are expert in finance are not agreed upon them . Some attribute it to the policies of the President , others to the gamblers of Wall Street . The truth lies at neither of these extremes , nor , indeed , between them . It is broader arid deep%r than either . " If I were to try to outline the causes of the present financial situation I should say that they run back at least a half dozen years , and are by no means confined to America . " Mr. Vanderlip mentioned the enormous consumption of capital in-. the Boor and the Russo-Japanese wars , the latter just at the time when the world was entering upon the greatest era of industrial development that it has ever seen . " Ent , " he added , " this affair has not altogether been one of money , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. period of so-called muck-raking , of very free criticism of leadera'rinancial and political , and to tell the truth we have had a good deal of occasion for it . Much of it was unfounded , but too frequently there was abundant evidence that much of it was merited . Under conditions thus created , investment capital hesitated and the confidence of the people in financial leaders was severely shaken . But not only that , 1 the confidence of the leaders themselves was shaken  --  their confidence in legislation and in public opinion . " We approached this period with a banking and currency situation , in which the withdrawal of money even to meet the ordinary legitimate demands of the crop movement meant a depleting of the reserves of the banks below the safety , point , with no expansive element to compensate for the increased tension . We have had this illustration of the danger of being without monetary elacticity , and it will do more to convince the people of the absolute need of currency reform than - any number of meetings or speeches could ever do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that one of the 1 causes of the financial stress might be found in the great trust companies of New York which encouraged deposits by the payment of excessive rates of interest to depositors and also encouraged investments of capital in ways that were not always conservative . He said also that individuals were not the only horders of money at this time , but that banks also were guilty of this practice . " I believe , " he said , " that the necessity for the study of these lessons is so great , so pressing , that right now is the time for beginning it . The papers of the country this morning were full of the views of Senators and Congressmen as to proposed financial legislation . It was shocking to read these views In some particulars . But the truth is that some of our bankers show almost as complete ignorance on the subject of financial needs as do some of our lawmakers . As I have said , education cm this subject is what we most need . " But there are certain underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearing House certificates has demonstrated clearly what the functions of asset currency really are . One of the lessons we have learned is the interdependence in a monetary crisis of the various parts of this great country . But perhaps the greatest lesson of all is what it means to destroy confidence , The . confidence of the people in their finan leaders and of capitalists In the fairnea of the people and also the destinatWof the respect of capitalists for the . sources of legislation .

Nash , President of the Corn Exchange Bank , New York City , said in Fart : ? " It is universally conceded that the present time is highly favorable for finan-cial reforms . The great danger is that ' : the remedies will be so numerous , and the diagnoses so differing that the patient will linger and suffer . Not only here tonight . but in Washington to-morrow and for months after , the doctors will assemble and discuss . I hope . to use an old phrase . we shall not have to wait for the autopsy to find out what is the matter . " When I was a youth I saw the panic of 1857 . It began , as always , in New York . Good and bad banks alike were attacked by uneasy depositors and they were fought to a standstill and compelled to surrender . The situation . however , soon righted itself , because the depositor had no safe place to keep his gold , and soon returned it to the bank he had been distrusting . " Now we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clearing House certificate is again at work , and you all realize how effective it has been to still the waters , so we can shift the cargo and repair the ship for its further voyage . As an emergency currency it is incomparable . as an asset currency it is the only one that I can conceive of that is not fraught with dangers , greatly in excess of the benefits to be derived from it . " Now , in view of this practical lesson . so often repeated , and always successful . what should he done . and what do we learn . The first lesson is that expansion of credit and the issue of currency can best be done by some central responsible power . and not by a series of small powers scattered all over the country . I do not hesitate to say that an asset currency authorized on a 40 per cent. , or any per cent .. basis and intrusted to 5.000 banks all over the country . will surely result in a cataclysm of disaster , unparalleled In the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we organize in a permanent form the Clearing House loan certificate , now issued so fitfully and at a time when a crisis is already upon us , we will provide the country in advance with a remedy . " But how shall we get this permanent form ? To answer this we come up against the most venerable and senseless prejudice that obstructs the National well-being , the dread of a great central bank . We must kill this bugaboo and exorcise this ghost . " The magnetic needle does not point more unerringly to the pole than the Clearing House certificate points to a great central bank , and , dodge this as we may , and as probably we will , finally we shall , come back to it and hall it as the solution of all our difficulties . " Give us in good faith such a central bank . with such management and with such functions as the Clearing Houses all over the country have to-day , and you will put us on a par with England . France and Germany , with their great benign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob H. Schiff said . in part : " The origin of the crisis is to be sought tr4till , y in too great an expansion of enterprise of every nature , both corporate and individuaL This , as a consequence , caused a straining of financial requirements . and particularly of credit beyond legitimate limits Prosperity run riot ' expresses , perhaps , best the condition which existed and which brought us to our present plight Nothing is probably so largely responsible for the breakdown as the ob . stinaay with which new enterprise became fostered ; in the enormous volume = of beeriness which was developed in every quarter , even in the face of a steadily in ; creasing money scarcity , and further in the stubbornness with which it was in ' steted that the country was so prosperous and rich that particularcaution and prUdence were not needed . the march forward was made with a totally unprotected rear . " Look only at the number of so-called trust companies called into being during recent years , and which under a false flag bid for and attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for legitimate banking , but for illegitimate promotion . from which funds could not be withdrawn when their return was asked for by those to whom they belonged . And not alone in financial quarters had developed this prosperity madness . In industry and commerce prudence had like ? wise been thrown to the winds . The manufactUrer arid merchant when warned that. , lae was expanding too largely  --  that he was straining his credit in too great an extreme  --  scornfully rejected the advice to go at a slower pace . Currency Reform Alone Inadequate . " Let it be said and well understood , at this juncture , that currency reform , imperatively needed though it is , can in itself never furnish protection against the consequences of unsound and illegitimate business methods . A properly constituted circulating medium can furnish in times of financial difficulty a palliative. but without simultaneous reform in the unsound practices , which , to so considerable an extent , have governed the affairs of financial institutions , currency reform will be of little avail . " The nation of the Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has just taken action with a view of correcting through the medium of a commission which is to report upon a revision of the banking laws of the State the shortcomings which have been laid bare , should be particularly welcome : Danger of Too Much Paper Money . " What we are most in need of at this juncture is the enactment of a measure through which the circulating medium can be made to respond promptly to a diminished money demand . We have during recent years , with the enormous expansion in enterprise and general business no less than in the few weeks since this crisis has come upon us , been rather liberal in the creation of paper currency . If we are not careful we shall before long find ourselves face to face with so large a volume of paper money that gold will inevitably be driven out , If not some day , when this mass of paper can no longer be digested , we may be face to face with a depreciation In the standard of credit of the Government , as expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the currency , when legitimately needed will . under proper provision for this , take care of itself , if only in any scheme for the reform of the currency proper provision be first made for the promptest possible contraction of the circulating medium when its volume becomes too large for legitimate requirements . Nor is it likely that any scheme for the issuance of a circulating medium will prove permanently satisfactory which shall clothe 6,000 banks with the privilege of issuing credit currency , each for itself . " No matter how complete the safeguards may appear proposed to be established through the creation of a guarantee fund to be thrown around the exercise of this privilege . a single default . even if only temporary . would likely create prejudice against the entire volume of the outstanding currency , and no chances , however remote . ought to be permitted to be taken in this respect . Whether it shall be a central bank ? if authority for the establishment of such can he obtained  --  or a central association of National banks , to possess no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which under the stipulations and restrictions to be imposed by law they shall become entitled , there is needed a central authority to properly control and determine the issuance of any circulating medium based upon assets . " Such a oontroling central authority should end can best be constituted by the banks " themselves An association of National banks would . for the time being at least . likely prove more acceptable and nracticable than a central bank . The latter . to be of real advantage . would not only have to receive a monopoly of the privilege to issue circulating notes , hut would moreover have to become the depository of the funds of the Government . " It would have to undertake the discounting of commercial paper . both for hanks and for individuals . and it is not likely that the country is at this time prepared to sanction so far-reaching a scheme , which of necessity would revolutionize our entire National banking system . ? Clearing Ronne Certificates . " The one lesson , at least , which wet should learn from recent experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different bank centres , while no doubt it helped locally , has also worked considerable harm . It has broken down domestic exchanges and has paralyzed to a large extent the business of the country . Far better , as has recently been semi-officially proposed , that the Government itself should become authorized to Issue in times of great stress legal tender loan certificates through the Clearing Houses to the banks upon appropriate security and with stringent , autimatically acting provision for quick redemption . " Undesirable as such an expedient may be . perhaps . In itself from an economic point of view . it would at least prevent a breakdown of domestic exchanges . such as we have just experienced . resulting in a large premium upon currency . or , to state it more correctly . in a large discount upon bank checks . We have seen how the suspension of cash payments by the banks in the leading centres compelled us to throw upon Europe the burden of financing our cash require . ments almost entirely during the irnpertant period , of the crop movement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortifying for us. where It had to assume this burden almost singlehanded . " Isaac N. Seligman 's Speech . Isaac N. Seligman of New York said : " As Gov . Hughes had admirably stated in a recent address before the Civic Forum in New York . ' The quality of the administration of local officers lies with the citizens of the community . They will be good or bad as the public insists on the former or is content with the latter . ' So it is with our currency problem . It lies with us whether or not we shall have a sane , practical , and intelligent currency system . The great difficulty at present appears to be an overzealousness on the part of every one to offer some panacea for the present unsatisfactory monetary condition . " That the present crisis is not wholly due to our perverted and immobile monetary system Is possibly true ; at the same time the crisis might in a great measure have been mitigated if we had got our own house in order . Until we have a stable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to acute and humiliating financial conditions like those which now confront us . Fortunately , the present crisis has fully opened the eyes of the entire country to the importance of some currency legislation , and has convinced the people  --  not Wall Street , but the West and South as well  --  that some method must be found to prevent a recurrence of the present acute and distressing crisis and depression . Country Demands Intelligent Relief . " Congress has not beer . able to enact as yet any permanent plan of relief , and this has been chiefly due to two causes ? first , the fact that our legislators have not as yet given sufficient time and thought to an intelligent , scientific , and responsive currency plan , and second , their inability to unite on any definite plan . The country now imperatively demands some intelligent relief . " We have had numerous tentative schemes offered ; the Baltimore plan , 1891 ; the Carlisle and Fowler bills , the McCleary and Gage bills , the Monetary Cornmission Indianapolis Convention , 1898 plan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association plan , 190U . All these plans practically provide for asset currency , i. e. , the right to issue emergency currency based on a certain proportion of their bond secured circulation , having first lien on the assets of the bank , subject to a tax to provide for any possible losses . The weakness of these last two plans has always appeared to lie in the fact that the graduated rate of interest is not sufficiently high to insure the rapid redemption in normal times , and also not sufficiently high tax rate to prevent the issue of notes in advance of urgent requirements . It is likely that some measure of relief would have been afforded to the country if any one of these plans had been in operation during the present crisis ; at the same time it would serve only as a palliative and not as a cure . " There is truth In the statement of Lord Rothschild when he characteriztil this country as financially uncivilized in its banking methods . Plan of a Central Bank . " The fact that the Government bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close our eyes to the Importance of nowre-establishing such a bank , purged of many of its then evil features , and surrounded by reasonable safeguards and legislation . I do not propose to enter into any details as to the plan of a central bank and only give an outline . This central or Government bank should be owned jointly by the Government and the National banks . The Secretary of the Treasury and the Controller of the Currency should be represented on its board . The Treasury funds should be deposited with the central bank and the Government bank should have power to issue notes in certain proportion to its gold reserve or capital . " As it is likely that the sole right of such note issue would be opposed by our National banks , and any radical plan for a Government bank would probably not pass Congress at present , an alternative plan has been admirably developed In an article lately published by Mr. Paul M. Warburg , a banker In New York , under the title ' Plan of a Modified Central Bank . ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , as it provides for a Government bank limited chiefly to transactions with the Clearing Houses of the various cities . The bank is to deposit funds with Clearing Houses and National banks against United States bonds and other approved security as well as commercial paper and bankers ' bills with proper margins . " The plan has the great advantage of providing additional currency , the rate of interest to be fixed by the board , and the banks would have been able to rediscount their paper and to obtain banknotes to relieve the currency strain . Clearing House certificates issued in different centres in times like the present make it well-nigh impossible to arrange for transfers of money from one city to the other . Just now drafts on Philadelphia , Boston . and other banks sent for collection are being returned on the plea that momentarily it Is impossible to remit New York exchange . Each city issuing its own Clearing House certificates under the present abnormal conditions practically builds a Chinese wall against other centres . " There is no doubt in my mind that If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Knickerbocker Trust Company could have been avoided . as it could readily have hypothecated on the first day of its run $25,000,000 or more of its good securities with the central bank , and the heedless run on other trust companies would have been prevented . Proof of Value of Central Bank . " At the time of the failure of the Leipziger Bank in Germany ( an institution which had been grossly mismanaged by its Directors , many of whom , by the bye , are now serving State prison sentences ) there was a run on one of the largest banks in Germany . This bank turned over some 75,000,000 Rmx. of - discounts , 1 . e. , commercial ' and bankers " itidoreed three and ' slit Months ' bills , to thaReichs ? Bank , Which , in turn , . furnished the funds and'the run ceased a.t.once . The Sank of France has been shipping gold to . England , taking ' in payment finance bills , - and it is ' prepared to . ship us gold against commercial hills , thus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central or Government bank to other countries . What better proof is'needed of the value of central Or Government banks in such emergencies ? It is needless for me to dived longer on ? the Importance of some such central bank , and I refer you to a ? careful study of Mr. ' Warburg 's article , which hits been ! published in pamphlet form . " ? Treat Would Retire Banknotes . United States , Treastirer Treat ' spoke on " The Readjustment of Our Banking Systern and the Unification of the Currency . " He said . in part : " There is , an Undoubted sentiment that something should .. be done ? that would place our monetary ' system upon such a broad and comprehensive basis that . ould be lasting in its beneficent workings that would stand the test of time , not only Of half a century , ? but ? an entire century . " I advise legislation by Congress authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to retire United States notes in ? sums not less ? than $50,000,000 ; nor exceeding $100,000.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes and the releasing of the reserve fund for their redemption would give a , legal reserve of about e350. - 000,000 in gold for banking purposes . " The increased ? supply of gold would seem to , be an assurance that there need be no apprehension of a sufficient legal reserve , in case fifty or one hundrd millions per annum of greenbacks were replaced by gold coin . " If the gradual retirement of greenbacks was known to be the settled policy of the Government ' , this would glee rise to an enhancement of the credit , of the country , and the financial repute therefrom would far outweigh any paltry sexing of the interest account . Such a step would convince the , international investor that gold was the legal and established standard of the country , and that he might confidently feel that his investment would be returned to him ? In enkl on demand . It . would promote . a .. urger growth of the National banking system , which is doing so much to uphold the credit of our securities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $475 , - ? 000,000  --  and to issue therefor:a 2 per cent . United States fifty-year - bond , for an amount not exceeding $50.000,000 to $100. - 000,000 per annum . The silver dollars so released from pledge to pay silver certificates could be utilized for the Government 's need of subsidiary coin . " I would advise that the present Issue of National banknotes be retired , and that the Government bonds so pledged for circulation and payment be redeemed by . a special bond known as a banking bond , bearing interest at 2 per cent . for a term of not less than fifty years , and that such bonds as are now held for circulation shall be redeemed and paid for at a premium of 5 per cent . to reimburse the average cost to the investor . Under Control of the Government . The sale and purchase of these banking bonds should be under the absolute control of the Government , and when a bank desired to retire its circulation the Government should buy the bonds at not less than par and without premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Government bonds . " The bonds so purchased should be destroyed . The denominations of the bonds should not be less than $10,000 nor more than 4100.000 . The bonds to be Issued for the retirement of silver certificates should also be banking bonds . This would furnish the basis of additional circulation without contracting the volume of currency , and the total amount of 500 millions , which is the measure of the volume of silver certificates , would then - be reissued in the form of National currency . " The new issue of banknotes should be known as ' United States National bank currency . ' This designation would give it an international recognition and the sentiment of such a designation would inspire world-wide confidence in its geunineness and its financial responsibility . " The guarantee of the Government on the notes would simply be expressed thus , ' This note Is secured by bonds deposited with and guaranteed by the United States . ' Three hundred millions of the notes should be held in reserve , and as they would be used in common by every National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilized . " This readjustmentwould not only unify the currency , but it i its simplified design would avoid the well-deserved Criticism of confusion in our monetary forms of currency , and- make it more acceptable in all the money markets of the . world . The notes would be acceptable for taxes , . &o.,; in the same way as the present National banknotes . which would be in-supply until all the silver certificates had been called in and canceled . " This whole plan , as-I have outlined it , would not only accomplish a fundamental readjustment of our banking system , butl I believe would meet the needs of the American people hero to-day , and likewise the needs of fifty years hence . " What this country needs is not only an enlargement of banking credits at crop-moving seasons , but also the establishment of a system whereby the panicky conditions that recur every seven or ten , years may be met . " Controller IlIda-ely 's Address . 11 United States Controller Ridgely dwelt on the financial conditions existing in the United States . He said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact it had peen in progress for some time . The exact incident which precipitated the crisis and produced a panic is not very material . " The expansion of business and inflation of credits , whether based on transactions which would be classed as perfectly sound and legitimate , whether on semispeculative ' ventures , or on speculation , pure and simple , had reached the point where there had to be some settlement and liquidation . While it might be difficult to assign any single transaction to one of the before-mentioned classes it is impossible to separate the results on the general business situation and say which added to and produced - the catastrophe , and which did not ; how much was due to i legitimate enterprise , and how much to speculation . The time had arrived when some one had to pay the penalty for'the indulgences ' f the past . " The reaction and liquidation were not only absolutely inevitable , but necessary and desirable , in order to bring business of all kinds back to its normal condition . This should have been accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Never Any Necessity for a Panto . " There never is any . necessity for a panic , and this of all others should never have taken place , because conditions did not justify it in any way . Least of all should we have had a panic among the banks , and this particular panic might easily have been avoided , and in its place we might have had a more reasonable and orderly readjustment of credits and values , if we has a better system of currency , and a better system of banking , both National and State . " We would also have been ' in a very much better position if the relations between the business world and the Treasury Department had been ? on -a different basis ; if the Treasury Department had been either entirely out of business and free from responsibility as to business conditions , . as it ought to be , or if being in business , it had had the proper facilities to deal with the situation as It arose . " Mr. Ridgely said he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from his experience during the administrations of Secretaries Gage , Shaw , and Cortelyou he believed they were entitled to- the highest praise for what they have done with antiquated , cumbersome , and complicated facilities ; Mr. Cortelyou , he said , had done splendid work , but the Government had collected from its people 4245,000,000 surplus above Its necessary expenditures , and then to restore this money to circulation had to deposit $222,000,000 with-National banks , and whenahe supply of . Government bonds gave out , had to accept various other bonds as security. - " This is all - that could have been done under the circumstances , but the surplus should never have been qollectedtcf such a vast sum . The Government should riot take money - from you and . me when we need it Just to keep it on.hand as a panic fund . It is no proper governmental function to tax people for such ' a purpose .
