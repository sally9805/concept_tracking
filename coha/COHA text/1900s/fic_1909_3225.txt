JOHN HARDY 'S WILL XXXVI . GARRISON 'S VALUED FRIEND XXXVII . A HONEYMOON A Husband by Proxy CHAPTER I THE PROPOSITION With the hum of New York above , below , and all about him , stirring his pulses and prodding his mental activities , Jerold Garrison , expert criminologist , stood at the window of his recently opened office , looking out upon the roofs and streets of the city with a new sense of pride and power in his being . New York at last ! He was here -- unknown and alone , it was true -- but charged with an energy that he promised Manhattan should feel . He was almost penniless , with his office rent , his licenses , and other expenses paid , but he shook his fist at the city , in sheer good nature and confidence in his strength , despite the fact he had waited a week for expected employment , and nothing at present loomed upon the horizon . His past , in a small Ohio town , was behind him . He blotted it out without regret -- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gilded hopes which had once seemed his all upon earth . If his heart was not whole , no New York eye should see its wounds -- and the healing process had begun . He was part of the vast machine about him , the mighty brain , as it were , of the great American nation . He paced the length of his room , and glanced at the door . The half-painted sign on the frosted glass was legible , reversed , as the artist had left it : JEROLD  - -   - -   - -   - -   CRIMINOLOGIST . He had halted the painter himself on the name , as the lettering appeared too fanciful -- not sufficiently plain or bold . While he stood there a shadow fell upon the glass . Someone was standing outside , in the hall . As if undecided , the owner of the shadow oscillated for a moment -- and disappeared . Garrison , tempted to open the door and gratify a natural curiosity , remained beside his desk . Mechanically his hand , which lay upon a book entitled " A Treatise on Poisons , " closed the volume . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob was revolved , and there , in the oaken frame , stood a tall young woman of extraordinary beauty , richly though quietly dressed , and swiftly changing color with excitement . Pale in one second , crimson in the next , and evidently concentrating all her power on an effort to be calm , she presented a strangely appealing and enchanting figure to the man across the room . Bravery was blazing in her glorious brown eyes , and firmness came upon her manner as she stepped inside , closed the door , and silently confronted the detective . The man she was studying was a fine-looking , clean-cut fellow , gray-eyed , smooth-shaven , with thick brown hair , and with a gentleman-athlete air that made him distinctly attractive . The fearless , honest gaze of his eyes completed a personal charm that was undeniable in his entity . It seemed rather long that the two thus stood there , face to face . Garrison candidly admiring in his gaze , his visitor studious and slightly uncertain . She was the first to speak . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective answered . " My sign is unfinished . May I offer you a chair ? " His caller sat down beside the desk . She continued to study his face frankly , with a half-shy , half-defiant scrutiny , as if she banished a natural diffidence under pressure of necessity . She spoke again , abruptly . " I wish to procure peculiar services . Are you a very well-known detective ? " " I have never called myself a detective , " said Garrison . " I 'm trying to occupy a higher sphere of usefulness . I left college a year ago , and last week opened my office here and became a New Yorker . " He might , in all modesty , have exhibited a scrap-book filled with accounts of his achievements , with countless references to his work as a " scientific criminologist " of rare mental attainments . Of his attainments as a gentleman there was no need of reference . They proclaimed themselves in his bearing . His visitor laid a glove and a scrap of paper on the desk . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said ; " but of course you are widely acquainted in New York -- I mean with young men particularly ? " " No , " he replied , " I know almost none . But I know the city fairly well , if that will answer your purpose . " " I thought , of course -- I hoped you might know some honorable --  --  You see , I have come on rather extraordinary business , " she said , faltering a little helplessly . " Let me ask you first -- is the confidence of a possible client quite sacred with a man in this profession ? " " Absolutely sacred ! " he assured her . " Whether you engage my services or not , your utterances here will be treated as confidential and as inviolate as if spoken to a lawyer , a doctor , or a clergyman . " " Thank you , " she murmured . " I have been hunting around --  --  " She left the sentence incomplete . " And you found my name quite by accident , " he supplied , indicating the scrap of paper . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices first . You have tramped all the way down Broadway from Forty-second Street , for the red ink that someone spilled at the Forty-first Street crossing is still on your shoe , together with just a film of dust . " She withdrew her shoe beneath the edge of her skirt , although he had never apparently glanced in that direction . " Yes , " she admitted , " I have been to others -- and they would n't do . I came in here because of the name -- Jerold . I am sorry you are not better acquainted -- for my business is important . " " Perhaps if I knew the nature of your needs I might be able to advise you , " said Garrison . " I hope to be more widely acquainted soon . " She cast him one look , full of things inscrutable , and lowered her lashes in silence . She was evidently striving to overcome some indecision . Garrison looked at her steadily . He thought he had never in his life beheld a woman so beautiful . Some wild , unruly hope that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flaring in his mind . The color came and went in her cheeks , adding fresh loveliness at every change . She glanced at her list of names , from which a number had been scratched . " Well , " she said presently , " I think perhaps you might still be able to attend to my requirements . " He waited to hear her continue , but she needed encouragement . " I shall be glad to try , " he assured her . She was silent again -- and blushing . She looked up somewhat defiantly . " I wish you to procure me a husband . " Garrison stared . He was certain he had heard incorrectly . " I do not mean an actual husband , " she explained . " I simply mean some honorable young man who will assume the role for a time , as a business proposition , for a fee to be paid as I would pay for anything else . " I would require that he understand the affair to be strictly commercial , and that when I wish the arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my acquaintance at once and absolutely . " All I ask of you is to supply me such a person . I will pay you whatever fee you may demand -- in reason . " Garrison looked at her as fixedly as she was looking at him . Her recital of her needs had brought to the surface a phase of desperation in her bearing that wrought upon him potently , he knew not why . " I think I understand your requirements , as far as one can in the circumstances , " he answered . " I hardly believe I have the ability to engage such a person as you need for such a mission . I informed you at the start that my acquaintance with New York men is exceedingly narrow . I can not think of anyone I could honestly recommend . " " But do n't you know any honorable young gentleman -- like some college man , perhaps -- here in New York , looking for employment ; someone who might be glad to earn , say , five hundred dollars ? " she insisted . " Surely if you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Garrison sat back in his chair and took hold of his smooth-shaved lip with his thumb and finger . He reviewed his few New York experiences rapidly . " No , " he repeated . " I know of no such man . I am sorry . " His visitor looked at him with a new , flashing light in her eyes . " Not one ? " she said , significantly . " Not one young college man ? " He was unsuspicious of her meaning . " Not one . " For a moment she fingered her glove where it lay upon the desk . Then a look of more pronounced determination and courage came upon her face as she raised her eyes once more to Garrison 's . She said : " Are you married ? " A flush came at once upon Garrison 's face -- and memories and heartaches possessed him for a poignant moment . He mastered himself almost instantly . " No , " he said with some emotion , " I am not . " " Then , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward on the table . Lightning from an azure sky could have been no more astonishing or unexpected . " Do you mean -- will I play this role -- as your husband ? " he said slowly . " Is that what you are asking ? " " Yes , " she answered unflinchingly . " Why not ? You need the money ; I need the services . You understand exactly what it is I require . It is business , and you are a business man . " " But I have no wish to be a married man , or even to masquerade as one , " he told her bluntly . " You have quite as much wish to be one as I have to be a married woman , " she answered . " We would understand each other thoroughly from the start . As to masquerading , if you have no acquaintances , then who would be the wiser ? " He acknowledged the logic of her argument ; nevertheless , the thing seemed utterly preposterous . He rose and walked the length of his office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned and resumed his seat . He was strangely moved by her beauty and some unexplained helplessness of her plight , vouchsafed to his senses , yet he recognized a certain need for caution . " What should I be expected to do ? " he inquired . His visitor , in the mental agitation which had preceded this interview , had taken little if any time to think of the details likely to attend an alliance such as she had just proposed . She could only think in generalities . " Why -- there will be very little for you to do , except to permit yourself to be considered my lawful husband , temporarily , " she replied after a moment of hesitation , with a hot flush mounting to her cheek . " And to whom would I play ? " he queried . " Should I be obliged , in this capacity , to meet your relatives and friends ? " " Certainly -- a few , " said his visitor . " But I have almost no relatives in the world . I have no father , mother , brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few distant relatives and possibly my lawyer . " Garrison made no response . He was trying to think what such a game would mean -- and what it might involve . His visitor presently added : " Do you consent -- for five hundred dollars ? " " I do n't know , " answered the man . Again he paced the room . When he halted before his client he looked at her sternly . " You have n't told me your name , " he said . She gave him her card , on which appeared nothing more than just merely the name " Mrs. Jerold Fairfax , " with an address in an uptown West Side street . Garrison glanced at it briefly . " This is something you have provided purposely to fit your requirements , " he said . " Am I not supposed to know you by any other name ? " " If you accept the -- the employment , " she answered , once more blushing crimson , " you may be obliged at times to call me Dorothy . My maiden name was Dorothy Booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were silent for a moment . The man was pondering the possibilities . His visitor was evidently anxious . " I suppose I can find someone else if you refuse the employment , " she said . " But you will understand that my search is one of great difficulty . The person I employ must be loyal , a gentleman , courageous , resourceful , and very little known . You can see yourself that you are particularly adapted for the work . " " Thank you , " said Garrison , who was aware that no particular flattery was intended . He added : " I hardly suppose it could do me any harm . " Mrs. Fairfax accepted this ungallant observation calmly . She recognized the fact that his side of the question had its aspects . She waited for Garrison to speak again . A knock at the door startled them both . A postman entered , dropped two letters on the desk , and departed down the hall . Garrison took up the letters . One was a circular of his own , addressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undelivered and marked " Not found , " though three or four different addresses had been supplied in its peregrinations . The second letter was addressed to himself in typewritten form . He was too engrossed to tear it open , and laid them both upon the table . " If I took this up , " he presently resumed , " I should be obliged to know something more about it . For instance , when were we supposed to have been married ? " " On the 10th of last month , " she answered promptly . " Oh ! " said he . " And , in case of necessity , how should we prove it ? " " By my wedding certificate , " she told him calmly . His astonishment increased . " Then you were actually married , over a month ago ? " " I have the certificate . Is n't that sufficient ? " she replied evasively . " Well -- I suppose it is -- for this sort of an arrangement , " he agreed . " Of course some man 's name must appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to adopt his name as part of the arrangement ? " " Certainly , " she said . " I told you I came into your office because your name is Jerold . " " Exactly , " he mused . " The name I 'd assume is Jerold Fairfax ? " She nodded , watching him keenly . " It 's a good enough name , " said Garrison . He paced up and down the floor in silence a number of times . Mrs. Fairfax watched him in apparent calm . " This is a great temptation , " he admitted . " I should like to earn the fee you have mentioned , Miss Booth -- Mrs . Fairfax , but --  --  " He halted . " Well ? " " I do n't exactly like the look of it , to be frank , " he confessed . " I do n't know you , and you do n't know me . I am not informed whether you are really married or not . If you are , and the man --  --  You have no desire to enlighten me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend that I am your husband ? " " I do not wish to discuss that aspect of the arrangement at present , " she said . " It is purely a business proposition that should last no more than a month or two at most , and then terminate forever . I would prefer to have you remain out of town as much as possible . " " A great many haphazard deductions present themselves to my mind , " he said , " but all are doubtless inaccurate . I have no morbid curiosity concerning your affairs , but this thing would involve me almost as much as yourself , by its very nature . " His brows were knitted in indecision . There was silence again between them . His visitor presently said : " If I could offer you more than the five hundred dollars , I would gladly do so . " " Oh , the fee is large enough , for up to date I have had no employment or even a prospect of work , " said Garrison . " I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently become a cautious man . " " I know how strange it appears for me to come here with this extraordinary request , " agreed Mrs. Fairfax . " I hardly know how I have done so . But there was no one to help me . I hope you will not consider the matter for another moment if you feel that either of us can not trust the other . In a way , I am placing my honor in your keeping far more than you are placing yourself in charge of mine . " Garrison looked at her steadily , and something akin to sympathy -- something that burned like wine of romance in his blood -- with zest of adventure and a surge of generosity toward this unknown girl -- tingled in all his being . Something in her helplessness appealed to his innate chivalry . Calmly , however , he took a new estimate of her character , notwithstanding the fact that his first , most reliable impression had been entirely in her favor . " Well , " he said , after a moment , " it 's a blind game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . When do you wish me to begin my services ? " " I should like to notify my lawyer as soon as possible , " answered Mrs. Fairfax , frankly relieved by his decision . " He may regard the fact that he was not sooner notified as a little peculiar . " " Practically you wish me to assume my role at once , " commented Garrison . " What is your lawyer 's name ? " " Mr. Stephen Trowbridge . " Garrison took up that much-addressed letter , returned by the post , and passed it across the table . The one fairly legible line on its surface read : STEPHEN TROWBRIDGE , ESQ . " I think that must be the same individual , " he said . " I sent out announcements of my business and presence here to nearly every lawyer in the State . This envelope has been readdressed , as you observe , but it has never reached its destination . Is that your man ? " Mrs. Fairfax examined the missive . " Yes , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " If you please , " answered Garrison . " I shall take the liberty of steaming this open and removing its contents , after which I will place an antedated letter or notification of the -- our marriage -- written by yourself -- in the envelope , redirect it , and send it along . It will finally land in the hands of your lawyer with its tardiness very naturally explained . " " You mean the notification will appear as if misdirected originally , " said Dorothy . " An excellent idea . " " Perhaps you will compose the note at once , " said Garrison , pushing paper , pen , and ink across the desk . " You may leave the rest , with the address , to me . " His visitor hesitated for a moment , as if her decision wavered in this vital moment of plunging into unknown fates , but she took up the pen and wrote the note and address with commendable brevity . Garrison was walking up and down the office . " The next step --  --  " he started to say , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to take until something arises making others expedient ? " " There is one slight thing remaining , " he answered , taking up her card . " You are in a private residence ? " " Yes . The caretaker , a woman , is always there . " " Have you acquainted her with the fact of your marriage ? " " Certainly . She is an English servant . She asks no questions . But I told her my husband is away from town and will be absent almost constantly for the next two or three months . " Garrison slightly elevated his brows , in acknowledgment of the thoroughness of her arrangements . " I have never attempted much acting -- a little at private theatricals , " he told her ; " but of course we shall both be obliged to play this little domestic comedy with some degree of art . " She seemed prepared for that also , despite the sudden crimson of her cheeks . " Certainly . " " One more detail , " he added . " You have probably found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust I shall not be led into awkward blunders . I shall do my best , and for the rest -- I beg of you to conduct the affair according to your own requirements and judgment . " The slightly veiled smile in his eyes did not escape her observation . Nevertheless , she accepted his proposal quite as a matter of course . " Thank you . I am glad you relieved me of the necessity of making some such suggestion . I think that is all -- for the present . " She stood up , and , fingering her glove , glanced down at the table for a moment . " May I pay , say , two hundred dollars now , as a retainer ? " " I shall be gratified if you will , " he answered . In silence she counted out the money , which she took from a purse in a bag . The bills lay there in a heap . " When you wish any more , will you please let me know ? " she said . " And when I require your services I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and your house address . " He wrote them both on a card and placed it in her hand . " Thank you , " she murmured . She closed her purse , hesitated a moment , then raised her eyes to his . Quite coldly she added : " Good-afternoon . " " Good-day , " answered Garrison . He opened the door , bowed to her slightly as she passed -- then faced about and stared at the money that lay upon his desk . CHAPTER II A SECOND EMPLOYMENT For a moment , when he found himself alone , Garrison stood absolutely motionless beside the door . Slowly he came to the desk again , and slowly he assembled the bills . He rolled them in a neat , tight wad , and held them in his hand . Word for word and look for look he reviewed the recent dialogue , shaking his head at the end . He had never been so puzzled in his life . The situation , his visitor -- all of it baffled him utterly . Had not the money remained in his grasp he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened , and yet she had a most remarkable amount of nerve , " he reflected . " She might be an heiress , an actress , or a princess . She may be actually married -- and then again she may not ; probably not , since two husbands on the scene would be embarrassing . " " She may be playing at any sort of a game , financial , political , or domestic -- therefore dangerous , safe , or commonplace , full of intrigue , or a mystery , or the silliest caprice . " She -- oh , Lord -- I do n't know ! She is beautiful -- that much is certain . She seems to be honest . Those deep , brown eyes go with innocence -- and also with scheming ; in which respect they precisely resemble blue eyes , and gray , and all the other feminine colors . And yet she seemed , well , helpless , worried -- almost desperate . She must be desperate and helpless . " Again , in fancy , he was looking in her face , and something was stirring in his blood . That was all he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting -- glad he had entered her employment . He placed the roll of money in his pocket , then looked across his desk at the clean , white letter which the postman had recently delivered . He took it up , paused again to wonder at the meaning of what had occurred , then tore the envelope and drew forth the contents . He had barely spread the letter open when a knock on the door startled every thought in his brain . His first conclusion was that Mrs. Fairfax had returned to repudiate her bargain and ask the surrender of her money . With a smile for any fate , he crossed the room and opened the door . In the hallway stood a man -- a little , sharp-faced , small-eyed , thin-nosed person , with a very white complexion , and a large , smooth-shaved mouth , open as if in a smile that never ceased . " Garrison ? " he said sharply . " Wicks -- I 'm Wicks . " " Wicks ? " said Garrison . " Come in . " Mr. Wicks stepped in with a snap-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " read your letter . " Obediently Garrison perused the missive in hand , typed on the steel-plate stationery of the New York Immutable Life Insurance Company : " DEAR SIR : " At the recommendation of our counsel , Mr. Sperry Lochlan , who is still abroad , we desire to secure your services in a professional capacity . Our Mr. Wicks will call upon you this afternoon to explain the nature of the employment and conclude the essential arrangements . " Respectfully yours , " JOHN STEFFAS , " Dep't of Special Service . " A wave of gratitude toward Lochlan , the lawyer who had first employed him , and advised this New York office , surged with another , of almost boyish joy , through Garrison 's being . It seemed almost absurd that two actual clients should thus have appeared within the hour . He looked up at the little man with a new , keen interest . " I am glad to meet you , Mr. Wicks , " he said . " Will you please sit down ? I am at your service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was quite a violent maneuver , especially as that sinister grin never for a moment left his features . He took off his hat and made a vicious dive at a wisp of long , red hair that adorned the otherwise barren top of his head . The wisp lay down toward his left ear when thus adjusted . He looked up at Garrison almost fiercely . " Obscure , ai n't you ? " he demanded . " Obscure ? " inquired Garrison . " Perhaps I am -- just at present -- here in New York . " " You are ! " stated Mr. Wicks aggressively . Garrison was not enamored of his manner . " All right , " he said --  " all right . " Mr. Wicks suddenly leaned forward and fetched his index finger almost up against the young man 's nose . " Good at murder ? " he demanded . Garrison began to suspect that the building might harbor lunatics , several of whom had escaped . " Am I good at murder ? " he repeated . " Doing murder or --  --  " " Ferreting murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor irritably . " Oh , " said Garrison , " if you wish to employ me on a murder case , I 'll do the best I can . " " You worked out the Biddle robbery ? " queried Mr. Wicks . Garrison replied that he had . The Biddle robbery was the Lochlan case -- his first adventure in criminology . " Take the case ! " commanded Mr. Wicks in his truculent manner . " Two hundred and fifty a month as long as you work . One thousand dollars bonus if you find the murderer . Accept the terms ? " " Yes , I 'll take the case , " he said . " What sort of --  --  " Mr. Wicks made a sudden snatch at his wisp of hair , adjusted it quite to the other side of his head , then as abruptly drew a paper from his pocket and thrust it into Garrison 's hand . " Statement of the case , " he interrupted . " Read it . " Garrison accepted the document , spread it open , and read as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age -- 57 . Occupation -- Real estate dealer ( retired ) . Residence -- Unfixed , changed frequently ( last , Hickwood , two days , boarding ) . Family -- No immediate family ( no one nearer than nephews and nieces ) . Rating in Bradbury's -- No rating . Insured in any other companies -- No . Insured with us for what amount -- Twenty thousand dollars . Name of beneficiary -- Charles Scott . Residence -- Hickwood , New York ( village ) . Occupation -- Inventor . Date of subject 's death -- May 27th . Place of death -- Village of Branchville ( near Hickwood ) . Verdict of coroner -- Death from natural causes ( heart failure or apoplexy ) .

Suspicious **26;2289;TOOLONG paid once before on claim for similar amount , death of risk having been equally sudden and unexplained . Remarks -- The body was found on the porch of an empty house ( said by superstitious neighbors to be haunted ) . It was found in sitting posture , leaning against post of porch .

Details supplied by old woman , Mrs. Webber , whose son found deceased . Our company not represented , either at inquest or afterward , as no notification of subject 's death was filed until the 31st inst . At the bottom , written in pencil , appeared the words : " Quiet case . Steffas . " That was all . Garrison turned the paper . There was nothing on the reverse . Placing it face upward on the table , he thrust his hands into his pockets and looked at Mr. Wicks . " I 'm expected to fasten this crime on Scott ? " he inquired . " Is that what your company requires ? " " Fasten the crime on the guilty man ! " replied the aggressive Mr. Wicks . " If Scott did n't do it , we 'll pay the claim . If he did , we 'll send him to the chair . It may not be murder at all . " " Of course , " said Garrison . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? " said Wicks . " I wondered why the writer drops out of the case , " answered Garrison . " That 's all . " " I wrote it , " said Wicks . " Scott knows me from the former case . If you want the case , you will start this evening for Hickwood and begin your work . Use your own devices . Report everything promptly -- everything . Go at once to the office and present your card for expenses and typed instructions . Good-day ! " He had clapped on his hat . He strode to the door , opened it , disappeared , and closed it again as if he worked on springs . Garrison was left staring at the knob , his hand mechanically closed on the statement intrusted to his keeping . " Well , " he said , " I 'll be scalloped ! Good old New York ! " He was presently out upon the street , a brisk , active figure , boarding a Broadway car for the downtown office of the company . At half past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second hundred dollars in his pocket , fifty of which was for expenses . He was turning away from his desk at last to leave for his lodgings , thence to journey to Hickwood , when a messenger-boy abruptly appeared with a telegram . When Garrison had signed , he opened the envelope and read the following : " Wire me you have arrived unexpectedly and will be here at eight , then come . " DOROTHY FAIRFAX . " He almost ran from the building , bought a five-dollar bunch of the choicest roses , and , after wiring in accordance with instructions , sent them to the house . CHAPTER III TWO ENCOUNTERS Garrison roomed in Forty-fourth Street , where he occupied a small , second-story apartment . His meals he procured at various restaurants where fancy chanced to lead . To-night a certain eagerness for adventure possessed his being . More than anything else in the world he wished to see Dorothy again ; he hardly dared confess why , but told himself that she was charming -- and his nature demanded excitement . He dined well and leisurely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wife , " dressed himself with exceptional care , and at length took an uptown train for his destination . All the way on the cars he was thinking of the task he had undertaken to perform . Not without certain phases of amusement , he rehearsed his part , and made up his mind to leave nothing of the role neglected . Arrived in the West Side street , close to the house which should have been Dorothy 's , he discovered that the numbering on the doors had been wretchedly mismanaged . One or the other of two brownstone fronts must be her residence ; he could not determine which . The nearest was lighted from top to bottom . In the other a single pair of windows only , on the second floor , showed the slightest sign of life . Resolved to be equal to anything the adventure might require , he mounted the steps of the lighted dwelling and rang the bell . He was almost immediately admitted by a serving-man , who appeared a trifle surprised to behold him , but who bowed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deference . " What shall I call you ? " he said . Garrison was surprised , but he announced : " Just Mr. Jerold . " A second door was opened ; a gush of perfumed air , a chorus of gay young voices , and a peal of laughter greeted Garrison 's ears as the servant called out his name . Instantly a troop of brilliantly dressed young women came running from the nearest room , all in fancy costume and all of them masked . Evidently a fancy-dress party was about to begin in the house . Garrison realized his blunder . Before he could move , a stunning , superbly gowned girl , with bare neck and shoulders that were the absolute perfection of beauty , came boldly up to where the visitor stood . The others had ceased their laughter . " Jerold !  - -  how good of you to come ! " said the girl , and , boldly patting his face with her hand , she quickly darted from him , while the others laughed with glee . Garrison was sure he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to note anything about her , save that on her neck she wore two necklaces -- one of diamonds , the other of pearls , and both of wonderful gems . Then out from the room from which she had come stepped a man appareled as Satan -- in red from top to toe . He , too , was in mask . He joined in the laughter with the others . Garrison " found himself " with admirable presence of mind . " My one regret is that I may not remain , " he said , with a bow to the ladies . " I might also regret having entered the wrong house , but your reception renders such an emotion impossible . " He bowed himself out with commendable grace , and the bold masquerader threw kisses as he went . Amused , quite as much as annoyed , at his blunder , he made himself ready as best he might for another adventure , climbed the steps of the dwelling next at hand , and once more rang the bell . Almost immediately the dark hall was lighted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Garrison beheld a squint-eyed , thin-lipped old man , who scowled upon him and remained there , barring his way . " Good evening -- is my wife at home -- Mrs . Fairfax ? " said Garrison , stepping in . " I wired her --  --  " " Jerold ! " cried a voice , as the girl in the party-house had done . But this was Dorothy , half-way down the stairs , running toward him eagerly , and dressed in most exquisite taste . Briskly stepping forward , ready with the role he had rehearsed , he caught her in his arms as she came to the bottom of the stairs , and she kissed him like a sweet young wife , obeying the impulse of her nature . " Oh , Jerold , I 'm so glad ! " she said . " I do n't see why you have to go away at nine ! " She was radiant with blushes . He recognized a cue . " And how 's the dearest little girl in all the world ? " he said , handing her the box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make it , till I wired . While this bit of important business lasts we must do the best we can . " He had thrown his arm about her carelessly . She moved away with a natural gesture towards the man who had opened the door . " Oh , Jerold , this is my Uncle Sykey -- Mr . Robinson , " she said . " He and Aunt Jill have come to pay me a visit . We must all go upstairs to the parlor . " She was pale with excitement , but her acting was perfect . Garrison turned to the narrow-eyed old man , who was scowling darkly upon him . " I 'm delighted to meet you , " he said , extending his hand . " Um ! Thank you , " said Robinson , refusing his hand . " Extraordinary honeymoon you 're giving my niece , Mr. Fairfax . " His manner nettled Garrison , who could not possibly have gauged the depth of the old man 's dislike , even hatred , conceived against him simply as Dorothy 's husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wits . " The present arrangement will not endure very long , " he said significantly . " In the meantime , if Dorothy is satisfied there seems to be no occasion for anyone else to feel distressed . " " If that 's intended as a fling at me --  --  " started Robinson , but Dorothy interrupted . " Please come upstairs , " she said , laying her hand for a moment on Garrison 's shoulder ; and then she ran up lightly , looking back with all the smiles of perfect art . Garrison read it as an invitation to a private confidence , much needed to put him properly on guard . He bounded up as if in hot pursuit , leaving her uncle down there by the door . She fled to the end of the upper hall , near a door that was closed . Garrison had lost no space behind her . She turned a white , tense face as she came to a halt . " Be careful , please , " she whispered . " Some of my relatives appeared here unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get away just as soon as you can . You are merely passing through the city . You must write me daily letters while they are here -- and -- do n't forget who you are supposed to be ! " She was radiant again with blushes . Garrison was almost dazzled by her beauty . What reply he might have made was interrupted . Dorothy caught him by the hand , like a fond young bride , as her uncle came rapidly up the stairs . The door was opened at his elbow by a white-haired , almost " bearded " woman , large , sharp-sighted , and ugly , with many signs of both inquisitiveness and acquisitiveness upon her . " So , that 's your Mr. Fairfax , " she said to Dorothy . " Come in here till I see what you 're like . " Dorothy had again taken Garrison 's arm . She led him forward . " This is Aunt Jill , " she said , by way of introduction and explanation . " Aunty , this is my husband , Jerold . " Aunt Jill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrison realized at once that Dorothy 's marriage had excited much antagonism in the breasts of both these relatives . A sudden accession of boldness came upon him , in his plan to protect the girl . He entered the room and faced the woman calmly . " I 'm glad to meet you , " he said , this time without extending his hand . " I beg to impress upon both you and Mr. Robinson that , such as I am , Dorothy chose me of her own free will to occupy my present position . " Mrs. Robinson was momentarily speechless . Her husband now stood in the door . Dorothy shot Garrison a look of gratitude , but her immediate desire was for peace . " Let us all sit down , and try to get better acquainted , " she said . " I 'm sure we shall all be friends . " " No doubt , " said her uncle somewhat offensively . Garrison felt himself decidedly uncertain of his ground . There was nothing to do , however , but await developments . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a large apartment , furnished handsomely , perhaps even richly , but in a style no longer modern , save for the installation of electric lights . It contained a piano , a fireplace , a cabinet , writing-desk , two settees , and the customary complement of chairs . The pictures on the walls were rather above the average , even in the homes of the wealthy . The objects of art , disposed in suitable places , were all in good taste and expensive . Quite at a loss to meet these people to advantage , uninformed as he was of anything vital concerning Dorothy and the game she might be playing , Garrison was rendered particularly alert by the feeling of constraint in the air . He had instantly conceived a high appreciation for Dorothy 's art in her difficult position , and he rose to a comprehension of the role assigned to himself . He had earlier determined to appear affectionate ; he now saw the need of enacting the part of protector . In the full illumination of the room , the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face with no need of acting , and the admiration blazing in his gaze was more than genuine ; it was thoroughly spontaneous and involuntary . The moment was awkward and fraught with suspense for Garrison , as he found himself subjected to the flagrantly unfriendly appraisement of his newly acquired relations . Aunt Jill had been wilted for a moment only . She looked their visitor over with undisguised contempt . " Well , I dare say you look respectable and healthy , " she said , as if conceding a point with no little reluctance , " but appearances are very deceiving . " " Thank you , " said Garrison . He sat down near Dorothy , occupying a small settee . If Mrs. Robinson was personally pugnacious , her husband harbored far more vicious emotions . Garrison felt this in his manner . The man was looking at him narrowly . " How much of your time have you spent with your wife since your marriage ? " he demanded , without the slightest preliminary introduction to the subject . Garrison realized at once that Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not correspond . He assumed a calm and deliberation he was far from feeling , as he said : " I was not aware that I should be obliged to account to anyone save Dorothy for my goings and comings . Up to the present I believe she has been quite well satisfied with my deportment ; have n't you , Dorothy ? " " Perfectly , " said Dorothy , whose utterance was perhaps a trifle faint . " Ca n't we all be friends -- and talk about --  --  " " I prefer to talk about this for a moment , " interrupted her uncle , still regarding Garrison with the closest scrutiny . " What 's your business , anyway , Mr. Fairfax ? " Garrison , adhering to a policy of telling the truth with the greatest possible frequency , and aware that evasion would avail them nothing , waited the fraction of a minute for Dorothy to speak . She was silent . He felt she had not committed herself or him upon the subject . " I am engaged at present in some insurance business , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to-night , and keep me away for a somewhat indefinite period . " " H 'm ! " said Mr. Robinson . " I suppose you 'll quit your present employment pretty soon ? " With no possible chance of comprehending the drift of inquiry , Garrison responded : " Possibly . " " I thought so ! " exclaimed the old man , with unconcealed asperity . " Marrying for money is much more remunerative , hey ? " " Oh , uncle ! " said Dorothy . Her pain and surprise were quite genuine . Garrison colored instantly . He might have been hopelessly floundering in a moment had not a natural indignation risen in his blood . " Please remember that up to this evening you and I have been absolute strangers , " he said , with some heat . " I am not the kind to marry for money . Had I done so I should not continue in my present calling for a very modest compensation . " He felt that Dorothy might misunderstand or even doubt his resolution to go on with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain assignments for my present employers which I mean to put through to the end , and no one aware of my motives could charge me with anything sordid . " Dorothy rose , crossed the space between her chair and the small settee where Garrison was seated , took the place at his side , and shyly laid her hand upon his own . It was a natural , wifely thing to do . Garrison recognized her perfect acting . A tingle of strange , lawless joy ran through his veins ; nevertheless , he still faced Robinson , for his anger had been no pretense . There was something in his bearing , when aroused , that invited caution . He was not a man with whom to trifle . Mrs. Robinson , having felt it before , underwent the experience anew . " Let 's not start off with a row , " she said . " No one means to offend you , Mr. Fairfax . " " What do you think he 'll do ? " demanded her husband . " Order us out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows it . " Garrison knew nothing concerning the ownership of the house . Mr. Robinson 's observation gave him a hint , however , that Dorothy 's husband , or Dorothy herself , would presumably own this dwelling soon , but that something had occurred to delay the actual possession . " I came to see Dorothy , and for no other purpose , " he said . " I have n't the slightest desire or intention to offend her relatives . " If Robinson and his wife understood the hint that he would be pleased to see Dorothy alone , they failed to act upon it . " We 'll take your future operations as our guide , " said Mr. Robinson significantly . " Protestations cost nothing . " Mrs. Robinson , far more shrewd than her husband , in her way , had begun to realize that Garrison was not a man either to be frightened or bullied . " I 'm sure we shall all be friends , " she said . " What 's the use of fighting ? If , as Mr. Fairfax says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband interrupted . " I do n't believe it ! Will you tell me , Mr. Fairfax , that when you married my niece you were not aware of her prospects ? " " I knew absolutely nothing of her prospects , " said Garrison , who thought he foresaw some money struggle impending . " She can tell you that up to the present moment I have never asked her a word concerning her financial status or future expectations . " " Why do n't you tell us you never knew she had an uncle ? " demanded Robinson , with no abatement of acidity . " As a matter of fact , " replied Garrison , " I have never known the name of any of Dorothy 's relations till to-night . " " This is absurd ! " cried the aggravated Mr. Robinson . " Do you mean to tell me --  --  " Garrison cut in upon him with genuine warmth . He was fencing blindly in Dorothy 's behalf , and instinct was guiding him with remarkable precision . " I should think you might understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman , with a natural desire to be esteemed for herself alone , might purposely avoid all mention both of her relatives and prospects . " " We 've all heard about these marriages for love , " sneered Dorothy 's uncle . " Where did you suppose she got this house ? " Garrison grew bolder as he felt a certain confidence that so far he had made no particular blunders . His knowledge of the value of half a truth , or even the truth entire , was intuitive . " I have never been in this house before tonight , " he said . " Our ' honeymoon , ' as you called it earlier , has , as you know , been brief , and none of it was spent beneath this roof . " " Then how did you know where to come ? " demanded Mr. Robinson . " Dorothy supplied me the address , " answered Garrison . " It is not uncommon , I believe , for husband and wife to correspond . " " Well , here we are , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " till the will and all the business is settled . Perhaps you 'll say you did n't even know there was a will . " Garrison was beginning to see light , dimly . What it was that lay behind Dorothy 's intentions and her scheme he could not know ; he was only aware that to-night , stealing a glance at her sweet but worried face , and realizing faintly that she was greatly beset with troubles , his whole heart entered the conflict , willingly , to help her through to the end . " You are right for once , " he answered his inquisitor . " I have known absolutely nothing of any will affecting Dorothy , and I know nothing now . I only know you can rely upon me to fight her battles to the full extent of my ability and strength . " " What nonsense ! You do n't know ! " exclaimed Mr. Robinson . " Why --  --  " " It 's the truth , " interrupted Dorothy . " I have told him nothing about it . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But whatever he knows , I 'll tell him this , that I propose to fight that will , day and night , before my brother 's property shall go to any scheming stranger ! " Garrison felt the need for enlightenment . It was hardly fair to expect him to struggle in the dark . He looked at his watch ostentatiously . " I did not come here expecting this sort of reception , " he said truthfully . " I hoped at least for a few minutes ' time with Dorothy , alone . " " To cook up further stories , I presume , " said Mr. Robinson , who made no move to depart . Garrison rose and approached Mr. Robinson precisely as he might have done had his right been more than a fiction . " Do you require Dorothy to go down in the hall , in her own house , to obtain a moment of privacy ? " he demanded . " We might as well understand the situation first as last . " It was a half-frightened look , full of craft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fidgeted , then rose from his seat . " Come , my dear , " he said to his wife , " the persecutions have commenced . " He led the way from the room to another apartment , his wife obediently following at his heels . The door they left ajar . CHAPTER IV UNSPOKEN ANTAGONISM Garrison crossed the room with an active stride and closed the door firmly . Dorothy was pale when he turned . She , too , was standing . " You can see that I 've got to be posted a little , " he said quietly . " To err has not ceased to be human . " " You have made no mistakes , " said Dorothy in a voice barely above a whisper . " I did n't expect them . When I found they had come I hardly knew what to do . And when they declared I had no husband I had to request you to come . " " Something of the sort was my conclusion , " Garrison told her . " I have blundered along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I supposed to have done that excites them both to insult me ? " Dorothy seemed afraid that the very walls might hear and betray her secret . " Your supposed marriage to me is sufficient , " she answered in the lowest of undertones . " You must have guessed that they feel themselves cheated out of this house and other property left in a relative 's will . " " Cheated by your marriage ? " said Garrison . She nodded , watching to see if a look of distrust might appear in the gaze he bent upon her . " I would n't dare attempt to inform you properly or adequately to-night , with my uncle in the house , " she said . " But please do n't believe I 've done anything wrong -- and do n't desert me now . " She had hardly intended to appeal to him so helplessly , but somehow she had been so glad to lean upon his strength , since his meeting with her relatives , that the impulse was not to be resisted . Moreover she felt , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to know him as well within the past half-hour as she had ever known anyone in all her life . Her trust had gone forth of its own volition , together with her gratitude and admiration , for the way he had taken up her cause . " I left the matter entirely with you this afternoon , " he said . " I only wish to know so much as you yourself deem essential . I feel this man is vindictive , cowardly , and crafty . Are you sure you are safe where he is ? " " Oh , yes , I 'm quite safe , even if it is unpleasant , " she told him , grateful for his evident concern . " If need be , the caretaker would fight a pack of wolves in my defense . " " This will ? " asked Garrison . " When is it going to be settled -- when does it come to probate ? " " I do n't quite know . " " When is your real husband coming ? " he inquired , more for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the afternoon , that she had a husband . She colored now as she tried to meet his gaze . " Did I tell you there was such a person ? " " No , " said Garrison , " you did not . I thought --  --  Perhaps that 's one of the many things I am not obliged to know . " " Perhaps . " She hesitated a moment , adding : " If you 'd rather not go on --  --  " She lowered her eyes . He felt a thrill that he could not analyze , it lay so close to jealousy and hope . And whatever it was , he knew it was out of the bargain , and not in the least his right . " It was n't for myself I asked , " he hastened to add . " I 'll act my part till you dismiss me . I only thought if another man were to come upon the scene --  --  " The far-off sound of a ringing house-bell came indistinctly to his ears . Dorothy looked up in his face with a startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest within him . " The bell , " she said . " I heard it ! Who could be coming here to-night ? " She slipped to the door , drew it open an inch , and listened there attentively . Garrison was listening also . The door to the outside steps , in the hall below , was opened , then presently closed with a slam . The caretaker had admitted a caller . " Good ! I 'd like to see him ! " said the voice of a man . " Upstairs ? " Dorothy turned to Garrison with her face as white as chalk . " Oh , if you had only gone ! " she said . " What 's the trouble ? " he asked . " Who 's come ? " " Perhaps you can slip in my room ! " she whispered . " Please hurry ! " She hastened across the apartment to a door , with Garrison following . The door was locked . She remembered she had locked it herself , from the farther side , since the advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead him round , by the hall . But the door swung open abruptly , and a tall , handsome young man was at the threshold . His hat was on . He was dressed , despite the season , in an overcoat of extraordinary length , buttoned close round his neck . It concealed him from his chin to his heels . " Why , hello , Dot ! " he said familiarly , advancing within the room . " You and your Jerold were n't trying to run away , I hope . " Dorothy struggled against her confusion and alarm . " Why , no , " she faltered . " Cousin Ted , you 've never met Mr. Fairfax . Jerold , this is my cousin , Mr. Theodore Robinson . " " How do you do ? " said Garrison , nodding somewhat distantly , since none of the Robinson group had particularly appealed to his tastes . " How are you ? " responded Dorothy 's cousin , with no attempt to conceal an unfriendly demeanor . Crossing to Dorothy with deliberate intent to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arms . " How 's everything with you , little sweetheart ? " he added in his way of easy intimacy . " What 's the matter with my customary kiss ? " Dorothy , with every sign of fear or detestation upon her , seemed wholly unable to move . He put his arm roughly about her and kissed her twice . Garrison , watching with feelings ill suppressed , beheld her shrink from the contact . She appeared to push her cousin off with small effort to disguise her loathing , and fled to Garrison as if certain of protection . " What are you scared of ? " said young Robinson , moving forward to catch her again , and laughing in an irritating way . " You used not to --  --  " Garrison blocked him promptly , subconsciously wondering where he had heard that laugh before . " Perhaps that day has passed , " he said quietly . The visitor , still with his hat on , looked Garrison over with anger . " Jealousy already , hey ? " he said . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're off , understand ? " Garrison stifled an impulse to slap the fellow 's face . " What are your rights as a cousin , if I may ask ? " he said . " Wait and see , " replied Robinson . " Dot was mighty fond of me once -- hey , Dot ? " Garrison felt certain of his ground in suppressing the fellow . " Whatever the situation may have been in the past , " he said , " it is very much altered at present . " " Is that so ? " demanded Theodore . " Perhaps you 'll find the game is n't quite finished yet . " Dorothy , still white and overwrought , attempted to mediate between the two . " I ca n't let you men start off like this , " she said . " I -- I 'm fond of you both . I wish you would try to be friendly . " " I 'm willing , " said her cousin , with a sudden change of front that in no wise deceived Garrison , and he held forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy wished him to greet the fellow civilly , and not incur his ill-feeling . Garrison was sure . He took the proffered hand , as cold as a fish , and dropped it again immediately . Theodore laughed , and stepped gracefully away , his long coat swinging outward with his motion . Garrison caught a gleam of red , where the coat was parted at the bottom -- and he knew where he had heard that laugh before . The man before him was no other than the one he had seen next door , dressed in red fleshings as Satan . It was not to be understood in a moment , and Theodore 's parents had returned once more to the door . Indeed , the old man had beheld the momentary hand-clasp of the men , and he was nettled . " Theodore ! " he cried ; " you 're not making friends with a man who 's sneaked off and married Dorothy , I hope ! I would n't have believed it ! " " Why not ? " said his son . " What 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you got on an overcoat such a night as this ? " " Because I like it , " said Theodore . Garrison knew better . He wondered what the whole game signified . The old man was glaring at him sharply . " I should think for a man who has to leave at nine your time is getting short , " he said . " Perhaps your story was invented . " Garrison took out his watch . The fiction would have to be played to the end . The hour lacked twenty minutes of nine . He must presently depart , yet he felt that Dorothy might need protection . Having made up his mind that a marriage had doubtless been planned between Dorothy and Theodore -- on the man 's part for the purpose of acquiring valuable property , probably veiled to Dorothy -- he felt she might not be safe if abandoned to their power . He had found himself plunged into complications on which it had not been possible to count , but notwithstanding which he meant to remain by Dorothy with the utmost resolution . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilously close to the tenderest of passions , but tried to convince himself his present desire was merely to see this business to the end . It certainly piqued him to find himself obliged to leave with so much of the evening 's proceedings veiled in mystery . He would have been glad to know more of what it meant to have this cousin , Theodore , masquerading as the devil in one house , and covering all the signs here at home . He was absolutely helpless in the situation . He knew that Dorothy wished him to depart . She could not , of course , do otherwise . " Thank you , " he said to the elder Robinson . " I must leave in fifteen minutes . " Dorothy looked at him strangely . She could not permit him to stay , yet she felt the need of every possible safeguard , now that her cousin had appeared . The strange trust and confidence she felt in Garrison had given her new hope and strength . To know he must go in the next few minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sense of desolation . Yet there was nothing she could say or do to prevent his immediate retreat . Young Robinson , made aware that Garrison would soon be departing , appeared to be slightly excited . " I 'll go down and ' phone for my suit-case , " he said , and he left the room at once . Aunt Jill and old Robinson sat down . It was quite impossible for Garrison to ask them again to retire . Dorothy crossed the room and seated herself before the piano . Garrison followed , and stood there at her side . She had no spirit for music , and no inclination to play , nevertheless she permitted her hands to wander up and down the keys , calling forth a sweetly sad bit of Hungarian song that took a potent hold on Garrison 's emotions . " Is there anything I can do but go ? " he murmured , his voice well masked by the melody . " Do you think you may need me very soon ? " " I do not know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . " I 'm sorry it 's been so disagreeable . Do you really have to go away from town ? " " Yes . " " To-day you said you had no employment . " " It was true . Employment came within ten minutes of your leaving . I took it . For you know you hardly expected to require my services so soon . " She played a trifle louder , and asked him : " Where are you going ? " " To Branchville and Hickwood . " The playing suddenly ceased . She looked up at him swiftly . In nervous haste she resumed her music . " Not on detective work ? You mentioned insurance . " " It concerns insurance . " She was silent for a moment . " When do you return ? " " I hardly know , " he answered . " And I suppose I 've got to start at once in order to maintain our little fiction . " " Do n't forget to write , " she said , blushing , as she had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rose from her seat . Garrison pulled out his watch and remarked , for the Robinsons to hear : " Well , I 've got to be off . " " Wait a minute , please , " said Dorothy , as if possessed by a sudden impulse , and she ran from the room like a child . With nothing particularly pleasant to say to the Robinsons , Garrison approached a center-table and turned the pages of a book . Dorothy was back in a moment . " I 'll go down to the door , " she said . Garrison said good-night to the Robinsons , who answered curtly . He closed the door upon them as he left the room . Dorothy had hastened to the stairs before him , and continued down to the hall . Her face was intensely white again as she turned about , drawing from her dress a neat , flat parcel , wrapped in paper . " I told you to-day that I trust you absolutely , " she said , in a nervous undertone . " I wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finding it heavy in his hand . " What is it ? " he said . " Do n't try to talk -- they 'll listen , " she cautioned . " Just hurry and go . " " If you need me , write or wire , " he said . " Good-night ! " She retreated a little way from him , as if she felt he might exact a husband 's right of farewell , which the absence of witnesses made quite unessential . " Good-night , " she answered , adding wistfully ; " I am very grateful , believe me . " She gave him her hand , and his own hand trembled as he took it . A moment later he was out upon the street , a wild , sweet pleasure in his veins . Across the way a man 's dark figure detached itself from the darkness of a doorstep and followed where Garrison went . Shadowed to his very door , Garrison came to his humble place of abode with his mind in a region of dreams . It was not until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket , that he thought again of Dorothy 's parcel surrendered to his keeping . He took it out . He felt he had a right to know its contents . It had not been sealed . He removed the paper , disclosing a narrow , shallow box , daintily covered with leather . It was merely snapped shut with a catch . He opened it , and an exclamation of astonishment escaped his lips . It contained two necklaces -- one of diamonds and one of pearls , the gems of both marvelously fine . CHAPTER V THE " SHADOW " Nothing more disquieting than this possession of the necklaces could possibly have happened to Garrison . He was filled with vague suspicions and alarms . The thing was wholly baffling . What it signified he could not conjecture . His mind went at once to that momentary scene at the house he had entered by mistake , and in which he had been confronted by the masked young woman , with the jewels on her throat , she who had patted his face and familiarly called him by name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the same . The fact that Dorothy 's cousin , in the garb of Satan , had undoubtedly participated in the masking party , aroused disturbing possibilities in Garrison 's mind . What was the web in which he was entangled ? To have Theodore come to the house in his long , concealing coat , straight from the maskers next door ; to have him disappear , and then to have Dorothy bring forth these gems with such wholly unimaginable trust in his honesty , brought him face to face with a brand-new mystery from which he almost shrank . Reflections on thefts , wherein women were accomplices , could not be driven from his brain . Here was Dorothy suddenly requiring a pseudo-husband -- for what ? Here was a party next door to the house -- a party on which he had stumbled accidentally -- where a richly dressed young woman chanced to greet him , with her jewels on her neck . Here was , apparently , a family disturbance , engendered by his marriage with old Robinson 's niece . And now -- here were the necklaces , worth , at the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He could not escape the thought of a " fence , " in which he himself had possibly been impressed as a tool , by the cleverest intrigue . The entire attitude of the Robinsons might , he realized , have been but a part of the game . He had witnessed Dorothy 's acting . It gave him a vivid sense of her powers , some others of which might well lie concealed behind her appearance of innocence . And yet , when he thought of the beautiful girl who had begged him not to desert her , he could not think her guilty of the things which this singular outcome might suggest . He was sure she could clear up the mystery , and set herself straight in his eyes . Not a little disturbed as to what he should do with these precious baubles , sparkling and glinting in his hand , he knitted his brow in perplexity . He was due to leave New York at once , on orders from Wicks . No safe deposit vault was available at such an hour . He dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no alternative , he must carry them along in his pocket . Inasmuch as the problem could not possibly be solved at once , and in view of the fact that his mind , or his heart , refused to credit Dorothy with guilt , there was nothing to do but dismiss the subject , as far as possible , and make ready to depart . He opened a drawer to procure the few things requisite for his trip . On top of a number of linen garments lay a photograph -- the picture of a sweetly pretty young woman . He took it up , gazed at it calmly , and presently shook his head . He turned it over . On the back was written : " With the love of my heart -- Ailsa . " He had kissed this picture a thousand times , in rapture . It had once represented his total of earthly happiness , and then -- when the notice of her marriage had come so baldly , through the mail -- it had symbolized his depths of despair . Through all his hurt he had clung , not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ailsa loved him still ; that the words she had spoken and the things she had done , in the days of their courtship , had not been mere idle falsehoods . To-night , for the first time since his dream had been shattered , the photograph left him cold and unfeeling . Something had happened , he hardly knew what -- something he hardly dared confess to himself , with Dorothy only in his vision . The lifeless picture 's day was gone at last . He tossed it back in the drawer with a gesture of finality , drew forth a number of collars and ties , then went to a closet , opened the door and studied his two suit-cases thoughtfully . He knew not which to take . One was an ordinary , russet-leather case ; the other was a thin-steel box , veneered with leather , but of special construction , on a plan which Garrison himself had invented . Indeed , the thing was a trap , ingeniously contrived when the Biddle robbery had baffled far older men than himself , and had then been solved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take this case along . It had brought him luck on the former occasion , and the present was , perhaps , a criminal case . He lifted it out , blew off some dust , and laid it , open , on the bed . To all appearances the thing was innocent enough . On the under side of the cover was a folding flap , fastened with a string and a button . Unremembered by Garrison , Ailsa 's last letter still reposed in the pocket , its romance laid forever in the lavender of rapidly fading memories . Not only was the case provided with a thin false bottom , concealing its mechanism , but between the cover and the body proper , on either side , were wing-like pieces of leather , to judge from their looks , that seemed to possess no function more important than the ordinary canvas strips not infrequently employed on a trunk to restrain the cover from falling far backward when opened . But encased in these wings were connections to powerful springs that , upon being set and suddenly released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun and catch , as in the jaws of a trap , any meddling hands that might have been placed inside the case by a thief , at the same time ringing a bell . To set it was a matter of the utmost simplicity , while to spring it one had barely to go at the contents of the case and touch the trigger lightly . The springs were left unset , as Garrison tossed in the trifles he should need . Then he changed his clothes , turned off the gas , and was presently out once more in the open of the street , walking to the Grand Central Station , near at hand . The man who had followed all the way from Dorothy 's residence not only was waiting , but remained on Garrison 's trail . At a quarter of ten Garrison ensconced himself in a train for Branchville . His " shadow " was there in the car . The run required fifty minutes . Hickwood , a very small village , was passed by the cars without a stop . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late when Garrison arrived . He and his " shadow " alighted from the train and repaired to a small , one-story hotel near the railway depot , the only place the town afforded . They were presently assigned to adjoining rooms . Garrison opened his suit-case on the bureau , removed one or two articles , and left the receptacle open , with the cover propped against the mirror . Despite the lateness of the hour he then went out , to roam about the village . His fellow traveler watched only to see him out of the house , and then returned in haste . In the town there was little to be seen . The houses extended far back from the railroad , on considerably elevated hills . There was one main thoroughfare only , and this was deserted . The dwellings were dark . No one seemed stirring in the place , though midnight had not yet struck . Garrison was out for half an hour . When he returned his suit-case was closed . He thought nothing of a matter so trifling till he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been rifled . But nothing was gone , so far as he could see . Then he noticed the folding-pocket , for its fastening cord was undone . How well he remembered placing there the letter from Ailsa , months ago ! A little surprised that he had so utterly forgotten its existence , he slipped his hand inside the place -- and found it empty ! Even then he entertained no suspicions , for a moment . The letter , like the photograph , was no longer a valued possession . Yet he wondered where it could have gone . Vaguely uncertain , after all , as to whether he had left it here or not , his eye was suddenly caught by the slightest movement in the world , reflected in the mirror of the bureau . The movement was up at the transom , above a door that led to the next adjoining room . Instantly turning away , to allay any possible suspicion that he might be aware of the fact that someone was spying upon him , Garrison moved the suit-case to a chair , drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important -- although merely a railroad folder -- placed it carefully , as if to hide it , under various articles of apparel , set the springs of the vicious steel-trap , and , leaving the suitcase open as before , took a turn around the room . All this business was merely for the benefit of the man whom he knew to be watching from over the door . Starting as if to undress , he paused , appeared to remember something left neglected , and hastened from his room , purposely leaving the door more than half-way ajar . Down the hall he strode , to the office , where he looked on the register and discovered the name of his neighbor -- John Brown -- an obvious alias . He had hardly been thus engaged for two minutes when the faint , far-off sound of a ringing bell came distinctly to his ears . " My alarm-clock 's gone off , " he said to the man at the desk , and he fled up the hall like a sprinter . A clatter of sounds , as of someone struggling , had come before he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit-case , over at the window , jerking against the sash and sill as if possessed of evil spirits . No thief was visible . The fellow , with the trap upon his fingers , had already leaped to the ground . Within a yard of his captured burglar Garrison beheld the suit-case drop , and his man had made good his escape . He thrust his head outside the window , but the darkness was in favor of the thief , who was not to be seen . Chagrined to think Mr. " Brown " had contrived to get loose , Garrison took up the case , carried it back to the bureau , and opened it up , by skillfully releasing the springs . Three small patches of finger-skin were left in the bite of its jaws -- cards of the visitor left as announcements of his visit . The room next door was not again occupied that night . The hotel saw no more of Mr. Brown . CHAPTER VI THE CORONER Not in the least reassured , but considerably aroused in all his instincts by these further developments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a futile watch for his neighbor , once more plunged into a study of the case in which he found himself involved . Vaguely he remembered to have noticed that the man who had come here to Branchville with him on the train carried no baggage . He had no doubt the man had been close upon his trail for some considerable time ; but why , and what he wanted , could not be so readily determined . Certain the man had extracted Ailsa 's letter from the pocket of the case , yet half convinced that the thief had been searching for the necklaces intrusted to his care , Garrison was puzzled . There seemed to be no possible connection between the two . He could not understand what a thief who would take the one would require of the other . Aside from his money , the gems were the only articles he possessed of the slightest value or significance . Half persuaded that the diamonds and pearls afforded the booty for which his visitor had searched , he was once more in doubt as to whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find it still among his things , at his room in Forty-fourth Street . He was fully convinced the man would return no more . Nevertheless , when he turned in at last , the jewels were under the pillow . Branchville , in the morning , proved an attractive place of residence . Half its male population went to New York as commuters . Its housewives then bustled about their gardens or their chicken-coops , at the rear of the houses , and a dozen old men gathered slowly at the post-office store to resume the task of doing nothing . Garrison experienced no difficulty in searching out Mrs. Webber , the woman who had supplied certain details concerning the finding of the body of the man , John Hardy , whose death had occurred here the previous week . The house , at the porch of which the body had been discovered , was empty . Mrs. Webber went with Garrison to the place , showed him exactly where the body had reclined , and left him alone at the scene . He looked the details over carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected a foot . If , as Garrison fancied , the stricken man might have come here in weakness , to lean against the post , and had then gone down , perhaps leaving heel-marks in the earth , all signs of any such action had been obliterated , despite the fact that no rains had fallen since the date of the man 's demise . Garrison scrutinized the ground closely . A piece of broken crockery , a cork , the top of a can , an old cigar , and some bits of glass and wire lay beside the baseboard -- the usual signs of neglect . The one man-made article in all the litter that attracted Garrison 's attention was the old cigar . He took it up for a more minute examination . It had never been lighted . It was broken , as if someone had stepped upon the larger end ; but the label , a bright red band of paper , was still upon it . The wrapper had somewhat spread ; but the pointed end had been bitten off , half an inch up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown down by anyone save Hardy , Garrison nevertheless placed it in an envelope and tucked it away in his pocket . A visit to the local coroner presenting itself as the next most natural step , he proceeded at once to his office . As a dealer in real estate , a notary public , and an official in several directions , the coroner was a busy man . He said so himself . Garrison introduced himself candidly as a New York detective , duly licensed , at present representing a State insurance company , and stated the nature of his business . " All right , " said the coroner , inclined at once to be friendly . " My name is Pike . What 'd you want to know ? Sit down and take it easy . " " As much as I can learn about the case . " Garrison took a proffered chair . " For instance , what did you find on the body ? " " Nothing -- of any importance -- a bunch of keys , a fountain-pen , and -- and just some useless trash -- I believe four dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , some scraps of paper and a picture postal-card . " " Any cigars ? " asked Garrison . " Yep -- three , with labels on ' em -- all but one , I mean . " He had taken one label for his son 's collection . " What did you do with the stuff ? " " Locked it up , waiting orders from the court , " replied Mr. Pike . " You bet , I know my business . " Garrison was pursuing a point . He inquired : " Do you smoke ? " " No , I do n't ; and if I did , I would n't touch one of them , " said the coroner . " And do n't you forget it . " " Did anyone help you to carry off the body -- anyone who might have thrown a cigar away , unlighted ? " " No , siree ! When Billy Ford and Tom Harris git a cigar it never gits away , " said Mr. Pike . " Did you find out where the dead man came from and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping down to Hickwood with Mrs. Wilson , " answered Pike . " His friend there was Charlie Scott , who 's making a flying-machine that 's enough to make anybody luny . I 've told him he ca n't borrow no money from me on no such contraption , and so has Billy Dodd . " Garrison mentally noted down the fact that Scott was in need of money . " What can you tell me of the man 's appearance ? " he added , after a moment of silence . " Did his face present any signs of agony ? " " Nope . Just looked dead , " said the coroner . " Were there any signs upon him of any nature ? " " Grass stain on his knee -- that 's about all . " " About all ? " Garrison echoed . " Was there anything else -- any scratches or bruises on his hands ? " " No -- nary a scratch . He had real fine hands , " said the coroner . " But they did have a little dirt on ' em -- right on three of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right -- the kind of dirt you ca n't rub off . " " Did it look as if he 'd tried to rub it off ? " " Looked as if he 'd washed it a little and it would n't come . " " Just common black dirt ? " " Yes , kind of grimy -- the kind that gits in and stays . " Garrison reflected that a sign of this nature might and might not prove important . Everything depended on further developments . One deduction was presented to his mind -- the man had doubtless observed that his hands were soiled and had washed them in the dark , since anyone with the " fine " hands described by the coroner would be almost certain to keep them immaculate ; but might , in the absence of a light , wash them half clean only . He was not disposed to attach a very great importance to the matter , however , and only paused for a moment to recall a number of the various " dirts " that resist an effort to remove them -- printers ' ink , acid stains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of questions abruptly . " What did you discover about the dead man 's relatives ? The nephew who came to claim the body ? " " Never saw him , " said the coroner . " I could n't hang around the corpse all day . I 'm the busiest man in Branchville -- and I had to go down to New York the day he come . " " Did you take possession of any property that deceased might have had at his room in Hickwood ? " " Sure , " said Pike . " Half a dozen collars , and some socks , a few old letters , and a box almost full of cigars . " " If these things are here in your office , " said Garrison , rising , " I should like to look them over . " " You bet , I can put my hand on anything in my business in a minute , " boasted Mr. Pike . He rose and crossed the room to a desk with a large , deep drawer , which he opened with a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The three cigars which his pocket had disgorged were lying near a little pile of money . Garrison noted at once that the labels on two were counterparts of the one on the broken cigar now reposing in his pocket . He opened the box beneath his hand . The cigars inside were all precisely like the others . Five only had ever been removed , of which four were accounted for already . The other had doubtless been smoked . On the even row of dark-brown weeds lay a card , on which , written in pencil , were the words : A BIRTHDAY GREETING -- WITH LOVE . Garrison let fall the lid and glanced with fading interest at the few insignificant papers and other trifles which the drawer contained . He had practically made up his mind that John Hardy had died , as the coroner had found , of heart disease , or apoplexy , even in the act of lighting up to smoke . He questioned the man further , made up his mind to visit Charles Scott and Mrs. Wilson , in Hickwood , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DISCOVERY Garrison walked along the road to Hickwood out of sheer love of being in the open , and also the better to think . Unfortunately for the case in hand , however , his thoughts wandered truantly back to New York and the mystery about the girl masquerading to the world as his wife . His meditations were decidedly mixed . He thought of Dorothy always with a thrill of strong emotions , despite the half-formed suspicions which had crossed his mind at least a dozen times . Her jewels were still in his pocket -- a burden she had apparently found too heavy to carry . How he wished he might accept her confidence in him freely , unreservedly -- with the thrill it could bring to his heart ! The distance to Hickwood seemed to slip away beneath his feet . He arrived in the hamlet far too soon , for the day had charmed bright dreams into being , and business seemed wholly out of place . The railroad station , a store , an apothecary 's shop , and a cobbler 's little den seemed to comprise the entire commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his man -- the inventor . Scott , whom he found at a workshop , back of his home , was a thin , stooped figure , gray as a wolf , wrinkled as a prune , and stained about the mouth by tobacco . His eyes , beneath their overhanging brows of gray , were singularly sharp and brilliant . Garrison made up his mind that the blaze in their depths was none other than the light of fanaticism . " How do you do , Mr. Scott ? " said the detective , who had determined to pose as an upper-air enthusiast . " I was stopping in Branchville for a day or two , and heard of your fame as a fellow inventor . I 've been interested in aeroplanes and dirigible balloons so long that I thought I 'd give myself the pleasure of a call . " " Um ! " said Scott , closing the door of his shop behind him , as if to guard a precious secret . " What did you say is your name ? " Garrison informed him duly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , but we all have our hopes . " " You 'll never be able to steer a balloon , " said Scott , with a touch of asperity . " I can tell you that . " " I begin to believe you 're right , " assented Garrison artfully . " It 's a mighty discouraging and expensive business , any way you try it . " " I 'll do the trick ! I 've got it all worked out , " said Scott , betrayed into ardor and assurance by a nearness of the triumph that he felt to be approaching . " I 'll have plenty of money to complete it **25;2317;TOOLONG it 's a long time coming , even now . " " That 's the trouble with most of us , " Garrison observed , to draw his man . " The lack of money . " " Why ca n't they pay it , now the man is dead ? " demanded Scott , as if he felt that everyone knew his affairs by heart and could understand his meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad enough when a man stays healthy so long , and looks as if he 'd last for twenty years . That 's bad enough without me having to wait and wait and wait , now that he 's dead and in the ground . " It was clear to Garrison the man 's singleness of purpose had left his mind impaired . He began to see how a creature so bent on some wondrous solution of the flying-machine enigma could even become so obsessed in his mind that to murder for money , insurance benefits , or anything else , would seem a fair means to an end . " Some friend of yours has recently died ? " he asked . " You 've been left some needed funds for your labors ? " " Funny kind of friendship when a man goes on living so long , " said the alert fanatic . " And I do n't get the money ; that 's what 's delaying me now . " " You 're far more fortunate than some of us , " said Garrison . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , he was here two days , " answered Scott . " I saw him but little . He died in the night , up to the village . " His sharp eyes swung on Garrison peculiarly the moment his speech was concluded . He demanded sharply ; " What 's all this business to you ? " " Nothing -- only that it shows the world 's great inventors are not always neglected , after all , " answered Garrison . " Some of us never enjoy such good fortune . " " The world do n't know how great I am , " declared the inventor , instantly off , on the hint supplied by his visitor . " But just the minute that insurance company gives me the money , I 'll be ready to startle the skies ! I 'll blot out the stars for ' em ! I 'll show New York ! I know what I 'm doing ! And nothing on earth is going to stop me ! All these fool balloonists , with their big silk floating cigars ! Deadly cigars is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him fixedly , fascinated by a new idea which had crept upon his mind with startling abruptness . His one idea was to get away for a vital two minutes by himself . " Well , perhaps I 'll try to get around again , " he said . " I can see you 're very busy , and I must n't keep you longer from your work . Good luck and good-day . " " The only principle , " the old man answered , his gaze directed to the sky . Garrison looked up , beholding a bird , far off in the azure vault , soaring in the majesty of flight . Then he hastened again to the quiet little street , and down by a fence at a vacant lot , where he paused and looked about . He was quite alone . Drawing from his pocket the envelope containing the old cigar that Hardy had undoubtedly let fall as he died at the porch of the " haunted " house , he turned up the raggedly bitten end . " By George ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a small hollow space which was partially closed by the filler which had once been bitten together , was a powdery stuff that seemed comprised of small , hard particles , as of crystals , roughly broken up . His breath came fast . His heart was pumping rapidly . He raised the cigar to his nostrils and smelled , but could only detect the pungent odor of tobacco . That the powder was a poison he had not the slightest doubt . Aware that one poison only , thus administered , would have the potency to slay an adult human being practically on the instant , he realized at once that here , at the little , unimportant drug-shop of the place , the simple test for such a stuff could be made in a matter of two minutes . Eager and feverish to inform himself without delay , he took out his knife and carefully removed all the powder from its place and wrapped it most cautiously about in the paper of the envelope in hand . The cigar he returned to his pocket . Five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliging and clever young chemist at the place was holding up a test-tube made of glass , with perhaps two thimblefuls of acidulated solution which had first been formed by dissolving the powder under inspection . " If this is what you suppose , " he said , " a slight admixture of this iron will turn it Prussian blue . " He poured in the iron , which was likewise in solution , and instantly the azure tint was created in all its deadly beauty . Garrison was watching excitedly . " No mistake about it , " said the chemist triumphantly . " Where did you find this poison ? " " Why -- in a scrap of meat , " said Garrison , inventing an answer with ready ingenuity ; " enough to have killed my dog in half a shake ! " CHAPTER VIII WHERE CLEWS MAY POINT Startled , thus to discover that , after all , a crime of the most insidious and diabolical nature had been committed , Garrison wandered along the street , after quitting the drug-store , with his brain aglow with excitement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed but a simple affair of a man 's very natural demise had suddenly assumed an aspect black as night . He felt the need for light -- all the light procurable in Hickwood . Aware of the misleading possibilities of a theory preconceived , he was not prepared even now to decide that inventor Scott was necessarily guilty . He found himself obliged to admit that the indications pointed to the half-crazed man , to whom a machine had become a god , but nothing as yet had been proved . To return to Scott this morning would , he felt , be indiscreet . The one person now to be seen and interviewed was Mrs. Wilson , at whose home the man Hardy had been lodged . He started at once to the place , his mind reverting by natural process to the box of cigars he had seen an hour before , and from which , without a doubt , this poisoned weed had been taken by Hardy to smoke . He realized that one extremely important point must be determined by the box itself . If among the cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case might involve a set of facts quite different from those which reason would adduce if the one cigar only had been loaded . It was vital also to the matter in hand to ascertain the identity of the person who had presented the smokes as a birthday remembrance to the victim . He arrived at Mrs. Wilson 's home , was met at the door by the lady herself , and was then obliged to wait interminably while she fled to some private boudoir at the rear to make herself presentable for " company . " For the second time , when she at length appeared , Garrison found himself obliged to invent a plausible excuse for his visit and curiosity . " I dropped in to ascertain a few little facts about the late Mr. Hardy , whose death occurred last week in Branchville , " he said . " The insurance company that I represent goes through this trifling formality before paying a claim . " " He certainly was the nicest man , " said Mrs. Wilson . " And just as I was countin ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think he was that kind . " " Did he have many visitors ? " Garrison asked , hastening at once to the items he felt to be important . " I mean , from among the neighbors , or -- anyone else ? " " Well , Charlie Scott come over , that second night and actin ' that queer I did n't know what was the matter . He went off just about nine o'clock , and I went to bed , and then I heard him come back in half an hour , while Mr. Hardy was out , and he went again before Mr. Hardy come in and started off to Branchville to die . " Her method of narrative was puzzling . " You mean , " said Garrison , " that after Mr. Scott had called and gone , Mr. Hardy went out temporarily , and in his absence Mr. Scott returned and remained for a time in his room ? " " I did n't git up to see what he wanted , or how long he stayed , " said Mrs. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm abed . " " And he went before Mr. Hardy 's return ? " " Yes , I stayed awake for that ; for although Charlie Scott may be honest enough , he 's inventin ' some crazy fiddlede-dee , which has been the crown of thorns of that dear woman all these --  --  " " Did they seem to be friends , Mr. Scott and Mr. Hardy ? " Garrison interrupted mildly . " A clever woman , you know , can always tell . " " Ai n't you New York men the quick ones to see ! " said Mrs. Wilson . " Of course they was friends . The day he come Mr. Hardy was over to Charlie 's all the livelong afternoon . " " Did Mr. Hardy get very many letters , or anything , through the mail ? " " Well , of course , I offered to go to the post-office , and bring him everything , " said Mrs. Wilson , " but he went himself . So I do n't know what he got , or who it come from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did he get any packages sent by express ? " " Not that come to my house , for little Jimmie Vane would have brought ' em straight to me . " Garrison went directly to the mark around which he had been playing . " Who delivered his birthday present -- the box of cigars ? " " Oh , that was his niece , the very first evenin ' he was here -- and she the prettiest girl I ever seen . " " His niece ? " echoed Garrison . " Some young lady -- who brought them here herself ? " " Well , I should say so ! My , but she was that lovely ! He took her up to Branchville to the train -- and how I did hate to see her go ! " " Of course , yes , I remember he had a niece , " said Garrison , his mind reverting to the " statement " in his pocket . " But , upon my word , I believe I 've forgotten her name . " " He called her Dot , " said Mrs. Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her real name was Dorothy Booth before she was married , " replied Mrs. Wilson , " but now , of course , it 's changed . " Garrison had suddenly turned ashen . He managed to control himself by making a very great effort . " Perhaps you know her married name ? " he said . " I never forget a thing like that , " said Mrs. Wilson . " Her married name is Mrs. Fairfax . " It seemed to Garrison he was fighting in the toils of some astounding maze , where sickening mists arose to clog his brain . He could scarcely believe his senses . A tidal wave of facts and deductions , centering about the personality of Dorothy Booth-Fairfax , surged upon him relentlessly , bearing down and engulfing the faith which he strove to maintain in her honesty . He had felt from the first there was something deep and dark with mystery behind the girl who had come to his office with her most amazing employment . He had entertained vague doubts upon hearing of wills and money inheritance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled the start she had given , while playing at the piano , upon learning he was leaving for Hickwood . Her reticence and the strangeness of the final affair of the necklaces , in connection with this present development , left him almost in despair . Despite it all , as it overwhelmed him thus abruptly , he felt himself struggling against it . He could not even now accept a belief in her complicity in such a deed while he thought of the beauty of her nature . That potent something she had stirred in his heart was a fierce , fighting champion to defend her . He had not dared confess to himself he was certainly , fatefully falling in love with this girl he scarcely knew , but his heart refused to hear her accused and his mind was engaged in her defence . Above all else , he felt the need for calmness . Perhaps the sky would clear itself , and the sun again gild her beauty . " Mrs. Fairfax , " he repeated to his garrulous informant . " She brought the cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival ? " " And went away on the six-forty-three , " said Mrs. Wilson . " I remember it was six minutes late , and I did think my dinner would be dry as a bone , for she said she could n't stay --  --  " " And that was his birthday , " Garrison interrupted . " Oh , no . His birthday was the day he died . I remember , ' cause he would n't even open the box of cigars till after his dinner that day . " Garrison felt his remaining ray of hope faintly flicker and expire . " You are sure the box was n't opened ? " he insisted . " I guess I am ! He borrowed my screwdriver out of the sewin ' - machine drawer , where I always keep it , to pry up the cover . " Garrison tacked to other items . " Why did she have to go so soon ? " he inquired . " Could n't she have stayed here with you ? " " What , a young thing like her , only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess you do n't know us women when we 're in love . " And she blushed again . " Of course , " answered Garrison , at a loss for a better reply . " Did her uncle seem pleased with her marriage ? " " Why , he sat where you 're now settin ' for one solid hour , tellin ' me how tickled he felt , " imparted the housewife . " He said she 'd git everything he had in the world , now that she was married happy to a decent man , for he 'd fixed it all up in his will . " " Mr. Hardy said his niece would inherit his money ? " " Settin ' right in that chair , and smilin ' fit to kill . " " Did the niece seem very fond of her uncle ? " " Well , at first I thought she acted queer and nervous , " answered Mrs. Wilson , " but I made up my mind that was the natural way for any young bride to feel , especial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping from him , one by one , and putting on their shrouds . " Did Mr. Hardy seem to be pleased with his niece 's selection -- with Mr. Fairfax ? " he inquired . " Or do n't you know ? " " Why , he never even seen the man , " replied Mrs. Wilson . " It seems Mr. Fairfax was mixin ' up business with his honeymoon , and him and his bride was goin ' off again , or was on their way , and she had a chance to run up and see her uncle for an hour , and none of us so much as got a look at Mr. Fairfax . " The mystery darkened rather than otherwise . There was nothing yet to establish whether or not a real Mr. Fairfax existed . It appeared to Garrison that Dorothy had purposely arranged the scheme of her alleged marriage and honeymoon in such a way that her uncle should not meet her husband . He tried another query : " Did Mr. Hardy say that he had never seen Mr. Fairfax ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but expected to meet him in a month . " Garrison thought of the nephew who had come to claim the body . His name had been given as Durgin . At the most , he could be no more than Dorothy 's cousin , and not the one he had recently met at her house . " I do n't suppose you saw Mr. Durgin , the nephew of Mr. Hardy ? " he inquired . " The man who claimed the body ? " " No , sir . I heard about Mr. Durgin , but I did n't see him . " Garrison once more changed the topic . " Which was the room that Mr. Hardy occupied ? Perhaps you 'll let me see it . " " It ai n't been swept or dusted recent , " Mrs. Wilson informed him , rising to lead him from the room , " but you 're welcome to see it , if you do n't mind how it looks . " The apartment was a good-sized room , at the rear of the house . It was situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear . Against the front partition an old-fashioned fireplace had been closed with a decorated cover . The neat bed , the hair-cloth chairs , and a table that stood on three of its four legs only , supplied the furnishings . The coroner had taken every scrap he could find of the few things possessed by Mr. Hardy . " Nice , cheerful room , " commented Garrison . " Did he keep the windows closed and locked ? " " Oh , no ! He was a wonderful hand to want the air , " said the landlady . " And he loved the view . " The view of the shed and hen-coops at the rear was duly exhibited . Garrison did his best to formulate a theory to exonerate Dorothy from knowledge of the crime ; but his mind had received a blow at these new disclosures , and nothing seemed to aid him in the least . He could only feel that some dark deed lay either at the door of the girl who had paid him to masquerade as her husband , or the half-crazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dorothy , he felt , than they did to Scott . " You have been very helpful , I am sure , " he said to Mrs. Wilson . He bade her good-by and left the house , feeling thoroughly depressed in all his being . CHAPTER IX A SUMMONS Once in the open air again , with the sunshine streaming upon him , Garrison felt a rebound in his thoughts . He started slowly up the road to Branchville , thinking of the murder as he went . The major requisite , he was thoroughly aware , was motive . Men were never slain , except by lunatics , without a deeply grounded reason . It disturbed him greatly to realize that Dorothy might have possessed such a motive in the danger of losing an inheritance , depending upon her immediate marriage . He could not dismiss the thought that she had suddenly found herself in need of a husband , probably to satisfy conditions in her uncle 's will ; that she had paid Mr. Hardy a visit as a bride , but without her husband , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his professional services as such husband , presumably for a short time only . She was cheating the Robinsons now through him . Of this much there could be no denial . She was stubbornly withholding important information from himself as the masquerading husband . She was , therefore , capable of craft and scheming . The jewel mystery was equally suspicious and unexplainable . And yet , when his memory flew to the hour in which he had met her for the very first time , his faith in her goodness and honesty swept upon him with a force that banished all doubt from his being . Every word she had uttered , every look from her eyes , had borne her sincerity in upon him indelibly . This was his argument , brought to bear upon himself . He did not confess the element of love had entered the matter in the least . And now , as he walked and began to try to show himself that she could not have done this awful crime , the uppermost thought that tortured his mind was a fear that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the box of cigars , through the medium of which John Hardy 's death had been accomplished . What a diabolically clever device it had been ! What scheme could be more complete to place the deadly poison on the tongue of the helpless victim ! The cigar is bitten -- the stuff is in the mouth , and before its taste can manifest itself above the strong flavor of tobacco , the deadly work is done ! And who would think , in ordinary circumstances , of looking in a cigar for such a poison , and how could such a crime be traced ? The very diabolism of the device acquitted Dorothy , according to Garrison 's judgment . He doubted if any clever woman , perhaps excepting the famous and infamous Lucrezia Borgia , could have fashioned a plan so utterly fiendish and cunning . He began to reflect what the thing involved . In the first place , many smokers cut the end from every cigar , preliminary to lighting up to smoke . The person who had loaded this cigar must have known it was John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . He hated this thought , for Dorothy would certainly be one to know of this habit in her uncle . On the other hand , however , the task of placing the poison was one requiring nicety , for clumsy work would of course betray itself at the cigar-end thus prepared . To tamper with a well-made cigar like this required that one should deftly remove or unroll the wrapper , hollow out a cavity , stuff in the poison , and then rewrap the whole with almost the skill and art of a well-trained maker of cigars . To Garrison 's way of thinking , this rendered the task impossible for such a girl as Dorothy . He had felt from the first that any man of the inventive , mechanical attributes doubtless possessed by Scott could be guilty of working out this scheme . Scott , too , possessed a motive . He wanted money . The victim was insured in his favor for a snug little fortune . And Scott had returned to Hardy 's room , according to Mrs. Wilson , while Hardy was away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two cigars , and prepared them for Hardy to smoke . He , too , would have known of Hardy 's habit of biting the end from his weed . There was still the third possibility that even before Dorothy 's visit to her uncle the cigars could have been prepared . Anyone supplied with the knowledge that she had purchased the present , with intention to take it to her uncle , might readily have conceived and executed the plan and be doubly hidden from detection , since suspicion would fall upon Dorothy . Aware of the great importance of once more examining the dead man 's effects at the coroner 's office , Garrison hastened his pace . It still lacked nearly an hour of noon when he re-entered Branchville . The office he sought was a long block away from his hotel ; nevertheless , before he reached the door a hotel bell-boy discerned him , waved his arm , then abruptly disappeared inside the hostelry . The coroner was emerging from his place of business up the street . Garrison accosted him . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've returned , you see . I 've nearly concluded my work on the Hardy case ; but I 'd like , as a matter of form , to look again through the few trifling articles in your custody . " " Why , certainly , " said Mr. Pike . " Come right in . I 've got to be away for fifteen minutes , but I guess I can trust you in the shop . " He grinned good-naturedly , opened the drawer , and hurriedly departed . Garrison drew up a chair before the desk . At the door the hotel-boy appeared abruptly . " Telegram for you , Mr. Garrison , " he said . " Been at the office about an hour , but nobody knew where you was . " Garrison took it and tore it open . It read : " Return as soon as possible . Important . " DOROTHY . " " Any answer ? " inquired the boy . " No , " said Garrison . " What 's the next train for New York ? " " Eleven-forty-five , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right . Have my suit-case down at the office . " He returned to his work . Ignoring the few piled-up papers in the drawer , he took up the three cigars beside the box , the ones which had come from Hardy 's pocket , and scrutinized them with the most minute attention . So far as he could possibly detect , not one had been altered or repasted on the end . He did not dare to cut them up , greatly as he longed to examine them thoroughly . He opened the box from which they had come . For a moment his eye was attracted and held by the birthday greeting-card which Dorothy had written . The presence of the card showed a somewhat important fact -- the box had been opened once before John Hardy forced up the lid , in order that the card might be deposited within . His gaze went traveling from one even , nicely finished cigar-end to the next , in his hope to discover signs of meddling . It was not until he came to the end cigar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , was a change . He took the cigar out carefully and held it up . There could be no doubt it had been " mended " on the end . The wrapper was not only slightly discolored , but it bulged a trifle ; it was not so faultlessly turned as all the others , and the end was corkscrewed the merest trifle , whereas , none of the others had been twisted to bring them to a point . Garrison needed that cigar . He was certain not another one in all the box was suspicious . The perpetrator of the poisoning had evidently known that Hardy 's habit was to take his cigars from the end of the row and not the center . No chance for mistake had been permitted . The two end cigars had been loaded , and no more . How to purloin this cigar without having it missed by Mr. Pike was a worry for a moment . Garrison managed it simply . He took out a dozen cigars in the layer on top and one from the layer next the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill in the empty space , he replaced the others in perfect order in the topmost row , and thus had one cigar left over to substitute for the one he had taken from the end . He plumped the suspicious-looking weed into his pocket and closed the box . Eagerly glancing at the letters found among the dead man 's possessions , he found a note from Dorothy . It had come from a town in Massachusetts . The date was over six weeks old . It was addressed , " Dear Uncle John , " and , in a girlish way , informed him she had recently been married to a " splendid , brilliant young man , named Fairfax , " whom she trusted her uncle would admire . They were off on their honeymoon , it added , but she hoped they would not be long away , for they both looked forward with pleasure to seeing him soon . It might have been part of her trickery ; he could not tell . The envelope was missing . Where Hardy had been at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pike had mentioned was also there . It , too , apparently , had come from Dorothy , and had been sent direct to Hickwood . Once more returning to the box of cigars , Garrison took it up and turned it around in his hand . On the back , to his great delight , he discovered a rubber-stamp legend , which was nothing more or less than a cheap advertisement of the dealer who had sold the cigars . He was one Isaac Blum , of an uptown address on Amsterdam Avenue , New York , dealer in stationery , novelties , and smokers ' articles . Garrison jotted down the name and address , together with the brand of the cigars , and was just about to rise and close the drawer when the coroner returned . " I shall have to go down to New York this morning , " said Garrison . " I owe you many thanks . " " Oh , that 's all right , " Mr. Pike responded . " If you 're goin ' to try to catch fifteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the station just above . " Garrison hastened away . He was presently whirling back to Dorothy . His " shadow , " with his bruised hand gloved , was just behind him in the car . CHAPTER X A COMPLICATION With ample time in which to wonder what Dorothy 's summons might imply , Garrison naturally found himself in the dark , despite his utmost efforts at deduction . He welcomed the chance thus made possible to behold her again so soon , after what he had so recently discovered , and yet he almost dreaded the necessity of ferreting out all possible facts concerning her actions and motives for the past six weeks , the better to work up his case . Wherever it led him , he knew he must follow unrelentingly . Masquerading as her husband , he had involved himself in -- Heaven alone knew what -- but certainly in all her affairs , even to the murder itself , since he was alleged to have married her prior to John Hardy 's death , and was now supposed to benefit , in all probability , by some will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incessantly . He almost wished he had never heard of Mr. Wicks , who had come to his office with employment . And yet , with Dorothy entangled as she was in all this business , it was better by far that he should know the worst , as well as the best , that there was to be discovered . He wondered if the whole affair might be charged with insidious fatalities -- either for himself or Dorothy . He was groping in the dark -- and the only light was that which shone in Dorothy 's eyes ; there was nothing else to guide him . He could not believe it was a baneful light , luring him on to destruction -- and yet -- and yet --  --  His gaze wandered out at the window on a scene of Nature 's loveliness . The bright June day was perfect . In their new , vivid greens , the fields and the trees were enchanting . How he wished that he and Dorothy might wander across the hills and meadows together ! A sweet , lawless wildness possessed his rebellious nature . His mind could reason , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the time passed until New York was reached . Unobserved , the man who had shadowed Garrison so faithfully left the train at the Harlem station , to take the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street crosstown car , in his haste to get to Ninety-third Street , where the Robinsons were waiting . Garrison went on to the Grand Central , carried his suit-case to his room , freshened his dress with new linen , and then , going forth , lunched at a corner cafe , purchased another bunch of roses , and proceeded on to Dorothy 's . It was a quarter of two when he rang the bell . He waited only the briefest time . The door was opened , and there stood young Robinson , smiling . " Why , how do you do , Cousin Jerold ? " he said , cordially extending his hand . " Come right in . I 'm delighted to see you . " Garrison had expected any reception but this . He felt his old dislike of the Robinsons return at once . There was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy --  --  " he started . " Wo n't you go right up ? " interrupted Theodore . " I believe you are not unexpected . " Garrison was puzzled . A certain uneasiness possessed him . He proceeded quietly up the stairs , momentarily expecting Dorothy to appear . But the house was silent . He reached the landing and turned to look at Theodore , who waved him on to the room they had occupied before . When he entered he was not at all pleased to find the elder Robinson only awaiting his advent . He halted just inside the threshold and glanced inquiringly from father to son . " How do you do ? " he said stiffly . " Is Dorothy not at home ? " " She is not , " said old Robinson , making no advance and giving no greeting . " Will you please sit down ? " Garrison remained where he was . " Do you expect her soon ? " he inquired . " We shall get along very well without her . We 've got something to say to you -- alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced to a chair and sat down . " In the first place , perhaps you will tell us your actual name , " said old Robinson , himself taking a seat . Garrison was annoyed . " Let me assure you , once for all , that I do not in the least recognize your right to meddle in my concerns , or subject me to any inquisitions . " " That 's another way of saying you refuse to answer ! " snapped Robinson tartly . " You know your name is n't Fairfax , any more than it 's mine . Your name is Garrison . " Garrison stared at him coldly . " You seem to have made up your mind very decidedly , " he said . " Is that all you have to say ? " " You do n't deny it ? " cried the old man , exasperated by his calmness . " You do n't dare deny it ! " Garrison grew calmer . " I have n't the slightest reason to deny anything , " he said . " I frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Garrison whenever occasion demands . " The old man was wild . " Will you swear that your right name is Fairfax ? " he said . " That 's what I demand to know ! " Garrison answered : " I came here to see my wife . I warn you I am growing impatient with your hidden insinuations ! " " Your wife ! " cried old Robinson , making a dive into one of his pockets with his hand . " What have you to say to this letter , from the woman who is doubtless by now your legal wife ? " Suddenly snatching a letter from his coat , he projected himself toward Garrison and held up the missive before him . It was the letter from Ailsa -- the one that Garrison had missed -- the letter in which she had agreed to become his wife . He put forth his hand to receive it . " No , you do n't ! " cried the old man , snatching it out of his reach . " I 'll keep this , if you please , to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , it was your hired thief who stole it , up at Branchville ? " he said . " I do n't suppose he showed you the skin that he left behind from his fingers . " " That 's got nothing to do with the point ! " the old man cried at him triumphantly . " I do n't believe you are married to my niece . If you think you can play your game on me --  --  " Garrison interrupted . " The theft of that letter was a burglary in which you are involved . You are laying up trouble for yourself very rapidly . Give that letter to me ! " " Give it up , hey ? We 'll see ! " said Robinson . " Take it to court if you dare ! I 'm willing . This letter shows that another woman accepted you , and that 's the point you do n't dare face in the law ! " Whatever else he discerned in the case . Garrison did not understand in the least how Dorothy could have summoned him back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied to Robinson calmly . " Look at the date . It 's a bit of ancient history , long since altered . " " There is no date ! " the old man shrilled in glee ; and he was right . Garrison 's reply was never uttered . The door behind him abruptly opened , and there stood Dorothy , radiant with color and beauty . " Why , Jerold ! " she cried . " Why , when did you come ? I did n't even know you were in town . " She ran to him ardently , as she had before , with her perfect art , and kissed him with wifely affection . CHAPTER XI THE SHOCK OF TRUTH For one second only Garrison was a trifle confused . Then he gave her the roses he had brought . She carried them quickly to the table , hiding her face in their fragrant petals . " Just a moment , Dorothy , " said Garrison . " You did n't know I 'd come to town ? You wired --  --  " He halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , " I think I begin to see . " Dorothy felt something in the air . " What is it , Jerold ? " she said . " I have n't wired . What do you mean ? " Garrison faced the Robinsons . " I mean that these two gentlemen telegraphed me at Branchville to come here at once -- and signed your name to the wire . " " Telegraphed you ? In my name ? " repeated Dorothy . " I do n't believe I understand . " " We may as well understand things first as last , " said her uncle . " I do n't believe this man is your husband ! I do n't believe his name is Fairfax ! He was registered as Garrison . Furthermore --  --  " Garrison interrupted , addressing Dorothy : " They think they have discovered something important or vital in the fact that I sometimes use the name Garrison . And they have managed to steal an old letter --  --  " " I 'll tell about the letter , if you please ! " cried old Robinson shrilly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There you are ! " he said , waving the letter before her face . " There 's the letter from his sweetheart -- the woman he asked to become his wife ! Here 's her acceptance , and her protestations of love . She is doubtless his wife at this moment ! Read it for yourself ! " He thrust it into Dorothy 's hand with aggressive insistence . Dorothy received it obediently . She hardly knew what she should say or do to confute the old man 's statements , or quiet his dangerous suspicions . His arrival at the truth concerning herself and Garrison had disconcerted her utterly . Garrison did not attempt to take the letter , but he addressed her promptly : " I am perfectly willing to have you read the letter . It was written over a year ago . It is Ailsa 's letter . I told you I was once engaged to Ailsa ; that she married my friend , without the slightest warning ; that I had not destroyed her last letter . She never acquired the habit of dating her letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of recent correspondence . " " A very pretty explanation ! " cried old Robinson . " We 'll see -- we 'll see ! Dorothy , read it for yourself ! " Dorothy was rapidly recovering her self-possession . She turned to her uncle quite calmly , with the folded bit of paper in her hand . " How did you come by this letter , " she inquired . " You did n't really steal it ? " Garrison answered : " The letter was certainly stolen . My suit-case was rifled the night of my arrival at Branchville . These gentlemen hired a thief to go through my possessions . " " I 've been protecting my rights ! " the old man answered fiercely . " If you think you can cheat me out of my rightful dues you 'll find out your mistake ! " " I would n't have thought you could stoop to this , " said Dorothy . " You could n't expect to shake my faith in Jerold . " She handed Garrison the letter to show her confidence . Garrison placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are both involved in a prison offense , " he said --  " an ordinary , vulgar burglary . I suppose you feel secure in the fact that for Dorothy 's sake I shall do nothing about it -- to-day . But I warn you that I 'll endure no more of this sort of thing , in your efforts to throw discredit on Dorothy 's relationship with me ! Now then , kindly leave the room . " Aware that Garrison held the upper hand , old Robinson was more than chagrined ; he was furious . His rage , however , was impotent ; there was no immediate remedy at hand . Theodore , equally baffled , returned to his attitude of friendliness . " No harm 's been done , and none was intended , " he said . " There 's nothing in family rows , anyhow . Father , come along . " His father , on the point of discharging another broadside of anger , altered his mind and followed his son to a room at the rear of the house . Garrison closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does it mean ? " she asked in a tone barely above a whisper . " They have n't really found out anything ? " " They suspect the truth , I 'm afraid , " he answered . " I shall be obliged to ask you a number of questions . " Her face became quite ashen . " I can see that your employment has become very trying , " she said , " but I trust you are not contemplating retreat . " The thought made her pale , for her heart , too , had found itself potently involved . " No ; I have gone too far for that , " he answered , making an effort to fight down the dictates of his increasing love and keep his head thoroughly clear . " In the first place , when you wire me in the future use another name , for safety -- say Jeraldine . In the next place , I am very much hampered by the blindness of my mission . I can see , I think , that the Robinsons expected some legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your marriage became necessary to fulfill some condition of the will . Is this correct ? " " Yes , quite correct . " She remained very pale . " Who was it that died , leaving the will ? And when did he die ? " " Another uncle , Mr. John Hardy -- quite recently , " she answered . " You are not in mourning . " " By his special request . He died very suddenly . He left a condition in his will that I should inherit his fortune provided I should have been married at least one month prior to his death to a healthy , respectable man -- who was not to be my cousin . " " Theodore ? " She nodded . " You can see I had to have a husband . " " Exactly . " Garrison thought he saw a light that cleared her as he could have wished . He hastened to a question bearing directly upon it . " Did the Robinsons know of this clause in your Uncle Hardy 's will -- say , two or three weeks ago ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrison 's heart sank . " You are sure ? " " Absolutely positive . Uncle John was very secretive . " The suggestion that the Robinsons , having known the condition in the will , had destroyed John Hardy in the belief that Dorothy , being unmarried , would thereby lose the inheritance , was vanishing . Garrison still had hope . " You once alluded to certain obligations that -- well , compelled you to hire a husband , " he said . " You had no urgent need of funds in a large amount ? " She darted him a startled look . " I shall have a pressing need -- soon . I suppose you have a right to know . " Garrison was almost in despair . There was nothing to do but go on . " Did Mr. Hardy know anything of this need ? " " No . " " You feared he might not be in sympathy with your requirements ? " " No , he --  --  Have these questions anything to do with our -- case ? " She seemed to be frightened . " They have , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You might raise quite a sum on such valuable gems . " The look of fear upon her face increased . " I could n't ! " she said , as if she feared the walls might hear and betray . " Please do n't mention --  --  " " You did n't tell me what they are , or why you wish to keep them , " he said . " What does it mean ? " " Please do n't ask ! " She was greatly agitated . " Please trust me -- a little while longer ! You probably have to return to Branchville and your work . " He determined then and there upon the one supreme test of the situation . " That reminds me , " he said , averting his gaze ; " the work on which I am engaged in Branchville is the case of a man named Hardy . I 'm glad he was not your uncle . " Her face took on the hue of death . Her lips moved , but for a moment made no sound . Then , with an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because , " he replied , with a forced smile on his lips , " the man up at Branchville was murdered . " She made no sound . She simply closed her eyes and swayed toward him , weakly collapsing as she fell . He caught her quickly against his breast , a heavy , precious burden that he knew he must love , though the angels of heaven accuse her . " **25;2344;TOOLONG me , " he said , but her senses were deaf to his voice . CHAPTER XII A DISTURBING LOSS Garrison , holding the limp , helpless form in his arms , gazed quickly about the room and saw the couch . He crossed the floor and placed her full length upon its cushions . She lay there so white and motionless that he was frightened . He felt it impossible to call the Robinsons . He needed water , quickly . He knew nothing of the house . His searching glance fell at once on the vase of roses , standing on the table . He caught it up , drew out the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetting his handkerchief with the water from the vase and pressing it closely on her forehead . She did not respond to his ministrations . He tore at her dress , where it fastened at the neck , and laid it wide open for several inches . On the creamy whiteness of her throat he sprinkled the water , then sprang to the window , threw it up , and was once more kneeling beside her . The fresh breeze swept in gratefully and cooled her face and neck . She stirred , slightly turned , opened her eyes in a languid manner , and partially relapsed into coma . " Thank God ! " said Garrison , who had feared for her life , and he once more applied his wetted handkerchief . He spoke to her , gently : " Forgive me , Dorothy -- it 's all right -- everything 's all right , " but her senses accepted nothing of his meaning . For another five minutes , that seemed like an age , he rubbed at her hands , resprinkled her throat and face , and waved a folded paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more opened her eyes she was fairly well restored . She recovered her strength by a sheer exertion of will and sat up , weakly , passing her hand across her brow . " I must have fainted , " she said . She was very white . " You 're all right now -- the heat and unusual excitement , " he answered reassuringly . " Do n't try to do anything but rest . " She looked at him with wide , half-frightened eyes . Her fears had returned with her awakened intelligence . " You must n't stay , " she told him with a firmness he was not prepared to expect . " Please go as soon as you can . " " But -- can I leave you like this ? You may need me , " he answered . " If there 's anything I can do --  --  " " Nothing now . Please do n't remain , " she interrupted . " I shall go to my room at once . " Garrison realized she was in no condition for further questioning . Whatsoever the status of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Dorothy in this present condition . He knew she very much desired to be alone . " But -- when shall I see you ? What shall I --  --  " he started . " I ca n't tell . Please go , " she interrupted , and she sank back once more on the cushions , looking at him wildly for a moment , and then averting her gaze . " Please do n't stay another minute . " He could not stay . His mind was confused as to his duty . He knew that he loved her and wished to remain ; he knew he was under orders and must go . Disturbed and with worry at his heart , he took her hand for one brief pressure . " Do n't forget I 'm your friend -- and protector , " he said . " Please do n't forget . " He took his hat , said good-by , saw her lips frame a brief , half-audible reply , then slipped from the room , to avoid giving undue notice to the Robinsons , went silently down the stairs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aware , in a dim sort of way , that a " shadow " was once more lurking on his trail , as he left the house , he was almost indifferent to the fellow 's intrusion , so much more disturbing had been the climax of his visit with Dorothy . The outcome of his announcement concerning her uncle 's death had affected Dorothy so instantaneously as to leave him almost without hope . The blow had reacted on himself with staggering force . He was sickened by the abruptness with which the accusing circumstances had culminated . And yet , despite it all , he loved her more than before -- with a fierce , aggressive love that blindly urged him to her future protection and defense . His half-formed plan to visit the dealer who had sold the cigars departed from his mind . He wanted no more facts or theories that pointed as so many were pointing . Indeed , he knew not where he was going , or what he meant to do , till at length a sign on a window aroused him to a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAFE DEPOSIT VAULTS . He entered the building , hired a box in the vault , and placed within it the jewels he had carried . Then he remembered Wicks . Instructions had been given to report , not only fully , but promptly . He must make a report -- but what ? He knew he could not tell of the horrible tissue of facts and circumstances that wound like a web about the girl he loved . He would far rather give up the case . And once he gave it up , he knew that no man alive could ever come again upon the damning evidence in his possession . He would say his work was incomplete -- that it looked like a natural death -- that Scott had acted suspiciously , as indeed he had -- that he needed more time -- anything but what appeared to be the sickening truth . Later , should Dorothy prove to be but some artful , dangerous creature , masquerading as a sweet young girl behind her appearance of beauty , innocence , and exquisite charm -- that would be time enough to move . Perfectly willing to be followed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest Subway station in upper Broadway and was presently borne downtown . He was barely in time at the big insurance office , for Wicks was preparing to leave . No less nervous , snappy , or pugnacious than before , the little sharp-faced man appeared more smiling than ever , and yet with an expression even more sardonic . " Well ? " he said , as he ushered Garrison into a small , private room . " What have you to report ? " " Nothing very much to report as yet , " said Garrison , slightly flushing at withholding the truth . " It looks very much as if the coroner 's verdict may have been correct -- although Scott acts a little like a man so absorbed in his inventions that he 'd stop at nothing for money . " " Needs money , does he ? " demanded Wicks . " He has admitted that ? " " Yes , " said Garrison , " he speaks so plainly of his need and makes such heartless and selfish references to the money he hopes to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of his character . " " Capable of murder , is he ? " " He 's fanatical about his invention and -- he needs money . " " You do n't think him guilty ? " announced Mr. Wicks , with rare penetration . " There seems to be little or nothing against him as yet , " said Garrison . " There was nothing found on the body , so far as I have been able to learn , to indicate murder . " " If murder at all , how could it have been done , " demanded Mr. Wicks . " Only by poison . " " H 'm ! You saw the dead man 's effects , of course . What did they comprise ? " Garrison detailed the dead man 's possessions , as found at the coroner 's office . He neglected nothing , mentioning the cigars as candidly as he did the few insignificant papers . " In what possible manner could the man have been poisoned ? " demanded Wicks , rising , with his watch in his hand . " Was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not that I can trace . The only clew that seems important , so far , is that Scott spent fifteen minutes in Hardy 's room , alone , on the night of his death . " " That 's something ! " said Wicks , with the slightest possible show of approval . " Put on your hat and go uptown with me and tell me exactly all about it . " They left the office , proceeded to the Subway , boarded an uptown express that was jammed to the guards with struggling humanity , all deserting the small end of Gotham at once ; and here , with Wicks crowded flat up against him , and hanging , first to a strap and then to his shoulder . Garrison related the few facts that he had already briefly summarized . " Well -- nothing to say to you but go ahead , " said Wicks , as they neared the Grand Central Station , where he meant to take a train . " Stick to the case till you clean it up . That 's all . " Garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular objective point in view , felt thoroughly depressed and lonely . He wished he had never discovered the poisoned cigar at Branchville . Mechanically , his hand sought his pocket , where the second charged weed had been placed . Then he started and searched his waistcoat wildly . The deadly cigar was gone ! CHAPTER XIII A TRYST IN THE PARK Unable for a moment to credit his senses , Garrison moved over against the wall of the building he was passing , and stood there , slowly , almost mechanically , searching his pockets once again , while his mind revolved about the lost cigar , in an effort to understand its disappearance . He was wholly at a loss for a tenable theory till he thought of the frequency with which men are robbed of scarf-pins or similar trifles -- and then a sickening possibility possessed him . One of the commonest devices that a woman employs in such a petty theft is to faint on the breast of her victim . In such a pose she may readily extract some coveted article from either his tie or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not seem possible -- and yet the fact remained that Dorothy had fainted thus against him , and the poisoned cigar was gone . She had known of his visit to Branchville ; his line of questions might have roused her suspicions ; the cigar had been plainly in sight . He had seen her enact her role so perfectly , in the presence of her relatives , that he could not doubt her ability in any required direction . For a moment a powerful revulsion of feeling toward the girl , who was undeniably involved in some exceptionally deep-laid plan , crept throughout his being . Not only does a man detest being used as a tool and played upon like any common dunce , but he also feels an utter chagrin at being baffled in his labors . Apparently he had played the fool , and also he had lost the vital evidence of Hardy 's poisoning . Mortified and angry , he remained there , while the crowds surged by , his gaze dully fixed on the pavement . For a time he saw nothing , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilted rose , thrown down by some careless pedestrian -- was lying almost at his feet . Somehow , it brought him a sense of calm and sweetness ; it seemed a symbol , vouchsafed him here in the hot , sordid thoroughfare , where crime and folly , virtue and despair , stalk arm in arm eternally . He could not look upon the bit of trampled beauty , thus wasted on a heedless throng , and think of Dorothy as guilty . She had seemed just as crushed and wilted as the rose when he left her at her home -- just as beautiful , also , and as far from her garden of peace and fragrances as this rejected handful of petals . She must be innocent . There must be some other explanation for the loss of that cigar -- and some good reason for the things she had done and said . He took up the rose , indifferent to anyone who might have observed the action with a smile or a sneer , and slowly proceeded down the street . The cigar , he reflected , might easily have been stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Any one of them so inclined could have taken the weed at his pleasure . The thought was wholly disquieting , since if any man attempted to bite the cigar-end through , to smoke , he would pay a tragic penalty for his petty theft . This aspect of the affair , indeed , grew terrible , the more he thought upon it . He almost felt he must run to the station , try to search out that particular train , and cry for all to hear that the stolen cigar would be fatal -- but the thought was a wild , unreasoning vagary ; he was absolutely helpless in the case . He could not be certain that the weed had thus been extracted from his pocket . It might in some manner have been lost . He did not know -- he could not know . He felt sure of one thing only -- his hope , his demand , that Dorothy must be innocent and good . Despite his arguments , he was greatly depressed . The outcome of all the business loomed dim and uncertain before him , a haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He presently came to the intersection of fashionable Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street , and was halted by the flood of traffic . Hundreds of vehicles were pouring up and down , in endless streams , while two calm policemen halted the moving processions , from time to time , to permit the crosstown cars and teams to move in their several directions . Across from Garrison 's corner loomed the great marble library , still incomplete and gloomily fenced from the sidewalk . Beyond it , furnishing its setting , rose the trees of Bryant Park , a green oasis in the tumult and unloveliness about it . Garrison knew the benches there were crowded ; nevertheless , he made his way the length of the block and found a seat . He sat there till the sun was gone and dusk closed in upon the city . The first faint lights began to twinkle , like the palest stars , in the buildings that hedged the park about . He meant to hunt out a restaurant and dine presently , but what to do afterward he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Hickwood at night , and but little , for the matter of that , to be done by day . Tomorrow would be ample time to return to that theater of uncertainty . He longed for one thing only -- another sight of Dorothy -- enshrined within his heart . Reminded at last of the man who had followed on his trail , he purposely strolled from the park and circled two blocks , by streets now almost deserted , and was reasonably certain he had shaken off pursuit . As a matter of fact , his " shadow " had lost him in the Subway , and now , having notified the Robinsons by telephone , was watching the house where he roomed . Garrison ate his dinner in a mood of ceaseless meditation concerning Dorothy . He was worried to know what might have happened since his departure from her home . Half inclined in one minute to go again to the house , in the next he was quite undecided . The thought of the telephone came like an inspiration . Unless the Robinsons should interfere , he might readily learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant , he found a quiet booth , far better suited to his needs than the noisier , more public boxes at the eating place he had quitted . He closed himself inside the little cubby-hole , asked for the number , and waited . It seemed an interminable time till a faint " Hello ! " came over the wire , and he fancied the voice was a man 's . " Hello ! Is that Mrs. Fairfax ? " he asked . " I 'd like to speak to Mrs. Fairfax . " " Wait a minute , please . Who is it ? " said a voice unmistakably masculine . " Mr. Wallace , " said Garrison , by way of precaution . " She 'll understand . " " Hold the wire , please . " He held the receiver to his ear , and waited again . At length came a softer , more musical greeting . It was Dorothy . His heart was instantly leaping at the sound of her voice . " Hello ! Is that someone to speak to me ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " answered Garrison . " This is Jerold . I felt I must find out about you -- how you are . I 've been distressed at the way I was obliged to leave . " " Oh ! " said the voice faintly . " I -- I 'm all right -- thank you . I must see you -- right away . " Her voice had sunk to a tone he could barely distinguish . " Where are you now ? " " Downtown , " said Garrison . " Where shall I meet you ? " " I -- hardly know , " came the barely audible reply . " Perhaps -- at Central Park and Ninety-third Street . " " I 'll start at once , " he assured her . " If you leave the house in fifteen minutes we shall arrive about the same time . Try to avoid being followed . Good-by . " He listened to hear her answer , but it did not come . He heard the distant receiver clink against its hook , and then the connection was broken . He was happy , in a wild , lawless manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elevated station . The prospect of meeting Dorothy once more , in the warm , fragrant night , at a tryst like that of lovers , made his pulses surge and his heart beat quicken with excitement . All thought of her possible connection with the Branchville crime had fled . The train could not run fast enough to satisfy his hot impatience . He wished to be there beneath the trees when she should presently come . He alighted at last at the Ninety-third Street station , and hastened to the park . When he came to the appointed place , he found an entrance to the greenery near by . Within were people on every bench in sight -- New York 's unhoused lovers , whose wooing is accomplished in the all but sylvan glades which the park affords . Here and there a bit of animated flame made a tiny meteor streak against the blackness of the foliage -- where a firefly quested for its mate , switching on its marvelous little searchlight . Beyond , on the smooth , broad roadways , four-eyed chariots of power shot silently through the avenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to man 's control . It was all thrilling and exciting to Garrison , with the expectation of meeting Dorothy now possessing all his nature . Then -- a few great drops of rain began to fall . The effect was almost instantaneous . A dozen pairs of sweethearts , together with as many more unmated stragglers , came scuttling forth from unseen places , making a lively run for the nearest shelter . Garrison could not retreat . He did not mind the rain , except in so far as it might discourage Dorothy . But , thinking she might have gone inside the park , he walked there briskly , looking for some solitary figure that should by this time be in waiting . He seemed to be entirely alone . He thought she had not come -- and perhaps in the rain she might not arrive at all . Back towards the entrance he loitered . A lull in the traffic of the street had made the place singularly still . He could hear the raindrops beating on the leaves . Then they ceased as abruptly as they had commenced . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart gave a quick , joyous leap . Near a bench was a figure -- the figure of a woman whose grace , he fancied , was familiar . Her back was apparently turned as he drew near . He was about to whistle , if only to warn her of his coming , when the shrubbery just ahead and beside the path was abruptly parted and a man with a short , wrapped club in his hand sprang forth and struck him viciously over the head . He was falling , dimly conscious of a horrible blur of lights in his eyes , as helplessly as if he had been made of paper . A second blow , before he crumpled on the pavement , blotted out the last remaining vestige of emotion . He lay there in a limp , awkward heap . The female figure had turned , and now came striding to the place with a step too long for a woman . There was no word spoken . Together the two lifted Garrison 's unconscious form , carried it quickly to the shrubbery , fumbled about it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded from the view of any possible passer-by , and then , still in silence , hastily quitted the park and vanished in one of the glistening side streets , where the rain was reflecting the lamps . CHAPTER XIV A PACKAGE OF DEATH A low , distant rumble of thunder denoted a new gathering of storm . Five minutes passed , and then the lightning flashed across the firmament directly overhead . A crash like the splitting of the heavens followed , and the rain came down as if it poured through the slit . The violence lasted hardly more than five minutes , after which the downpour abated a little of its fury . But a steadier , quieter precipitation continued , with the swiftly moving center of disturbance already far across the sky . The rain in his face , and the brisk puff of newly washed ozone in his heavily moving lungs , aroused Garrison 's struggling consciousness by slow degrees . Strange , fantastic images , old memories , weird phantoms , and wholly impossible fancies played through his brain with the dull , torturing persistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was fully half an hour before he was sufficiently aroused to roll to an upright position and pass his hand before his eyes . He was sick and weak . He could not recall what had happened . He did not know where he was . He was all but soaked by the rain , despite the fact that a tree with dense foliage was spread above him , and he had lain beneath protecting shrubberies . Slowly the numbness seemed to pass from his brain , like the mist from the surface of a lake . He remembered things , as it were , in patches . Dorothy -- that was it -- and something had happened . He was stupidly aware that he was sitting on something uncomfortable -- a lump , perhaps a stone -- but he did not move . He was waiting for his brain to clear . When at length he hoisted his heavy weight upon his knees , and then staggered drunkenly to his feet , to blunder toward a tree and support himself by its trunk , his normal circulation began to be restored , and pain assailed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned for some time against the tree , gathering up the threads of the tangle . It all came back , distinct and sharp at last , and , with memory , his strength was returning . He felt of his head , on which his hat was jammed . The bone and the muscles at the base of the skull were sore and sensitive , but the hurt had not gone deep . He felt incapable of thinking it out -- the reasons , and all that it meant . He wondered if his attacker had thought to leave him dead . Mechanically his hands sought out his pockets . He found his watch and pocketbook in place . Some weight seemed dragging at his coat . When his hand went slowly to the place , he found the lump on which he had been lying . He pulled it out -- a cold , cylindrical affair , of metal , with a thick cord hanging from its end . Then a chill crept all the distance down his spine . The thing was a bomb ! Cold perspiration and a sense of horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feebly left unfocused in his brain -- a thought of himself as a victim , lured to the park for this deed -- became as stinging as a blow on the cheek . The cord on this metal engine of destruction was a fuse . The rain had drenched it and quenched its spark of fire , doubtless at some break in the fiber , since fuse is supposedly water-proof . Nothing but the thunder-storm had availed to save his life . He had walked into a trap , like a trusting animal , and chance alone had intervened to bring him forth alive . His brain by now was thoroughly active . Reactionary energy rushed in upon him to sharpen all his faculties . There was nothing left of the joyous throbbing in his veins which thoughts of his tryst with Dorothy had engendered . He felt like the wrathful dupe of a woman 's wiles , for it seemed as plain as soot on snow that Dorothy , fearing the consequences of his recent discoveries in the Hardy case , had made this park appointment only with this treacherous intent . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with them came new indications of her guilt . Her voice on the telephone had been weak and faltering . She had chosen the park as their meeting place , as the only available spot for such a deed . And then -- then --  --  It seemed too horrible to be true , but the wound was on his head , and death was in his hand . It was almost impossible that anyone could have heard their talk over the ' phone . He was left no alternative theory to work on , except that perhaps the Robinsons had managed , through some machination , to learn that he and Dorothy were to meet at this convenient place . One struggling ray of hope was thus vouchsafed him , yet he felt as if perhaps he had already given Dorothy the benefit of too many reasonable doubts . He could be certain of one thing only -- he was thoroughly involved in a mesh of crime and intrigue that had now assumed a new and personal menace . Hereafter he must work more for Garrison and less for romantic ideals . Anger came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sense of alarm which would frighten him out of further effort to probe to the bottom of the business , he was stubbornly determined to remain on the case till the whole thing was stripped of its secrets . Not without a certain weakness at the knees did he make his way back to the path . He had no fear of lurking enemies , since those who had placed the bomb in his pocket would long before have fled the scene to make an alibi complete . The rain had ceased . Wrapping the fuse about the metal cartridge in his hand , he came beneath a lamp-post by the walk , and looked the thing over in the light . There was nothing much to see . A nipple of gas-pipe , with a cap on either end , one drilled through for the insertion of the fuse , described it completely . The kink in the fuse where the rain had found entrance to dampen the powder , was plainly to be seen . Garrison placed the contrivance in his pocket . He pulled out his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten . He realized he must have lain a considerable time unconscious in the wet . Halting to wonder what cleverness might suggest as the best possible thing to be done , he somewhat grimly determined to proceed to Dorothy 's house . CHAPTER XV SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERIES Damp and uncomfortable , he kept to the farther side of the street , and slackened his pace as he drew near the dwelling which he realized was a place replete with mystery . He stood on the opposite sidewalk at length , and gazed across at the frowning brownstone front . The place was utterly dark . Not the slightest chink of light was visible in all its somber windows . Aware that nothing is so utterly confusing to a guilty being as to be confronted unexpectedly by a victim , supposed to be dispatched , Garrison had come this far without the slightest hesitation . The aspect of the house , however , was discouraging . Despite the ache at the base of his skull , and despite the excited thumping of his heart , he crossed the street , climbed unhaltingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made up his mind to act as if nothing unusual had occurred . Then , should either Dorothy or the Robinsons exhibit astonishment at beholding him here , or otherwise betray a guilty knowledge of the " accident " which had befallen him , his doubts would be promptly cleared . A minute passed , and nothing happened . He rang the bell again . Once more he waited , in vain . His third ring was long and insistent . About to despair of gaining admission , he was gratified to note a dimly reflected light , as if from the rear , below stairs . Then the hall was illumined , and presently a chain-lock was drawn , inside the door , the barrier swung open , and the serving-woman stood there before him , dressed with the evidences of haste that advertised the fact she had risen from her bed . Garrison snatched at his wits in time to act a part for which he had not been prepared . " I 'm afraid it 's pretty late , " he said , " but I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's too bad , sir , ai n't it ? " said the woman . " Mrs. Fairfax has went out for the night . " This was the truth . Dorothy , together with the Robinsons , had left the house an hour before and gone away in an automobile , leaving no word of their destination , or of when they intended to return . Utterly baffled , and wholly at a loss to understand this unexpected maneuver . Garrison stood for a moment staring at the woman . After all , such a flight was in reasonable sequence , if Dorothy were guilty . The one thing to do was to avail himself of all obtainable knowledge . " Gone -- for the night , " he repeated . " Did Mrs. Fairfax seem anxious to go ? " " I did n't see her , sir . I could n't say , really , " answered the woman . " Mr. Theodore said as how she was ailing , sir , and they was going away . That 's all I know about it , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , half to himself . Then a thought occurred to him abruptly -- a bold suggestion , on which he determined to act . " Is my room kept ready , in case of present need like this to-night ? " he said . " Or , if not , could you prepare it ? " " It 's all quite ready , sir , clean linen and all , the room next to Mrs. Fairfax 's , " said the woman . " I always keeps it ready , sir . " " Very good , " said Garrison , with his mind made up to remain all night and explore the house for possible clews to anything connected with its mysteries . " You may as well return to your apartments . I can find my way upstairs . " " Is there anything I could get you , sir ? " inquired the woman . " You look a bit pale , sir , if you 'll pardon the forwardness . " " Thank you , no , " he answered gratefully . " All I need is rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman switched on the lights in the hallway above . " Good-night , sir , " she said . " If you 're needing anything more I hope you 'll ring . " " Good-night , " said Garrison . " I shall not disturb you , I 'm sure . " With ample nerve to enact the part of master , he ascended the stairs , proceeded to the room to which he had always gone before , and waited to hear the woman below retire to her quarters in the basement . The room denoted nothing unusual . The roses , which he had taken from the vase to obtain the water to sprinkle on Dorothy 's face , had disappeared . The vase was there on the table . He crossed the floor and tried the door that led to Dorothy 's boudoir . It was locked . Without further ado , he began his explorations . It was not without a sense of gratitude that he presently discovered the bathroom at the rear of the hall . Here he laved his face and head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall led away from the first , and through this he came at once to the rooms which had evidently been set apart for Dorothy and her husband . The room which he knew was supposed to be his own contained nothing save comfortable furnishings . He therefore went at once to Dorothy 's apartments . She occupied a suite of three rooms -- one of them large , the others small . Exquisite order was apparent in all , combined with signs of a dainty , cultured taste . It seemed a sacrilege to search her possessions , and he made no attempt to do so . Indeed , he gained nothing from his quick , keen survey of the place , save a sense of her beauty and refinement as expressed in the features of her " nest . " He felt himself warranted in opening a closet , into which he cast a comprehensive glance . It seemed well filled with hanging gowns , but several hooks were empty . On a shelf high up was a suit-case , empty , since it weighed almost nothing as he lifted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where fingers had disturbed the dust upon its lid , then stood on a chair , examined the shelf , and became aware that a second case had been removed , as shown by the absence of accumulated dust , which had gathered all about the place it had formerly occupied . Replacing the case he had taken from the shelf , he closed the closet , in possession of the fact that some preparation , at least , had been made against some sort of a journey . He was certain the empty hooks had been stripped of garments for the flight , but whether by Dorothy herself or by her relatives he could not , of course , determine . He repaired at once to the rooms farther back , which the Robinsons had occupied . When he switched on the lights in the first one entered , he knew it had been the old man 's place of refuge , for certain signs of the occupancy of Mr. Robinson were not lacking . It reeked of stale cigar-smoke , which would hang in the curtains for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old Robinson had quitted in haste . On the table were ash-trays , old cigar-stumps , matches , burned and new ; magazines , hairpins , a tooth-brush , and two calf-bound volumes of a legal aspect . One was a lawyer 's treatise on wills , the other a history of broken testaments , statistical as well as narrative . The closet here supplied nothing of value to Garrison when he gave it a brief inspection . At the end of the room was a door that stood slightly ajar . It led to the next apartment -- the room to which Theodore had been assigned . Garrison soon discovered the electric button and flooded the place with light . The apartment was quite irregular . The far end had two windows , overlooking the court at the rear -- the hollow of the block . These were both in an alcove , between two in-jutting partitions . One partition was the common result of building a closet into the room . The other was constructed to accommodate a staircase at the back of the house , leading to the quarters below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , neckties , soiled collars , and ends of cigarettes , with perfumes , toilet requisites , and beer bottles seemed strewn promiscuously on everything capable of receiving a burden . Garrison tried the door that led to the staircase , and found it open . The closet came next for inspection . Without expecting anything of particular significance , Garrison drew open the door . Like everything else in the Robinsons ' realm , it was utterly disordered . Glancing somewhat indifferently over its contents . Garrison was about to close the door when his eye caught upon a gleam of dull red , where a ray of light fell in upon a bit of color on the floor . He stopped , put his hand on the cloth , and drew forth a flimsy pair of tights of carmine hue -- part of the Mephistophelian costume that Theodore had worn on the night of the party next door . With this in his hand , and a clearer understanding of the house , with its staircase at the rear . Garrison comprehended the ease with which Theodore had played his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arousing suspicion . Encouraged to examine the closet further , he pawed around through the garments hung upon the hooks , and presently struck his hand against a solid obstacle projecting from the wall in the darkest corner , and heard a hollow , resonant sound from the blow . Removing half a dozen coats that hung concealingly massed in the place , he almost uttered an exclamation of delight . There on the wall was a small equipment telephone , one of the testing-boxes employed by the linemen in their labors with which to " plug in " and communicate between places where no regular ' phone is installed . It was Theodore 's private receiver , over which he could hear every word that might be said to anyone using the ' phone ! It tapped the wires to the regular instrument installed in the house , and was thoroughly concealed . Instantly aware that by this means young Robinson could have overheard every word between himself and Dorothy concerning their meeting in the park , Garrison felt his heart give a lift into realms of unreasonable joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy , but it gave him a priceless hope ! CHAPTER XVI IN QUEST OF DOROTHY More than half ready to believe that Dorothy had been spirited away , Garrison examined everything available , with the intention of discovering , if possible , any scrap that might indicate the destination to which the trio had proceeded . The Robinsons had left almost nothing of the slightest value or importance , since what clothing remained was of no significance whatever . It was not until he opened up the old man 's books on the subject of wills that Garrison found the slightest clew , and then he came upon a postal-card addressed to " Sykey Robinson , Esq. , " from Theodore 's mother . It mentioned the fact that she had arrived quite safely at " the house , " and requested that her husband forward a pair of her glasses , left behind when she started . The address of the place where she was stopping was given as 1600 Myrtle Avenue . The postmark was Woodsite , Long Island . Garrison made up his mind to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal her -- if need be , even against her will . Warmed to the business by his few discoveries , he returned at once to Dorothy 's apartments and opened her bureau and dressing-table for a superficial inspection . To his complete surprise , he found that every drawer was in utter confusion as to its contents . That each and all had been rudely overhauled there could not be a doubt for a moment . Not one showed the order apparent in all things else about the rooms . There could be but one conclusion . Some one had searched them hurriedly , sparing not even the smallest . The someone could not have been Dorothy , for many reasons -- and Garrison once more rejoiced . He was thoroughly convinced that Dorothy had been taken from the house by force . Whatever else she might be guilty of , he felt she must be innocent of the dastardly attempt upon his life . And , wherever she was , he meant to find her and take her away , no matter what the cost . The hour was late -- too late , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sense of ownership , and with grim resolutions concerning his dealings in future with the Robinsons , he extinguished the lights in the rooms he had searched , and , glad of the much-needed rest , retired in calm for six solid hours of sleep . This brought him out , refreshed and vigorous , at a bright , early hour of the morning . The housekeeper , not yet stirring in her downstairs quarters , failed to hear him let himself out at the door -- and his way was clear for action . His breakfast he took at an insignificant cafe . Then he went to his room in Forty-fourth Street . The " shadow , " faithful to his charge , was waiting in the street before the house . His presence was noted by Garrison , who nodded to himself in understanding of the fellow 's persistency . Arrived upstairs , he discovered three letters , none of which he took the time to read . They were thrust in his pocket -- and forgotten . The metal bomb , which was still in his coat , he concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his possessions , accumulated months before , when the needs of the Biddle robbery case had arisen , he selected a thoroughly effective disguise , which not only grew a long , drooping mustache upon his lip , but aged him about the eyes , and appeared to reduce his stature and his width of shoulders . With a pair of shabby gloves on his hands , and a book beneath his arms , he had suddenly become a genteel if poor old book-agent , whose appearance excited compassion . Well supplied with money , armed with a loaded revolver , fortified by his official badge , and more alert in all his faculties than he had ever felt in all his life , he passed down the stairs and out upon the street , under the very nose of the waiting " shadow , " into whose face he cast a tired-looking glance , without exciting the slightest suspicion . Twenty minutes later he had hired a closed automobile , and was being carried toward the Williamsburg Bridge and Long Island . The car selected was of a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock when he stood at length on the sidewalk opposite 1600 Myrtle Avenue , Woodsite , a modest cottage standing on a corner . It was one of the houses farthest from the center of the town ; nevertheless , it had its neighbors all about , if somewhat scattered . There was no sign of life about the place . The shades were drawn ; it bore a look of desertion . Only pausing for a moment , as even a book-agent might , after many repeated rebuffs , Garrison wended his way across the street , proceeded slowly up the concrete walk , ascended the steps , and rang the bell . There was no result . He rang again , and out of the corner of his eye beheld the curtain pushed a trifle aside , in the window near at hand , where someone looked out from this concealment . For the third time he rang -- and at last the door was opened for a distance no more than six inches wide . The face he saw was old man Robinson 's . The chain on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way inside without further ado . He noted this barely in time to save himself from committing an error . " Go away ! " said old Robinson testily . " No books wanted ! " " I hope you will not refuse a tired old man , " said Garrison , in a voice that seemed trembling with weakness . " The books I have to offer are quite remarkable indeed . " Do n't want them . Good-day ! " said Robinson . He tried to close the door , but Garrison 's foot prevented . " One of my books is particularly valuable to read to headstrong young women . If you have a daughter -- or any young woman in the house --  --  " " She ca n't see anyone -- I mean there 's no such person here ! " snapped Robinson . " What 's the matter with that door ? " " My other book is of the rarest interest , " insisted Garrison . " An account of the breaking of the Butler will -- a will drawn up by the most astute and crafty lawyer in America , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whose will was that ? " demanded Robinson , his interest suddenly roused . " Some lawyer , did you say ? " He relaxed his pressure on the door and fumbled at the chain . " The will of Benjamin Butler -- the famous Benjamin Butler , " Garrison replied . " One of the most remarkable --  --  " " Come in , " commanded old Robinson , who had slipped off the chain . " How much is the book ? " " I am only taking orders to-day , " answered Garrison , stepping briskly inside and closing the door with his heel . " If you 'll take this copy to the light --  --  " " Father ! " interrupted an angry voice . " Did n't I tell you not to let anyone enter this house ? Get out , you old nuisance ! Get out with your book ? " Garrison looked down the oak-finished hall and saw Theodore coming angrily toward him . Alive to the value of the melodramatic , he threw off both his hat and mustache and squared up in Theodore 's path . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You -- you --  --  " he gasped . Old Robinson recovered his asperity with remarkable promptness . " How dare you come into this house ? " he screamed . " You lying --  --  " " That 's enough of that , " said Garrison quietly . " I came for Dorothy -- whom you dared to carry away . " " You -- you -- you 're mistaken , " said Theodore , making a most tremendous effort at calmness , with his face as white as death . " She is n't here . " " Do n't lie . Your father has given the facts away , " said Garrison . " I want her -- and I want her now . " " Look here , " said Theodore , rapidly regaining his rage , " if you think you can come to my house like this --  --  " He was making a move as if to slip upstairs -- perhaps for a gun . Garrison pulled his revolver without further parley . " Stay where you are ! Up with your hands ! Do n't either of you make a move that I do n't order , understand ? I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For Heaven 's sake , do n't shoot ! " begged old Robinson . " Do n't shoot ! " " You fool -- do you think I 'd bring her here ? " said Theodore , trying to grin , but putting up his hands . " Put away your gun , and act like a man in his senses , or I 'll have you pulled for your pains . " " You 've done talking enough -- and perhaps I 'll have just a word to say about pulling , later on , " said Garrison . " In the meantime , do n't you open your head again , or you 'll get yourself into trouble . " He raised his voice and shouted tremendously : " Dorothy ! " " Jerold ! " came a muffled cry , from somewhere above in a room . He heard her vainly tugging at a door . " Go up ahead of me , both of you , " he commanded , making a gesture with the gun . " I prefer not to break in the door . " CHAPTER XVII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was eager to obey . Garrison stepped a foot forward and thrust the pistol firmly against the young man 's body , cocking the hammer . " I 'm going -- for the love of Heaven , look out ! " cried the craven suddenly , and he backed toward the stairs in haste . " That 's better , " said Garrison coldly . " Step lively , please , and do n't attempt the slightest treachery unless you are prepared to pay the price . " Theodore had no more than started when the door-bell rang -- four little jingles . " It 's mother , " said old Robinson , starting for the door . " Let her remain outside for the present , " ordered Garrison . " Get on up the stairs . " The bell rang again . The Robinsons , resigned to defeat , ascended to the hall above , with the gun yawning just at the rear . Once more Garrison called out : " Dorothy -- where are you ? " " Here ! " cried Dorothy , her voice still muffled behind a solid door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out ! " Garrison issued another order to Theodore , whom he knew to be the governing spirit in the fight against himself and Dorothy : " Put down one hand and get out your keys -- but do n't attempt to remove anything else from your pocket , or I 'll plug you on the spot . " Theodore cast a defiant glance across the leveled gun to the steady , cool eyes behind it , and drew forth the keys , as directed . " If that 's you , Jerold -- please , please get me out -- the door is locked ! " called Dorothy , alarmed by each second of delay . " Where are you now ? " " Coming ! " called Garrison . He added , to Theodore : " Keep one hand up . Unlock the door . " He called out again : " Keep cool when it 's opened . Do n't confuse the situation . " Young Robinson , convinced that resistance at this point was useless , inserted the key in the lock and opened the door , at the same time casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the wall . In the instant that Garrison 's attention was directed to the unlocked room , old Robinson made a quick retreat to a tiny red box that was screwed against the wall and twice pulled down a brass ring . Garrison beheld the action too late to interpose . He knew the thing for a burglar-alarm -- and realized his own position . Meantime Dorothy had not emerged . " Jerold ! Jerold ! " she cried . " My feet are chained ! " " Get in there , both of you , double-quick ! " commanded Garrison , and he herded the Robinsons inside the room , fairly pushing them before him with the gun . Then he saw Dorothy . White with fear , her eyes ablaze with indignation at the Robinsons , her beauty heightened by the look of intensity in her eyes , she stood by the door , her ankles bound together by a chain which was secured to the heavy brass bed . " Jerold ! " she cried as she had before , but her voice broke and tears started swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , " said Garrison , who had turned on her captors with an anger he could scarcely control . " You cowards ! You infamous scoundrels ! " he said . " Release those chains this instant , or I 'll blow off the top of your head ! " He demanded this of Theodore . " The key is n't here , " said the latter , intent upon gaining time since the burglar-alarm had been sprung . " I left it downstairs . " " I think you lie , " said Garrison . " Get busy , or you 'll have trouble . " " It 's on his ring , with the key to the door , " said Dorothy . " They 've kept me drugged and stupid , but I saw as much as that . " Once more Garrison pushed the black muzzle of the gun against Theodore 's body . The fellow cringed . The sweat stood out on his forehead . He dropped to his knees and , trembling with fear , fumbled with the keys . " To think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrained from sobbing , in her anger , relief , and nervous strain . Garrison made no reply . He was fairly on edge with anxiety himself , in the need for haste , aware that every moment was precious , with the town 's constabulary doubtless already on the way to respond to the old man 's alarm . The rights of the case would come too late , with his and Dorothy 's story against the statements of the Robinsons , and he had no intention of submitting to arrest . " You 're wasting time -- do better ! " he commanded Theodore , and he nudged the gun under his ribs . " That 's the key , that crooked one -- use it , quick ! " Theodore dared not disobey . The chain fell away , and Dorothy ran forward , with a sob upon her lips . " Do n't hamper me , dear , " said Garrison , watching the Robinsons alertly . " Just get your hat , and we 'll go . " Dorothy ran to a closet , drew forth a hat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall ! " commanded Garrison , and young Robinson tossed them out as directed . " Now , then , over in the corner with the pair of you ! " The helpless Robinsons moved over to the corner of the room . Dorothy was already in the hall . Garrison was backing out , to lock the door , when Dorothy ran in again beside him . " Just a minute ! " she said , and , going to the bed , despite Garrison 's impatience , she turned down the pillow and caught up a bunch of faded roses -- his roses -- and , blushing in girlish confusion , ran out once more , and slammed the door , which Garrison locked on her relations . " Throw the keys under the rug , " he said quietly . " We 've no time to lose . The old man rang in an alarm . " Dorothy quickly hid the keys as directed . The face she turned to him then was blanched with worry . " What shall we do ? " she said , as he led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this there 's no place to go . " " I provided for that , " he answered ; and , beholding her start as a sound of loud knocking at the door in the rear gave new cause for fright , he added : " Thank goodness , the old bearded woman has gone around back to get in ! " Half a minute more , and both were out upon the walk . Garrison carrying his book , his pistol once more in his pocket . A yell , and a shrill penetrative whistle from the rear of the house , now told of Theodore 's activities at the window of the room where he and his father were imprisoned . He was doubtless making ready to let himself down to the ground . " We may have to make a lively run , " said Garrison . " My motor-car is two blocks away . " They were still a block from the waiting car when , with yells and a furious blowing of his whistle , Theodore came running to the street before his house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of the town 's police and the chief of the local firemen , shot around the corner into Myrtle Avenue , and came to a halt before the residence which the fugitives had just barely quitted . " Make a run for it now , we 're in for a race , " said Garrison , and , with Dorothy skipping in excitement beside him , he came to his waiting chauffeur . " That fellow up the street is on our trail ! " he said . " Cut loose all the speed you 've got . Fifty dollars bonus if you lose the bunch before you cross the bridge to New York ! " He helped Dorothy quickly to her seat inside , and only pausing to note that Theodore was clambering hotly into the big red car , two long village blocks away , he swung in himself as the driver speeded up the motor . Then , with a whir and a mighty lurch as the clutch went in , the automobile started forward in the road . Ten seconds later they were running full speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puncturing the air like a Gatling gun 's terrific detonations . The race for New York had commenced . CHAPTER XVIII THE RACE Some of the roads on Long Island are magnificent . Many of the speed laws are strict . The thoroughfare stretching ahead of the two cars was one of the best . The traffic regulations suffered absolute demolition . Like a liberated thing of flame and deviltry , happiest when rocketing through space , the car beneath the fugitives seemed to bound in the air as it whirred with a higher and higher hum of wheels and gears , and the air drove by in torrential force , leaving a cloud of smoke and dust in their wake . Dorothy clung to Jerold , half afraid . He raised himself upon the seat and looked out of the tiny window set in the back . The big car in the road behind , obscured in the dust that must help to blind its driver , had lost scarcely more than half a block in picking up its speed . It , too , was a powerful machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ din on the highway . It was trailing smoke in a dense , bluish cloud that meant they were burning up their lubricant with spendthrift prodigality . But the monster was running superbly . The houses seemed scooting by in madness . A team that stood beside the road dwindled swiftly in perspective . The whir of the gears and the furious discharge of the used-up gas seemed increasing momentarily . The whole machine was rocking as it sped , yet the big red pursuer was apparently gaining by degrees . Garrison nodded in acknowledgment of the fact that the car behind , with almost no tonneau and minus the heavy covered superstructure , offered less resistance to the wind . With everything else made equal , and accident barred , the fellow at the wheel behind would overhaul them yet . He looked out forward . The road was straight for at least a mile . He beheld a bicycle policeman , riding ahead , to develop his speed , with the certain intention of calling to his driver to stop . Half a minute later the car was abreast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders on the wind . Garrison leaned to the tube that ended by the chauffeur 's ear . " Go on -- give her more if she 's got it ! " he said . " I 'll take care of the fines ! " The driver had two notches remaining on his spark advance . He thumbed the lever forward , and the car responded with a trifle more of speed . It was straining every bolt and nut to its utmost capacity of strength . The bicycle officer , clinging half a minute to a hope made forlorn by his sheer human lack of endurance , drifted to rearward with the dust . Once more Garrison peered out behind . The big red demon , tearing down the road , was warming to its work . With cylinders heating , and her mixture therefore going snappily as a natural result , she too had taken on a slight accession of speed . Two meteors , flung from space across the earth 's rotundity , could scarcely have been more exciting than these liberated chariots of power . There was no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The road , the landscape , the very world , became a dizzying blur that destroyed all distinct sense of sight . In the rush of the air , and the rapid-fire fusillade from the motor , all sense of hearing was benumbed . A craze for speed took possession of the three -- Dorothy , Garrison , the driver . The power to think on normal lines was being swept away . Such mania as drives a lawless comet comes inevitably upon all who ride with such space-defying speed . The one idea is more -- more speed -- more freedom -- more recklessness of spirit ! A village seven miles from Woodsite , calm in its half-deserted state , with its men all at business in New York , was cleaved , as it were , by the racing machines , while women and children ran and screamed to escape from the path of the monsters . The fellow behind was once more creeping up . The time consumed in going seven miles had been barely ten minutes . In fifteen minutes more , at his present rate of gain , the driver behind would be up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started as if to speak , at least a dozen times . She was now holding on with all her strength , aware that conversation was wholly out of the question . Garrison was watching constantly through the glass . The race could hardly last much longer . They were rapidly approaching a larger town , where such speed would be practically criminal . If only they could gain a lead and dart into town and around some corner , into traffic of sufficient density to mask his movements , he and Dorothy might perhaps alight and escape observation on foot , while the car led pursuit through the streets . About to suggest some such plan to his driver , he was suddenly sickened by a sharp report , like a pistol fired beneath the car . He feared for a tire , but the noise came again , and then three times , quickly , in succession . One of the cylinders was missing . Not only was the power cut down by a fourth , but compression in the engine thus partially " dead " was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward , one hand on the buzzer of his coil , and gave a screw a turn . Already the car was losing speed . The fellow behind was coming on like a red-headed whirlwind . For a moment the missing seemed to cease , and the speed surged back to the hum of the whirring gears . " Bang ! Bang ! " went the sharp report , as before , and Garrison groaned . He was looking out , all but hopeless of escape , rapidly reflecting on the charges that would lie against not only himself , but his chauffeur , when he saw the red fellow plunge through the dust on a crazy , gyrating course that made his heart stand still . They had blown out a tire ! Like a drunken comet , suddenly robbed of all its own crazy laws , the red demon see-sawed the highway . The man at the wheel , shutting off his power , crowding on his brakes , and clinging to his wheel with the skill and coolness of a master , had all he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unaware of what had occurred at the rear the driver in charge of Garrison 's car had once more adjusted the buzzer , and now with such splendid results that his motor seemed madder than before to run itself to shreds . Like a vanishing blot on the landscape , the red car behind , when it came to a halt , was deserted by its rival in the race . Two minutes later , with the city ahead fast looming like a barrier before them , Garrison leaned to the tube . " Slow down ! " he called . " Our friend has quit -- a blow-out . Get down to lawful speed . " Even then they ran fully half a mile before the excited creature of wheels and fire could be tamed to calmer behavior . CHAPTER XIX FRIGHT AND A DISAPPEARANCE With the almost disappointed thing of might purring tamely along through the far-spread town , and then on through level ways of beauty , leading the way to Gotham , Dorothy found that she was still clinging fast to Jerold 's arm , after nearly ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shyly withdrew her hand . Garrison had felt himself transported literally , more by the ecstasy of having her thus put dependence upon him than by any mere flight of the car . He underwent a sense of loss when the strain subsided , and her trembling hold relaxed and fell from his arm . Nevertheless , she clung to the roses . His heart had taken time to beat a stroke in joy during that moment of stress at the house , when she had caused a few seconds ' added delay to gather up the crushed and faded flowers . Since speaking to the driver last Garrison had been content to sit beside the girl in silence . There was much he must ask , and much she must tell , but for this little time of calm and delight he could not break the spell . Once more , however , his abounding confidence in her goodness , her innocence , and deep-lying beauty of character rose triumphant over fears . Once more the spell of a mighty love was laid upon his heart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , was Cupid 's victim -- that she loved him with a strange and joyous intensity , but he did know that the whole vast world was no price for this moment of rapture . She was the first to speak . " Why did we have to run away ? Are n't you supposed to have a perfect right to -- to take me wherever you please -- especially from a place like that , and such outrageous treatment ? " " I am only supposed to have that right , " he answered . " As a matter of fact , I committed a species of violence in Theodore 's house , compelling him to act at the point of the gun . Technically speaking , I had no right to proceed so far . But , aside from that , when they sprung the alarm -- well , the time had come for action . " Had the constable dragged me away , as a legal offender -- which he would doubtless have done on the charge of two householding citizens -- the delay would have been most annoying , while a too close investigation of my status as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wave of crimson swept across her face . " Of course . " She relapsed into silence for a moment . Then she added : " What does it all mean , anyway ? How dared they carry me off like this ? How did you happen to come ? When did you find that I had gone ? What do you think we 'd better do ? " " Answer one question at a time , " said Garrison , stuffing his handkerchief into the tube , lest the driver overhear their conversation . " There is much to be explained between us . In the first place , tell me , Dorothy , what happened just after I ' phoned you last evening , and you made an appointment to meet me in the park . " " Why , I hardly know , " she said , her face once more a trifle pale . " I went upstairs to get ready , thinking to slip out unobserved . In the act of putting on my hat , I was suddenly smothered in the folds of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I have scarcely known anything till this morning , when I waked in the bed at Theodore 's house , fully dressed , and chained as you saw me . " " But -- these roses ? " he said , lightly placing his hand upon them . " How did you happen to have them along ? " It was not a question pertinent to the issues in hand , but it meant a great deal to his heart . " Why -- I -- I was wearing them -- that 's all , " she stammered . " No one stopped to take them off . " He was satisfied . He wished they might once and for all dismiss the world , with all its vexations , its mysteries , and pains , and ride on like this , through the June-created loveliness bathed in its sunlight -- comrades and lovers , forever . The hour , however , was not for dreaming . There were grim facts affecting them both , and much to be cleared between them . Moreover he was merely hired to enact a role that , if it sometimes called for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all . He attacked the business directly . " We require an understanding on a great many topics , " he said to her slowly . " After I ' phoned you I went to the park , was caught in the rain , and attacked by two ruffians , who knocked me down , and left me to what they supposed would be certain destruction . " " Jerold ! " she said , and his name thus on her lips , with no one by to whom she was acting , gave him an exquisite pleasure . There was no possibility of guilty knowledge on her part . Of this he was thoroughly convinced . " You ? Attacked ? " " Later , " he resumed , " when I recovered , I went to the house in Ninety-third Street , was admitted by the woman in charge , and remained all night , after taking the liberty of examining all the apartments . " She looked at him in utter amazement . " Why -- but what does it --  --  You , attacked in the park -- these lawless deeds -- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ? " " No ; I merely thought so . The woman knew nothing . But I presently discovered a number of interesting things . Theodore has installed a private ' phone in his closet , and by means thereof had overheard our appointment . Your bureau and dressing-case had both been searched --  --  " " For the necklaces ! " she cried . " You have them safe ? " " I thought it might have been the jewels -- or your marriage certificate , " he said , alive to numerous points in the case which , he felt , were about to develop . She turned a trifle pale . " I 've sewn the certificate -- where I 'm sure they 'd never find it , " she said . " But the jewels are safe ? " " Quite safe , " he said , making a mental note of her insistence on the topic . " I then discovered the address of the Woodsite house , and you know the rest . " " It 's terrible ! The whole thing is terrible ! " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things ! I do n't know what we 're going to do . We 're neither of us safe ! " " You must help me all you can , " he said , laying his hand for a moment on her arm . " I 've been fighting in the dark . I must find you apartments where you will not be discovered by the Robinsons , whose criminal designs on the property inheritance will halt at nothing , and -- you must tell me all you can . " " I will , " she said ; " only --  --  " And there she halted , her eyes raised to his in mute appeal , a dumb fear expressed in their depths . They had both avoided the topic of the murder , at the news of which she had fainted . Garrison almost feared it , and Dorothy evidently dreaded its approach . More than anything else Garrison felt he must know she was innocent . That was the one vital thing to him now , whether she could ever return his love or not . He loved her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tenderest wishes for her comfort and happiness . He believed in her now as he always had , whensoever they were together . Nevertheless , he could not abandon all his faculties and plunge into folly like a blind and confident fool . " I 'd like to ask about the jewels first , " he said . " The night I first came to your home I entered the place next door by accident . A fancy-dress party was in progress . " " Yes -- I knew it . They used to be friends of Theodore 's . " " So I guessed , " he added dryly . " Theodore was there . " " Theodore -- there ? " she echoed in surprise he felt to be genuine . " Why , but -- do n't you remember you met him with the others in my house , soon after you came ? " " I do , perfectly . Nevertheless , I saw him in the other house , in mask , I assure you , dressed to represent Mephistopheles . Last night I found the costume in his closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , to employ . " " I remember , " said Dorothy excitedly , " that he came in a long gray overcoat , though the evening was distinctly warm . " " Precisely . And all of this would amount to nothing , " Garrison resumed , " only that while I stood in the hall of the house I had entered , that evening , I saw a young woman , likewise in mask , wearing your necklaces -- your pearls and diamonds . " Dorothy stared at him in utter bewilderment . Her face grew pale . Her eyes dilated strangely . " You -- you are sure ? " she said in a tone barely audible . " Perfectly , " said Garrison . " And you never mentioned this before ? " " I awaited developments . " " But -- what did you think ? You might almost have thought that Theodore had stolen them , and handed them to me , " she said . " Especially after the way I put them in your charge ! " " I told you we have much to clear between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to know a little --  --  " " But -- how did they come to be there ? " she interrupted , abruptly confronted by a phase of the facts which she had momentarily overlooked . " How in the world could my jewels have been in that house and also in my bureau at the very same time ? " " Is n't it possible that Theodore borrowed them , temporarily , and smuggled them back when he came ? " The startled look was intensified in her eyes as she met his gaze . " He must have done it in some such way ! " she said . " I thought at the time , when I ran in to get them , they were not exactly as I had left them , earlier . And I gave them to you for fear he 'd steal them ! " This was some light , at least . Garrison needed more . " Why could n't you have told me all about them earlier ? " She looked at him beseechingly . Some way , it seemed to them both they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much had been swept away that must have stood as a barrier between mere client and agent . " I felt I 'd rather not , " she confessed . " Forgive me , please . They do not belong to me . " Not yours ? " said Garrison . " What do you mean ? " " I advanced some money on them -- to some one very dear , " she answered . " Please do n't probe into that , if you can help it . " His jealousy rose again , with his haunting suspicion of a man in the background with whom he would yet have to deal . He knew that here he had no rights , but in other directions he had many . " I shall be obliged to do considerable probing , " he said . " The time has come when we must work much more closely together . A maze of events has entangled us both , and together we must find our way out . " She lowered her glance . Her lip was trembling . He felt she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were strung to the highest tension . For fully a minute she was silent . He waited . She looked up , met his gaze for a second , and once more lowered her eyes . " You spoke of -- of something -- yesterday , " she faltered . " It gave me a terrible shock . " She had broached the subject of the murder . " I was sorry -- sorry for the brutal way -- the thoughtless way I spoke , " he said . " I hope to be forgiven . " She made no reply to his hope . Her entire stock of nerve was required to go on with the business in hand . " You said my uncle was -- murdered , " she said , in a tone he strained to hear . " What makes you think of such a thing ? " " You have not before made the statement that the Hardy in Hickwood was your uncle , " he reminded her . " You must have guessed it was my uncle , " she replied . " You knew it all the time . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till some time after I began my work on the case . I knew Mr. Hardy had been murdered before I knew anything else about him . " She was intensely white , but she was resolute . " Who told you he was murdered ? " " No one . I discovered the evidence myself . " He felt her weaken and grow limp beside him . " The -- the evidence ? " she repeated faintly . " What kind -- of evidence ? " " Poison . " He was watching her keenly . She swayed , as if to faint once more , but mastered herself by exerting the utmost of her will . " Poison ? " she repeated , as before . " But how ? " " In a box of cigars -- a birthday present given to your uncle . " It was brutal -- cruelly brutal -- but he had to test it out without further delay . His words acted almost with galvanic effect . " Cigars ! His birthday ! My cigars ! " she cried . " Jerold , you do n't suspect me ? " The car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic . Almost on the instant came a crash and a cry . A dainty little brougham had been crushed against another motor car in the jam and impatience on the structure . One of its wheels had lost half its spokes , that went like a parcel of toothpicks . Garrison leaped out at once , and Dorothy followed in alarm . In the tide of vehicles , blocked by the trifling accident , a hundred persons craned their heads to see what the damage had been . A small knot of persons quickly gathered about the damaged carriage . Garrison hastened forward , intent upon offering his services , should help in the case be required . He discovered , in the briefest time , that no great damage had been done , and that no one had been injured . Eager to be hastening onward , he turned back to his car . Almost immediately he saw that the chauffeur 's seat was empty . Dorothy had apparently stepped once more inside , to be screened from public view . Hastily scanning the crowd about the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently , but in vain . He presently became aware of the fact that his man had , for some reason , fled and left his car . Considerably annoyed , and aware that he should have to drive the machine himself , he returned once more to the open door of the auto , intent upon informing Dorothy of their loss . He gazed inside the car in utter bewilderment . Dorothy also was gone . CHAPTER XX NEW HAPPENINGS Still puzzled , unable to believe his senses , Garrison made a second quick search of the vicinity that was rapidly being cleared and restored to order by a couple of efficient police officers , but without avail . Neither Dorothy nor the chauffeur could be found . One of the officers ordered him to move along with his car . There was nothing else to be done . Reluctantly , and not without feelings of annoyance and worry , combined with those of baffled mystery and chagrin , Garrison was presently obliged to climb to the driver 's seat and take the wheel in hand . The motor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeded it up , threw off the brake , put the gears in the " low , " and slipped in the clutch . Over the bridge in the halted procession of traffic he steered his course -- a man bereft of his comrade and his driver and with a motor-car thrust upon his charge . Through the streets of New York he was finally guiding the great purring creature of might , which in ordinary circumstances would have filled his being with delight . Thorough master of throttle , spark-advance , and speed-lever , he would have asked nothing better than to drive all day -- if Dorothy were only at his side . He had never felt more utterly disconcerted in his life . Where had she gone -- and why ? What did it mean to have the chauffeur also disappear ? Had the two gone off together ? If so , why should she choose a companion of his type ? If not , then what could have formed the motive for the man 's abrupt flight from the scene ? And what should be done with the motor-car , thus abandoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stolen came to Garrison 's mind . Nevertheless it was always possible that Dorothy had urged the driver to convey her out of the crowd , and that the driver had finally returned to get his car , and found it gone ; but this , for many reasons , seemed unlikely . Dorothy had shown her fear in her last startled question : " Jerold , you do n't suspect me ? " She might have fled in some sort of fear after that . But the driver -- what was it that had caused him also to vanish at a time so unexpected ? Garrison found himself obliged to give it up . He could think of nothing to do with the car but to take it to the stand where he had hired it in the morning . The chauffeur might , by chance , appear and claim his property . Uneasy , with the thing thus left upon his hands , and quite unwilling to be " caught with the goods , " Garrison was swiftly growing more and more exasperated . He knew he could not roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for anyone so inclined to steal ; he objected to reporting it " found " in this peculiar manner at any police headquarters , for he could not be sure it had been stolen , and he himself might be suspected . Having hired the car in crowded Times Square , near his Forty-fourth Street rooms , he ran it up along Broadway with the thought of awaiting the driver . The traffic was congested with surface cars , heavy trucks , other motors , and carriages . His whole attention was riveted on the task in hand . Driving a car in the streets of New York ceases to be enjoyment , very promptly . The clutch was in and out continuously . He crept here , he speeded up to the limit for a space of a few city blocks , and crept again . Past busy Fourteenth Street and Union Square he proceeded , and on to Twenty-third Street with Madison Square , green and inviting , lying to his right . Pushed over into the Fifth Avenue traffic by the regulations , he contemplated returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling along with his clutch barely rubbing , when a hansom cab , containing a beautiful but pale young woman , slowly passed . The occupant abruptly rose from her seat and scrutinized the car in obvious excitement . Garrison barely caught a glimpse of her face , busied as he was with the driving . He continued on . Two minutes later he was halted by a jam of carriages and the hansom returned at full speed . Once more the pale young woman was leaning half-way out . " Stop ! " she cried at the astounded Garrison . " You 've stolen that car ! I 'll have you arrested ! You 've got to return it at once ! " Garrison almost smiled , the half-expected outcome had arrived so promptly . He saw that half a dozen drivers of cabs and other vehicles were looking on in wonder and amusement . " Kindly drive into Twenty-sixth Street , out of this confusion , " he answered . " I shall be glad to halt there and answer all requirements . " He was so obviously a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified , that the strange young lady almost felt abashed at the charges she had made . The jam was broken . Garrison ran the car to the quieter side street , and the cab kept pace at his side . Presently he halted , got down from the seat and came to the hansom , lifting his hat . How thankful he was that no policeman had overheard the young woman 's cry , and followed , she might never suspect . " Permit me to introduce myself as a victim of another 's man 's wrongful intentions , " he said . " I hired this car this morning uptown -- in fact , in Times Square , and was driven out to Long Island . Returning , we were halted on the bridge -- and the chauffeur disappeared -- ran away , leaving me to drive for myself . " I feared at the time it might be the man was a thief , and I am greatly relieved to find the owner of the car so promptly . If this or any other explanation , before an officer , or any court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet every demand you may make upon my time . " The young woman looked at him with widely blazing eyes . She believed him , she hardly knew why . She had alighted from the hansom . " I 've been driving up and down Fifth Avenue all morning ! " she said . " I felt sure I could find it that way . It is n't mine . It was only left in my charge . I was afraid that something might happen . I did n't want to have it in the first place ! I knew it would cause me endless trouble . I do n't know what to do with it now . " " I should be gratified , " said Garrison , " if you will state that you do not consider me guilty of a theft so stupid as this would appear . " " I did n't think you were the man , " she answered . " A chauffeur my cousin discharged undoubtedly stole it . Policemen are after him now , with the man who runs the garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him , this morning . Perhaps he saw them on the bridge . " She was regaining color . She was a very fine-looking young woman , despite the expression of worry on her face . She was looking Garrison over in a less excited manner -- and he knew she held no thought of guilt against him . " Let me suggest that you dismiss your cab and permit me to take you at once to your garage , " he said , adding to the man on the box : " Cabby , how much is your bill ? " " Five dollars , " said the man , adding substantially to his charge . " Take ten and get out ! " said Garrison , handing him a bill . " Oh , but please --  --  " started the pretty young woman . Garrison interrupted . " The man who stole your car did yeoman service for me . I promised him five times this amount . He may never dare appear to get his money . Kindly step in . Will you drive the car yourself ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeying because of his masterly manner . " But really , I hardly know --  --  " " Please say nothing further about it , " he once more interrupted . " I am sorry to have been in any manner connected with an event which has caused you uneasiness ; but I am very glad , indeed , to be instrumental in returning your property and relieving your worry . Where do you keep your car ? " She told him the place . It was up in the neighborhood of Columbus Circle . Twenty minutes later the car was " home "  - -  where it would never get away on false pretenses again , and the news of its coming began to go hotly out by wire . Garrison heard the men call his fair companion Miss Ellis . He called a cab , when she was ready to go , asked for permission to escort her home , and was driven in her company to an old-fashioned house downtown , near Washington Square . There he left her , with a nice old motherly person , and bade her good-by with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured thanks she gave him and the half-timid offer of her hand . When he left and dismissed the cabman he was face to face with the problem of what he should do to find his " wife . " His worry all surged back upon him . He wondered where Dorothy had gone -- where she could go , why she had fled from him -- and what could he do but wait with impatience some word of her retreat . He had felt her innocence all but established , and love had come like a new great tide upon him . He was lonely now , and thoroughly disturbed . He had warned her she must go to live in some other house than her own ; nevertheless she might have proceeded to the Ninety-third Street residence for things she would require . It was merely a hope . He made up his mind to go to the house without delay , aware that the Robinsons might make all haste to get there and gain an advantage . Half an hour later he was once more in the place . The housekeeper alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absence . He had no intention of remaining long , with Dorothy to find , although he felt inclined to await the possible advent of Theodore and his father , whom he meant to eject from the place . As yet he dared not attempt to order the arrest of the former , either for Dorothy 's abduction or the crime attempted on himself in the park . The risk was too great -- the risk to the fictional marriage between himself and Dorothy . He climbed the stairs , wandered aimlessly through the rooms , sat down , waited , somewhat impatiently , tried to think what were best to do , worried himself about Dorothy again , and finally made up his mind she might attempt to wire him at his office address . Calling up the housekeeper , he gave her strict instructions against admitting any of the Robinsons -- an order which the woman received with apparent gratification . They were merely to be referred to himself , at this address , should they come upon the scene . He started off . He had barely closed the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to walk down the brownstone steps when Theodore , half-way up , panting from haste , confronted him , face to face . For a moment the two stood staring at each other in surprise . Garrison was first to break the silence . " You came a little late , you see . I have just issued orders you are not to be admitted to this house again , except with my special permission . " " By Heaven , you --  --  We 'll see about that ! " said Theodore . " I 'll have you put under arrest ! " " Try it , " said Garrison , grinning in his face . " A charge of abduction , plus a charge even larger , may cause you more than mere annoyance . You 've been looking for trouble with me , and you 're bound to have it . Let me warn you that you are up against a number of facts that you may have overlooked -- and you may hear something drop ! " " You think you 've been clever , here and in Woodsite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alarm . " I could drop a couple of facts on you that would fade you a little , I reckon . And this house is n't yours yet ! " " I wonder how many lessons you are going to need , " answered Garrison coldly . " If you put so much as your hand inside this building , I 'll have you arrested for burglary . Now , mind what I say -- and get out ! " " I 'll see you later , all right , " said Robinson , glaring for a moment in impotent rage , and he turned and retreated from the place . Garrison , with his mind made up to a coup of distinct importance , was presently headed for his room in Forty-fourth Street . Before he left the Subway he went to a waiting-room , replaced the long mustache upon his face -- the one with which he had started away in the morning -- and walked the few short blocks from the station to his house . The street was nearly deserted , but the " shadow " he had duped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Robinson . Garrison went up to him quietly -- and suddenly showing his gun , pulled away the false mustache . " I 'm the man you 've been waiting to follow , " he said . " Now , do n't say a word , but come on . " " Hell ! " said the man . He shrugged his shoulders and was soon up in Garrison 's room . CHAPTER XXI REVELATIONS The fellow whom Garrison had taken into camp had once attempted detective work himself and failed . He was not at all a clever being , but rather a crafty , fairly reliable employee of a somewhat shady " bureau " with which young Robinson was on quite familiar terms . He was far from being a coward . It was he who had followed Garrison to Branchville , rifled his suit-case , and been captured by the trap . Despite the fact that his hand still bore the evidence of having tampered with Garrison 's possessions , he had dared remain on the job because he felt convinced that Garrison had never really seen him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his helplessness , aware that his captor must at last have a very great advantage , he complied with Garrison 's command to take a seat in the room , and glanced about him inquiringly . " What do you want with me anyhow ? " he said . " What 's your game ? " " Mine is a surer game than yours , " said Garrison , seating himself with his back to the window , and the light therefore all on his visitor 's face . " I 'm going to tell you first what you are up against . " The man shifted uneasily . " You have n't got anything to hold me on , " he said . " I 've got my regular license to follow my trade . " " I was not aware the State was issuing licenses to burglars , " said Garrison . " Come , now , with that hand of yours , what 's the use of beating around the bush . If my suit-case had nipped you by the wrist instead of the fingers , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fellow thrust his hand in his pocket . His face , with two days ' growth of beard upon it , turned a trifle pale . " I 'd rather work on your side than against you , " he ventured . " A man has to make a living . " " You 've come around to the point rather more promptly than I expected , " said Garrison . " For fear that you may not keep your word , when it comes to a pinch , I 'll inform you I can send you up on two separate charges , and I 'll do so in a wink , if you try to double-cross me in the slightest particular . " " I have n't done anything but that one job at Branchville , " said the man in alarm . " What are you givin ' me now ? " " What 's your name ? " demanded Garrison . " Tuttle , " said the fellow , after a moment of hesitation . " Frank Tuttle . " " All right , Tuttle . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to your burglary at Branchville , you have made yourself accessory to a plot to commit a willful murder . " " I did n't ! By Heaven , I did n't ! " Tuttle answered . " I did n't have anything to do with that . " " With what ? " asked Garrison . " You see you plunge into every trap I lay , almost before it is set . " He rose , went to his closet , never without his eye on his man , searched on the floor and brought forth the cold iron bomb . This he abruptly placed on Tuttle 's knee . Tuttle shrank in terror . " Oh , Lord ! I did n't ! I did n't know they went in to do a thing like that ! " he said . " I 've been pretty desperate , I admit , Mr. Garrison , but I had no hand in this ! " The sweat on his forehead advertised his fear . He looked at Garrison in a stricken , ghastly manner that almost excited pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassins were to meet me in the park , " said Garrison . " You procured their services -- and expected to read of an accident to me in the papers the following morning . " He was risking a mere conjecture , but it went very near to the truth . " So help me , I did n't go as far as that ! " said Tuttle . " I admit I stole the letter up at Branchville , and sent it to Robinson at once . I admit I followed you back to New York and told him all I could . But I only gave him the names and addresses of the dagos , and I never knew what they had to do ! " Garrison took the bomb and placed it on his bureau . " Very good , " he said . " That makes you , as I said before , an accomplice to the crime attempted -- in addition to the burglary , for which I could send you up . To square this off you 'll go to work for me , and begin by supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a picture of abject fear and defeat . His jaw hung down ; his eyes were bulging in their sockets . " You -- you mean you 'll give me a chance ? " he said . " I 'll do anything -- anything you ask , if only you will ! " " Look here , Tuttle , your willingness to do anything has put you where you are . But I 'll give you a chance , with the thorough understanding that the minute you attempt the slightest treachery you 'll go up in spite of all you can do . First , we 'll have the names of the dagos . " Tuttle all but broke down . He was not a hardened criminal . He had merely learned a few of the tricks by which crime may be committed , and , having failed in detective employment , had no substantial calling and was willing to attempt even questionable jobs , if the pay were found sufficient . He supplied the names and addresses of the men who had done young Robinson 's bidding in Central Park . Garrison jotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in the detective business myself , " he added , as he finished the writing . " I thought so , but I was n't sure , " said Tuttle . " You told young Robinson as much ? " " He hired me to tell him everything . " " Exactly . How much do you expect to tell him of what is going on to-day ? " " Nothing that you do not instruct , " said Tuttle , still feeling insecure . " That is , if you meant what you said . " " I meant it , " said Garrison , " meant it all . You 're at work for me from this time on -- and I expect the faithfulness of an honest man , no matter what you may have been before . " " You 'll get it , " said Tuttle . " I only want a show to start off square and right . . . . What do you want me to do ? " " There is nothing of great importance just at present , except to remember who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be obliged to double-cross Robinson to a slight extent , when he next hunts you up for your report . He deserves a little of the game , no matter how he gets it . Take his instructions the same as before . Tell him you have lost me for a time . Report to me promptly concerning his instructions and everything else . Do you know the address of my office ? " " You have never been there since I was put on the case , " said Tuttle with commendable candor . " All right , " said Garrison . " It 's down in the --  --  " A knock on the door interrupted . The landlady , a middle-aged woman who rarely appeared at Garrison 's room , was standing on the landing when he went to investigate , and holding a message in her hand . " A telegram for you , " she said , and halting for a moment , she turned and retreated down the stairs . Garrison tore the envelope apart , pulled out the yellow slip and read : Please come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as possible . JERALDINE . It was Dorothy , across the Hudson . A wave of relief , to know she was near and wished to see him , swept over Garrison 's being . " Here , " he said to Tuttle , " here 's the address on a card . Report to me there at six o'clock to-night . Get out now and go to young Robinson , but not at the house in Ninety-third Street . " " Why not ? " inquired Tuttle . " Its the regular place --  --  " " I 've ordered him not to enter the house again , " interrupted Garrison . " By the way , should he attempt to do so , or ask you to get in there for him , agree to his instructions apparently , and let me know without delay . " " Thank you for giving me a chance , " said Tuttle , who had risen from his chair . " You 'll never regret it , I 'm sure . " " All right , " said Garrison . " Shake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip and bade him " So ' long ! " at the door . A few minutes later , dressed in his freshest apparel , he hastened out to gulp down a cup of strong coffee at an adjacent cafe , then headed downtown for the ferry . CHAPTER XXII A MAN IN THE CASE The hour was just after four o'clock when Garrison stepped from a cab in Hackatack Street , Jersey City , and stood for a moment looking at the red-brick building numbered 937 . It was a shabby , smoke-soiled , neglected dwelling , with signs of life utterly lacking . Made wary by his Central Park experience , Garrison had come there armed with his gun and suspiciously alert . His cabman was instructed to wait . Without apparent hesitation Garrison ascended the chalk-marked steps and rang the bell . Almost immediately the door was opened , by a small and rather pretty young woman , dressed in good taste , in the best of materials , and wearing a very fine diamond ring upon her finger . Behind her , as Garrison instantly discerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shabby exterior of the place . " How do you do ? " he said , raising his hat . " Is my wife , Mrs. Fairfax --  --  " " Oh , " interrupted the lady . " Wo n't you please come in ? She hardly expected you to come so promptly . She 's lying down to take a rest . " Garrison entered and was shown to a parlor on the left . It , too , was furnished in exceptional richness , but the air was close and stuffy , and the whole place uncomfortably dark . " If you 'll please sit down I 'll go and tell her you have come , " said his hostess . " Excuse me . " The smile on her face was somewhat forced and sad , thought Garrison . His feeling of suspicion had departed . Left alone , he strode across the room and glanced at a number of pictures , hung upon the walls . They were excellent oils , one or two by masters . Dorothy must have slept lightly , if at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her footfall came to his ear . She came swiftly into the apartment . " Oh , you were very good to come so soon ! " she said in a tone made low for none but him to hear . " I wired you , both at your house and office , not more than an hour ago . " " I got the message sent to the house , " he said . " It came as a great relief . " He paused for a moment , looking in her eyes , which were raised to his own appealingly . " Why did you run away ?  - -  and how did you do it ? " he asked her . " I did n't know what in the world to think or do . " Her eyes were lowered . " I had to -- I mean , I simply obeyed an impulse , " she confessed . In an almost involuntary outburst she added : " I am in very great trouble . There is no one in the world but you that can give me any help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the joy of that instant . How he longed to take her in his arms and fold her in security against his breast ! And he dared not even be tender . " I am trying to help you , Dorothy , " he said , " but I was utterly dumfounded , there in the crush on the bridge . Where did you go ? " " I ran along and was helped to escape the traffic , " she explained . " Then I soon got a car , with my mind made up to come over here just as soon as I could . This is the home of my stepbrother 's wife -- Mrs . Foster Durgin . I had to come over and -- and warn -- I mean , I had to come , and so I came . " He had felt her disappearance had nothing to do with the vanishing of the chauffeur . Her statement confirmed his belief . " Durgin ? " Garrison repeated . " Did n't some Durgin , a nephew of Hardy , claim the body , up at Branchville ? " Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's Foster 's brother . " " You told me you had neither brothers nor sisters , " Garrison reminded her a little sternly . " These were not forgotten ? " " They are stepbrothers only -- by marriage . I thought I could leave them out , " she explained , flushing as she tried to meet his gaze . " Please do n't think I meant to deceive you very much . " " It was a technical truth , " he told her ; " but is n't it time you told me everything ? You ran off before I could even reply to something you appeared to wish to know . You --  --  " " But you do n't suspect me ? " she interrupted , instantly reverting to the question she had put before , in that moment of her impulse to run . " I could n't bear it if I thought you did ! " " If I replied professionally , I should say I do n't know what to think , " he said . " The whole affair is complicated . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you of anything wrong , but you 've got to help me clear it as fast as I can . " She met his gaze steadily , for half a minute , then tears abruptly filled her eyes , and she lowered her gaze to the floor . " Thank you , Jerold , " she murmured , and a thrill went straight to his heart . " I am very much worried , and very unhappy -- but I have n't done anything wrong -- and nothing like that ! not even a wicked thought like that ! I loved my uncle very dearly . " She broke down and turned away to give vent to an outburst of grief . " There , there , " said Garrison after a moment . " We must do the best we can . If you will tell me more , my help is likely to be greater . " Dorothy dried her eyes and resumed her courage heroically . " I have n't asked you to be seated all this time , " she said apologetically . " Please do -- and I 'll tell you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy sat near him . He thought he had never seen her in a mood of beauty more completely enthralling than this one of helplessness and bravery combined . " We are quite , well -- secure from being overheard ? " he said . She went at once and closed the door . " Alice would never listen , greatly as she is worried , " she said . " It was she who met you at the door -- Foster 's wife . " Garrison nodded . He was happy only when she came once more to her seat . " This is your stepbrother 's home ? " he inquired . " Is he here ? " " This is Alice 's property , " Dorothy corrected . " But that 's way ahead of the story . You told me my uncle was poisoned by my cigars . How could that possibly have been ? How did you find it out ? How was it done ? " " The box had been opened and two cigars had been so loaded with poison that when he bit off one , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadly stuff on his tongue -- and was almost instantly stricken . " Despite the dimness of the light in the room Dorothy 's face showed very white . She asked ; " What kind of poison ? " He mentioned the drug . " Not the kind used by photographers ? " she asked in affright . " Precisely . Foster , then , is a photographer ? " " He used to be , but --  --  Oh , I do n't see how he -- it 's terrible ! It 's terrible ! " She arose and crossed the room in agitation , then presently returned . " Your suspicions may be wrong , " said Garrison , who divined she had something on her mind . " Why not tell me all about it , and let me assist , if I can ? What sort of a looking man is Foster ? " " Rather small , and nearly always smiling . But he may not have done it ! He may be innocent ! If only you could help me now ! " she said . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you half suspect it was he ? " " I 've been afraid of it all along , " she said , in an outburst of confession . " Before I even knew that Uncle John was -- murdered -- before you told me , I mean -- I felt afraid that something of the kind might have happened , and since that hour I 've been nearly distracted by my thoughts ! " " Let 's take it slowly , " said Garrison , in his soothing way . " I imagine there has been either anger or hatred , spite or pique on the part of your stepbrother , Foster , towards John Hardy in the past . " " Yes -- everything ! Uncle John spoiled Foster at first , but when he found the boy was gambling in Wall Street , he cut him off and refused to supply him the means to pay off the debts he had contracted . Foster threatened at the time . " The breach grew wider . Uncle did n't know he was married to Alice . Foster would n't let me tell . He had used up nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more , after I took the necklaces , on a loan -- and if Foster does n't get ten thousand dollars in August I do n't know what he 'll do ! " Garrison was following the threads of this quickly delivered narrative as best he might . It revealed a great deal , but not all . " I see , " he commented quietly . " But how could Foster hope to profit by the death of Mr. Hardy ? " Dorothy turned very white again . " He knew of the will . " " The will that was drawn in your favor ? " " Yes . " " And he thought that you were married , that the conditions of the will had been fulfilled ? " Dorothy nodded assent . Garrison 's impulse was to push a point in personal affairs and ask if she had really married some Fairfax , not yet upon the scene . But he adhered strictly to business . " What you fear is that Foster , aware that you would become your uncle 's heir , may have hastened your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in for the property you would liquidate his debts ? " Dorothy nodded again . She said : " It is terrible ! Do you see the slightest ray of hope ? " Garrison ignored the query for a moment . " Where is Foster now ? " " No one knows -- he seems to have run away -- that 's one of the worst things about it . " " But you came over here to warn him , " said Garrison . Dorothy flushed . " That was my impulse , I admit , when you told me about the cigars . I hardly knew what else I could do . " " You are very fond of Foster ? " " I am very fond of Alice . " Garrison was glad . He could even have been jealous of a brother . " But how could Foster have tampered with your cigars ? " he inquired . " Was he up there at Hickwood when you left them ? " " He was there all the time of uncle 's visit , in hiding , and even on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . " Alice does n't know of this , but he admitted it all to me . " " This is what you have been trying to conceal from me , all the time , " Garrison observed . " Do the Robinsons have their suspicions ? " " I ca n't be certain . Perhaps they have . Theodore has exercised a very bad influence on Foster 's life . He intimated once to me that perhaps Uncle John had been murdered . " Garrison thought for a moment . " It is almost impossible for anyone to have had that suspicion who had no guilty knowledge , " he said . " Theodore was , and is , capable of any crime . If he knew about the will and believed you had not fulfilled the conditions , by marrying , he would have had all the motive in the world to commit the crime himself . " " But , " said Dorothy , " he knew nothing of the will , as I told you before . " " And he with an influence over Foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy changed color once again . She was startled . " I never thought of that , " she admitted . " Foster might have told . " " There 's a great deal to clear up in a case like this , " said Garrison , " even when suspicions point your course . I think I can land Mr. Theodore on the things he attempted on me , but not just yet . He may reveal himself a little more . Besides , our alleged marriage will hardly bear a close investigation . " For the moment Dorothy was more concerned by his personal danger than by anything concerning the case . " You told me a little of what was attempted in the park , " she said . " I 've thought about it ever since -- such a terrible attack ! If anything dreadful should happen to you --  --  " She broke off suddenly , turned crimson to her hair , and dropped her gaze from his face . In that moment he resisted the greatest temptation of his life -- the impulse to sink at her feet on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt , as he did , the wondrous attraction between them ; he knew that to her , as to himself , the impression was strong that they had known each other always ; but hired as he had been to conduct an affair in which it had been particularly stipulated there was to be no sentiment , or even the slightest thought of such a development , he throttled his passion and held himself in check . " Some guardian angel must have hovered near , " was all he permitted himself to reply , but she fathomed the depth of his meaning . " I hope some good spirit may continue to be helpful -- to us both , " she said . " What are you going to do next ? " " Take you back to New York , " said Garrison . " I must have you near . But , while I think of it , please answer one thing more . How did it happen that your uncle 's life was insured for that inventor in Hickwood , Charles Scott ? " " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as boys together . Uncle John was saved by this Mr. Scott , when he was twenty-one -- his life was saved , I mean . And he was very much in love with Mr. Scott 's sister . But something occurred , I hardly know what . The Scotts never had much money , and they lost the little they had . Miss Scott was very shamefully treated , I believe , by some other friend in the group , and she died before she was thirty -- I 've heard as a result of some great unhappiness . " Uncle and Mr. Scott were always friends , though they drifted apart to some extent . Mr. Scott became an inventor , and spent all his poor wife 's money , and also funds that Uncle John supplied , on his inventions . The insurance was Uncle John 's last plan for befriending his old-time companion . There was no one else to make it in favor of , for of course the estate would take care of the heirs that he wished to remember . Does that answer your question ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll make ready we will start . Is there any particular place in New York where you prefer to stay ? " " No . I 'd rather leave that to you . " " By the way , " he said , his mind recurring to the motor-car incident and all that had followed , " did you know that when you deserted me so abruptly on the bridge , the chauffeur also disappeared -- and left me with the auto on my hands ? " " Why , no ! " she said . " What could it mean ? " " It seems to have been a stolen car , " he answered . " It was left in charge of a strange young woman , too poor to own it -- left her by a friend . She found it in my possession and accepted my explanation as to how it was I chanced to have it in my care . She is living in a house near Washington Square . " " How very strange ! " said Dorothy , who had suddenly conceived some queer feminine thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps you might take me there . But tell me all about it ! " What could be actuating her woman 's mind in this was more than he could tell . But -- why not take her to that house as well as to any in New York ? " All right , " he said . " It 's a very nice place . I 'll tell you the story as we go . " CHAPTER XXIII THE ENEMY 'S TRACKS On the way returning to Gotham , Garrison learned every fact concerning John Hardy , his former places of residence , his former friends , his ways of life and habits that he deemed important to the issues and requirements now in hand , with Dorothy 's stepbrother more than half suspected of the crime . Dorothy gladly supplied the information . She had been on the verge of despair , harboring her fear and despair all alone , with the loyal desire to protect not only Foster , but Alice as well , and now she felt an immense relief to have a man 's clear-headed aid . Garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for young Durgin at the best , and the fellow had run away . A trip to the small Connecticut town of Rockdale , where Hardy had once resided , and to which it had long been his wont to return as often as once a month , seemed to Garrison imperative at this juncture . He meant to see Tuttle at six , and start for the country in the evening . He outlined his plan to Dorothy , acquainting her with the fact that he had captured Theodore 's spy , from whom he hoped for news . By the time they came to the house near Washington Square , Dorothy was all but asleep from exhaustion . The strain , both physical and mental , to which she had been subjected during some time past , and more particularly during the past two days , told quickly now when at last she felt ready to place all dependence on Garrison and give up to much-needed rest . The meeting of Miss Ellis and Dorothy was but slightly embarrassing to Garrison , when it presently took place . Explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " desired to stop all night in town , rather than go on to Long Island , while he himself must be absent from the city , he readily procured accommodations without exciting the least suspicion . Garrison merely waited long enough to make Dorothy promise she would take a rest without delay , and then he went himself to a hotel restaurant , near by in Fifth Avenue , devoured a most substantial meal , and was five minutes late at his office . Tuttle had not yet appeared . The hall before the door was deserted . The sign on his glass had been finished . Garrison went in . There were letters all over the floor , together with Dorothy 's duplicate telegram , a number of cards , and some advertising circulars . One of the cards bore the name of one J. P. Wilder , and the legend , " Representing the New York Evening Star . " There was nothing , however , in all the stuff that appeared to be important . Garrison read the various letters hastily , till he came to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of the Hardy case , and reminding him that he had reported but once . This he filed away . Aware at last that more than half an hour had gone , without a sign from his man , he was on the point of going to the door to look out in the hall when Tuttle 's shadow fell upon the glass . " I stayed away a little too long , I know , " he said . " I was trying to get a line on old man Robinson , to see if he 'd give anything away , but I guess he 's got instructions from his son , who 's gone away from town . " " Gone away from town ? " repeated Garrison . " Where has he gone ? " " I do n't know . The old man would n't say . " " You have n't seen Theodore ? " " No . He left about five this afternoon . The old man and his wife are stopping in Sixty-fifth Street , where they used to live some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " Nothing , except I had n't seen you again , " said Tuttle . " The old man leaves it all to his son . He did n't seem to care where you had gone . " Garrison pondered the matter carefully . He made almost nothing out of Theodore 's departure from the scene . It might mean much or little . That Theodore had something up his sleeve he entertained no doubt . " It 's important to find out where he has gone , " he said . " See old Robinson again . Tell him you have vital information on a special point that Theodore instructed you to deliver to no one but himself , and the old man may tell you where you should go . I am going out of town to-night . Leave your address in case I wish to write . " " I 'll do my best , " said Tuttle , writing the address on a card . " Is there anything more ? " " Yes . You know who the two men were who knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket . Get around them in any way you can , ascertain what agreement they had with young Robinson , or what instructions , and find out why it was they did not rob me . Come here at least once a day , right along , whether you find me in or not . " Once more Tuttle stated he would do his best . He left , and Garrison , puzzling over Theodore 's latest movement , presently locked up his office and departed from the building . He was no more than out on the street than he came upon Theodore 's tracks in a most unexpected direction . A newsboy came by , loudly calling out his wares . An Evening Star , beneath his arm , stared at Garrison with type fully three inches high with this announcement : MYSTERY OF MURDER AND A WILL ! ! John Hardy May Have Been Slain ! Beautiful Beneficiary Married Just in Time ! Garrison bought the paper . With excitement and chagrin in all his being he glanced through the story of himself and Dorothy -- all that young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the sensational garnishments of which the New York yellow press is capable . Sick and indignant with the knowledge that Dorothy must be apprised of this at once , and instructed to remain in hiding , to induce all about her to guard her from intrusion and to refuse to see all reporters who might pursue the story , he hastened at once towards Washington Square , and encountered his " wife , " almost upon entering the house . She was white with alarm . He thought she had already seen the evening sheet . " Jerold ! " she said , " something terrible has happened . When I got up , half an hour ago to dress -- my wedding certificate was gone ! " CHAPTER XXIV A NEW ALARM Without , for a moment , comprehending the drift of Dorothy 's fears , Garrison led her to a parlor of the house , looking at her in a manner so fixed that she realized their troubles were not confined to the loss of her certificate . " What do you think ? What do you fear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he still remained dumb for a moment . " What shall we do ? " " Theodore threatened that something might occur , " he said . " He has evidently done his worst , all at once . " " Why -- but I thought perhaps my certificate was stolen here , " whispered Dorothy in agitation . " How could Theodore --  --  " " No one in this house could have known you had such a document about you , " interrupted Garrison . " While you were drugged , or chloroformed , in the Robinsons ' house , the old woman , doubtless , searched you thoroughly . You told me your certificate was sewed inside --  --  " " Inside -- yes , inside , " she interrupted . " I thought it was safe , for they put a blank paper in its place , and I might not have thought of anything wrong if I had not discovered a black thread used instead of the white silk I had been so careful to employ . " " There is ample proof that Theodore has utilized his wits to good advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of what he has achieved . This paper contains all the story -- suggesting that your uncle may have been murdered , and telling the conditions of the will . " He held up the paper before her startled eyes , and saw the look of alarm that came upon her . " Printed -- in the paper ! " she exclaimed in astonishment and utter dismay . " Why , how could such a thing happen ? " She took the paper and scanned the story hurriedly , making exclamations as she read . " Theodore -- more of Theodore , " said Garrison . " From his point of view , and with all his suspicions concerning our relationship , it is a master-stroke . It renders our position exceedingly difficult . " " But -- how could he have found out all these things ? " gasped Dorothy . " How could he know ? " " He has guessed very shrewdly , and he has doubtless pumped your stepbrother of all that he happened to know . " " What shall we do ? " she repeated hopelessly . " We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for probate ? " " I 'll land him in prison , if he does n't pull out of it now , " said Garrison , angered as much by Theodore 's diabolical cleverness as he was by this premature publicity given to the story . " He has carried it all with a mighty high hand , assured of our fear to take the business into court . He has stirred up a fight that I do n't propose to lose !  - -  a fight that has roused all the red-hot Crusader of my being ! " " But -- what shall we do ? All the newspaper people will be digging at the case and doing their best to hunt up everyone concerned ! " " No reporters can be seen . If the fact leaks out that you are here , through anyone connected with the house , you must move at once , and change your name , letting no one but me know where you are . " She looked at him blankly . " Alone ? Ca n't you help me , Jerold ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was before , " he answered . " I must work night and day to clear things up about the murder . " " But -- if Foster should really be guilty ? " " He 'll be obliged to take his medicine -- otherwise suspicion might possibly rest upon you . " " Good Heavens ! " She was very pale . " This story in the Star has precipitated everything , " he added . " Already it contains a hint that you and your ' husband ' are the ones who benefit most by the possible murder of John Hardy . " She sank on a chair and looked at him helplessly . " I suppose you 'll have to go -- but I do n't know what I shall do without you . How long do you think you 'll be away ? " " It is quite impossible to say . I shall return as soon as circumstances permit . I 'll write whenever I can . " " I shall need some things from the house , " she said . " I have absolutely nothing here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you can , " he instructed . " Reporters will be sure to haunt the house in Ninety-third Street , hoping to see us return . " " It 's horrible ! " said Dorothy . " It almost makes me wish I had never heard of any will ! " Garrison looked at her with frank adoration in his eyes . " Whatever the outcome , I shall always be glad , " he said --  " glad of the day you needed -- needed assistance -- glad of the chance it has given me to prove my -- prove my -- friendship . " " I 'll try to be worthy of your courage , " she answered , returning his look with an answering glance in which the love-light could only at best be a trifle modified . " But -- I do n't see how it will end . " " About this marriage certificate --  --  " he started , when the door-bell rang interruptingly . In fear of being overheard by the landlady , already attending a caller , Garrison halted , to wait . A moment later the door was opened by the lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was ushered in . The room was the only one in the house for this semi-public use . " Excuse me , " said the landlady sweetly . " Someone to see Miss Ellis . " The visitor bowed very slightly to Dorothy and Garrison , and stood somewhat awkwardly near the door , with his hat in his hand . The landlady , having made her excuses for such an intrusion , disappeared to summon Miss Ellis . Garrison was annoyed . There was nothing to do but to stand there in embarrassing silence . Then Miss Ellis came shyly in at the door , dressed so becomingly that it seemed not at all unlikely she had hoped for the evening 's visitor . " Oh , Mr. Hunter , this is a very pleasant surprise ! " she said . " Allow me to introduce my friends , Mr. and Mrs. Fairfax . " She added to Garrison and Dorothy , " This is Mr. Hunter , of the New York Star . " Prepared to bow and let it go at that , Garrison started , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hunter , on his part , meeting strangers unexpectedly , appeared to be diffident and quite conventional , but pricked up his ears , which were strung to catch the lightest whisper of news , at the mention of the Fairfax name . " Not the Fairfax of the Hardy case ? " he said , for the moment intent on nothing so moving as a possible service to his paper . " Of course you 've seen --  --  " Garrison sat down on the copy of the Star which Dorothy had left in a chair . He deftly tucked it up beneath his coat . " No , oh , no , certainly not , " he said , and pulling out his watch , he added to Dorothy , " I shall have to be going . Put on your hat and come out for a two-minute walk . " Then , to the others : " Sorry to have to run off in this uncomplimentary fashion , but I trust we shall meet again . " Hunter felt by instinct that this was the man of all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not insist upon his calling in such a situation , however , and Garrison and Dorothy , bowing as they passed , were presently out in the hall with the parlor door closed behind them . In half a minute more they were out upon the street . " You 'll be obliged to find other apartments at once , " he said . " You 'd better not even go back to pay the bill . I 'll send the woman a couple of dollars and write that you made up your mind to go along home , after all . " " But -- I wanted to ask a lot of questions -- of Miss Ellis , " said Dorothy , thereby revealing the reason she had wished to come here before . " I thought perhaps --  --  " " Questions about me ? " interrupted Garrison , smiling upon her in the light of a street-lamp they were passing . " I can tell you far more about the subject than she could even guess -- if we ever get the time . " Dorothy blushed as she tried to meet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I only thought -- thought it might be interesting to know her . " " It 's far more interesting to know where you will go , " he answered . " Let me look at this paper for a minute . " He pulled forth the Star , turned to the classified ads , found the " Furnished Rooms , " and cut out half a column with his knife . " Let me go back where I was to-night , " she suggested . " I am really too tired to hunt a place before to-morrow . I can slip upstairs and retire at once , and the first thing in the morning I can go to a place where Alice used to stay , with a very deaf woman who never remembers my name and always calls me Miss Root . " " Where is the place ? " said Garrison , halting as Dorothy halted . " In West Eighteenth Street . " She gave him the number . " It will look so very queer if I leave like this , " she added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " he replied , taking out a booklet and jotting down " Miss Root , " and the address she had mentioned . " I 'll write to you in the name the deaf woman remembers , or thinks she remembers , and no one need know who you are . If I hurry now I can catch the train that connects with the local on the Hartford division for Rockdale . " They turned and went back to the house . " You do n't know how long you 'll be gone ? " she said as they neared the steps . " You can not tell in the least ? " " Long enough to do some good , I hope , " he answered . " Meantime , do n't see anybody . Do n't answer any questions ; and do n't neglect to leave here early in the morning . " She was silent for a moment , and looked at him shyly . " I shall feel a little bit lonely , I 'm afraid , " she confessed --  " with none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be very long . Good-by . " " Good-by , " said Garrison , who could not trust himself to approach the subject she had broached ; and with his mind reverting to the subject of his personal worry in the case , he added : " By the way , the loss of your wedding certificate can be readily repaired if you 'll tell me the name of the preacher , or the justice of the peace --  --  " " I 'd rather not -- just at present , " she interrupted , in immediate agitation . " Good-night -- I 'll have to go in . " She fled up the steps , found the door ajar , and pushing it open , stood framed by the light for a moment , as she turned to look back where he was standing . Only for a moment did she hover there , however . He could not see her face as she saw his . He could not know that a light of love and a mute appeal for forgiveness lay together in the momentary glance bestowed upon him . Then she closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly walked away . CHAPTER XXV A DEARTH OF CLEWS Garrison 's ride on the train was a matter of several hours ' duration . Not only did he read every line of the story in the Star , which he felt convinced had been furnished by young Robinson , but he likewise had time to reflect on all the phases , old and new , of the case in which he was involved . But wander where they would , his thoughts invariably swung around the troubled circle to Dorothy and the topic was she married or not , and if she was ,  - -  where was the man ? He could not reach a decision . Heretofore he had reasoned there could be no genuine Fairfax ; to-night he entertained many doubts of his former deductions . He found it possible to construe Dorothy 's actions both ways . She was afraid to have him search out the man who had written her wedding certificate , perhaps because it was a fraud , or perhaps because there was a Fairfax somewhere , concerning whom something must be hidden . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vengeance he promised himself he would wreak on Theodore , sank into significance in the light of his personal worry . There was only one thing worth while , and that was love . He was rapidly approaching a frame of mind in which no sacrifice would be too great to be made , could he only be certain of winning Dorothy , heart-free , for his own . For more than an hour he sat thinking , in the car , oblivious to the flight of time , or to the towns through which he was passing . He gave it up at last and , taking from his pocket a book he employed for memoranda , studied certain items there , supplied by Dorothy , concerning her uncle and his ways of life . There were names of his friends and his enemies among the scribbled data , together with descriptive bits concerning Hardy 's personality . Marking down additional suggestions and otherwise planning his work to be done at Rockdale , Garrison reflected there was little apparent hope of clearing young Durgin of suspicion , unless one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her Uncle John had long had some particularly bitter and malicious enemy , a man unknown to herself , from whom she believed Mr. Hardy might have been fleeing , from time to time , in the trips which had become the habit of his life . That this constant moving from place to place had been the bane of his existence was a theory that Dorothy had formed a year before . Yet , for all she knew , it might have been young Foster Durgin whom her uncle was trying to avoid ! The train connection for Rockdale was wretchedly timed . What with a long wait at the junction and a long delay at a way station farther out , it was nearly one o'clock when at length his destination was reached and Garrison , with his steel-trap suit-case in hand , found his way to a second-rate hotel , where , to his great relief , the beds were far better than they looked . He had taken the precaution to register as Henry Hilborn , realizing that Rockdale doubtless abounded in acquaintances of Hardy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their own local papers in the morning . He wrote at once to Dorothy , under the name of Miss Root , apprising her of his altered name and his address . In the morning he was early at his work . Representing himself as nothing more than the agent of the New York Insurance Company , for which he was , in fact , conducting his various investigations , at least in part , he rapidly searched out one after another of the persons whose names Dorothy had supplied , but all to little purpose . He found the town very much alive indeed to the news which the Star had blazoned to the world . Hardy had been a well-known figure , off and on , for many years in Rockdale , and the names of the Durgins and of Dorothy were barely less familiar . Garrison 's difficulty was not that the people talked too little , but rather that they talked too much , and said almost nothing in the process . New trivialities were exceedingly abundant . He worked all day with no results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy had , in turn , furnished more names by the dozen , alleging that this man or that knew John Hardy better than the proverbial brother , if possible ; nevertheless , one after another , they revealed their ignorance of any vital facts that Garrison could use . On the following day he learned that Paul Durgin , the nephew credited with having claimed the body of the murdered man , lived ten miles out on a farm , amassing a fortune rearing ducks . Hiring a team , Garrison drove to Durgin 's farm . He found his man in the center of a vast expanse of duck-pens , where ducks by the thousand , all singularly white and waterless , were greeting their master with acclaim . Durgin came out of the duck midst to see his visitor . He was a large , taciturn being , healthy , strong , independent , a trifle suspicious and more than a trifle indifferent as to the final disposal of John Hardy 's fortune . Garrison , at first , found him hard to handle . He had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was being said ; and now that he heard it at last , from Garrison 's lips , he scarcely did more than nod his head . Garrison was annoyed . He determined on awakening the duck-stupored being , unless the task should prove hopeless . " Mr. Durgin , " he said , " the reasons for supposing that Hardy was murdered -- poisoned -- are far more convincing than anyone really supposes -- and suspicion points particularly at a person in whom you may and may not be interested -- your younger brother , Foster Durgin . " A curious white appearance crept all about the smooth-shaven mouth of the duck man . He was not in the least an emotionless clod ; he was not even cold or indifferent , but silent , slow at giving expression to anything but excellent business capabilities . He looked at Garrison steadily , but with dumb appeal in his eyes . The blow had gone home with a force that made Garrison sorry . " How could that be ? " the man inquired , " even with Foster wild ? " " He may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Garrison , with ready sympathy . " It looks as if he had a motive . With his knowledge of photography and his dabbling in the art , he has almost certainly handled poison -- the particular poison used to destroy John Hardy 's life . He was there in Hickwood at the time of the crime . He has gambled in Wall Street , and lost , and now has disappeared . You can see I need your help to clear the case . " CHAPTER XXVI STARTLING DISCLOSURES Durgin sat down on a box , picked up a sliver of wood and began to chew it slowly . He was not a man of rapid thoughts ; and he was stunned . " How did you find out all these things ? " he said . " From Dorothy , partially , and in part from my own investigations . " " Dorothy did n't go back on the boy like that ? " The man was hurt by the thought . " Not at all . She tried to shield him . I came to Rockdale on her account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might have had a motive for the crime . " Durgin pulled the sliver of wood to shreds with his teeth . " I do n't think Foster would have done it , " he said , concealing the pain in his breast . " He 's been wild . I 've lost all patience with his ways of livin ' , but Uncle John was never afraid of Foster , though he was of Hiram Cleave . " " What 's that ? " said Garrison , instantly , alive to a possible factor in the case . " Do you mean there was a man Mr. Hardy was afraid of -- Hiram what ? " " He never wanted me to tell of that , " said Durgin in his heavy manner . " He was n't a coward ; he said so , and I know it 's true , but he had a fear of Cleave . " " Now that 's just exactly what I 've got to know ! " said Garrison . " Man alive , if you wish to help me clear your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can think of concerning Mr. Hardy , his enemies , and everything else in the case ! What sort of a man is this Cleave ? " " A short , middle-aged man , " drawled Durgin deliberately . " I never saw him but once . " " What was the cause of enmity between him and Hardy , do you know ? " " No , I do n't . It went far back -- a woman , I guess . But I hope you wo n't ever say I told that it was . I promised I would n't , and I never did till now . " The big fellow looked at Garrison with honest anxiety in his eyes . " It 's not my business to tell things , " Garrison assured him . " This is a matter perhaps of life and death for your brother . Do you think Mr. Hardy feared this man Cleave would take his life ? " " He did , yes . " " Was it ever attempted before ? " Durgin looked at him oddly . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean , Mr. Hardy told you a little about it , but , perhaps , not all ? " " How did you know that ? " Durgin asked , mystified by Garrison 's swiftness of thinking . " I do n't know anything . I 'm trying to find out . How much did Hardy tell you of a former attempt on his life ? " " He did n't really tell it . He sort of let it out a little , and would n't say anything more . " " But you knew it was this man Cleave ? " " Yes , he was the one . " Garrison questioned eagerly : " Where is he now ? " " I do n't know . " " When was it that you saw the man ? " " A year ago . " " Where ? " " In the village -- Rockdale , " answered Durgin . " Mr. Hardy pointed him out ? " " Yes , but how did you --  --  " " What was the color of his hair ? " Garrison interrupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his hair . " " What did your uncle say at the time ? " " Nothing much , just ' that 's the man '  - -  that 's all , " said the duck man . " And he went away that night -- I guess because Cleave turned around and saw us in the store . " " All right , " said Garrison . " Where 's your brother now ? " " I do n't know . We do n't get on . " " Do you think he knew anything about Mr. Hardy 's will ? " Durgin answered with a query : " Which one ? " " Why , the only one , I suppose , " said Garrison . " What do you mean ? " " Well , there must have been more than one , " drawled the duck man with exasperating slowness . " Foster was down in the first , but that was burned . I do n't think he ever saw the others , but he knew he was n't a favorite any more . " " What about yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave me out . I 've got enough , " was the answer . " We 're no blood kin to the Hardys . I know I was n't in the last . " " The last ? " repeated Garrison . " You mean the last will of Mr. Hardy -- the one in favor of Dorothy , in case she should be married ? " Durgin studied his distant ducks for a moment . " No , I do n't think that was the last . I 'm sure that will was n't the last . " Garrison stared at him fixedly . " You 're sure it was n't the last ? " he echoed . " What do you mean ? " " Uncle John sent a letter and said he 'd made a brand-new will , " answered Durgin in his steady way of certainty . " I burned up the letter only yesterday , clearing up my papers . " " You do n't mean quite recently ? " insisted Garrison . " Since Dorothy got married , " answered Durgin , at a loss to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could make all the difference in the world to the case , " Garrison told him . " Did he say what he 'd done with this new document ? " " Just that he 'd made a new will . " " Who helped him ? Who was the lawyer ? Who were the witnesses ? " " He did n't say . " Garrison felt everything disarranged . And Durgin 's ignorance was baffling . He went at him aggressively . " Where was your uncle when he wrote the letter ? " " He was up to Albany . " Albany ! There were thousands of lawyers and tens of thousands of men who would do as witnesses in Albany ! " But , " insisted Garrison , " perhaps he told you where it was deposited or who had drawn it up , or you may know his lawyer in Albany . " No . He just mentioned it , that 's all , " said Durgin . " The letter was most about ducks . " " This is too bad , " Garrison declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will may be ? " " No , I have n't . " " You found nothing of it , or anything to give you a hint , when you claimed the body for burial , and examined his possessions in Hickwood ? " " No . " " Where was Dorothy then ? " " I do n't know . She 's always looked after Foster more than me , he being the weak one and most in need . " Desperate for more information . Garrison probed in every conceivable direction , but elicited nothing further of importance , save that an old-time friend of Hardy 's , one Israel Snow , a resident of Rockdale , might perhaps be enabled to assist him . Taking leave of Durgin , who offered his hand and expressed a deep-lying hope that something could be done to clear all suspicion from his brother , Garrison returned to Rockdale . The news of a will made recently , a will concerning which Dorothy knew nothing ,  - -  this was so utterly disconcerting that it quite overshadowed , for a time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale concerning this unknown Hiram Cleave . Where the clews pointed now it was utterly impossible to know . If the fact should transpire that Dorothy did , in fact , know something of the new will made by her uncle , or if Foster knew , and no such will should ever be produced , the aspect of the case would be dark indeed . Not at all convinced that Theodore Robinson might not yet be found at the bottom of the mystery , Garrison wondered where the fellow had gone and what his departure might signify . Israel Snow was out of town . He would not return till the morrow . Garrison 's third night was passed in the little hotel , and no word had come from Dorothy . He had written four letters to the Eighteenth Street address . He was worried by her silence . On the following day Mr. Snow returned . He proved to be a stooped old man , but he supplied a number of important facts . In the first place he stated that Hiram Cleave had long since assumed another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acquainted with his business or his whereabouts . The reason of the enmity between him and John Hardy went deep enough to satisfy the most exacting mind . Cleave , Hardy , and Scott , the inventor , had been boys together , and , in young manhood , chums . Hardy had fallen in love with Scott 's sister , while he was still a young , romantic man . Cleave , developing an utterly malicious and unscrupulous nature , had deceived his friend Hardy , tried to despoil Miss Scott 's very life , thereby ultimately causing her death , and Hardy had intervened only in time to save her from utter shame and ruin . Then , having discovered Cleave guilty of a forgery , he had spared no effort or expense till he landed the creature in prison out in Indiana . Cleave had threatened his life at the time . He had long since been liberated . His malicious resentment had never been abated , and for the past two or three years , with Miss Scott a sad , sweet memory only , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid his enemy . A friend of another friend of a third friend of Snow 's , who might have moved away , had once had a photograph of Cleave . Old Snow promised to procure it if possible and deliver it over to Garrison , who made eager offers to go and try to get it for himself , but without avail . He promised to wait for the picture , and returned at last to his hotel . A telegram was waiting for him at the desk . He almost knew what he should find on reading it . The message read : Please return at once . JERALDINE . He paid off his bill , and posting a note to Israel Snow , giving an address , " Care of J. Garrison , " in the New York building where he had his office , he caught the first train going down and arrived in Manhattan at three . CHAPTER XXVII LIKE A BOLT FROM THE BLUE Delaying only long enough to deposit his suit-case at his lodgings , and neglecting the luncheon which he felt he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible haste . The house he found at the number supplied by Dorothy was an old-time residence , with sky-scrapers looming about it . A pale woman met him at the door . " Miss Root -- is Miss Root in , please ? " he said . " I 'd like to see her . " " There 's no such person here , " said the woman . " She 's gone -- she 's given up her apartment ? " said Garrison , at a loss to know what this could mean . " She went to-day ? Where is she now ? " " She 's never been here , " informed the landlady . " A number of letters came here , addressed in her name , and I took them in , as people often have mail sent like that when they expect to visit the city , but she sent around a messenger and got them this morning . " Thoroughly disconcerted by this intelligence , Garrison could only ask if the woman knew whence the messenger had come -- the address to which he had taken the letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but to hasten to the house near Washington Square . Garrison lost no time in speeding down Fifth Avenue . He came to the door just in time to meet Miss Ellis , dressed to go out . " Why , how do you do , Mr. Fairfax ? " she said . " Mrs. Fairfax asked me to tell you , if you came before I went , that she 'd meet you at your office . I felt so sorry when she was ill . " " I did n't know she 'd been ill , " said Garrison . " I was afraid of something like that when she failed to write . " " Oh , yes , she was ill in the morning , the very day after you left , " imparted Miss Ellis . " I know you 'll excuse me , " interrupted Garrison . " I 'll hurry along , and hope to see you again . " He was off so abruptly that Miss Ellis was left there gasping on the steps . Ten minutes later he was stepping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not yet in the corridor . He opened the office , beheld a number of notes and letters on the floor , and was taking them up when Dorothy came in , breathless , her eyes ablaze with excitement . " Jerold ! " she started . " Please lock the door and --  --  " when she was interrupted by the entrance of a man . Dorothy gave a little cry and fled behind the desk . Garrison faced the intruder , a tall , flaxen-haired , blue-eyed man with a long mustache -- a person with every mark of the gentleman upon him . " Well , sir , " said Garrison , in some indignation , " what can I do for you ? " " We 'll wait a minute and see , " said the stranger . " My name is Jerold Fairfax , and I came to claim my wife . " Garrison almost staggered . It was like a bolt from the bluest sky , where naught but the sun of glory had been visible . " Dorothy ! What does he mean ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakly to a chair and could not meet the question in his eyes . " Did n't you hear what I said ? " demanded the visitor . " This is my wife and I 'd like to know what it means , you or somebody else passing yourself off in my place ! " Garrison still looked at Dorothy . " This is n't true , what the man is saying ? " he inquired . She tried to look up . " I -- I --  --  Forgive me , please , " she said . " He's -- He followed me here --  --  " " Certainly I followed , " interrupted the stranger . " Why would n't I follow my wife ? What does this mean , all this stuff they 've been printing in the papers about some man passing as your husband ? " He snatched out a newspaper abruptly , and waved it in the air . " And if you 're the man , " he added , turning to Garrison , " I 'll inform you right now --  --  " " That will do for you , " Garrison interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of business . My services to her have nothing to do with you or any of your claims . And let me impress upon you the fact that her affairs with me are private in character , and that you are here uninvited . " " The devil I am ! " answered Fairfax , practically as cool as Garrison himself . " I 'll inform you that a man needs no invitation from a stranger , lawyer , detective , or otherwise , to seek the presence of his wife . And now that I 've found her I demand that she come along with me ! " Dorothy started to her feet and fled behind Garrison . " Please do n't let him stay ! " she said . " Do n't let him touch me , please ! " Garrison faced the intruder calmly . " I permit no one to issue orders in this office , either to me or my clients , " he said . " Unless you are a far better man than I , you will do nothing to compel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will oblige me by leaving my office . " " I 'll do nothing of the sort ! " answered Fairfax . " Your bluff sounds big , but I 'm here to call it , understand ? Dorothy , I command you to come . " " I will not go with such a man as you ! " she cried in a sudden burst of anger . " You left me shamefully , half an hour after we were married ! You 've been no husband to me ! You have only come back because you heard there might be money ! I never wish to see you again ! " " Well , you 're going to hear from me , now ! " said Fairfax . " As for you , Mr. Garrison , assuming my name and --  --  " He was making a movement toward his pocket , throwing back his coat . " Drop that ! " interrupted Garrison . He had drawn his revolver with a quickness that was startling . " Up with your hand ! " Fairfax halted his impulse . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ghastly pallor overspread his face . His eyes took on a look of supernatural brightness . His mouth dropped open . He crouched a trifle forward , staring fixedly at the table . His hand had fallen at his side . He began to whisper : " His brains are scattered everywhere , I see them -- see **28;2371;TOOLONG ! " His hand came up before his eyes , the fingers spread like talons . He cried out brokenly , and , turning abruptly , hastened through the door , and they heard him running down the hall . Dorothy had turned very white . She looked at Garrison almost wildly . " That 's exactly what he said before , " she said , " when he pushed me from the train and ran away . " " What does it mean ? " said Garrison , tense with emotion . " What have you done to me , Dorothy ? He is n't your husband , after all ? " Dorothy sank once more in the chair . She looked at Garrison appealingly . " I married him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , sat down . His pistol he dropped in his pocket . " Why did n't you tell me this before ? " " I was afraid , " she confessed . " I thought you would n't consent to be -- to be -- what you have been . " " Of course I would n't , " Garrison responded . " What have I got myself into ? Why did you do it ? " " I had to , " she answered weakly . " Please do n't scold me now -- even if you have to desert me . " Her voice broke in one convulsive sob , but she mastered herself sharply . " I 'll go , " she added , struggling to her feet . " I did n't mean to get you into all this --  --  " " Dorothy , sit down , " he interrupted , rising instantly and placing his hand on her shoulder . " I did n't mean it -- did n't mean what I said . I sha n't desert you . I love you -- I love you , Dorothy ! " She turned one hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover her face . " Oh , do n't , do n't , do n't ! " she said . " You have n't any right --  --  " " Forgive me , " he pleaded . " I did n't intend to let you know . I did n't intend to use my position for anything like that . Forgive me -- forget what I said -- and let me serve you as I have before , with no thought of anything but -- earning the money , my fee . " He turned away , striking his fist in his palm , and went across to the window . For nearly five minutes neither spoke . Dorothy , torn by emotions too great to be longer restrained , had controlled her sobs almost immediately , but she had not dared to raise her eyes . She sat up at last , and with gaze averted from the figure against the square of light , composed herself as best she might . " What is there we can do ? " she said at last . " If you wish to be released from your -- your position --  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still looking out on the roofs below . " I 'm in this to stay -- till you dismiss me and bid me forget it -- forget it and you -- forever . But I need your help . " " I have made it very hard , I know , " she said . " If I 've acted deceitfully , it was the only way I thought I could do . " " Please tell me about this man Fairfax , " he requested , keeping his back toward her as before . " You married him , where ? " " At Rockbeach , Massachusetts . " She was businesslike again . " To satisfy the condition in your uncle 's will ? " " No , " the confession came slowly , but she made it with courage . " I had known him for quite a long time . He had -- he had courted me a year . He was always a gentleman , cultured , refined , and fascinating in many ways . I thought I was in -- I thought I was fond of him , very . He was brilliant -- and romantic -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm quite sure now he exercised some spell upon me -- but he was kind -- and I believed him -- that 's all . " " Who married you ? " " A justice of the peace . " " Why not a minister ? " " Mr. Fairfax preferred the justice . " Garrison remained by the window stubbornly . " You said the man is crazy . What did you mean ? " " Did n't you see ? " she answered . " That light in his eyes is insanity . I thought it a soul-light shining through , though it worried me often , I admit . We were married at two in the afternoon and went at once to the station to wait there for the train . He bought the tickets and talked in his brilliant way until the train arrived . It only stopped for a moment . " He put me on , then a spell came over him suddenly , I do n't know what , and he pushed me off the steps , just as the train was moving out -- and said the very thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , deserted . " She told it all in a dry-voiced way that cost her an effort , as Garrison felt and comprehended . He had turned about , in sheer sympathy for her predicament . " What happened then ? " " I saw in a paper , two days later , he had been detained in a town in Ohio as being mentally unbalanced . In the meantime I had written to my Uncle John , while we were waiting at the station , telling him briefly I was married and to whom . The note was posted not five minutes before a postman came along and took up the letters in the box . I could n't have stopped it had I wished to , and it never occurred to my mind to stop it , anyway . " " What did your uncle reply ? " " He wrote at once that he was thoroughly pleased . He had long hoped I might marry someone other than Theodore . He confessed that his will contained a clause to the effect that I should inherit no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married at least one month prior to his death , to a healthy , respectable man who was not my cousin . " I dared not write that I had been deserted , or that Mr. Fairfax might be insane . I could n't tell what to do . I hardly knew what to expect , or what I was , or anything . I could only pretend I was off on my honeymoon -- and wait . Then came uncle 's sudden death , and my lawyer sent me word about the will , asking when he should file it for probate . Then -- then I knew I had to have a sane husband . " " And the will is not yet filed ? " " Not yet . And fortunately Mr. Trowbridge has had to be away . " Garrison pursued the topic of the will for purposes made necessary by his recent discoveries concerning a new one . " Mr. Trowbridge had your uncle 's testament in his keeping ? " Dorothy shook her head . " No . I believe he conferred with uncle 's lawyer , just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where did your uncle 's lawyer live ? " " In Albany . " " Do you know his name ? " " I think it is Spikeman . Why ? " Garrison was looking at her again with professional coldness , despite the fact that his heart was fairly burning in his breast . " Because , " he said , " I learned from your stepbrother , Paul Durgin , near Rockdale , that your uncle made a later will , and we 've got to get trace of the document before you can know where you stand . " Dorothy looked at him with her great brown eyes as startled as a deer 's . " Another will ! " she said . " I may have lost everything , after all ! What in the world would become of Foster then -- and Alice ? " " And yourself ? " added Garrison . " Oh , it does n't make the least difference about me , " she answered in her bravery -- bravery that made poor Garrison love her even more than before , " but they all depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did you find out about Foster ? " " Not a great deal , " Garrison confessed . " This new will business was my most important discovery . Nevertheless , I confirmed your story of a man whom your uncle greatly feared . His name , it seems , is Hiram Cleave . " " That 's the name ! That 's the man ! " cried Dorothy . " I remember now ! He once pinched my face till I cried . " " You have seen him , then ? What sort of a looking being is he ? " " I do n't remember much -- only the horrid grin upon his face . I was only a child -- and that impressed me . You did n't hear anything of Foster ? " " Not of his whereabouts -- quite a bit concerning his character , none of it particularly flattering . " " I do n't know where in the world he can be , " said Dorothy . " Poor Alice ! What are we going to do now , with all these new complications ? " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside from the will , and my work on the murder of your uncle , a great deal depends upon yourself , and your desires . " Dorothy looked at him in silence for a moment . A slight flush came to her face . She said : " In what respect ? " Garrison had no intention of mincing matters now . He assumed a hardness of aspect wholly incompatible with his feelings . " In respect to Mr. Fairfax , " he answered . " He will doubtless return -- dog your footsteps -- make himself known to the Robinsons , and otherwise keep us entertained . " She met his gaze as a child might have done . " What can I do ? I 've depended so much upon you . I do n't like to ask too much -- after this -- or ever --  --  You 've been more than kind . I did n't mean to be so helpless -- or to wound your feelings , or --  --  " A knock at the door interrupted , and Tuttle entered the room . CHAPTER XXVIII A HELPLESS SITUATION Confused thus to find himself in the presence of Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked about him helplessly . " How are you , Tuttle ? " said Garrison . " Glad to see you . Come back in fifteen minutes , will you ? I want your report . " " Fifteen minutes ; yes , sir , " said Tuttle , and he backed from the place . " Who was that ? " said Dorothy . " Anyone connected with the case ? " " A man that Theodore hired to shadow me , " said Garrison . " I took him into camp and now he is shadowing Theodore . Let me ask you one or two questions before he returns . You were ill the morning after I left , and did not go at all to Eighteenth Street . " " I could n't go , " she said . " I tried not to give up and be so ill , but perhaps the effects of the drug that the Robinsons employed caused the trouble . At last I thought you might have written to the Eighteenth Street address , so I sent around and got your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You wired because Fairfax had appeared ? " " Yes , I thought you ought to know . " " How did you know he was here in New York ? Did he call at the house where you were staying ? " " No . He sent a note declaring he would call . That was this morning . Miss Ellis 's friend , of the Star , had an intuition as to who we were , that evening when he called . When I finally requested Miss Ellis to ask him not to print more stories about us , he had already spoken to the editor , and more of the matter had appeared . Since you left , however , I have n't seen a single reporter . " " Fairfax got his clew to your whereabouts from the press , of course . The question now is , where do you wish to go ? And what do you wish me to do -- concerning the role I have filled ? " Dorothy was thoroughly disturbed by the topic . " Oh , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish I could never see that man again ! What do you advise ? " " We hardly know what the situation may require , till we discover more about this latest will , " said Garrison . " Things may be altered materially . If you wish it , you can doubtless manage to secure a separation from Fairfax . In the meantime I would strongly advise that you rent an apartment without delay , where no one can find you again . " She looked at him wistfully . " Not even you ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll have to see me , once in a while , " he told her , suppressing the passionate outcry of his heart , " unless you wish to secure the services of someone who will make no mistakes . " She was hurt . She loved him . Her nature cried out for the sure protection of his arms , but her womanhood forbade . More than anything else in the world she wished to please him , but not by confessing her fondness . However much she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerold Fairfax , with everything precious to guard . By the token of the wound that Garrison had inflicted , she knew that she had wounded him . It could not have been avoided -- there was nothing but a chasm between them . " Please do not make me feel that I have been utterly despicable , " she pleaded . " You have made no mistakes -- in the conduct of the case . I should be so helpless without you . " Garrison knew he had hurt her . He was sorry . He knew her position was the only one possible for a woman such as he could love . He reviled himself for his selfishness . He forced himself now to return her gaze with no hint of anything save business in his eyes . " Dorothy , I shall be honored to continue with your work , " he said . " I mean to see you through . " " Thank you -- Jerold , " she said . Her voice all but broke . She had never loved him so much as now , and because of that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as possible . Meantime , I hope we will soon discover about this latest will . " " I shall do my best , " he assured her . " Let me take you now to the annex elevator , in case anyone should be waiting to see you at the other . Get yourself a heavy veil , and be sure you avoid being followed when you hunt up your room . Take the apartment in the name of Miss Root , and send me word in that name also , just for precaution . Leave Fairfax and the others to me . I may go up to Albany about the will . " He opened the door , but she hesitated a moment longer . " I hope it will all end somehow , for the best , " she said . " It 's very hard for you . " He smiled , but not mirthfully . " It was here in this room I assumed my role , " he said , " and here I drop it . " For a moment she failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How ? " " I 'm no longer even your pseudo-husband . I drop the name Fairfax , with all it might imply . " She blushed crimson and could not meet his gaze . " I 'm sorry if I 've been the cause --  --  " she started . Garrison interrupted . " I 'm glad -- glad of everything that 's happened . We 'll say no more of that . But -- Theodore -- how he will gloat over this ! " " If he finds out Mr. Fairfax is crazy , he could overthrow the will , " suggested Dorothy . " But -- what 's the use of thinking of that , if a new will comes to light ? It 's a dreadfully mixed affair . " She stepped out in the hall and Garrison led the way to the elevator farther to the rear . The chains of a car were descending rapidly . " Please try not to detest the hour I came to see you first , " she said , holding out her hand , " if you can . " " I 'll try , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the conventional time . Glancing up at him quickly she saw a bright smile in his eye . Joy was in her heart . The car was at the floor . " Good-by , " she said , " till we meet again -- soon . " " Good-by , " he answered . She stepped in the cage and was dropped from his sight , but her last glance remained -- and made him happy . CHAPTER XXIX NIGHT-WALKERS Tuttle had returned by the time Garrison came once more to his office . He entered the room behind his chief , and Garrison closed the door . " Well ? " said Jerold , " any news ? " " I got a line on young Robinson , " answered Tuttle . " He 's gone to a small resort named Rockbeach , up on the coast of Massachusetts , but his father does n't know his business , or if he does he denies it . " " Rockbeach ? " said Garrison , who realized at once that Theodore had gone there to search out the justice of the peace who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there still ? " " He had n't come home this morning . " What so long an absence on Theodore 's part might signify was a matter purely of conjecture . There was nothing more to be done but await developments . Whatever young Robinson 's scheme , it might be wholly disorganized by the latest will that John Hardy had drawn . " What about the two dagos -- the fellows who attacked me in the park ? " inquired Garrison . " Have you found out anything concerning them ? " Tuttle replied with a question . " Have n't you seen it in the papers ? " " Seen what ? " " Why , the bomb explosion and the rest of it -- all Black Hand business last night , " answered Tuttle . " One of our pair was killed outright , and the other one 's dying , from a premature explosion of one of their gas-pipe cartridges . They attempted to blow up a boiler , under a tenement belonging to a man they 'd tried to bleed , and it got ' em both . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning newspaper , and placed it on the desk . " Out of my hands , then ; no chance to help send them up , " commented Garrison reflectively , as he glanced through the article . " I 'll keep this , if you do n't mind , " he added . " It may be useful with Robinson -- in helping to warm up his blood . " " I tried to carry out instructions , " said Tuttle , " but I could n't find out where they were till this came out in print . I hope there 's something else I can do . " Garrison thought for a moment . " How many times have you been here to report ? " " Two or three times every day . " " Have you noticed a tall , light-haired man , with a long mustache , around here at all , either to-day or yesterday ? " " If he 's got blue eyes and wears a brown striped suit , he was here this morning and asked me where he could find you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The same . His name is Fairfax . He 's the real Fairfax . He 'll be likely to return . Until Robinson appears again , you can keep your eye on this office , spot Fairfax , and then keep him shadowed for a time . Find where he lives , where he goes , and what he does . " " Anything more ? " " Keep track of old man Robinson , and let me know as soon as Theodore returns . " Tuttle rose as if to go . He hesitated , turning his hat in his hands . " Would it be asking too much if I suggested I need a little money ? " he inquired . " The Robinsons pay with hot air . " " I can let you have twenty-five , " said Garrison , pulling out his rapidly diminishing roll . " That do ? " " Fine , " said Tuttle , receiving the bills . " When shall I --  --  " A messenger boy came plunging in at the door without the slightest formality . " Telegram for Garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait half a minute , Tuttle , " said Garrison , tearing open the envelope , as the boy was departing , and he read the wire almost at a glance . It was dated from Branchville . Come up here as soon as possible . Important . JAMES PIKE . For a moment Garrison failed to remember the personality of James Pike . Then it came with a flash -- the coroner ! Aware at once that the tale of possible murder in the Hardy case had been spread and discussed all over the State , he realized that Pike , and others who had been concerned when John Hardy 's body was found in their jurisdiction , might have come upon new material . " Nothing to add to instructions , " he said to Tuttle . " I shall be out of town to-night , and perhaps a part of to-morrow . " Tuttle took his leave . Garrison paced up and down the office floor for half an hour . He was very much in hopes that word might come from Dorothy as to where she had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was famished . He left at last , went to a restaurant , ate a hearty meal , and returned to the office rather late . On the floor lay a notification of a special delivery letter , to be had at the nearest substation . He was there in the shortest possible time . The letter was from Dorothy . It began " Dear Jerold , " but it merely informed him she had found apartments on Madison Avenue , not far from Twenty-ninth Street . He wrote her a note to acquaint her with the fact that new developments called him at once to Branchville , whence he might continue to Albany , and this , with a dozen magnificent roses , he sent by special messenger to Miss Jeraldine Root . He was still enabled to catch a fairly early train from Grand Central Station . A little after eight o'clock he arrived in Branchville , found James Pike 's real-estate office ablaze with light , and walked in on that busy gentleman , who rose in excitement to grasp him by the hand . " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm awful glad you came . I turned up something in the Hardy case that I think you ought to know . Got a man coming ' round here in fifteen minutes who read up on the murder suspicions and the rest of it , and he saw a stranger , down in Hickwood the night of Hardy 's death , get into Hardy 's room at Mrs. Wilson 's . It just struck me you ought to know , and so I wired . " " Thank you very much , " said Garrison . " I consider this highly important . Who is your man ? " " He ai n't a man , he 's a boy ; young Will Barnes , " amended the coroner . " Most people think he 's just a lazy , no-account young feller , but I 've always said he was growin ' . Goes fishin ' a good deal , of course , but --  --  There he goes , now ! " He ran to the door , through the glass of which he had seen a tall , lanky youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yelled , " come over , the New York man is waiting ! " Young Barnes came slowly across the highway . " I 've got to git some hooks , " he said . " If I do n't get ' em now the store 'll close . " " This is more important than hooks , " answered Pike . " Come in here . Mr. Garrison , this is Mr. Barnes . Will , Mr. Garrison , the New York detective . " Quite unimpressed by Garrison 's personality or calling , Will advanced and shook his hand . Garrison looked him over quickly . " You 're the man who saw a stranger going into Hardy 's room , at Mrs. Wilson 's , the night that Hardy died , I believe ? " he said . " How did you happen to be there ? " " He lives right near , " volunteered Mr. Pike . " I was gettin ' night-walkers , " said Will . " Night-walkers ? " repeated Garrison . " People ? " " Fishin ' worms , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will gits ' em for bait . Goes out with a dark lantern and picks ' em up . " " I see , " said Garrison . " What sort of a looking person was the man who got into Mrs. Wilson 's house ? " " A little shaver , that 's all I could see , " said the youthful angler . The description tallied closely with all that Garrison had heard before of Hiram Cleave , or Foster Durgin . " Very good , " he said . " Did you see what he did in the room ? " " Did n't do nuthin ' but steal a couple of cigars , " informed the disciple of Walton . " He was n't there more'n about a minute . " " But he did steal a couple of cigars ? " echoed Garrison , keenly alert to the vital significance of this new evidence . " Did he take them from the table ? " " Nope . Took ' em out of a box . " " Then came out by the window and departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't you tell anyone of this before ? " " Nobody asked me . " " And he ai n't got no use for Mrs. Wilson , nor she for him , " supplemented the coroner . " But I thought you ought to know . " " Would you know the man again if you should see him ? " Garrison inquired . " Sure . " " Do you know where he went when he left the house , or yard ? Did you follow him at all ? " " No , the night-walkers was too thick . " Garrison knew the lay of the yard at Mrs. Wilson 's . He knew the room . There was no particular reason for visiting the scene again . There was nothing , in fact , to do at all except to visit the dealer in New York who had sold the cigars to Dorothy , and hope for news of Foster Durgin or the speedy arrival of the photograph of Cleave , which the old man in Rockdale had promised . He asked one more question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " said Will , grinning . " He did n't say . " Garrison rose to go . " This is all of the utmost importance . I may be obliged to have you come down to New York -- if I can find the man . But when you come it will be at my expense . " " The fishin 's awful good right now , " objected Will . " I do n't know about New York . " " You can pick yourself out a five-dollar rod , " added Garrison . " I 'll wire you when to come . " Garrison left for Albany at once . He found himself obliged to take a roundabout course which brought him there late in the night . In the morning he succeeded in running down a John W. Spikeman , who had served as Hardy 's lawyer for many years . The man was ill in bed , delirious , a condition which had lasted for several days . Naturally no word concerning the Hardy affair had come to his notice -- hence his silence on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not be seen , and to see him would have been of no avail , since his mind was temporarily deranged . The utmost that Garrison could do was to go to the clerk at his office . This man , a very fleshy person , decidedly English and punctilious , was most reluctant to divulge what he was pleased to term the professional secrets of the office . Under pressure of flattery and a clever cross-examination , he at length admitted that Mr. Hardy had drawn a will , within a week of his death , that Mr. Spikeman had declared it perfect , and that he and another had signed it as witnesses all in proper form . Concerning the contents of the document he was absolutely dumb . No amount of questioning , flattery , or persuasion would induce him to divulge so much as a word of what he had witnessed . Garrison gave up with one more inquiry : " Was the will deposited here in Mr. Spikeman 's vault ? " " No , sir , " said the clerk ; " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrison 's hopes abruptly wilted . CHAPTER XXX OVERTURES FROM THE ENEMY Leaving Spikeman 's office , Garrison walked aimlessly away , reflecting on the many complications so recently developed , together with the factors in the case , and all its possibilities . He was shutting from his mind , as far as possible , the thoughts of Fairfax , Dorothy 's husband , whose coming he had feared by intuition from the first . The actual appearance of a husband on the scene had come as a shock , despite his many warnings to himself . What could develop along that particular line was more than he cared to conjecture . He felt himself robbed , distracted , all but purposeless , yet knew he must still go on with Dorothy 's affairs , though the other man reap the reward . Forcing his mind to the Hardy affair , he found himself standing as one at the edge where things ought to be patent ; nevertheless a fog was there , obscuring all in mystery . Some man had entered Hardy 's room and tampered with Dorothy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance beneficiary , from suspicion , yet was all in his favor . The Hiram Cleave was an unknown quantity . Unfortunately the general description of the man who had entered Hardy 's room tallied closely with Dorothy 's description of Foster Durgin , whom she herself suspected of the crime . He had been in Hickwood , lurking near his uncle for several days . He had since run away and was apparently in hiding . Intending to make an endeavor to seek out young Durgin and confront him with Barnes , who had seen the intruder in Hardy 's room , and intending also to visit the dealer in tobacco from whom Dorothy had purchased her cigars , Garrison made his way to the railway station to return once more to New York . The matter of finding Hardy 's will was on his mind as a constant worry . It had not been found among his possessions or on his person . It could have been stolen from his room . If this should prove to be the case it would appear exceedingly unfavorable for Durgin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aware of something concerning the testament , while Hiram Cleave , if such a person existed , would have had no special interest in the document , one way or another . Another possibility was that Hardy had hidden the will away , but this seemed rather unlikely . Comfortably installed on a train at last , Garrison recalled his first deductions , made when he came upon the fact of the poisoned cigars . The person who had prepared the weeds must have known very many of Hardy 's personal habits -- that of taking the end cigar from a box , and of biting the point instead of cutting it off with his knife , for instance . These were things with which Foster , no doubt , would be well acquainted . And in photographic work he had handled the deadly poison employed for Hardy 's death . Again , as he had a hundred times before , Garrison accused himself of crass stupidity in permitting someone to abstract that cigar from his pocket . It might have been lost : this he knew , but he felt convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dorothy was not the one , he could think of no chance that a thief could have had to extract it without attracting his attention . When at length he arrived once more in Manhattan , he proceeded at once to the shop on Amsterdam Avenue where Dorothy had purchased her cigars . Here he found a short individual in charge of a general business , including stationery , candy , newspapers , and toys , in addition to the articles for smokers . Garrison pulled out his memorandum concerning that box of cigars still in possession of Pike , at Branchville . " I dropped in to see if by any chance you recall the sale of a box of cigars some little time ago , " he said , and he read off the name of the brand . " You sold them to a lady -- a young lady . Perhaps you remember . " " Oh , yes , " agreed the man . " I do n't sell many by the box . " " Did anyone else come in while she was here , or shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He awaited the dealer 's slow process of memory and speech with eager interest . " Y-e-s , I think so , " said the man after a pause . " Yes , sure , a small man . He bought a box just the same . Two boxes in one evening -- I do n't do that every day . " " A man , you say -- a small man . Was he young ? " " I do n't remember very well . He was sick , I think . He had a handkerchief on his face and his hat was pulled far down . " " But surely you remember whether he was young or not , " insisted Garrison . " Try to think . " A child came in to buy a stick of candy . The dealer attended to her needs while Garrison waited . When he returned he shook his head . " So many people come , " he said , " I do n't remember . " Garrison tried him with a score of questions , but to no avail . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagueness that shadowed the figure of the man had not been illumined in the least . Beyond the fact that a small man had followed Dorothy inside the store and purchased the duplicate of her cigars , there was nothing of significance revealed . Disappointed , even accusing himself of dullness and lack of resources in the all-important discovery of his unknown man 's identity . Garrison went out upon the street . He felt himself in a measure disloyal to Dorothy in his growing conviction that young Foster Durgin was guilty . He was sorry , but helpless . He must follow the trail wheresoever it led . He ate a belated luncheon , after which he went to his office . There were two letters lying on the floor , neither one addressed in a hand he knew . The first he opened was from Theodore . It was brief : DEAR SIR : If you can find the time to grant me an interview , I feel confident I can communicate something of interest . Yours truly , THEODORE ROBINSON . His street address was written at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the second . If the first had occasioned a feeling of vague wonder in his breast , the other was far more potently stirring . It read : DEAR MR . GARRISON : I called once , but you were out . Shall return again about four-thirty . Trusting to see you , FOSTER DURGIN . Without even halting to lock the door as he fled from the place Garrison hastened pell-mell to the telegraph-office , on the entrance floor of the building , and filed the following despatch : JAMES PIKE , Branchville , N. Y. : Get Will Barnes on train , headed for my office , soon as possible . GARRISON . As he stepped in the elevator to return to his floor , he found Tuttle in the corner of the car . CHAPTER XXXI THE FRET OF WAITING Tuttle had performed his services fairly well . He reported that young Robinson had returned to town and had lost no time in dismissing him , with a promise to pay for services rendered by the end of the week . Theodore had seemed content with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total absence from his office , and had rather appeared to be satisfied to let the case develop for the present . Tuttle knew nothing of the note on Garrison 's desk from Theodore , and was therefore unaware how his news affected his chief , who wondered yet again what might be impending . Concerning Fairfax there was news that was equally disquieting . He had been here once , apparently quite sane again . He had talked with Tuttle freely of a big surprise he had in store for the man who had hidden his wife , and then he had gone to his lodgings , near at hand , departing almost immediately with a suit-case in his hand and proceeding to the station , where he had taken a train on a ticket purchased for Branchville . Tuttle , uninstructed as to following in a circumstance like this , had there dropped the trail . " What seemed to be the nature of the big surprise he had in mind ? " inquired Garrison . " Could you gather anything at all ? " " Nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenge he had in his mind , or something he meant to do , but he was careful to keep it to himself . " " He said nothing at all of leaving New York ? " " Not a word . " " You are positive he bought a ticket for Branchville ? " " Oh , sure , " said Tuttle . Garrison reflected for a moment . " I rather wish you had followed . However , he may return . Keep your eye on the place where he was rooming . Have you noticed anyone else around the office here -- reporters , for instance ? " " No . The story 's a sort of a dead one with the papers . Young Robinson was gone , and you kept out of sight , and nothing came up to prove any thing . " " You must have been talking to some newspaper man yourself , " was Garrison 's comment . He looked at Tuttle keenly . " I did , yes , sir . One of them saw me here two or three times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the Cable . " Garrison paced up and down the floor somewhat restlessly . " I think of nothing further except for you to keep an eye on the Robinsons , " he said . " Wait a minute . I want you to go to the Ninety-third Street house with a note I 'll give you to the housekeeper , and examine the closet , in the back room , first flight up , to see if an equipment telephone is still in place there , concealed beneath a lot of clothing . " He sat down , wrote the note , and gave it to Tuttle , who departed with instructions to return with his report as soon as possible . The office oppressed Garrison . It seemed to confine him . He prodded himself with a hundred vague notions that there ought to be something he could do , some way to get at things more rapidly . He wondered how far he would find it possible to go with Foster Durgin , and what the fellow would say or do , if confronted with the cold-blooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down he paced , impatient of every minute that sped away bringing nothing to the door . Would Barnes arrive in time , or at all ? Would Durgin fail to come ? Did Dorothy know of his presence in the city ? Everything always swung back to Dorothy . What would she do concerning Fairfax ? What would Fairfax himself attempt to do , so far baffled , but a factor with a hold upon her name and , perhaps , upon her fortune ? And if the thing should all be cleared at last , and come to its end , as all things must , what would be the outcome for himself and Dorothy ? She had told him at the start that when her business ends had been completely served she would wish him to dismiss himself ,  - -  from her life and her memory forever . He smiled at the utter futility of such a behest . It had gone beyond his power to forget like this , though a century of time should elapse . For an hour he paced his cage impatiently , and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened it and looked out in the hall -- to no avail . The moment for young Durgin to arrive was at hand . It was almost time for young Barnes to appear . Tuttle should have made his trip by this . The postman should have brought that photograph from Israel Snow , of Rockdale . Dorothy might at least ' phone . It was maddening to wait and feel so impotent ! His mind reverted to various phases of the case , but lingered most upon the second will -- that might mean so much to Dorothy . Where had it gone ? Had it been stolen -- or hidden ? Some way he felt it was hidden . For some reason , wholly illogical , he thought of Hardy lying dead with those grease-like stains upon his knuckles . What did they mean ? Working out a line of thought about the will , he was halted abruptly by a shadow on the glass of his door . He sat down quickly at his desk and assumed an air of calmness he was far from feeling . At the knock which came he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Wicks . " Oh , how do you do ? " said Garrison , rising from his chair . " Come in . Come in , Mr. Wicks . " CHAPTER XXXII A TRAGIC CULMINATION The grin on the face of Mr. Wicks had apparently deepened and become even more sardonic . He glanced Garrison over in his sharp , penetrative manner , heightened by his nervousness , and took a chair . " Forgotten instructions , have n't you , Garrison ? " he snapped , adjusting his thin wisp of hair . " Where 's your report on the case of Hardy , all these days ? " " Well , I admit I 've rather neglected the office , " said Garrison , eying his visitor with a new , strange interest . " I 've been hard at work . I 've lost no time . The case is not at all simple . " " What 's all this business in the papers ? You mixing up with some niece of Hardy 's , and the girl getting married to save an inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? " " That part is my private affair , " answered Garrison calmly . " It has nothing to do with my work for your company , nor has it interfered in the least with my prosecution of the inquiry . " " Do you mean to say it has n't delayed your reports ? " " What if it has ? I 've had nothing to report -- particularly . " " Yes , you have , " snapped Wicks . " You know it was murder -- that 's something to report ! " Garrison studied the man deliberately for half a minute before replying . What a living embodiment of Durgin 's description of Hiram Cleave he was ! And what could he know of the facts in the case of Hardy 's death that would warrant him in charging that the affair was known to be murder ? " Do I know it was murder ? " he queried coldly . " Have I said so , Mr. Wicks , to you , or to anyone else ? " Wicks glanced at him with a quick , roving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed in the papers , " he answered evasively . " You must have given it out . " " I gave out nothing , " said Garrison , bent now on a new line of thought , and determined that he would not accuse young Durgin by name till driven to the last extremity . " But , as a matter of fact , I do know , Mr. Wicks , that Hardy was murdered . " " Then why the devil do n't you report to that effect ? " snapped Wicks . " Are you trying to shield that young woman ? " Garrison knew whom he meant , but he asked : " What young woman ? " " Dorothy Booth-Fairfax ! You know who I mean ! " " What has she to do with it ? " Garrison inquired in apparent innocence . " Why should you think I 'm shielding her ? " " She 's the likely one -- the only one who could benefit by Hardy 's death ! " answered Wicks , a little less aggressively . " You could see that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't read the papers for guidance , " Garrison observed dryly . " Have you ? " " I did n't come here to answer questions . I came to ask them . I demand your report ! " said Mr. Wicks . " I want to know all that you know ! " Garrison reflected that the little man knew too much . It suddenly occurred to his mind , as the man 's sharp eyes picked up every speck or fleck upon his clothing , that Wicks , in the Subway that evening when they rode together in the jostling crowd , could have filched that poisoned cigar from his pocket with the utmost ease . He determined to try a little game . " I 've been waiting for the last completing link in my chain , " he said , " before accusing any man of murder . You are right in supposing that I have found out more than I 've reported -- but only in the last few days and hours . I told you before that I thought perhaps Hardy had been poisoned . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The poison employed was crushed to a powder , " and he mentioned the name of the stuff . " Used by photographers , " commented Wicks . " Not exclusively , but at times , yes . " " How was the stuff administered ? " " I think in a fifteen-cent cigar . " Garrison was watching him closely while apparently toying with a pen . " Very good , " said Wicks with an air of satisfaction that was not exactly understandable . " I presume you have something to go on -- something by way of evidence ? " " No , " said Garrison , " unfortunately I have not . I had a second cigar which I believe was prepared with the poison , but I committed the blunder of losing it somewhere -- Heaven alone knows where . " " That 's devilish poor business ! " cried Wicks in apparent exasperation . " But you have n't said why you believe the man got the poison in any such manner . On what do you base your conclusions ? " " Near where the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered Garrison , watching the effect of his words . " It contained what little of the powder the victim had not absorbed . " Wicks looked at him almost calmly . " You 've done good work , " he said . " It 's a pity you lost that second cigar . And , by the way , where did you get it ? " Garrison realized that , despite his intended precautions , he had gone irretrievably into disclosures that were fetching the case up to Dorothy or young Foster Durgin . In his eagerness to pursue a new theory , he had permitted Wicks to draw him farther than he had ever intended to go . There was no escape . He decided to put it through . " I got it from a box , at the coroner 's office , " he admitted . " Mr. Garrison , what do you mean by withholding all these facts ? " demanded Wicks sharply . " Where did Hardy get the box of cigars ? " Garrison would gladly have evaded this question , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece . " " This Miss Booth-Fairfax ? " " Yes . " " And you 're in love with her !  - -  masquerading as her husband ! What do you mean by saying you 've not attempted to shield her ? " " Now go slow , Mr. Wicks , " cautioned Garrison . " I know what I 'm doing in this case . It was given to me to ferret out -- and I 'll go through it to the end -- no matter who is found guilty . " " That 's better ! " said Wicks . " You do n't believe it 's this young woman . Who else could have as good a motive ? " Garrison was fighting for time . A sacrifice was necessary . He utilized young Durgin , who might , after all , be guilty . " Miss Booth , or Mrs. Fairfax , has a step-brother , by marriage , " he said . " He has worked at photography . He gambles in Wall Street . He was desperate -- but as yet I have no positive proof that he did this crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where is the man ? " said Wicks . " What 's his name ? " " Foster Durgin . I 'm waiting for him now . He 's fifteen minutes overdue . " " Arrest him when he comes ! " commanded Wicks . " Take no chances on letting him escape ! " " Perhaps that 's good advice , " said Garrison slowly . " I 'll think it over . " " He 's the only one you suspect ? " " Well , there 's one more element , somewhat vague and unsubstantiated , " admitted Garrison . " There 's a man , it seems , who threatened Hardy years ago . He has followed Hardy about persistently . Hardy appeared to fear him greatly , which accounts for his ceaseless roving . This man may and may not have accomplished some long-planned revenge at Branchville . He appears to be somewhat mystical , but I felt it my business to investigate every possible clew . " " Certainly , " said Wicks , whose scrutiny of Garrison 's face had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Garrison focused his eyes on the man across the desk incisively . " Hiram Cleave . " So far as he could see there was not so much as a flicker to show that his shot had gone home . Wicks spoke up , no less aggressively than before . " Where is he now ? " " No one seems to know . I hope to discover -- and report . " Wicks rose and took his hat from the desk . " Except for your negligence in appearing at the office , " he said , " you have done fairly well . Shall you need any help in arresting Durgin ? If you wish it I --  --  " A knock on the door interrupted . A postman entered , met Garrison as he was stepping across the floor , and handed him a thin , flat parcel , crudely wrapped and tied . It was postmarked Rockdale . Garrison knew it for the photograph -- the picture of Cleave for which he had hoped and waited . " Wait just a minute , Mr. Wicks , " he said , backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departing . " This is a letter from a friend who is helping on the case . Let me look it through . I may have more to report before you go . " Wicks sat down again . Garrison remained by the door . He was cutting the string on the package when a second knock on the glass behind him gave him a start . He opened the door . A small , rather smiling young man was in the hall . " Mr. Garrison ? " he said . " My name is --  --  " " How do you do ? " Garrison interrupted loudly , having instantly recognized Foster Durgin , from a strong resemblance to his older brother , and instantly calling out : " Excuse me a moment , Mr. Wicks , " stepped out in the hall and closed the door . " My name is Durgin , " said the visitor . " I called before --  --  " " I know , " interrupted Garrison , moving down the hall and speaking in a voice so low he was certain Wicks could hear nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been expecting you . I want you to do something quickly , before we try to have a talk . I want you to go downstairs , ring up police headquarters and ask for a couple of officers to come as quickly as they can travel . " " What for ? I don't --  --  " " I 've got to arrest the man who murdered your uncle , " said Garrison , using the most searching and startling method at command to put young Durgin to the test of guilt or innocence . " Act first and come back afterward ! " " I 'm with you ! " said Durgin . " Got him , have you ?  - -  what 's his name ? " He was innocent . Garrison knew it , and instantly concluded that the young man before him could hardly have stolen the uncle 's second will . But he had no time for ramifying inquiries . He pushed his visitor toward the elevator and only answered with more urging for speed . He returned to the office , tearing off the wrapper from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before he opened the door . It was Wicks -- not so bald -- not so aggressive of aspect , but Wicks beyond the shadow of a doubt . On the back was written " Hiram Cleave . " Wicks turned upon him as he entered . " I ca n't wait here all day while you conduct your business in the hall , " he said . " Who was the man outside ? " Garrison had grown singularly calm . " That , " he said , " was Foster Durgin . " " And you let him get away ? " cried Wicks wrathfully . " Mr. Garrison --  --  " Garrison interrupted curtly . " I took your advice and sent him to get the police . Good joke , is n't it , to have him summon the officers to arrest the man who murdered his uncle ? " Wicks had an intuition or a fear . He stared at Garrison wildly . Garrison remained by the door . " What do you mean to do ? " demanded the visitor . " Wait a few minutes and see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph of the man who threatened Hardy 's life . And , by the way , " he added , holding the picture with its face toward himself , in attitude of carelessness , " I forgot to say before that a man was seen entering Hardy 's room , in Hickwood , the night of the murder . He extracted two cigars from the box presented to Hardy by his niece , and in their place he deposited others , precisely like them , purchased at the same little store in Amsterdam Avenue where she obtained hers , and bought , moreover , within a very few minutes of her visit to the shop . All of which bears upon the case . " Wicks was eying him now with a menacing , furtive glance that shifted with extraordinary rapidity . He had paled a trifle about the mouth . " Mr. Garrison , " he said , " you are trifling with this matter . What do you mean ? " " Just what I said , " answered Garrison . " The witness who saw the murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now to identify the criminal . This photograph , as I said before , is a picture of the man I think guilty . " He advanced a step , with no intention of abandoning the door , and delivered the picture into his visitor 's hand . Wicks glanced down at it furtively . His face turned livid . " So ! " he cried . " You think you --  --  Get away from that door ! " He made a swift movement forward , but Garrison blocked his way . " Not till your friends the policemen arrive ! " he said . " It was your own suggestion , and good . " " You act like a crazy man ! " Wicks declared with a sudden change of manner . " I 'll have you discharged -- you are discharged ! The case is out of your hands . You --  --  " For the third time a knock was sounded on the door . " Come in ! " called Garrison , keeping his eyes on Wicks , whose face had turned from the red of rage to the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was Pike and young Will Barnes . " That 's the man ! " said the youth on entering , his eyes transfixed by Wicks . " Look at him laugh ! " " I 'd kill you all if I had a gun ! " cried Wicks in an outburst of malignity . " I killed Hardy , yes ! I said I 'd get him , and I got him ! It 's all I lived for , but , by Heaven ! you 'll never take me to jail alive ! " He caught up a chair , ran to the window , and beat out the glass with a blow . Garrison ran to snatch him back , but Wicks swung the chair and it broke on Garrison 's head and he went down abruptly in a heap . There were two sharp cries . Wicks made one as he leaped to his death from the sill . The other came in a woman 's utterance . It was Dorothy , at the open door . " Jerold ! " she cried , and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . He was merely stunned . He recovered as if by the power of stubbornness , with his mind strangely occupied by thoughts of Hardy 's will -- the hidden will -- and the fingers stained with black . When he opened his eyes he was looking up in the sweetest , most anxious face in all the world . " Help me up . Let me go before everyone comes , " he said . " I believe I know where to find your uncle 's will ! " It was already too late . Durgin and two policemen appeared at the open door . CHAPTER XXXIII FOSTER DURGIN Confusion reigned in the office presently , for more of the officers came upon the scene , and people from adjoining rooms helped to swell the numbers . Everyone was talking at once . The form of Wicks , motionless and broken , lay far below the window , on the pavement of an air and light shaft , formed like a niche in the building . Garrison sent Dorothy to her lodgings , promising to visit her soon . There was nothing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was much she should be spared . Pike , young Barnes , and Foster Durgin remained , the two former as witnesses of what had occurred , Durgin by Garrison 's request . All others were presently closed out of the office , and the body of Wicks was removed . The hour that followed , an hour of answering questions , making statements , proving who he was and what , was a time that Garrison disliked exceedingly , but it could not be escaped . Reporters had speedily gathered ; the story would make a highly sensational sequel to the one already printed . The guilt of Wicks had been confessed . Corroborative testimony being quite abundant , and every link in the chain complete , the affair left no possible suspicion resting upon either Scott or any of Hardy 's relatives ; and Garrison and Durgin refused to talk of Dorothy 's marriage or anything concerning the will . The story used before was , of course , reviewed at length . Despite the delays of the investigation immediately undertaken , Garrison managed at last to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of himself and Foster Durgin . As good as his word , he took the disciple of Walton to a first-class dealer in sportsmen 's articles and bought him a five-dollar rod . Barnes and the coroner of Branchville started somewhat late for their town . The evening was fairly well advanced when at length young Durgin and Garrison found themselves enabled to escape officials , reporters , and the merely curious , to retire to a quiet restaurant for something to eat and a chat . Durgin , as he sat there confronting his host , presented a picture to Garrison of virtues mixed with hurtful tendencies . A certain look of melancholy lingered about his eyes . His mouth was of the sensitive description . His gaze was steady , but a boyish expression of defiance somewhat marred an otherwise pleasant countenance . He showed both the effects of early spoiling and the subsequent intolerance of altered conditions . On the whole , however , he seemed a manly young fellow in whom regeneration was more than merely promised . Garrison ordered the dinner -- and his taste was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said at last with startling candor , " it looked for a time as if you yourself were concerned in the death of Mr. Hardy . More than half the pleasure that Dorothy will experience in the outcome of to-day 's affairs will arise from her knowledge of your innocence . " Foster met his gaze steadily . " I am sorry for many of the worries I have caused , " he said , in a quiet , unresentful manner , free alike from surprise or anger . " I 've been trying to do better . You knew I 'd been away ? " " That was one of the features of the case that looked a little suspicious , " answered Garrison . " I did n't care to tell where I was going , in case my mission should fail , " the young fellow imparted . " I went after work -- good , clean , well-paying work -- and I got it . I can hold up my head at last . " A look of pride had come upon his face , but his lip was trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manly , and worthily won , to some considerable extent , was a thing that Garrison felt . He had no intention of preaching and no inclination for the task . " ' Nuff said , " he answered . " Shake . Here comes the soup . " They shook hands over the table . No further reference was made to a personal subject . Some way Garrison felt that a man had come to take the place of a boy , and while he reflected that the fight was not yet absolutely finished , and the bitterness of it might remain for some time yet to come , nevertheless he was thoroughly convinced that through some great lesson , or some awakening influence , Foster had come to his manhood and could henceforth be trusted to merit respect and the trust of all his fellow-beings . Garrison , alone , at nine o'clock , had an impulse to hasten off to Branchville . In the brief time of lying unconscious on the floor when Wicks struck him down , he had felt some strange psychic sense take possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occupied in Hickwood to come into vision , as if through walls made transparent . He had merely a dim , fading memory that when he awoke he had spoken to Dorothy , telling her to help him to go , that the hiding-place of Hardy 's will had been at last revealed . As he thought of it now , on his way to Dorothy 's abiding place , he shook his head in doubt . It was probably all an idle dream . CHAPTER XXXIV THE RICHES OF THE WORLD Dorothy was waiting to see him . She was still excited , still anxious concerning himself . She had quite forgotten his words about the will in her worry lest the blow on his head had proved more serious than had at first appeared . He met her quietly in a large , common parlor -- the duplicate of a thousand such rooms in New York -- and was thoroughly determined to curb the impetuous surging of his feelings . She was wearing a bunch of his carnations , and had never seemed more beautiful in all her wondrous moods of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all he wished , without restraint or conventions , would almost have satisfied his soul . But she gave him her hand with a grace so compelling , and her eyes asked their question so tenderly -- a question only of his welfare -- that riot was loosed in his veins once more and love surged over him in billows . " I was afraid you might not come , " she said . " I have never been more worried or afraid . Such a terrible moment -- all of it -- and that creature striking you down ! If you had n't come I 'd have been so sure you were very badly hurt . I 'd have felt so guilty for all I 've done to jeopardize your life in my petty affairs . " " It 's all right . I was ashamed for going out so easily , " said Garrison , turning away in self-defense and seating himself in a chair . " He struck me so suddenly I had no time to guard . But that part is n't worth another thought . " " I thought it the only part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It came upon me suddenly that nothing I was after was worth the risks you 've been assuming in my behalf . And they may not be ended . I wish they were . I wish it were all at an end ! But Foster is innocent . If you knew how glad I am of that you would feel a little repaid . " " I feel thoroughly repaid and gratified , " said Garrison . " I have told you before that I am glad you came into my existence with your need -- your case . I have no regret over anything that has happened -- to myself . It has been life to me -- life ! And I take a certain pride in feeling that when you come to dismiss me , at the end , I shall not have been an absolute disappointment . " She looked at him in a new alarm . He had purposely spoken somewhat bluntly of his impending dismissal . She had come to a realizing sense that she could never dismiss him from her life -- that to have him near , to know he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive of her life . Nevertheless she was helpless . And he was treating the matter as if her fate were sealed to that of Fairfax indissolubly . What little timid hopes she might have entertained of gaining her freedom , some time in the future , and saving herself , soul and body , for him -- all this he had somewhat dimmed by this reference to going from her ken . " But I -- I have n't said anything about dismissing -- anyone , " she faltered . " I had n't thought --  --  " She left her sentence incomplete . " I know , " said Jerold . " There has been so much to think about , the subject may have been neglected . As a matter of fact , however , I am already out of it , supplanted by your genuine husband . We can no longer maintain the pretense . " The moment Mr. Fairfax and Theodore chance to meet , our bit of theatricalism goes to pieces . We would scarcely dare to face a court , in a will probation , with Fairfax on the scene . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The one thing that remained in her mind at the end of his speech was not in the least the main concern . She looked at him with pain in her eyes . " Has it been nothing but a bit of theatricalism , after all ? " He dared not permit himself to answer from his heart . He kept up his show of amusement , or indifference to sentiment . " We have played theatric roles to a small but carefully selected audience , " he said . " I for a fee , and you -- for needful ends . We might as well be frank , as we were the day it all began . " It was the way of a woman to be hurt . She felt there was something of a sting in what he said . She knew she had halted his impassioned declaration of love -- but only because of the right . She had heard it , despite her protest -- and had treasured it since , and echoed it over in her heart repeatedly . She wished him to say it all again -- all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her know that he loved her more than anything else in the world , but not by spoken words of passion . " I am sorry if I 've seemed so -- so heartless in it all , " she said . " I had n't the slightest intention of -- of permitting you to --  --  " " I know , " he interrupted , certain he knew what she meant . " I have n't accused anyone . It was all my own fault . We 'll drop it , if you wish . " " You have n't let me finish , " she insisted . " I started to say that I had no intention of making you feel like -- like nothing more than an agent -- toward me -- I mean , I had no intention of appearing to you like a selfish , heartless woman , willing to sacrifice the sweetest -- the various things of life to gain my ends . I want you to believe that I -- I 'd rather you would n't call it all just mere theatrics . " Garrison gripped his chair , to restrain the impulse to rise and take her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in his heart must lie there , dumb and all but hopeless . " Dorothy , " he said when he felt his mastery complete , " I have already made it hard enough for myself by committing a folly against which you gave me ample warning . I am trying now to redeem myself and merit your trust and regard . " Her eyes met his in a long , love-revealing look -- a look that could bridge all the gulfs of time and the vast abyss of space itself -- and words would have been but a jar . Whatever the outcome , after this , nothing could rob them of the deep , supernal joy that flashed there between them for a moment . Even when her lashes fell , at last , the silence was maintained . After a time Garrison spoke again , returning to earth and the unfinished labor before him . " I must go , " he said , consulting his watch . " I hope to catch a train for Branchville in order to be there early in the morning . " " On our -- this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to raise her hopes -- or perhaps her fears -- by announcing he felt he should find John Hardy 's latest will . Moreover , he had undergone a wakeful man 's distrust of the " dream " he had experienced after falling at the hands of Wicks . He resorted to a harmless deceit , which , after all , was not entirely deceitful . " Mr. Fairfax left for Branchville -- he said to spring a surprise , " he imparted . " I thought it would do no harm to be on hand and prepare for his moves , as far as possible . " He had risen . Dorothy did likewise . A slight suggestion of paleness overspread her face , followed at once by a faint , soft flush of color . " I hope you will try to avoid him -- avoid anything that might be dangerous , " she faltered . " I feel already I shall never be able to forgive myself for the dangers into which I have sent you . " " This is the surest way to avoid any possible dangers , " he assured her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular reason now why you should longer remain away from Ninety-third Street . The newspaper men have done their worst , and the Robinsons will be entirely disarmed by the various events that have happened -- unless Theodore should happen to spring a new surprise , and in any event you might be far more comfortable . " " Perhaps I will return -- some time to-morrow , " she said . " I 'll see . " Garrison went to the door and she walked at his side . He merely said : " Good-night -- and Heaven bless you , Dorothy . " She answered : " Good-night , Jerold , " and gave him her hand . He held it for a moment -- the riches of the world . And when he had gone they felt they had divided , equally , a happiness too great for terrestrial measurement . CHAPTER XXXV JOHN HARDY 'S WILL Garrison slept the sleep of physical exhaustion that night in Branchville . The escape from New York 's noise and turmoil was welcome to his weary body . He had been on a strain day after day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the mystery concerning Hardy 's death , he felt entitled to a let-down of the tension . In the morning he was early on the road to Hickwood -- his faculties all eagerly focused on the missing will . He felt it might all prove the merest vagary of his mind -- his theory of his respecting old Hardy and this testament . But stubbornly his mind clung fast to a few important facts . Old Hardy had always been secretive , for Dorothy had so reported . He had carried his will away with him on leaving Albany . It had not been stolen -- so far as anyone could know . Coupled with all this was the fact that the dead man 's hands ' had been stained upon the knuckles -- stained black , with a grimy something hard to wash away -- perhaps the soot , the greasy , moldy old soot of a chimney , encountered in the act of secreting the will , and later only partially removed . It seemed as clear as crystal to the reasoning mind of Garrison as he hastened along on the road . He passed the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that the man , being innocent , must be paid his insurance now without delay . Mrs. Wilson was working in her garden , at the rear of the house , when Garrison arrived . She was wonderfully pleased to see him . She had read the papers -- which Garrison had not -- and discovered what a truly remarkable personage he was . The credit of more than ordinarily clever work had been meted out by the columnful , and his name glared boldly from the vivid account of all he had done in the case . All this and more he found himself obliged to face at the hands of Mrs. Wilson , before he could manage to enter the house and go as before to Hardy 's room . It was just precisely as he had seen it on his former visit . It had not been rented since , partially on account of the fact that Hardy 's fate had cast an evil shadow upon it . Garrison lost no time in his search . He followed his theory . It led him straight to the fireplace , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind this , he felt , should be the will . The board was stuck . Mrs. Wilson hastened to her sitting-room to fetch a screwdriver back to pry it out . Garrison gave it a kick , at the bottom , in her absence , thus jarring it loose , and the top fell forward in his hand . He put his hand far up , inside the chimney -- and on a ledge of brick , where his knuckles picked up a coating of moldy , greasy soot , his fingers encountered an envelope and knocked it from its lodgment . It fell on the fender at the bottom of the place . He caught it up , only taking time to note a line , " Will of John Hardy , " written upon it -- and , cramming it into his pocket , thrust the board back into place as Mrs. Wilson entered at the door . It was not with intent to deceive the good woman that he had thus abruptly decided to deny her the knowledge of his find , but rather as a sensible precaution against mere idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she pried the board from place , and nothing was discovered behind it , he thanked her profusely , made a wholly perfunctory examination of the room , and presently escaped . Not until he found himself far from any house , on the road he was treading to Branchville , did he think of removing the package from his pocket . He found it then to be a plain white envelope indorsed with this inscription : Last will of John Hardy . To be opened after my death , and then by my niece , Dorothy Fairfax , only . Denied the knowledge whether it might mean fortune or poverty to the girl he loved , and feeling that , after all , his labors might heap great unearned rewards on Fairfax , bestowing on himself the mere hollow consciousness that his work had been well performed , he was presently seated once more in a train that roared its way down to New York . There was still an hour left of the morning when he alighted at the Grand Central Station . He went at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlady knew nothing whatever of her whereabouts . Impatient of every delay , and eager to know not only the contents of the will , but what it might mean to have Dorothy gone in this manner , he felt himself baffled and helpless . He could only leave a note and proceed to his office . Tuttle was there when he arrived . He had nothing to report of Fairfax -- of whom Garrison himself had heard no word in Branchville -- but concerning the house in Ninety-third Street there was just a mite of news . He had been delayed in entering by the temporary absence of the caretaker . He had finally succeeded in making his way to the closet in Theodore 's room -- and the telephone was gone . Theodore had evidently found a means to enter by the stairs at the rear , perhaps through the house next door . The caretaker felt quite certain he had not set foot inside the door since Garrison issued his orders . Garrison wrote a note to Theodore , in reply to the one received the day before , suggesting a meeting here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take that out , " he said to Tuttle , " and send it by messenger . Then return to the house where Fairfax had his room and see if there 's any news of him . " Tuttle opened the door to go just as Dorothy , who had arrived outside , was about to knock . Garrison beheld her as she stepped slightly back . He rose from his seat and hastened towards her . " Excuse me , " said Tuttle , and he went his way . " Come in , " said Garrison . " Come in , Dorothy . I 've been at your house and missed you . " She was somewhat pale . " Yes , I could n't stay -- I wanted to see you the moment you returned , " she told him . " Theodore has found my address , I do n't know how , and sent me a note in which he says he has something new -- some dreadful surprise --  --  " " Never mind Theodore , " Garrison interrupted . " Sit down and get your breath . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean , that we do not already know . In the meantime , get ready for news -- I ca n't tell what sort of news , but -- I 've found your uncle 's latest will ! " Dorothy made no attempt to speak for a moment . Her face became almost ashen . Then it brightened . Alarm went from her eyes and she even mustered a smile . " It does n't make a great deal of difference now , whatever Uncle John may have done , " she said . " Foster and Alice will be all right -- but , where did you find it ? Where has it been ? " " I found it at the room he occupied in Hickwood -- and fetched it along . " He produced it from his pocket and placed it in her hand . Despite her most courageous efforts she was weak and nervously excited . Her hands fairly trembled as she tore the envelope across . " Take it calmly , " said Garrison . " Do n't be hurried . " She could make no reply . She drew the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it rapidly . " Dear Uncle John ! " she presently said , in a voice that all but broke . " He has willed it all to me , with no conditions -- all except a nice little sum for Foster -- poor Foster , I 'm so glad ! " She broke down and cried . Garrison said nothing . He went to the window and let her cry it out . She was drying her eyes , in an effort to regain her self-control , when someone knocked and immediately opened the door . Garrison turned . Dorothy had risen quickly to her feet . It was Theodore who stood in the doorway . He had come before Garrison 's note could be delivered . " Come in , " said Garrison . " You 're just the man I wish to see . " CHAPTER XXXVI GARRISON 'S VALUED FRIEND Dorothy , catching up the precious will , had retreated from Theodore 's advance . She made no effort to greet him , even with so much as a nod . " I thought I might possibly find you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , striding in boldly , with no sign of removing his hat . " Seems I hit it off about right . " " Charmingly , " said Garrison . " Wo n't you sit down and take off your hat and stay a while ? " " You sound cheerful , " said Theodore , drawing forth a chair and seating himself in comfort . " Perhaps you realize the game is up at last . " " Yes , " agreed Garrison . " I think we do -- but it 's good of you to come and accept our notice , I 'm sure . " " I did n't come to accept notice -- I came to give it , " said young Robinson self-confidently . " I 've recently returned from Rockbeach , where I went to investigate your so-called marriage . " He had seen or heard nothing of Fairfax ; that was obvious . " Well ? " said Garrison . " Proceed . " " That 's about enough , ai n't it ? " said Theodore . " The marriage having been a fraud , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care to fix it up on decent terms , I 'll make no attempt to break the will when it comes up for probate , but otherwise I 'll smash your case to splinters . " " You 've put it quite clearly , " said Garrison . " You are offering to compromise . Very generous . Let me have the floor for half a minute . I 've had your man Tuttle on your trail , when you thought you had him on mine , for some little time . " I happen to know that you stole two necklaces in the keeping of Mrs. Fairfax , on the night I met you first , and placed them on the neck of some bold young woman in the house next door , where , as you may remember , I saw you dressed as Mephistopheles . You --  --  " " I stole nothing of the kind ! " interrupted Theodore . " She 's got them --  --  " " Never mind that , " Garrison interposed . " Let 's go on . You installed a ' phone in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night when you overheard an appointment I made with Mrs. Fairfax , you plugged in , overheard it , abducted Dorothy , under the influence of chloroform , stole her wedding-certificate , and delivered me over to the hands of a pair of hired assassins to have me murdered in Central Park . " All this , with the robbery you hired Tuttle to commit at Branchville , ought to keep you reflecting in prison for some little time to come -- if you think you 'd like to go to court and air your grievances publicly . " Theodore was intensely white . Yet his nerve was not entirely destroyed . " All this wo n't save your bacon , when I turn over all my affidavits , " he said . " The property wo n't go to you when the will 's before the court . The man who married you in Rockbeach was no justice of the peace , and you know it , Mr. Jerold Garrison . You assumed the name of Fairfax and hired a low-down political heeler , who had n't been a justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry you to Dorothy . " I 've got the affidavits . If you think that 's going to sound well in public -- if you think it 's pleasant to Dorothy now to know what a blackguard you are , why let 's get on the job , both of us flinging the mud ! " Dorothy was pale and tense with new excitement . " Wait a minute , please , " said Garrison . " You say you have legal affidavits that the man who performed that marriage ceremony was a fraud , paid to act the part ?  - -  that the marriage was a sham -- no marriage at all ? " " You know it was n't ! " Theodore shouted at him triumphantly , pulling legal-looking papers from his pocket . " And you were married to another wretched woman at the time . Let Dorothy try to get some joy out of that , if she can -- and you , too ! " " Thank you , I 've got mine , " said Garrison quietly . " You 're the very best friend I 've seen for weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a lunatic , somewhere between here and up country , at this moment . He was here in town for a couple of days , and I thought you might have met him . " " You -- what do you mean ? " demanded Theodore . " Just what I say , " said Garrison . " I 'll pay you five hundred dollars for your affidavits , if they 're genuine , and you may be interested to know , by the way of news , that a later will by your step-uncle , John Hardy , has come to light , willing everything to Dorothy -- without conditions . You wasted time by going out of town . " " A new will !  - -  I refuse to believe it ! " said Robinson , weak with apprehension . Garrison drew open a drawer of his desk and took out a loaded revolver . He knew his man and meant to take no risk . Crossing to Dorothy , he took the will from her hand . " This is the document , " he said . " Signed and witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving town , let me suggest that you might avoid a somewhat unhealthily close confinement by making your residence a good long way from Manhattan . " Robinson aged before their very eyes . The ghastly pallor remained on his face . His shoulders lost something of their squareness . A muscle was twitching about his mouth . His eyes were dulled as he tried once more to meet the look of the man across the desk . He knew he was beaten -- and fear had come upon him , fear of the consequences earned by the things he had done . He had neither the will nor the means to renew the fight . Twice his lips parted , in his effort to speak , before he mastered his impotent rage and regained the power to think . He dropped his documents weakly on the desk . " I 'll take your five hundred for the papers , " he said . " How much time will you give me to go ? " " Two days , " said Garrison . " I 'll send you a check to-morrow morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knocked on the door and entered . Startled thus to find himself face to face with Robinson , he hesitated where he stood . " So , " said Theodore with one more gasp of anger , " you sold me out , did you , Tuttle ? I might have expected it of you ! " Tuttle would have answered , and not without heat . Garrison interposed . " It 's all right , Tuttle , " he said . " Robinson knows when he 's done . I told him you were in a better camp . Any news of Mr. Fairfax for us all ? " " It 's out in the papers , " said Tuttle in reply , taking two copies of an evening edition from his pocket . " It seems a first wife of Mr. Fairfax has nabbed him , up at White Plains . But he 's crazy , so she 'll put him away . " For the first time in all the scene Dorothy spoke . She merely said , " Thank Heaven ! " CHAPTER XXXVII A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer charms return . August had laid a calming hand on all the gray Atlantic , dimpling its surface with invitations to the color and glory of the sky . The world turned almost visibly here , in this vast expanse of waters , bringing its meed of joys and sorrows to the restless human creatures on its bosom . Jerold and Dorothy , alone at last , even among so many passengers , were four days deep in their honeymoon , with all the delights of Europe looming just ahead . There was nothing left undone in the case of Hardy . Scott had been paid his insurance ; the Robinsons had fled ; Foster Durgin and his wife were united by a bond of work and happiness ; the house in Ninety-third Street was rented , and Fairfax was almost comfortable at a " sanatorium " where his wife came frequently to see him . With their arms interlocked , Dorothy and Jerold watched the sun go down , from the taffrail of the mighty ocean liner . When the moon rose , two hours later , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a shadow , built for two , they paused in their perfect understanding . She put her arms about his neck and gave him a kiss upon the lips . His arms were both about her , folding her close to his breast . " It 's such a rest to love you all I please , " she whispered . " It was very , very hard , even from the first , to keep it from telling itself . " Such is the love that glorifies the world . THE END
