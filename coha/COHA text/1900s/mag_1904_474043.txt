BURKE and Warren Hastings stand out in English history as the two most complete and imposing embodiments of opposite principles of politics ? the principle of morality , the principle , in short , that the state has a conscience like any Non-conformist ; and the opposite persuasion that statecraft is the application and balance of forces that are more akin to natural causes than to the specifically human impulses and emotions ? forces which it is possible to adjust within limits , but impossible to initiate or to destroy . Recent events have disclosed once more and excited the old antagonism of ideal and outlook which is summed up and symbolized in Hastings and Burke . Are we to think first of humanity or of ourselves ? Burke as a practical influence is remembered for what he might have prevented in America , for what he fruitlessly endeavored to fortify and restore in France , and lastly in the present case for the attempt to discredit and destroy one of the greatest constructive powers in English history . And if politicians of this stamp loom large in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the custom of government by debate tends to exalt the talker , and the historians naturally follow suit . Now and then a discordant . note makes itself heard ; but the exceptions are not more than suffice to prove the rule . To employ Mr. Gladstone 's contrast , the voice of : Metternich has certainly been less audible than the bark without bite , the tres bien of Lord John Russell . If only for its rarity the following utterance of D'Isradi is worth preserving ; but it is in the strange tongue of the alien who from without saw most of the game : " I have had some experience of public life , and during that time I have seen a great deal done and more pretended by what are called moral ' means ; and , being naturally of a thoughtful temperament , I have been induced to analyze what moral means are . I will tell you what I have found them to consist of . I have found them to consist of three qualities ? enormous lying , inexhaustible boasting , intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated by genius , and it has not suffered either in tone or in bulk for the absence of competing partialities . There is no occasion to reenter the ground of details well known through the gossip of Miss Burney and the grandiose picture of Macaulay . But the letter here for the first time published introduces a note that it is not so easy to catch for the echoes of the orators and the disputations of their backers . We have the celebrated performances of Burke and Sheridan judged at the time by Hastings himself . What he says of Sheridan is instructive over against the view of Pitt , who , it is needless to say , dragged the ancients into comparison , and of Burke , who pronounced Sheridan 's to be " the true style , something between poetry and prose , but better than either " ; though , with due deference to those who in the eighteenth century talked about Greek more fluently then they read it , nothing can be conceived less like , for example , Demosthenes than the true style as here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been secretary to Hastings in India , where he remained during the seven years of the trial for the purpose of collecting petitions in favor of Hastings from the natives . It is preserved at Nottell Priory among the papers of Lord St. Oswald , by whose permission it is printed here : MY DEAR THOMPSON Your letters of the 18th of Deer . &; 12th February have freed me from a great deal of painful anxiety on your account , &; afforded me much satisfaction , though not unmixed , on my own . I ain not oversanguine ; and if the Rodney , wch I understand is to be the last Dispatch from Bengal of the Season , should disappoint me of the expected Testimonials , I am prepared for the Disappointment . I shall less feel its effect on my present Interests than the Baseness or Indifference of those to whom I shall impute it as the greatest Benefits which I can derive from the successful termination of this Commission will affect me less ( I think so , and am almost sure that it will ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninfluenced attachment of a generous People , and primarily to the enthusiastic activity of genuine Friendship . To you , my dear Thompson , I acknowledge this obligation , whatever may have been the concluding events of your Exertions . I approve the caution of Lord Cornwallis. 1 try to suspend my Judgment on the conduct of Mr Shore : but I can not think with temper of the meanness of Jonathan Duncan , or the unmerited discountenance of the Zemidarry Collectors . T suspect the cause of Prannkiston 's Coldness , but no cause can acquit him , 1 almost suspect that the govt will not have chosen to be the channel of conveying ye Deeds , when they were presented . Bayed deed. * After all what have I to do with these external memorials ? I am what I am , whether the whole Universe combine to applaud or to condemn me . And though the most complete acquittal should close ye present Trial , my Reputation will still be blasted by Writers yet unborn , and will continue to be so as long as the Events which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the History of this Country . Take the following Epitome of the trial to its latest Period . It commenced on the 13th of February . On * This is a Persian phrase . It may he translated " one must be on the lookout. " the 29th it was adjourned to the 10th of April . This is ( I am told ) the first Instance in the history of English Jurisprudence of an Adjournment of a Criminal Trial ; and I am also told that the three last Days of this Adjournment were given as an Accommodation to such of the Lords and managers as . indispensably required them for their attendance at Newmarket . On the 10th of April the Court met , and on the 13th of last month adjourned a second Time for an indefinite period , which can not be well shorter than six months . Thirty-five are the number of sittings . The Prosecution alone has gone no further than to the close of two articles of the charge , which consists altogether of twenty . They talk of going through one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; for it is not the Interest of the managers to let the Trial come to an End , nor perhaps doss the ministry wish it . I know not why . Of the 35 days thus employed 13 were wholly consumed in long speeches , 4 by Mr Burke in the genl. opening , 2 by Messrs Fox and Gray in the opening of the Renares charge , 1 by Mr Anstruther in the close of it , 2 by Adam &; Pelham in ye opening of the Begum charge and four by Mr Sheridan in closing it : ? Iiesides occasional Harangues of considerable length in the intermediate Process . Of these I will send you copies ; though I think you will never bear to read them . I can not yet send them . I have not yet seen the last myself . People admire this as a perfect model of Eloquence , Many think it turgid nonsense , and much of it if fairly reduced to writing certainly is so . If my Judgment of it . may be trusted , it consisted of impudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry &; fallacious applications of the Evidence , which he magnified , and suppressed , as either served his purpose ; of some Wit , but much more buffoonery ; of gross invective , &; foul Language throughout ; many flights of fine Imagination ; much Bombast , &; even unintelligible Declamation ; and Patches of highly wrought Oratory , evidently got by heart , &; of perfect Composition had it borne any just Relation to the subject . I can truly assure you that a few pages of the Spectator , a few Extracts from Sterne 's Sentl Journey , or scraps from Bouffou , inserted at proper Intervals between the application of the Evidence to ye charge , wd compound just such a Speech as the best part of Sheridan 's . Would you know the general character of all the oratory that has been exhibited on this occasion , take it in the following lines , of web I take it for granted you will have the Context : and they are the - finest that mortal Bard has ever sung , in this species of Poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the Art With abuse to bespatter the foe , And shoot it like mud from a cart , With the true ( liceronian flow . " It was strange to hear a man after declaiming against me as a monster much worse than Nero or Caligula ( which he not only affirmed but attempted to prove ) &; roaring with assumed fury at the enormities which I had committed , pass in the transition of a minute to salliesof pleasantry , put on the most comic arrangement of features , and convulse the assembly ( I am sorry to say it ) with laughter , his associates and their partizans who sat behind him , always ( as if by a signal given ) first striking up the chorus . Speaking of Sir E. Impey 's visit to Euenow , notwithstanding the danger which he ran from the pretended rebellion in Gorookpoor , he called him , this giddy Chief Justice , a conceit which excited abundant mirth ; and compared him in his various excursions as they were marked by the dates of the affidavits to Hamlet 's Ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear : closing the allusion with a grave declaration that , " he protested he was almost tempted to exclaim with the young prince in the play : Ha I art thou there , old True-penny ? " Do not think that I exaggerate . What I have recited is , as far as I can trust to my memory , literally true : and true it is also that this Buffoonery met with its portion , and a large one , of applause . In one of his purpurei paani inserted after a declaration on the plea of State Necessity he had got by heart a few compliments to Bd . HeatHeld , but his memory deserting him , he concluded it with a Bull . He admitted the plea in a case where the Hero , like an Eagle seated on the summit of his rock crushed the shrubs which grew on its sides , with his Wings in the defence of her nest , being herself unassailable . And to ridicule the idea of the Begum 's disaffection , and the rebellion excited by her influence , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by two eunuchs , &; quelled by an affidavit . Such is modern eloquence , and there are thousands in this blessed country who prefer Sheridan 's speech to the best orations of Tully or Demosthenes . In length and multitude of words it certainly went beyond all the WARREN HASTINGS 'S ACCOUNT OF HIR IMPEACHMENT. 93 orators of an -- cient or modern times ; for it took up altogether fourteen hours and twelve minutes of time : and when it was finished ( which was elegantly and emphatically announced by these words : " My Lords , I have done " ) some of his zealous Friends clapped their bands to complete the travesty of the Court into a theatre . The Lords ( except Lord Loughborough &; Ld . Derby ) behaved with great dignity , decorum and attention The assembly to which T have alluded consisted of the ladies who in virtue of their rank as peeresses , &; others of both sexes , who as the occasional possessors of tickets ( many of which were purchased at a dear rate ) in number more than a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittance , &; sat with patient expectation and attention , many from 7 in the morning till rl &; 1 in the evening . Of the impression which the past process has mode on the minds of the public you will be better informed by others . I am assured that it is completely for me . I know not . I have a most rooted contempt for my own countrymen , who not only bear to see the fundamental principles of the Law &; Constitution openly violated to gratify the vengeance or policy of two factions in the government with the prosecution of an unprotected individual , but make his sufferings the subject of their entertainment , and the argument of convivial discourse . Had 1 committed murder , or excited a rebellion in the kingdom , the court must have sat from day to day till it had pronounced my Verdict , and my life would have been the forfeit ' of my guilt . Yet on a charge , to which the court have not the power to affix the sentence of death , I have already undergone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three , with an allowance of the same time for my defence as is - taken up in the prosecution , nineteen years more remain for the close of it . The law of England presumes every man , however arraigned , to be innocent , until he is proved to be guilty , and places under the protection of its courts even the most atrocious criminals that are brought before them . Yet the Court before which I have stood has permitted such foul invectives as would he worse than death to many minds to be uttered in its presence unreproved against me , even Moro a single witness was called , or the charge opened to show what I had done to deserve it . Every witness , hut two gentlemen who were thought too irritable for that species of provocation , was abused if he gave testimony in my favour , &; blazoned with panegyric if his evidence tended to criminate me . My counsel had their share of invective , and if they were provoked to repel it were called to order , &; intimations were privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intemperance . I am assured that if on advocate at the Old Bailey was to keep back any evidence which he knew would prove favourable to the prisoner , he would be deemed infamous by others of his profession . But the Managers of this prosecution have sent for every man that they thought capable of giving information upon the various matters of the charge , examined them in secret , WARREN HASTINGS 'S ACCOUNT OF HIS likIPEACHMENT. 95 treated such as would bear it with menaces , &; almost with outrage , set down in the minutes only what could be used against me , suppressing whatever was deposed in my favour ; and such of these only were called for examination before the court as they knew would give testimony against me , or whose testimony they could pervert to that construction , or whom they could intimidate , as in the case of Middleton , and make his embarrassment an argument of my guilt . Others either were not summoned at all , or summoned to attend , but never called . But . I have imperceptibly got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with one conclusion , which , if I am ever put upon my defence , I think to give to my judges : that if any friend of mine shall be hereafter brought to a similar trial , I shall advise him to plead guilty to the charge , to avoid the torture of the process ; since the worst punishment that the Court can inflict upon him will fall short of that which be must suffer to obtain his acquittal ; and to assign that reason for his motive . The world , frivolous as the English world is , will know it to he true , &; the infamy which should attend the sentence will recoil on the accusers , not with much credit reflected on the judges . What would poor Coote have suffered , had he lived to have been placed where I have been ? The three first days would have killed him . I have sustained the trial , as I hope I possess that within me which would support me with equal fortitude under any bodily torture , if the managers should require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no acknowledgment for this to those who have put my patience to such a proof , nor are my wrongs the less for my having shown myself superior to them . I told you , Thompson , before my trial commenced that my accusers should not triumph over me . They have yet no cause , nor shall they . There is one only way in which they can make toe suffer , and that is by the effects of this persecution on Mrs H. 's health , which has been for some time very languid , and her spirits less firm than they were . I am satisfied , my dear friend , with all that you have done , nor can I suggest a single point which remains to be done . I had the pleasure of seeing Mr Anstey in town about two months ago . He was then well . Mrs Hastings desires to be kindly remembered to you . I hope you continue in peace . Happily for you the French with a despised monarch , a feeble administration , and intestine troubles , are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our affairs , or retrieve their own . But their pompous reception of Tippoo 's Embassadors , his precipitancy ( if what we hear of his irruption into the Mar. frontier is true ) the loss of their influence in Holland , which is not yet quite irrecoverable , all together indicate and require that they should begin speedily to exert themselves . If they do , will your governour have the virtue to despise the narrow policy of this country , and act from his own judgment of what will be necessary to its interests in India . I hope he will . If lie dues not , woe to him , and to you all ! Adieu , my dear friend . I have written you nothing ; for I have nothing to write . As to what relates to myself , the little epitome of it which I have given you will receive in full detail from a thousand printed documents . By the blessing of ( led I have one quality of a public character , that my history may be read in a Nation 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people write abusive pamphlets against me in France , as virulently as in England ; and many that justify me in both countries do it upon the assumption of unreal facts , or of principles which I do not avow . I em ever , my dear Thompson , Your most affectionate friend WARREN HASTINGS .
