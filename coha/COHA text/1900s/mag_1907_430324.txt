 |p649  MY friend , President Frost of Berea college , asks , " What is the use of a big country unless you love the whole of it ? " A country that stretches across the continent , that spreads out under the folds of one flag mountain and forest and river and plain , north , south , east , west , is a divine proclamation against provincialism . Yet we travel to Europe for our education , and travel in America to get somewhere . The text of this little sermon is the firm belief of the writer that America is worth traveling in for its own sake , and as the basis of a larger patriotism . There is told a story of an old woman in the hills of Chautauqua county who @# heard from some summer visitors about the wonderful things to be seen in New York city from which they came . " Yes , " said she , " but I do n't see how you can stand it to live so far off . " Neither do I. They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of the people in New York city live very far off . New York is the most provincial town in America . None of them suspect this provincialism , however . Not a great while ago I attended a convention addressed by many distinguished men , among the rest by one from New York city . And this gentleman , speaking in Chicago , and stating in his preface that this was his  |p650  first journey to what he called " the west , " chose for his topic , " The religious and educational life of the west . " It was a paper full of accurate statistics , and its diction was excellent . But that man supposed that he could learn what he needed to know and tell in such an address from the census reports ! Not that New York has a monopoly of provincialism . It is possible to be provincial anywhere . But the least provincial community is that through which a stream of settlers ' wagons , moving out on the frontier , brings not only news but life every day into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prairie schooner has an antidote for provincialism wholly unknown to him who travels in Pullmans , monotonously alike , and eats in first-class hotels , each one much like all the others . It is provincial to go abroad before going well over America . It is evidence of a narrow and shallow patriotism that people near either coast have their faces set oceanward rather than landward . A large company of Americans was camping through Palestine , a thing very well worth doing . They pitched their tents outside the city on Jenin , on the borders of Samaria and Galilee . That city is the capital of a little province , and the governor sent his son and one or two other officials to bring greetings to the visitors . In an hour we sent a deputation to return the salutation . While we were drinking coffee with the governor , and learning a little something of oriental diplomacy , the governor 's wife held a reception to some of the ladies of our party . They got on somewhat slowly in the way of conversation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had they no homes ? " To her it was inconceivable that people who had any abiding place should be globe-trotting in tents after the manner of the Bedouins . And they were not able to make her understand that they really had left good homes to go sky-rocketing about the world after this fashion . Over and over again it has occurred to me that the Turkish woman asked a very sensible question . I have crossed the track of wealthy Americans in various parts of the world , traveling with little interest in anything but the hotels , which were practically the duplicate of those we have at home , and putting up with all manner of inconvenience for the sake of getting rid of their money and their democratic ideas , and I have asked , " Have these people no homes ? " And then I have passed along the streets of our fashionable residential districts , and seen house after house inhabited by caretakers , janitors and housemaids and I have said , " No , they have no homes ; these are the homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we Americans . It is in the blood , as in that of the wild duck . It sends us wandering over the face of the earth , restless as Noah 's dove . It is not for the present writer to rebuke a trait to which he himself pleads guilty ; but he may with possible propriety suggest some profitable ways of flight . For instance , there are our great American rivers . Why not travel them for pleasure ? Europe has microscopic streams and much boating . We have great rivers and little travel upon them . This is a waste of good water . One may travel if not in luxury at least in comfort from St Louis to St Paul and back again upon a very good river steamer . The nine days so spent may be divided by two if one has time for only one way , and the cost is little over three dollars a day for travel , board and room . Twenty-eight dollars covers the entire expense of the round trip . It is just as fascinating as an ocean voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive . You swing out from the levee in St Louis under the great Ends bridge , and ascend the muddy stream to where the Missouri flows in with its yellow tide , and then , keeping in the clearer current , head toward the North Pole . But you box the compass in doing so ; for the stream winds and winds , and you approach now this bank and now that , and swing around islands , and warp through canals , and creep up through rapids , and the scene changes with every mile . One day may be like another on the ocean ; but on a Mississippi boat there is constant variety . No two bridges are alike and the captain will tell you how the currents run at Hannibal , and why it is harder to get a vessel through than Alton or Dubuque . No two shoals are alike , and the same shoal is not alike in any two seasons . No two landings are alike . And no two roustabouts are alike . To sit on deck in the evening and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene never to be forgotten . And you go to sleep at night hearing the call of the mate as he sounds :  |p651  " Nine-nand-a-half Y " " E i g h t-t a n cl-ahal f ! " and so on till it reaches six feet , when the boat slows down until the water begins to deepen again , and at length the reassuring call , " No bottom " starts the bells a-jangling , and sends you off for a sound night 's rest . Would n't you like to try it , you who have jaunted over Europe again and again till you can find nothing new except the new crowd of servants and porters waiting for their tip ? Or if rivers are not in your line , try mountains . A week in the saddle through the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee would be a pleasant change from ordinary civilization . Start in at Berea , where the college is , and where you can get a horse and a guide . Maybe you have some historic interest ; if so , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hobby . Or maybe it is folks . They are all here . The rocks are in bewildering variety , and are placed at all angles ; and the people are good old AngloSaxon people like our ancestors and ourselves . You may find the spinning-wheel humming , and the loom pounding . And it may be that you will hear the old-time ballads sung as in Shakespeare 's day , and learn about the cruelty of Barbara Allen , and the tragedies of the old songs whose theory is that two are company and three are none , and in which the triple tragedy helps out the situation with the hero 's direction to " Bury fair Eleanor in my arms And the brown girl at my feet . " If you have the good fortune to spend a Sunday far back in the mountains you may hear and meet a preacher who contends that the earth is flat . You probably labor under the disadvantages of having lived always among people who have a strong prejudice against this opinion , but most of them without being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of your provincialism . It will do you good to meet an intelligent man , as provincial as yourself , who holds the contrary opinion , and has given more thought to the matter than you have found time to do . He probably will not convince you that he is right ; and I will not say that you can not convince him . You may try . And do not go among these people expecting to despise them or merely to smile at their oddities . They will notice oddities in you . It amuses you to see a GREAT COUNTRY 651 man from the country get off a street ear with his face to the rear ; but the act is no more provincial or dangerous than the attempt to milk a cow on the left side . The rural debating society , which argued the question , " Which is greener , the city man in the country or the country man in the city ? " produced a lot of good arguments on both sides . My friends of the Cumberland mountains are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time over the newspapers than we . If we learn to know them , we shall respect them , and count ourselves provincial by the measure of half the difference between them and ourselves . If your journey enables you to attend a merry-making , and you play a game of " Skip-tomy-lou " you will have opportunity to prove yourself less ungraceful there than the mountaineer might be in your less wholesome round dance . When you have had enough of rivers and mountains , try deserts . Go down into New Mexico where the Penitentes lash themselves in preparation for Easter , and on Good Friday crucify one of their number in genuine mediaval devotion . Realize , if you can , that each of these men has a vote which is worth six to ten times as much as your own in electing a senator . Try to accommodate your imagination to the variety of types of character included in that generic term " American citizen . " Then find some poor , pitifully poor , little mission school teaching among other things that the stars and stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Try hard to make real to yourself the interests which these dark-skinned , brighteyed youngsters hold in common with your own children . For these , too , are Americans . Your lineage goes back to 1620 and the Mayflower , perhaps ; but these came over with Columbus in 1492 or thereabout . These are only suggestions , and may be multiplied over and over . For we have a great , big country , crammed with interesting things and people from end to end . If you will make any one of these journeys , it will be likely to suggest to you previous visits and journeys that were wasteful of opportunity . As you journey delightfully along the Mississippi , you will say , " I remember the summer we went to St Paul on a smoky dusty railroad , rushing through at breakneck speed that we might spend two  |p652  or three days more in a monotonous summer hotel ; why did we not make the journey itself a part of the vacation ? " As you tour the Kentucky mountains you will remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , and growling at the number of tunnels , and gaining for your experience with smoke and cinder a few days in a high-priced hotel managed by the same company that owns a hotel in your own home city , and where you would be welcome any day at the same or a lower rate . As you get back in the desert , and company not only with Mexican-American citizens , but with men and women making a heroic battle to conquer the wilderness and admire the blossoming of the desert , turning streams aside , pumping up water with windmills , and making two blades of grass to grow where formerly there was none , you will remember the time you went to California , and spent most of your time in the hotel because it rained so constantly ; and you might have been learning something here among people . Old Father Taylor , of the Boston Seamen 's Bethel , when told that he was dying , and would soon be with the angels , said , " I do n't want to be among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are many folks and many kinds of folks in America well worth knowing , and the only way to know them is to seek them in their homes . An Englishman has criticised American sport , saying that the true sportsman cares for the game , but the American only for the winning . The true traveler cares for the journey ; but we Americans in our own land mostly about the destination . Let us learn if we may that our own great country has nooks and corners and great expanses just as well worth visiting , and with just as much joy and information to be gained from their exploration , as any part of the rest of the world . So I leave off as I began , with the wise query of my good friend , " What is the use of having a great country , unless you love the whole of it ? "
