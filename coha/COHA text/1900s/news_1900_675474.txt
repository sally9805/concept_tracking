txt Those postal clerks who have been induced to contribute of their money , in sums of *10 or whatever , to secure the passage of the Classification bill by June 10 , have practically thrown away their money . Not only will the Postal Clerks ' Classification bill not be passed during this session , but the probability is that it will not be the subject even of a motion in the House . The impression is here , among those Qualified to judge the meaning of the story told in THE NEW YORK TIMES this morn ing , that some of the clerks have been imposed upon by those who knew that nothing can be accomplished at this session , but who were willing to practice upon the credulity of those who wish to better their positions as employes of the Government . The circumstances are such here as to leave but one conclusion as to the object in view in making the assessment . Bills having almost if not quite identical provisions touching first and second class postal eerks were introduced in Congress some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House by Mr. Daly of New Jersey . The understanding of members of the House Post Office Committee is that the bill introduced in the Senate was passed , but no member of that committee who has been seen can give a positive statement about the fate of the measure , and the record does not show more than that it was introduced and referred . Since its introduction ex-Representative T. J. Campbell and James R. Davies have been here repeatedly advocating its passage , and have spoken with members of both Senate - and House committees with the expectation . of procuring . early and favorable action upon the bills . Mr. Healey has also been here and has done some work for the bill . Representative N. D. Sperry of the Second Connecticut District , formerly Postmaster of New Haven , a practical Post Office man , and the most friendly member of the Post Office Committee , perhaps , that the first and second class clerks have , was astonished at the story in THE NEW YORK TIMES . I am amazed , " said he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows , in my opinion , to - be imposed upon in the way described . I scarcely need to tell any one acquainted with the condition of business hem that it is preposterous and ridiculous for anybody to promise to pass that Classification bill , or any other bill , at this stage of the session . I ' am told that the ' Senate bill was passed , and that it is on the Speaker 's table . If we had considered-the bill in the House committee it would be practicable , perhaps , to take up the Senate bill and substitute it for the House bill ; but that is not practicable . " Although we have had the bill before our committee for some time , there has never been a meeting to consider it . SOme members have been spoken to about it . Mr. Campbell has mentioned it to me several times , and I have assured him of my desire to do something to bring about a classification that will render the status of the clerks more secure , give them the prospect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , and so keep good clerks instead of letting them run away for better employment . " The idea of assessing clerks now to raise money to push the bill through Congress is absurd . There was no occasion to raise money to get the bill through . Indeed , the raising of money for such a purpose is rather damaging to the bill than helpful to it . I do not know what other expenses the clerks ' organization- may have , but there are no necessary expenses attending the advancement of the bill through Congress . " Our Chairman , Mr. Loud , has told me and other members of the committde that our work for this session is ended ; that he will not call another meeting of the committee this Summer , and that only such bills as have been reported will be taken up . We shall adjourn on Wednesday , if all goes ' well , and the clerks could have ascertained that by reading the newspapers , as I suppose they do . " My impression is , . after having read Tian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raised was different from that stated , or ' that the clerks have been imposed upon for some selfish purpose . " You can not be too positive in any statement you may make for me in letting it be known that I fully exonerate the clerks from any bad purpose in subscribing this money , if they have been so foolish as to give it to anybody who has promised to accomplish impossible things with the Post Office Committee and the House . " The bill is not considered ; it can not be considered because there will not be a meeting . If it had been reported , it would be necessary to obtain an order from the Committee on Rules to consider it ; then it would have to be debated and take its chances . It simply can not be reached , and the clerks ought to have been so informed by those who are supposed to have been locking after their interests . " Chairman Loud , who was sought for but could not be found to-night , has notified all members of his committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opposed to the Classification bill at this time , but is not opposed to the idea of gradual classification of all employes in the postal service . The work done for the bill has not been very systematic , and it . has not been directed by men who inspire confidence . If representations have been made that money could be used here to get the bill out of committee , and that fact can be proved . it will be unfortunate for the clerks , who are not responsible for the bad management of it , and it will embarrass the present committee in the next ? session . POSTAL CLERKS ' FUND . Mr. Van Cott Will Investigate and Report to Washington . Postmaster Van Cott yesterday reiterated his former statement that he had no knowledge of the assessment of clerks in the- General and branch Post Offices for a fund to influence the passage of the Classification bill . When his attention was directed to the admission of Joseph P. Healy , National President of the United National Post Office Clerks ' Association , that that body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I have read in THE TIMES that Mr. Healy made such a statement , but I do n't know anything further about it . ' " Do you intend taking the matter up for investigation ? " the Postmaster was asked . " Well , " was the reply , " I do n't know whether the association is raising this money for such benefits or for some other purpose . I 'll have to see about it next week . " " But , " said the reporter , " Mr. Healy stated specifically that this money was being raised for legitimate legislative expenses , ' and did n't mention sick benefits . " " I know that 's what THE TIMES says , " Mr. Van Cott continued . " Of course , they have no right to do that . If I find that they have done so , I will certainly make -a report on it to the department . " " Could you take any action against the clerks engaged in this sort of thing ? " the reporter asked . ' I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . That is all I will say on the subject , " was the reply .
