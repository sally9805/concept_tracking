txt // from other cases of a similar character , in which a direct correlation has been found . Even when describing nervous processes it is often convenient to use subjective terms which are generally recognized as being correlated with those processes . On the other hand , it is sometimes convenient to express the activities of consciousness in physiological terms , as when we speak of association of ideas in terms of connections between brain centers . Although inaccurate there is considerable justification for the use of words in these ways . This is found in the fact that almost the same nervous process may take place at one time with consciousness and at another time without . As we have already seen , consciousness is most prominent in new adjustments of behavior and least prominent or entirely absent in reflex , instinctive , and habitual adjustments . It is therefore doubtless true that a great many nervous processes which at one time in the life of the individual were represented in consciousness may at another time proceed almost , if not wholly , without such representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective term implying consciousness , but it is well to have it understood that the process may take place without any such representation in consciousness as may at one time have occurred and as the words now imply . When we are learning new movements we are conscious of many sensations and images of which , at a later stage , we are not at all conscious . The same is true of perceptions . Relatively unfamiliar perceptions involve images to a far greater extent than when they become habitual , e.g. a voice not often heard may call up several images before we recognize to whom it belongs , while a familiar voice is // recognized at once without any preliminary images . The question as to whether images are used in perceptions of any given kind should be regarded largely as a genetic problem rather than as a problem of fixed modes of mental procedure , for the imagery connected with any perception may vary indefinitely with needs , interests , and practice . For example , the sound of approaching footsteps may excite many and definite images in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to different interests , needs , and degree of familiarity . The images involved in most perceptions are usually not free images , but , as already suggested , anticipatory and of the nature of secondary or mediated sensations . Not only do processes that are at first conscious become , with repetition , unconscious under ordinary circumstances , though they may usually at will be performed consciously , but the opposite condition is found , of processes which were originally performed without consciousness that may also be performed with consciousness . This is true of nearly all the physiological processes . We breathe either consciously or unconsciously and within certain limits we can control the rate of breathing as we choose . A few individuals have acquired control over the movements of - the heart so that they can increase or decrease its rate of movement and can stop or start it at pleasure . Glands such as the tear glands are in some persons under the control of consciousness . Consciousness can also acquire control over muscles that are ordinarily classed as non-voluntary , e.g. the muscles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the body may also be increased by conscious attention to that portion of the body , and the representation // of a burn has been known in some instances to produce physiological effects similar to that produced by a hot iron . The distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary action and between mere conscious accompaniment and conscious direction of activities , can not be closely drawn . Neither are the possibilities of acquisition of voluntary control well known . If an individual gave as much attention to acquiring conscious control of the physiological processes as he gives to acquiring control of the muscles of his hand it may be that he could gain almost as much control over the processes of circulation , digestion , repair , and growth as he now has over his fingers or his vocal organs . Again , as we analyze wholes into their elements and form new combinations we become conscious of an infinite number of things of which under the same external circumstances we were not previously conscious . All mental development involves the continual emergence of new states of consciousness , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is that as long as we are developing we are increasing the number and variety of actual and possible conscious states , though continually becoming less conscious of activities often repeated . The tendency on the part of physiologists is to emphasize the importance of nervous processes and to seek to find a complete explanation of all behavior in the laws of physiological activity . The tendency on the part of the psychologist , on the other hand , is to seek to explain what takes place in subjective terms and as the result of psychological laws . From neither point of view is it possible // to gain a complete idea of all that is taking place . A large proportion of the activity of the nervous centers is not accompanied by consciousness and hence the psychological account is quite inadequate . On the other hand , it is possible to determine to only a slight extent what is taking place in the nervous centers , except so far as it is represented in consciousness and in so far as changes in nerve centers produce changes in external movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push his explanations too far into the field that is open only from the other point of view . Both , however , should feel at liberty to use the terms that best serve their purpose in describing and explaining , providing it is understood or made clear by the context , that a certain type of activity which may be conceived either as a physiological or as a conscious process , is taking place , without implying that consciousness either is or is not present in the particular instance described . Words must be used in this somewhat loose way in describing the behavior of men and animals or else a new set of terms must be invented . Attempts have been made to invent terms that are wholly objective , but this is open to the same objection as is the use of strictly psychological terms to describe conscious states . If we had both objective and subjective terms we would still be at a loss to describe processes that may or may not be accompanied by consciousness , and processes that at one time may be accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same or in different creatures . Terms indicating the process meant , but not necessarily implying that it is with or is without consciousness , are // necessary until we know more regarding what kinds of processes may be performed without consciousness and what kinds must be so accompanied , and in what stages of development and under just what circumstances must consciousness continue to be present in order that the process may be performed . The term " subconsciousness " has come into extensive use recently , but has probably added to , rather than decreased , the difficulties of the situation . It is used to describe processes that take place outside of the ordinary consciousness , and usually implies that a consciousness in some way distinct from the primary , normal consciousness of an individual is directing some of his activities . This supposition is easily made and difficult to disprove . It would be safer to use subjective terms when convenient in describing what a hypnotic subject does , without necessarily implying that there is any consciousness accompanying the process . It is better to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acts may be performed without consciousness . It may be found that all the cases of subconsciousness , or supposed cases of a consciousness separate from the ordinary consciousness , are really cases of acts that may be performed without conscious direction or that they are supervised by an alternating consciousness . This may well be illustrated bya case reported by Dr. Prince of an individual who was able to perform complex processes of which his ordinary consciousness seemed to know nothing . Dr. Prince asked the subject , when in a state designated as " consciousness B , " to work a problem in the computation of time , whenever the figures indicating the hours should be presented . The ordinary consciousness known // as " A " was then given the task of writing a poem on a sheet of paper that had in the margin the figures to be used as data by consciousness B. So far as could be determined , consciousness A took no notice of these numbers , but as soon as consciousness B was evoked by hypnotism , the solution of the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a consciousness B directing the solution of this problem while consciousness A was engrossed with the writing of the poem . It is possible , however , and equally reasonable to suppose , that the brain was consciously adjusted to perform the problem at the time of receiving directions to do so whenever the figures were presented , and that the actual working of the problem was done automatically while the only consciousness present , viz. , the normal consciousness , was occupied with the poem , in much the same way as a person may adjust himself to reading aloud and then read a whole page while intently thinking of something else . In general , the function of consciousness is not to actually do things but to adjust apparatus for doing them , note the results , and readjust as needed . It is not wise therefore to assume that what is done without the knowledge of the ordinary consciousness must have been directed by another consciousness . The term " subconscious " often implies this . Such use of the word opens the way for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate consciousnesses , a reliable knowledge of which is , in the nature of the case , unattainable . The word has therefore been more of a stimulus to the imagination than a contribution to accurate thinking , and should be used with caution if at all . // PROBABLE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANIMALS No progress can be made in understanding the minds of animals by supposing that they have a consciousness entirely different from our own ; and we are led into error if we suppose their consciousness to be exactly like ours , especially in its more highly developed phases . We can only hope to attain some knowledge of the truth by studying carefully the variations in our own consciousness and inferring from all known facts the nature and extent of such variations in the consciousness of animals , giving special attention to the least distinct and highly developed of our own conscious states . We have already found that the fundamental function of consciousness is to unify experiences , and that to itself , human consciousness is always unified and continuous , although there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recalling the events of the day or the week the larger number are not recalled , yet the omissions give no sense of the lack of continuity . This may or may not be true of the consciousness of animals . The breaks in their consciousness maybe much longer and more frequent , but to the consciousness of an animal there may be continuity and unity but probably a continuity not involving a past and a future related to the present , a mere negative continuity in which no break is felt , because only the present is cognized . Observing our own consciousness at different times and comparing the consciousness of persons of varying age and culture , we find that there are immense differences // in the content of consciousness . In some instances it is crowded with sensations , images , and ideas , each carrying with it a host of other images and ideas as a background , while in other cases consciousness is comparatively bare of content . In the case of animals with few sense organs and little change in external surroundings and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of a simpler character than any that we have ever experienced . It is probable that the content of consciousness of even the higher animals at their best is far more meager than that of human beings at their lowest . It is a well-known fact that the span of consciousness increases greatly with age , experience , and familiarity with the experience being held in mind . Where a child can think of two objects , numbers , or words so as to name or repeat them , an adult would readily name or repeat three or four times as many . In observing trains of association the same fact may be noticed . The child 's trains of thought are very short and usually initiated by external stimulation , while the adult 's trains of thought are frequently very long and almost independent of external stimulation . The content of an adult 's consciousness is still further increased by arrangement into groups and series without trying to focalize individual elements . From the actions of animals it is fair to infer that their span of consciousness and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a two-year-old child . In fact , most of their behavior and probably their conscious states are the result of immediate sensory stimulation . We know that our own consciousness may be of a higher or lower degree of intensity and more or less clear and // discriminating . Clearness in the form of accurate discrimination , and intensity in the form of feeling , do not necessarily occur together , but frequently , if not usually , is the reverse true . The fact that the behavior of animals is much less modified by severe injuries than in the case of man would suggest the probability that the intensity of conscious feeling is in them very much less than it is in man . On the other hand , the wonderful accuracy of discrimination in special lines , notably in that of smell , indicates that in some cases at least animals do not lack in clearness of consciousness . This may not , however , indicate a generally highly illuminated consciousness . Just as a light is much more easily and clearly discriminated in darkness than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may stand out with great clearness in a consciousness otherwise comparatively dim . It is worthy of note also that our finest tactual , visual , and auditory discriminations are not of stimuli that produce pain or pleasure , but rather of those that do not , though they may be suggestive of painful or pleasurable stimuli to follow . Perhaps the most common and marked variation in human consciousness is in the unevenness of its content , or , in other words , in its characteristic of being focalized upon a portion of its contents while other portions are but dimly felt . Not only is this focus being changed from one element to another , but the degree of focalization or of concentration of attention varies immensely in different minds and in the same mind at different times . In idle moments of day dreaming there may be almost if not entire lack of focalization . In cases of fatigue also it often be- // comes impossible to keep the attention fixed upon the subject in hand . Diffusion of attention is usually more marked in children than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is usually supposed . The child 's attention changes much more frequently than an adult 's and he has less power to direct it in any required way ; but in some instances , at any rate , there is every evidence of very complete momentary concentration of attention upon one thing on the part of even very young children . What is true of children is true of animals in a greater degree . We can not therefore say positively that their consciousness is lacking in focalization , but it may be in power of sustaining it . The difference perhaps between human and animal focalization is in the extent and variety of the content involved . It may very well be that when the consciousness of an animal is focalized there is little or no other content besides that which is focalized . Thus far our discussion has been concerned chiefly with the content of consciousness , and it is of this that we know most . Of consciousness as such , apart from its content , we know little or nothing . It is difficult to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is comparatively empty . Some persons maintain that they are at times conscious but not conscious of any definite thing . A few claim to be able at will to empty their consciousness of all content . To most persons this condition is almost if not quite inconceivable . Since , however , creditable observers claim that this is true of themselves we are not justified in arbitrarily denying its possibility . It is probable , however , that this seeming absence of content is merely an extreme case of diffu-Y // sion of attention under conditions in which there is little variety in kind and degree of stimulation . If so , then the seeming bareness of consciousness is due to the fact that there is no focalization upon any one part . Whether animals have this kind of conscious state frequently we can not say , but it is not improbable that in many instances such states alternate in the same animal with states in which there is almost complete focalization upon one prominent conscious experience . Speaking figuratively , the consciousness of the lower animals may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the same drop of ink spread over a surface when there is no focalization ; while a highly developed human consciousness is like a kaleidoscopic view , always presenting unified variety that changes with every change of attention , yet is always a complex and distinct unity . NOTE . ? It is often emphasized that the subjective phenomena occurring after physical stimulations and neural activity are entirely new and in no respect like their supposed cause . Such a statement , when looked at in the light of scientific observation in other fields , would seem to be scarcely worthy of the mention and certainly not of the attention which it has received . In all scientific investigations new phenomena that have no resemblance to their causes are appearing . There is no resemblance between a blow on a piece of rock and the spark that results . In all chemical combinations the introduction of a new element or condition may call forth a phenomenon that bears no resemblance to the element occasioning it . The new phenomena of neural activity are as different from the stimulus calling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neural activity . The peculiar thing about the new phenomena of consciousness that appear as the result of nervous activity in the human cortex is not that they in no respect resemble the physical stimulus nor the physiological activity , but that the new // phenomena appear only to the consciousness of the individual possessing the nervous structure thus stimulated . Other consciousnesses may have corresponding or similar facts just as other worlds may have the same elements as our own earth , but direct examination of them is possible only for the individual to whose world they belong . Just as the organism is a unity and all of its behavior is governed by the necessity of preserving that unity amidst external influences of various kinds , so the inner conscious life is a unity and all that takes place in it has reference to its own preservation and development . With the appearance of a highly developed consciousness , as has already been suggested , the objective factor in evolution ? natural selection ? is replaced by the subjective factor of pleasure and pain , and the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most effective reactions . In the simpler forms of mental life there is little subjective activity that is not manifested in objective movement , but in a highly developed human mind a large part of the subjective life is not manifested outwardly in behavior , though it may be indicated by words ; hence there are extensive fields of consciousness to be studied in human beings besides that of objective behavior , which is common to men and animals . This is the distinctive field of psychology , and its problem is to determine how activities are related to each other in individual consciousness , and not to wonder at or dispute over the fact that the phenomena of consciousness are different from those of physics or physiology .

CHAPTER VIII SPECIFIC CONSCIOUS STATES OF ANIMALS AND MAN GENERAL CHARACTER OF FEELING IN ANIMALS EVEN the lowest forms of animal life show two kinds of reaction , negative and positive . Where a creature possesses consciousness these two forms of reaction are doubtless correlated with feelings of the disagreeable and the agreeable . It may be asserted that the feelings of the agreeable and the disagreeable are results instead of causes of the increase or decrease of activity associated with them . This is doubtless true to a certain extent , but it is reasonable to suppose that the feelings exert a reciprocal influence upon the physiological activities ; otherwise there would be no reason for creatures possessing consciousness to be selected for survival , and consciousness could never have become such a prominent characteristic as we know that it has become in man . Feelings of attraction and repulsion are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn quickly . These do not necessarily involve any definite representation of what is to be experienced . We have an impulse to touch , pick up , or eat some objects and to draw away from others , without any distinct representation of the results of such movements . It is only when we delay a movement that we are likely to form images of 214 // results to be obtained . In animals , conscious representation is doubtless even less promir ? nt in such cases than in man . Even strong emotions , such as fear and anger , which appear to be manifested in some form in all animals , are probably entirely different in their consciousness , when they possess any , from what they are in ours . Fear in man is largely a matter of imagination , while in animals it is chiefly a form of reaction . A person who is actively getting out of harm 's way usually feels at the time merely increased activity . It is only when one is keeping still , or relatively so , and representing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fear . Men of action suffer very little from fear . When danger threatens they act , and when it does not , they do not think about it . This is true of animals , only in a greater degree . However often a wild animal may be frightened , as soon as the heightened activities become normal , he appears to be entirely comfortable till another danger stimulus is received . What-is true of fear is also true to a large extent of anger . The so-called " grief " of animals is also largely motor rather than psychic , as it is also in some people . An important object of activity is lacking when a companion or a master is taken away , and apathy , or a wild form of undirected activity , is likely to take the place of the orderly , directed activity that has been concerned with the absent individual . A horse may be as much disturbed by the absence of a mate with whom he fights a great deal , as of one with whom he is on good terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grief in men and animals , // because it substitutes directed for undirected activity . It also gives less opportunity for the representative activity , which is so likely to be carried on by man , and which in him is the chief source of emot 1 . The readiness with which grief may be consoled in sonic instances is well illustrated by Morgan 's incident of the cow that was frantic because her calf had been taken away but was quieted by a stuffed calf to lick , and was soon calmly engaged in eating the hay with which it was stuffed . Similar statements might be made of other forms of instinctive emotion . Animals are supposed to show sympathy for wounded companions , but the reaction is largely motor rather than mental , as is also sometimes the case in man . The smell of blood greatly excites a herd of cattle , and if the enemy that spilled the blood of a comrade is seen , it may be fiercely attacked ; but if it is not found it is not unusual for the excitement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form instinctive emotions are merely native tendencies to act in certain ways under certain circumstances , and only when representation takes the place of action , either for the time being or permanently , do they become genuine emotions involving intense feelings . The above statements do not mean that animals do not experience any emotions in connection with their instinctive acts , or that man experiences none when he immediately makes the instinctive movements . Where the development of a situation does not lead too quickly to the instinctive reaction , anticipatory images may be formed by animals as a result of a series of stimuli which cause them to feel as well as to act . On the other hand , when men // are making instinctive reactions that are not too vigorous , the apparatus concerned in imaging may also be sufficiently active to produce strong emotional states . The point to be emphasized is that in both men and animals prompt and unimpeded ins , inctive reaction doubtless has less feeling accompanying it than when there is delay , obstruction , and conflict of motor tendencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be supposed , however , that since representation is necessary to emotion the feeling is strongest when representation is most definite . On the contrary , definite and specific representation , like prompt unobstructed movement , may be accompanied by less feeling than less clearly defined imagery . It is generally true that an emotion is stronger when the general character of what is to happen is anticipated , but not definitely known and specifically represented . This is especially true in fear , for unknown dangers produce more agonizing fears than any known consequence that can be clearly represented . In man there are a great variety of emotions associated with imagery that are probably entirely unknown to animals . Man has emotions also associated with concepts , but except as the concepts are accompanied by concrete images the emotions are not likely to be intense . PAIN Pain as a sensation is probably a differentiation of the feeling of the disagreeable which serves as a stimulus to negative reactions . In man , pain sensations are differentiated from states that are disagreeable , and there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitation of specific nerve elements . To what extent pain sensations in animals are differentiated from the generally disagreeable we do not know , nor is it possible to assert , without fear of contradiction , how the intensity of pain in animals compares with that in man . We can reason as to the probabilities of the case from the function of pain in promoting self-preservative reactions and the part it plays in our own lives . Pain , like the general feeling of the disagreeable , serves as a stimulus to do something to obtain relief . The reactions to pain stimulation are usually of a trial character , and experiment shows that in man , reactions to pain sensations , though more vigorous , are slower , less discriminative , and less accurate than to stimuli that have a suggestive value . Fine discrimination of suggestive stimuli which are neither agreeable nor disagreeable , and accurate and prompt response to such stimuli , are the most effective means of avoiding painful stimuli and of preserving life . Painful stimulations best serve their function when they produce many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which relief may be obtained . Fine discrimination as to the degree and quality of pain would not be of great value after the unfavorable stimulus had already begun to act . It matters not whether pain is caused by heat , cold , or contact . The only thing to do is to get away from the painful stimulus , while successful reaction to a suggestive stimulus involves accurate discrimination . It does not follow therefore that , because a creature reacts very quickly and accurately to a stimulus , it is experiencing pain . Pain is more probSPECIFIC // ably present when the reactions are varied and vigorous than when rapid and finely adjusted . It is not to be supposed , however , that the pain is always proportional to the vigor of the reactions . It is true of ourselves only within certain limits that the greater the pain the more vigorous the reaction . Vigorous reaction probably serves of itself as a relief from the slighter stimuli , but when the pain becomes intense , relief can not thus be obtained and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements . This decreased activity probably serves to decrease the capacity to feel pain . One means of judging of the relative importance of sensory stimuli is to observe what stimulus dominates action when several are being given . This furnishes something of a basis for comparison between men and animals . It is a well-known fact that a severe wound in man produces loss of appetite and less ready response to all forms of external stimulation . This is true to some extent of the higher animals and to only a slight extent of the lower . A shark or a bee may continue to feed after a considerable portion of the body has been cut away so that the food can not be retained . Frogs and fishes will again and again take a bait though severely lacerated by the hook each time they do so . These facts indicate that pain does not play such a prominent part in determining the activity of animals as of men . Vigorous and varied movements may be the result of the overwhelming dominance of a painful sensation , or they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of par t to par t , upon which definite movements depend . The latter rather than the former is almost surely I // the explanation of the behavior of the angleworm when cut in two . If cut in two quickly , while crawling , the front part is likely to continue to move forward as if nothing had happened , while the posterior portion curls up and makes all kinds of irregular movements , after which it may move in the opposite direction . If this portion is again cut in two the part that is leading continues to move forward while the part that is following makes irregular movements . This is because each segment in crawling responds to the stimulus of the segment in front of it , and when that is removed equilibrium is destroyed and movements are very irregular . Injuries on one side of the cerebellum in higher animals produce for a similar reason incoordinated or " forced " movements of the whole body . Putting these facts together it seems quite probable that pain in animals is not clearly differentiated from the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense the lower we go in the scale of animal life . Man probably experiences pain in a distinct and intense form more than any other creature , and the more highly developed man more than those with less highly developed nervous organizations . Idiots are frequently so insensitive to pain that what would be a severe surgical operation to a normal individual appears to be to them merely an interesting and novel experience . It is probable that pain is a prominent feature in the mental life , not so much because of the value of the sensation in itself in the preservation of life and health , as because of its relation to other mental states . The general refinement of nervous organization in man is probably necessarily correlated with some increase in sensitiveness // to painful stimuli . It is probable also that more intense feelings of pain are needed in man to prevent actions that are not for the good of his body , than in animals , nearly all of whose conscious states are related to their physical well-being . In man , as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating him to do things that are not for the good of the body and may possibly be of injury to it . A very slight disagreeable feeling of hunger may be sufficient to insure that an animal shall take food , but a very much greater feeling of discomfort may be needed to induce a man to cease the interesting occupation of painting or writing in order to partake of food . It is probably because man is capable of experiencing so many more agreeable feelings , that are not of great biological value , than are animals , that he is capable of experiencing more intense feelings of pain , because they are needed in order to preserve a proper balance and induce him to act with reference to bodily needs as well as with reference to mental pleasures . Those who read into the actions of animals the same degree of suffering of which they are themselves capable , are probably wholly misinterpreting the phenomena . On the principles of evolution we can see no reason why great capacity for suffering should be of any use to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reason to suppose that such capacity would have been developed by natural selection . All that is needed in the way of painful experience in the life of animals is a feeling of discomfort strong enough to produce vigorous action when an unfavorable stimulus is being received , and to dominate behavior in so far as the well-being of the body demands // that it shall dominate . In man , however , aesthetic , moral , and religious feelings often produce action injurious to the body , even in the face of pain which prompts to behavior favorable to bodily needs . INTELLECTUAL STATES Sensations In man , sensations have the quality of being not only painful or pleasurable , or at least agreeable or disagreeable , but they have many other qualities by which the sensations due to one sense organ are distinguished from those caused by the stimulus of other sense organs . In addition to this , difference in sensations due to different stimulating objects affecting the same sense organ , is clearly discriminated , e.g. various colors by the eye and many odors by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how far animals discriminate in consciousness the difference between the results of stimulation of the different sense organs and between the different kinds of stimuli affecting the same organ . In trying to answer this question we should consider our least highly developed senses rather than those that are most highly developed , and especially than those giving characteristic sensations that have been named and specifically analyzed and separated from the general mass of sensations accompanying them . Touch , taste , and smell are the least highly developed of our senses and are by us least accurately discriminated , and hence are most profitably studied as a basis for understanding the mental states of animals . In many of our experiences we are conscious of the effects of the stimulation of one or more of these senses without knowing acSPECIFIC // curately which ones are affected . When we drink coffee or eat ice cream , we say that the taste is agreeable or disagreeable , when in reality the feeling that we experience is due to the stimulus of three senses instead of one . If the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeableness or disagreeableness depends largely upon tactile sensations , while if we have a severe cold , we find that one of the essential qualities of agreeableness , that of flavor , is lacking , because the sense of smell is not acting effectively . Because of our varied mental life we are able by practice and effort to analyze the complex mental state produced by simultaneous stimulation of all of these senses into sensations having the qualities of sweetness , bitterness , saltiness , sourness , warmth , coldness , smoothness , roughness , and into a variety of odor sensations . In our ordinary experience , however , we make very few of these analyses . The ordinary individual notices in eating that the food is agreeable or disagreeable , and sometimes recognizes that it has some quality which he likes in food or that that quality is not present , and yet there is no complete and clear analysis of just what the quality is . One who has given no attention to cookery may say that the cake is not good , realizing that it lacks some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quality is , though the cook who has given attention to such things may say at once , " It has not enough salt , " or " It is not sweet enough . " Even an experienced cook may , however , detect a lack without knowing at once what is missing , e.g. a lady said that something was lacking in her lemon pie , and later remembered that she had not as usual put salt into the filling . // Where varied experiences and practical needs have made it convenient to analyze complex sensations into their ele ments , such analyses have been made , but not otherwise . One of the most common mistakes in attempting to interpret the mental states of creatures whose experience and needs are different from our own is in supposing that elements of mental states , which we have analyzed from the complex in which they are always found , have also been analyzed by them . This vitiates the reasoning of many writers on animal behavior as well as that of many writers on general psychology . A mental state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed from what it was before such analysis . All the elements were there at first , in the total experience of the whole , but after the analysis they are there as individual factors and not simply as influencing the general character of the mental state . A person who prefers one picture , poem , or speech to another , may have exactly the same preference after he has learned to analyze pictures , poems , and speeches so as to know in just what characteristics they differ from each other ; but the mental state produced by the picture , poem , or speech will never again be the same as it was before such analysis , and soon he will be unable to understand how an individual who distinguishes between two pictures as wholes , can fail to perceive the exact characteristics that he knows are possessed by one and lacking in the other . It is this that makes it so difficult for adults to understand the mental condition of children . A soldier who does not know a single note may learn to respond accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds are being made at the same time . If we // apply the same principle to the behavior of animals , we shall have to adopt an entirely different principle of interpretation from that taken by many writers . A striking example of the discriminative ability of a dog is given by Romanes . He found that it could follow his track , although a dozen other men had followed in his footsteps and seven of them had diverged later from the path taken by himself and the others . This is interpreted by one of the most recent and acute students of animal behavior , Miss Washburn , as an instance of the analysis of a sensation from the complex in which it occurs , similar to that of the expert musician who detects the instrument and the exact error made by a performer in an orchestra . To the author it does not seem probable that the mental state of the dog in following his master 's track is at all like that of the musician in detecting a false note . The mental state of the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier who knows the bugle call for advance of his own regiment , from any other signal and from the same signal made by another bugler , although he knows not a single element of music . To the dog , the sum total of odors with that of the master is different from any sum total of odors in which that of the master is not included , hence he knows which track to follow . He follows that track just as a man cats cake that has the quality that he likes , although he does not know just what the quality is ; or the reader still prefers the poem that appeals to him rather than the one that does not , although he is utterly unable to tell the characteristic upon ii which his preference depends . The fact that an animal acts differently when a certain Q // stimulus is present , even in a very slight degree , from what he does when it is absent , does not prove that he has a distinct sensation corresponding to that stimulus , but only that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is present , is different from what it is when it is absent . Nature provides the sense organs for special sensations but they come into actual existence in consciousness as separate elements only when the results of experience make this separate recognition valuable . The fact that Japanese mice learn to go in at the entrance illuminated with red instead of one illuminated with green , does not prove that there is a conscious sensation of red and of green as analyzed elements in the general mental state involved in the action being performed . The fact that a monkey goes to a box covered with red instead of some other box for food , does not prove that he consciously discriminates the sensation of red as an element in the sum total of his experience . It is altogether probable that children learn to discriminate objects with a specific color from objects not having that color , before they analyze the mental state produced by the object and become conscious of redness as one of its characteristics . So long as red or any other characteristic is simply part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recognized as an element in itself . If its presence means food , not only under those conditions but under a great variety of other conditions , so that it appears as a part of many wholes , notice may be attracted to it specifically . If it appears not only as a means to food but as a means to other ends , it is still further dissociated from any particular combination of conditions and ends . This occurs very // frequently in human beings who have a great variety of interests and needs , while it occurs very rarely in even the higher animals . It is probable , therefore , that none but a few specifically trained animals of the higher type have specific sensations of any kind such as we have . The various sensations that they experience probably form a complex similar to that produced in us by articles of food , only less definite and specific as to the elements constituting the complex . Space Perceptions The space sensations of animals rank in importance with the feelings of the agreeable and the disagreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they indicate the need of doing something . The thing to be done usually involves some kind of a space reaction . To get relief the creature must move in a definite way and the more quickly it moves in the right direction the sooner is the reaction effective . It is therefore just as important that there should be means of determining the direction of movement as it is that there should be a feeling of the disagreeable to induce movement . In a general way the sensations upon which space reactions depend are of the same general character as those by which equilibrium is maintained . The sensations by which equilibrium is maintained vary with the position of the body and the relation of one part to another , while space reactions are usually made in response to stimulations coming from objects in the environment . In their more primitive form , space reactions depend to a considerable extent upon inequality of stimulation and upon // inequality of sensitiveness to stimulation in different parts of the body . A creature with one portion of the body as sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heat , and other stimulations would have no occasion for movement . Just as soon , however , as it is stimulated more on one side than on the other there is occasion for spatial reaction . A greater sensitiveness on one side may also call forth reaction . When a creature responds by a different movement according to the portion stimulated , it is reasonable to suppose that there is some differentiation of the sensitive surface so that the effect of the stimulus is different . As we have already seen , this appears very low in the scale of animal life . These two principles are probably the basis of all " tropisms . " Experiment shows that the lower animals are influenced in a spatial way by light , heat , and gravity , sometimes one being dominant and sometimes another . The sensitiveness to these different kinds of stimuli varies also with the internal conditions of the creature , the reactions of the same animal being at one time positive and at another negative to the same stimulus . It is probable that such changes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to food and at another to safety from enemies . We may therefore best conceive of an animal as being in equilibrium and motionless when all the stimuli tending to produce movement are in equilibrium . If he is moving and all these stimuli are in equilibrium , he continues the same form of movement , whether it be in a straight line or in a circle . Variations from this motionless condition or uniform movement are produced by any stimulus that disturbs the equilibrium and becomes for the time being the dominant director of activity . 4. // Human experience may be helpful in forming an idea of the character of space sensation in animals . A person who has been used to working for many years in a certain room , facing in a certain direction , and surrounded by the same objects , is likely to be somewhat disconcerted if he attempts to do the same kind of work facing another way or with the position of objects in the room changed . He does not seem to be rightly adjusted to his environment and prefers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most vivid illustration of spatial adjustments in their memories of having waked in a bed in a new position . On the conscious side a condition of equilibrium in relation to surrounding objects is accompanied by a feeling of the agreeable , while disturbance of equilibrium produces a feeling relatively disagreeable , although the reaction may be positive in its character and secure an agreeable result . Space discrimination depends upon the accuracy with which the various stimuli may be coordinated so as to maintain proper relations between different parts of the body and with various objects in the environment . This does not mean , however , that the sensations coordinated are represented separately and distinctly in consciousness . Experiment shows that this is not the case even in man . We are guided with great precision by sensations coming from the hand and from the eye , without being distinctly conscious of what those guiding sensations are . Experiment shows that space judgments are greatly influenced by variations in sensation of which the subject is entirely unconscious . This is especially true of the movements of the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fusing the two images upon the retina ; , // and in accommodating for different distances and degrees of light . A certain sensation complex made up of all the stimuli affecting us at the moment means an object in a certain place to be reacted to by a certain kind of movement , and any variation in this complex calls for a variation in movement , but it is exceedingly difficult for us to become conscious of the exact sensations by means of which our movements are coordinated and adjusted . A slight variation from the usual in this complex may disturb the accuracy of our movements and the accuracy of our space judgments , but we are slightly or not at all conscious of the specific changes in sensations that are influencing our spatial perceptions and movements . The effect of surrounding objects that have no direct relation to the objects with which we are dealing , has long been recognized in a practical way by sportsmen . Tennis players change sides because the objects surrounding the tennis court within their field of view affect the playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side of the court only , he would find it very difficult to play on the other side without error . He reacts not only to the ball moving from a certain point , in a certain direction , at a certain rate , to the net and the side lines , and to his own movements and position , but also to any buildings , trees , or spectators that may be in the neighborhood of the court . All spatial reactions are determined by the sum total of the surroundings affecting one . This is true not only of single reactions but also of a long series of reactions by means of which one finds his way . Not only do the sun and wind and one 's own movements serve as guides , but all objects characteristic of the environment , whether individuSPECIFIC // ally and specifically known or not . For example , one who has lived much of his life in a place where roads usually run according to the points of the compass generally uses the roads as reference points in guiding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . When he strikes into the timber from the road , he is continually judging his direction by the relation of his movements to the direction in which the road runs that he has just left . This is true of the writer , although he did not realize it until after living for a while in a section of the country where the roads run in every direction . In trying to find why he made mistakes in direction when hunting , he was led to ascribe them to the fact that he somewhat unconsciously used the roads as guiding standards and was led into error because these roads were entirely uncertain in their direction . Every individual who is able to find his way is doubtless influenced in a similar manner by something in his environment . Often he does not know what it is but simply feels that this is the direction to take , that this is north , or that this way seems familiar . It is probable that the spatial reactions of animals are guided in a similar way by the objects characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not individually familiar . A mountain sheep , for example , transported to a new range of mountains , could doubtless find food and avoid enemies very successfully . Creatures very low in the scale may have their reactions to specific objects in their immediate environment modified by becoming accommodated to them , in a way similar to that by which man becomes used to working in a certain room facing in a certain direction . This is probably the explana232 GENETIC PSYCHOLOGY tion of what is sometimes called the " homing instinct " of animals very low in the scale . Experiments show that when they are moved from their usual environment they find their way back again . This is probably because they are not in equilibrium with the new environment . They make various trial movements , then continue the movements that help to restore the equilibrium until they reach their former position . In higher animals , such as bees , wasps , dogs , and pigeons , the same factor doubtless exercises some influence . The chief difference is that in the higher animals the modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been found is produced by one or two perceptions instead of by long and repeated exposure to the objects . The wasp that has left food in a certain place has , we may say , been polarized with reference to that spot and the objects surrounding it , so that she reacts to them in a different way from what she does to any other set of objects . The nervous system of the homing pigeon is doubtless polarized with reference to the objects within the neighborhood . When carried many miles and released , his movements are often at first of a trial character ; but frequently he knows the general direction of home , probably in much the same way as many men are able to tell with considerable assurance , as soon as they step off a train , which way is north , although they may not know how they know it . In flying , the pigeon is also probably guided by the general character of objects in the landscape , hills , forests , etc. , in the same way in which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood of home , so that any portion of its familiar environment can be // perceived , he finds that direction the more agreeable , and thus guided , soon reaches his old home . There is much that is mysterious in the reactions of animals in finding their way , but probably nothing more mysterious than in man 's modes of distinguishing direction . He himself usually knows little of the specific sensations that guide him and that are the most important factors in his success . It has been suggested that men and animals may be subject to magnetic influences as is the needle of the compass , and this is the only explanation yet suggested of how some individuals know in every situation the points of the compass . When men are able to explain how they know directions , it is often by memory images ; hence they are inclined to think that movements are in general guided in that way , when , as a matter of fact , men and all animals are guided much of the time without conscious memories and by sensations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by images in the form of representation of the relation of roads or objects that are not in the field of view is often possible to men but is by no means universal . Many people can act very successfully as guides who can not describe the course to be taken . In a similar way animals are very skillful in finding their way , though they probably never image the relation of objects to each other or mentally pass over a route . Perception of Objects No absolute line of distinction can be drawn between sensation and perception , either when viewed objectively // in the form of stimulus and movement or as observed subjectively in our own consciousness . The more immediate the effects of the stimulus , either favorable or unfavorable , the more are we inclined to call them sensations . When , however , the stimulus is not in itself especially agreeable , but is suggestive of something to follow that is significant for our welfare we are more likely to use the word " perception . " Taste and smell are more frequently named as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor or a taste suggests other sensations associated with it we may use the term " perception . " We may also use the term " sensation " to indicate the effects of visual and auditory stimulation when we mean that the light , color , or sound is in itself agreeable or disagreeable instead of signifying some object that as a whole is pleasing or otherwise . On the motor side the movements in response to sensations are usually less complex and definitely coordinated than those in response to suggestive stimuli and involving perception . In perception there is not only response to the stimulus received but an adjustment to the object or situation suggested by it . On the mental side in perception there is not simply a feeling of agreeableness or disagreeableness , but a mental o attitude toward the situation or object suggested which in the higher animals may involve anticipatory images of what is to come , and in man in a certain stage of development may arouse memory images of past experiences in similar situations . Where the response to a stimulus is clearly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the term " sensation " to describe the mental state than when the reac-1 // tion is one that has been acquired by previous experience . There is no doubt that animals often make fitting responses to complex situations in an instinctive way , and hence may , in one sense of the word , be said to have instinctive perceptions . This is especially true of what are usually described as space perceptions . Without previous practice a chicken can peck with considerable accuracy at a particle of food , and young pigs either seeing or hearing their mother can guide themselves directly toward her . They can also judge distance with sufficient accuracy to jump successfully from a higher to a lower position . The response of chickens to a danger call is also evidence of instinctive perception if we admit that the term may be applied to that which is native instead of limiting it to that which has been acquired by experience . It is probably well to recognize two kinds of perceptions , the instinctive and the acquired ; although it may be convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to use the term " perception " in the narrower sense of acquired perceptual motor reactions and tendencies , while in a still narrower sense it refers only to reactions represented in consciousness . On the mental side there can be no anticipatory images ( or mediated sensations ) except in the case of acquired perceptions . There is an instinctive basis , however , even in man for many acquired perceptions . The response of a dog to food placed in its mouth is largely sensory in character , although the swallowing or ejecting of the food , according to its character , suggests that there may be some reaction to the object as a whole rather than simply to the sensation that has already been experienced . The response of the dog to the stimulus of the odor of meat is of a similar // character but slightly more perceptual . His response to meat that he can see but can not smell , if he makes such a response , is without question an instance of acquired perception , though the movements he makes are largely instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates an instinctive perception , but his pause when the cat turns and faces him may indicate an acquired perception gained from previous painful experience in a similar situation . It is not necessary to suppose that he has a distinct memory of the former experience , but merely that the pain previously experienced in that situation has modified his instinctive mode of action and perhaps produced some vague anticipatory images of disagreeable results that may follow continued pursuit . In our own experience we acquire new modes of behavior without any distinct recognition of the exact changes made and their results . This is perhaps best illustrated by the experience of one who is learning to ride a bicycle . He learns to make certain adjustments and avoid others without knowing just how he does it . In the case of more sudden and marked modifications the attitude and feeling toward an object may persist long after it is impossible to recall any former experience with it . This is well illustrated by a case mentioned by Professor Judd of a man who was very much afraid of horses without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been severely bitten by a horse when he was a small boy . One 's feeling of liking or dislike for persons , places , names , and things , that can not be accounted for by any memories of experiences with them , is doubtless due to similar causes . Attitude toward objects as shown in // perceptions is much more fundamental than memory , being produced in creatures incapable of memory and persisting in higher creatures long after memory has failed . Again , a child who has seen a companion make an exclamation or gesture of horror at being touched or approached by a worm or a spider , may have its attitude towards those creatures completely changed , although it retains no memory of the experience that produced the change . It is probable that nearly all the acquired perceptions of animals are of this type in which there is no memory of the past experience , but only a mental attitude of attraction or repulsion excited by the object , with possibly some anticipatory images of the general character of the result to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to these characteristics of perception , there are often definite images of just what is to be experienced , and sometimes memory images of former experience . These , in the cases of delayed perception , which are most readily observed , are usually the prominent elements . Hence there is a tendency for psychologists to ignore the less prominent phases of perception and to attempt to explain the perceptions of animals in terms of definite images and memories . As a result of acquired perceptions a change in the adjustment of the nervous and muscular apparatus has been produced so that the creature is modified and his states of consciousness are changed ; but there is no reason to suppose that animals are conscious that these changes have taken place . In man , such a consciousness is probably lacking in the majority of his perceptions . We are surprised at the sensation we get when we take salt from the sugar bowl , but this does not // necessarily mean that before tasting we had formed an image of the sweet taste to be experienced . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not conscious of having formed an image of their weight . In general , the changes in acquired perception are in the reaction and attitude toward the situation as a whole , but where one feature dominates the situation the change may be chiefly with reference to that one element . In such a case the object or sensation may excite the same reaction whenever experienced . A clog that has been whipped by his master when hunting may show signs of fear when he sees the whip in the master 's hand at home , or perhaps when he sees it in the hand of any person . It is not likely , however , that he will show any fear of it when it is not in the hands of some person , and then perhaps only when it is being held or moved in a certain way . In the case of acquired reactions to the more direct stimulus of an odor , which is in a way a sample of the object itself , the reaction is likely to be of a specific kind no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A horse that is gun shy may show fear at sight of a gun only when it is being pointed , but if his fear is due to the odor , it is more likely to be aroused by that alone , whatever the situation . Images and Memories Since the actions of all creatures are dominated by the end to be gained , and since association of impressions is much stronger in the order in which they occurred than in the reverse order , it is clear that anticipatory images would be formed easier and earlier than reminiscent images . // Where a stimulus is always immediately followed by the same movement , there is not in our own case any conscious image formed and there is no reason to see why there should be in the case of any creature . When movements are directed toward an end but vary in ways that result in reaching that end by shorter means , as is the case in the learning of many of the higher animals , it would seem that an image of the result to be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movements follow the stimulus immediately , it is difficult to see how an image could be formed , or be of any service if formed . An animal that is stimulated by objects at a distance , as , for instance , a deer by the form of a hunter , may not make any considerable reaction to that stimulus for some time . It may wait until the stimulus is repeated and intensified by nearer approach and perhaps supplemented by sound or odor before it reacts strongly by running away . Evidently the conditions in this case are favorable for the production of modifications in portions of the nervous system not directly connected with the motor centers , and hence for the formation of images . Such images of results that may follow the various stimuli being received from objects at a distance would be likely to be of service in directing movements . We should expect therefore that images of some sort would be formed in response to suggestive stimuli , especially when immediate movement is not necessary , rather than in response to direct stimuli and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deer , however , are probably anticipatory and of the same type as secondary sensations or perceptual images . In order to become free images they // must appear under various circumstances and must be aroused in some other way than by associated sensory activity . Most of our free images are from the suggestive senses of sight and hearing , while images of taste and pain are rare , and to many persons impossible . In the case of the suggestive senses an image of the sensation to be experienced may serve the same purpose as the movements by which the sensation could be secured ; hence the power of forming such images has been highly developed , while that of forming images of immediate sensations has been but slightly developed . In learning , images sometimes play a prominent part . Where the process of learning is very gradual , there is no reason to suppose that images aid in the process , for they do not in our own case . When , however , all useless and indirect movements are dropped as soon as the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images aid in the process of learning . The service rendered by images must be still greater when all movements are inhibited for a time and then the right one made at once . In all but the higher animals learning seems to be a very gradual process . Hence there is no reason to suppose that images play any considerable part in the learning of lower animals . Much of the learning of monkeys , raccoons , and other of the higher animals and some of that of human beings is not rapid enough to indicate that images assist in the process . In Cole 's experiments the raccoons learned to get up on the box for food when white , orange , and blue cards were shown successively , but to remain down when blue was shown three times in succession . In other words , the reaction was not made to blue alone or blue repeated three // times in succession , but only when it was preceded by white and orange . The animals often began to get up on the box after white appeared , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . This is perhaps further indicated by the fact that they would sometimes get down and wait for the blue to appear before getting up on the box again . It is not certain , however , that this indicates a definite image of just what was to appear . It may be interpreted merely as an indefinite image of pleasant results to be obtained , with a waiting for the proper signal , which is recognized when it appears , though it may not have been imaged previously . It is certainly true of persons that they are able to anticipate and react to the proper signal when it appears without having held in mind an image of it . The pause involved in waiting for the proper stimulus is doubtless , however , a favorable condition for developing an image of the stimulus that is to appear . Whether such an image actually is developed in the consciousness of the raccoon can not be stated positively . Should an image be formed under such circumstances as stated above it would not necessarily be a free image or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as can be judged , by the general conditions of the experiment and the immediately preceding stimulus of white and orange cards . Where an animal learns to perform a long series of movements it is possible but not probable that anticipatory images of the next stimulus to be reacted to are formed in the animal 's mind and aid him in performing the movements when the trick has only been partly learned . For example , where a monkey or a raccoon is to undo several fastenings in the same order he has pre- // viously followed , he might image the next fastening , but at most there is probably nothing more than an image of the place toward which he is next to turn , as is often the case in our own habitual acts . It is not at all likely that the animal forms a reminiscent image of what he did the other time and then thinks , " I must do the same again , " as a person sometimes does . In learning a series of manual movements or in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before are in us the exception rather than the rule . If one can not go on he is likely to begin again the series and may then know what to do when he comes to the place at which he was previously obliged to stop . If he stops to think instead of beginning to repeat again , he is likely to mentally repeat the first part of the series and may then think of the next thing to do . It is doubtful if animals are ever able to form an anticipatory image of a series of actions to be performed so as to mentally repeat it . If they are , that is one step beyond the anticipatory stage in which images are aroused after part of the series has been reproduced . In other words , animals rarely or never have a train of thought . It is true that animals do frequently repeat the first part of a series of movements when at any stage they are unable to go on successfully . This was an especially marked feature of the behavior of Watson 's rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point than at the usual entrance , if they could not at once find their way to the center where the food was , nearly always went back to the original starting point . This motor repetition is an earlier stage of development than that of mental repetition , which is probably possible to man only . // Evidently the kind of association formed in this type of image formation is that of contiguity only , and there is not necessarily any analysis of the whole situation into the elements involved in the situation or the series . In our own case images are frequently brought to mind by concentration of attention upon some one element of what is in consciousness until that brings into mind an image connected with that element in some other situation . In other words , images are brought to our mind by association of similarity . Images when thus brought into mind are to sonic extent free images since they are brought in by a portion of a new situation instead of by a reproduction of a group , a series , or situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images are rarely or never brought into the minds of animals in this way and consequently they have few if any free images . It is difficult , however , to distinguish clearly between images that are brought into consciousness by analysis of the present situation and those that are brought in by the similarity of the whole situation or of the dominant portion of it to the situation with which the image had been associated and of which it was a prominent feature . It is also sometimes difficult to distinguish between a case of association by similarity and a case of lack of discrimination between two things that resemble each other as wholes though they differ in many respects . Several experimenters with animals report that animals that have been drilled in undoing fastenings attack entirely new fastenings by methods that have been found successful with the old and thus usually learn to undo them more quickly . This indicates a partial analysis of the situation . // The fact , however , that if the new fastening demands an opposite mode of treatment , the animal requires a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not analyzed the situation so as to find the exact points of similarity and dissimilarity as a person might do . He has . perhaps analyzed the case sufficiently to at once attack the fastening , but not definitely enough to know in what direction to move it . Most of the so-called memories of animals probably do not involve images , and are therefore more nearly allied to habit reactions . The animal is readily changed by an experience and may retain the modification for a considerable time , so that when a portion of the situation is reproduced the appropriate reaction at once follows . An animal that has quickly learned a trick may perform it after a long interval when again confronted with the proper situation . This does not necessarily imply , however , that he has ever mentally performed the trick in the meantime ; nor does it necessarily imply that the performance of other tricks at another time and place has caused him to form images of the one previously learned . Mental images of animals , so far as they have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being repeated , especially to the movements which the animal himself is to make . The fact that dogs sometimes seem to dream is not a positive proof of image formation and memory . It is more probable that the movements are produced by sensations arising from the physiological condition of the animal and from external stimulation , Movements of various kinds may be produced in persons who are // asleep , especially habitual ones , such as turning over in response to a certain touch . It is worthy of note that in such cases there is usually no memory of dreaming ; while in most instances of dreaming , with its image formation , there is no movement , and if movement occurs , the dream usually ceases . This is additional evidence that the apparatus concerned in image formation is different from that directly concerned in performing movements . Memory usually involves the production of images , and the process by which they are brought into consciousness conforms to the same laws that govern habitual acts . When not only movements but images are reproduced , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " habit . " In the common characteristic of retaining and reproducing former experiences there is no difference between memory and habit . Memory is usually the result of few repetitions , while habits are the result of many . Habits when fully developed involve no images , while memory involves images or concepts . There is another characteristic of memory which is probably more primitive than that of image formation . It is recognition or a feeling of familiarity . This feeling differs somewhat from anticipatory images in that some of the things leading to the result produce a feeling of familiarity as they are experienced , which may or may not be accompanied by anticipatory images . Memory of this type differs but little from recognition in perception . This feeling of familiarity doubtless appears very early in animal life . It is contrasted with the feeling of strangeness , which , as we have already seen , is one of the most common excitants of fear . Animals probably have this // feeling of familiarity to as great an extent as do men , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in ours , by the thought that the object has been experienced before . Recognition may occur for things that have been perceived once or many times , and one 's attitude toward the object may persist without definite intellectual accompaniments . For example , the writer once recognized a face in an audience as familiar , was sure that the person had been well known to him and was regarded in a friendly but not wholly trustful way , but was unable to recollect any one definite thing regarding the person until afterward , when he met him and heard his name . Recognition in the form of persistence in an attitude toward a person or thing is doubtless a prominent feature of animal memory , which the many stories of elephants and other creatures revenging themselves upon persons who have injured them years before , illustrate . In human psychology a mental process is not supposed to be a memory unless it is not only reproduced but is known as a former mental state that can be contrasted with the present one . This kind of memory probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of memory is possible are there produced what may be called reminiscent images , in the production of which one does not entirely lose consciousness of the present but has a feeling of contrast between the past and the present circumstances . There is no good reason for believing that any animal possesses memory in this , its true form . Another element in memory of great importance in man is that of location of the reproduced experience as having // occurred at a certain time or place or in connection with certain other experiences of one 's own . This kind of memory implies the existence of free images and a further consciousness of the relation of images to each other . Hence memory in this sense is probably not found in animals . Concepts and Reasoning Since concepts represent a higher stage of psychical development than free images , and since we have already decided that animals can have very few free images , it at once follows that we conclude that they have no concepts . It is worth while , however , to devote a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate that animals have concepts or general ideas , or at least what Romanes calls " recepts . " There is no question whatever that animals do react to classes of objects in ways as definitely fitting as they do to individual objects . Each species of animals reacts to the enemies of its species and to classes of food suitable to it . Birds react to liquids , when alighting , in a different way from what they do to solids . This has been supposed by Romanes to indicate the existence of general ideas of each group of objects as a class . The term " instinctive percepts " is doubtless however a better name to apply to the mental state involved in the action . There is no reason to suppose that the mental state arises except when a sensory stimulus is received and a reaction is to be made . In many cases a reaction to the members of a class does not differ from the reactions to an individual of the class simply because there is no discrimination of the finer differences // between individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . In cases of acquired modes of reaction to a class of objects , as , for example , the avoidance of all men by birds , the mental state is probably better described by the term " acquired perception " than by the word " concept . " If an individual bird has learned to respond to one specific individual in a different manner from that used to other members of the class , we have simply an instance of an acquired perception more definite in its character than that indicated by the reaction to the members of a group . In this , as in the other case , the mental state is probably never aroused except by sensory stimulation . Reasoning , in the sense of responding to a situation in a way that has previously brought satisfactory results , is shown by animals as well as by man ; but reasoning in the sense of analyzing a situation , and identifying the element upon which results depend , is probably never shown . Most untrained persons do much of their reasoning from particular to particular without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same is true of a good deal of the reasoning of many cultured people . The so-called " reasoning " of animals is somewhat similar to this kind of reasoning in man , the chief difference being that similarity of the situation as a whole to a previous situation is to a greater extent the basis of reasoning in animals , while in man it is not only the situation as a whole but specific things or characteristics in that situation that are made the basis of the inferences . In both men and animals the most fundamental basis of all reasoning is found in the general law of habit , which // produces a tendency to do the same thing under the same circumstances , that is strong in proportion as the situation and act have been repeated many times , recently and with intensity . Where the situation and the act are exactly the same , we speak of any particular performance as an habitual act . When there are many new elements in the situation and in the act , and when some specific element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has never previously been associated with the present situation , the act is usually supposed to indicate reasoning . Much of the discussion regarding the possibility of animals reasoning is meaningless because of differing conceptions of what constitutes reasoning . There are many instances of animal and human behavior that on the surface look like reasoning , in the sense that a situation only partly like one previously met is reacted to in the way that previously brought favorable results . The stricter psychological definition of reasoning , however , demands that the situations shall have been analyzed and a free idea of its essential element compared with an abstract general truth regarding such element and situation . Our previous study has shown that free ideas are rarely or never possessed by animals , and that abstract ideas are utterly impossible to them . It follows , therefore , that they can not reason in the stricter meaning of the word " reason . " That animals and persons who can do little or no reasoning , in the strict meaning of the word , can profit by former experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be doubted . In the case of animals this can only be done when their senses are actually being affected , while in human beings it may be done by means of images of // concrete situations . The real difference between reasoning and other processes that accomplish similar results is much the same as is recognized in general psychology in distinguishing thinking from perception and imagination , and as is emphasized in a subsequent chapter in distinguishing the conceptual from the representative and sensory motor types of intelligence . VOLITIONAL ACTIVITY Interest and attention are objectively indicated when one stimulus appears to dominate the activity of an animal in spite of other stimuli that are being received . Even as low a creature as the paramecium may , when feeding , fail to react to rather intense stimulations of heat or light that would ordinarily produce marked reactions . When there is any consciousness accompanying this objective attitude of interest and attention it is doubtless concerned wholly with the dominant stimulus and the reaction being made to it . In such cases as this , however , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very doubtful whether there is any mental state accompanying the act . Where the stimulus dominating activity is suggestive rather than immediate , as when a cat is watching and creeping toward a bird , it is probable that there is a conscious state accompanying the attitude and that this conscious state consists largely of a feeling of attraction and expectation and a more or less definite anticipatory image of the result to be obtained . Attention to immediate stimuli is probably always // reflex or instinctive , while that to suggestive stimuli may be either instinctive or acquired . Interest is instinctive in the sense that the creature is so organized that certain kinds of stimuli tend to dominate his activity even though others of equal or greater intensity are being received at the same time . The structure and conditions of life of each species have made it necessary that they should be more sensitive to some kinds of stimuli than to others . For example , a small moving object of any kind is an especially strong stimulus to a cat , and for the time being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive interest in objects moving swiftly over them , while they have an acquired interest in the movements of persons who have frequently brought them food . In general , both instihctive and acquired interest are more or less closely connected , either with the immediate satisfaction of needs or with things that are means to the satisfaction of some instinctive need . In animals , therefore , interest and attention are connected almost exclusively with the satisfaction of biological needs , while in man , interest in the satisfaction of mental needs plays a large part . On the mental side the most elementary phenomenon of interest probably consists in a mere feeling of attraction . In a higher stage of development there is a vague anticipatory image of the general character of the result to be experienced . In a still higher stage of development there is a more definite anticipatory image of the result and some images of what will lead to it . The higher animals may have some interest of this sort , though representations of just what leads to the result are probably few // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus is present . In man the exact result to be obtained and the elements leading to that result may be represented with a great deal of definiteness , and memory images may be formed of parts of a number of experiences , and related to each other in such a way as to bring about the desired result in the present situation . Such a mental state is by no means universal in the attentive activity of man . Much of our attention is not accompanied by these conscious states , although the fact that when observed they are prominent features of consciousness is likely to lead us to think that they are always so . Such attention as this evidently involves association of similarity and numerous free images and ideas . Hence attention in this sense is almost if not wholly impossible for animals . Animals usually respond almost immediately to the stimulus that , because of its objective strength or because of the instinctive or acquired tendency in the animal , is at the time the strongest . There is therefore no opportunity for deliberation and formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained under the present circumstances . Occasionally , animals do pause for a moment under the influence of two stimuli , either of which if received alone would immediately dominate action . For example , a dog that is chasing some hogs may stop when he hears his master 's call , and for a while it is uncertain as to whether he will continue chasing the hogs or return to his master . Such a pause might be supposed to be occupied with the formation of images of the results of the two courses of action , but it is probable // that such imagery is almost if not wholly lacking . That the action of the animal is dominated by sensory stimuli rather than by images , is indicated by the fact that the pause is readily converted into vigorous action in one direction or the other by a supplementary stimulus , such as the passing of a hog near the dog , or a louder call from the master . In some instances , however , when there is no prominent external stimulus perceptible to man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go and do something . In such cases there may be a sensory stimulus unperceived by the human observer that directs the action of the animal , but it is also possible that in some instances imagery of some kind may play a part in initiating and directing the activity of the animal . It is probably true that in many instances the physiological condition of the animal , as for example a state of hunger , initiates the action . Perhaps there is an anticipatory image of the place or direction in which to go to find satisfaction of the physiological need , but the more specific direction of movements is later determined by the stimuli that are received as the animal moves from place to place . An animal may thus go where he has previously hunted , but the actual hunting is probably directed , not by images , but by sensory stimulations as they come to him . Instinct and habit , rather than memory , usually if not always direct the action of even the higher animals . A dog when hungry will go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may see food placed in a new position and show no evidence of any consciousness of it afterward unless his senses are actually affected by it . This was // clearly shown by experiments upon a very clever dog that was very fond of candy . When the word " candy " was spoken he would go to places where he had previously obtained candy ; but if a piece of candy were given him from a bag and the bag placed on a chair , the word " candy , " uttered a few minutes later , would not cause him to go to the bag but to the usual place where candy had been found . From the above , it is clear that if representation of more than one end or of more than one means of obtaining an end is necessary to an act of will , then animals can show very little if any volitional activity . They may persist in trying to reach an end , and in doing so use various means ; but the means to be used are usually suggested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than by specific images and memories . It is true that the actions of human beings , especially of children , are directed in a similar manner ; but it is also true that in their minds specific images are likely to play some part in all deliberative action , and in many instances images and ideas play the whole part at the time , the movements corresponding to the decision being made only after a long interval .

CHAPTER IX TYPES OF ADAPTIVE ACTIVITY OR INTELLIGENCE A BROADER CONCEPTION OF INTELLIGENCE THE word " intelligence " always implies the adaptation of means to ends , but it has usually been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology , and biology may find a common ground for the consideration of behavior it is necessary that either the term " intelligence " shall be given a broader meaning , some differentiating term like " adaptation " be used , or some new term invented to indicate the most prominent characteristic of all organs and organisms , i.e. that of activity suited to self-preservation . The word " Organoses " would be a good word to indicate organic activity , whether conscious or unconscious , including the original meanings of the two terms " neuroses " and " psychoses . " The author for present purposes , however , prefers to extend the meaning of the word " intelligence " so as to include unconscious as well as conscious activities that are suited to the preservation of organic unity . Having recognized the common characteristic of all organic activity , it will be possible to classify activities according to the way in which they secure the preservation of the organisms . Our previous study of behavior has shown that the difference between actions of lower and higher animals is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which it is gained . Plants gain the end of // // preservation chiefly by means of slow growth activities , while animals use to a considerable extent organs of movement in preserving life . Higher animals store up in their systems the results of activity in such a way as to be helpful in future preservative acts , and if acts are varied and complex and must be quickly modified to meet changing conditions , as is the case in man , consciousness plays an important part . All of these kinds of activity are intelligent in a high degree in the sense of adapting means to ends . The differences viewed objectively consist chiefly in the number of adaptations and the quickness and accuracy with which they are made and modified . By thus extending the meaning of the word " intelligence " the truths of several sciences may be brought into intimate relation and their significance better appreciated . In thus classifying the various types of intelligence , familiar psychological classifications may be used and shown to have a more fundamental basis than has usually been supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important influences upon mental processes , determining whether conscious processes shall or shall not be intelligent in the sense of being well adapted to the securing of ends . In the treatment here proposed , physiological activity , instead of being regarded simply as influencing mental activity , will be considered as one type of intelligence . The other types of intelligence will correspond quite closely with the old division of intelligence into presentative , representative , and thinking processes . The term " sensory motor " intelligence will be used for the first , " representative " for the second , and " conceptual " for the third . // In our study of typical forms of behavior we found that the dominant form of intelligence in the lower organisms is physiological , while in those a little higher sensory motor intelligence becomes prominent . In the higher species of animals there is perhaps a slight development of representative intelligence , while in man this form of intelligence is very prominent and is supplemented by conceptual intelligence . V ' In our study of the structural basis of behavior we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the nervous system became a more prominent element of the organism as we went upward in the scale of animal life . We found that in man there is a nervous apparatus at different levels , concerned in different kinds of behavior similar to those of the lower animals , and in addition certain apparatus in the cerebrum , either not possessed or possessed only in a slight degree by any other creature than man . r . With such conceptions and classifications it will be much easier to correlate the truths of physiology and psychology , to compare the behavior of lower animals with that of the higher and with that of human beings , and to trace the development of behavior and ideas in individuals . PHYSIOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE Physiological intelligence is shown especially in nutritive and growth processes . At first thought it seems incongruous to speak of physiological processes as intelligent . When , however , we view intelligence in an entirely objective way as the adaptation of means to ends , we find good 26o GENETIC PSYCHOLOGY reason for looking upon physiological processes as highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed by the greatest mechanic or architect . A tree with its beauty and strength may well compare with any structure planned by an architect , and the human body as a machine is far superior to any as yet constructed by man . The engineer who tears down an old bridge and erects a new one while trains are running over it , has performed a remarkable feat , but not so great as that performed by physiological intelligence in directing the processes of growth in which a large number of complex organs are torn down , built up , and increased in size without any interference whatever with their activities or the harmony of their working . Discriminative and selective activity , which chooses from the various substances introduced into the body just the right elements for the building of each organ , is certainly comparable in accuracy to the perceptive judgment of the human builder . The physiological processes by which life and health are maintained are comparable , in the complexity of activities that must be related and harmonized , to the most complex machine constructed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To give a single illustration , no heat-regulating device as yet invented by man will keep a building at a temperature so nearly uniform , amid rapidly changing external conditions , as is the temperature of the body , maintained by physiological intelligence . So perfectly does it perform this function that a variation of only a few degrees in the temperature of the body indicates a serious derangement in the physiological activities . // Physiological processes , as well as other forms of intelligent activity , are subject to modification by experience . The physiological processes correspond to the food , exercise , and climate usual to the individual , but they quickly adjust themselves to changes in any or all of these respects , although such adjustment probably involves a modification of the activity of nearly every gland and organ in the body . The organism may become habituated to the use of drugs p such an extent that a dose that would produce instant death in one unhabituated to their use will have but little effect . Not only may the physiological processes be passively habituated to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be formed . In some instances , instead of becoming accommodated to certain drugs or conditions , there is increased sensitiveness , so that smaller quantities will produce greater effects in an individual who has previously taken the poison or the food in excess than would be produced upon an individual that had never had such experience . This is quite analogous to growth in sensitiveness and discrimination by the senses . In such cases as this , and also in cases of disease , single experiences may produce permanent effects similar to those in conscious memory . A single attack of certain diseases , such as measles , usually renders the individual forever immune to further attacks , just as if the experience were remembered and avoided . In the case of other diseases a single attack renders one ever after more susceptible to the disease , e.g. pneumonia . When subjected to unfavorable conditions , the vital // organs modify their activity until relief is obtained in ways that are analogous to the behavior of the stentor under continued unfavorable stimulation . It is probable that in reacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fixed reflex-like modes of reaction , but that they vary their activity in a way analogous to that of trial movement . However this may be , we know that a change in the activity of any organ or gland is met by corresponding changes in every other part of the body , especially in those parts whose function is most intimately associated with the one first affected , e.g. change in lung activity affects also the organs of circulation and nutrition . The complexity of correlation thus involved is quite comparable to that revealed in the relation of conscious states to each other . We see , therefore , that the phenomenon of physiological intelligence is very similar to that of conscious intelligence . The difference is not so much in the complexity of the activities related and unified in the accomplishment of an end as in the rapidity with which it is done . Where a physiological process requires hours or years , the conscious process may only require seconds or minutes . For example , the various qualities of an article of food may be consciously discriminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a new concept in a few minutes , while the physiological process of separating the particles of food and building them up into the tissues of the body would require hours and days . The physiological processes are worthy of study , not only in themselves , as instances of a high degree of objective intelligence , but because other forms of intelligence are // dependent upon the perfect working of apparatus that is built up and kept in working order by means of physiological processes . The circulatory , respiratory , and digestive , organs , together with the sympathetic nervous system , constitute the apparatus especially concerned in physiological activities . The other portions of the nervous system that are especially concerned in other forms of intelligent activity are perfected and kept in good working order by means of the physiological activities . The physiological apparatus bears much the same relation to the rest of the body that the heating and power plant bears to the various machines in a manufacturing establishment . The relation is more close , however , for not only is power furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in repair and in good working condition by the physiological intelligence . The special physiological activity involved in the functioning of the higher nerve centers must be exceedingly delicate and rapid to make possible the precise and lightning-like activity of conscious processes . In tracing the development from the lower forms upward we note that the chief type of intelligence manifested by the lower animals is physiological ; yet the apparatus concerned in maintaining the life processes becomes more and more complex . The evolution of organs concerned in the higher types of intelligence does not greatly surpass in complexity that shown in the differentiation of vital organs , by means of which physiological intelligence is manifested in the higher animals and in man . In other words , there has been almost as much increase in physiological intelligence , from the lowest animals to man , as there has been in the higher forms of conscious intelligence . // SENSORY MOTOR INTELLIGENCE While physiological intelligence is concerned with the direction of activities taking place within the body in such a way as to preserve life , the sensory motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the body in response to external stimulation in such a way that favorable results may be secured . All immediate responses to sensory stimulation , such as reflexes and perceptions , are under the direction of sensory motor intelligence . Plants and some forms of animals that remain constantly fixed in the same environment and subjected to the same influences , are able to preserve life by means of the slower growth processes of physiological intelligence . Creatures that move , however , are constantly being subjected to new stimulations , which must be responded to in order that life may be successfully maintained . Hence a high degree of development of the sensory motor intelligence , by means of which fitting reactions may be made , is of great advantage in the struggle for existence . Sensory motor intelligence is manifested to some extent by creatures not possessing a distinct nervous and muscular system , but is much more prominent in creatures thus endowed . In its simplest form this kind of intelligence is shown in comparatively uniform reflex movement in response to stimulation and in trial movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single reflex movements , as in a series or combination of such movements that are so related to each other that they all contribute to the same end . This is shown in a remarkable way in instinctive // reactions of all kinds , especially in those made in response to suggestive stimuli and in proper correlation with the physiological condition of the animal at the time . Sensory motor intelligence may be regarded as greatest in acquired reactions to complex and varied situations and in perceptual activity of all kinds . It is manifested in a high degree in all forms of manual work and athletics . The apparatus concerned in sensory motor intelligence in the higher animal consists ( 1 ) of specialized nerve endings , ( 2 ) muscles , ( 3 ) nerve fibers , and ( 4 ) a nerve center . This is the apparatus used in the simplest form of reflex action . In more complex forms of instinctive and perceptual reaction several sense organs , thousands of nerve fibers , a number of nerve centers , and many muscles act together in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order that there may be a high degree of sensory motor intelligence manifested , there must be not only highly specialized sense organs , many muscles , nerve fibers , and nerve centers , but they must all be related to each other in such a way that there is a proper balance or equilibrium of activity , and so that all may act together harmoniously in the accomplishment of an end . Any over-development of any portion of a complex and closely related sensory motor apparatus will give that part undue prominence in determining the direction of activity , while any lack of perfect connection between the parts or in the various adjustments for meeting changing situations will interfere with the successful attainment of ends , e.g. cross eyes may result from over-action of one of two opposing muscles , with the result that the two images are not properly combined and vision is poor . // Although considerable changes in the character of sensory motor reactions may be produced by decrease or increase in the perfectness of the peripheral organs of sensation and motion , yet the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve centers and their connections . These are the parts also most readily changed by exercise , a single unfavorable or favorable experience often producing marked changes in subsequent activity ; e.g. the sight of medicine after a single experience may produce nausea . The connections between centers become more or less close according as impulses passing between them have had favorable or unfavorable results . The close connection between all parts of the nervous system and the readiness with which even the most elementary reflex-like actions are modified by experience so that they can be called into action by impulses from other centers , are well illustrated by experiments upon the tendon reflex or knee jerk . Stratton , who had been carrying on such experiments for some time , accidentally discovered that the mechanism concerned had learned to respond to a suggestive stimulus . In the apparatus used a sound was always made just before the tendon was struck , and after a great many experiments had been made , the apparatus failed to work properly , so that the sound was made but the tendon was not struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same as if the tendon had been directly stimulated . Since the reflex is involuntary and without conscious direction , it must be that the change in reaction so that the movement is made in response to an associated stimulus is a case of unconscious learning by the sensory motor apparatus . // The sensory motor intelligence becomes greater , not only in proportion to the number , variety , complexity , and unity of action of the mechanisms concerned , but in proportion to the readiness with which the apparatus is modified by experience . Since the modification depends largely upon changes in the nerve centers , an increase in the number of nerve centers connected with the sensory motor apparatus would naturally increase the number and rapidity of modifications in activity . In the higher animills and in man there is , therefore , a high degree of sensory motor intelligence . For example , the sensory motor mechanism by means of which a man catches a flying ball , or a swallow a flying insect , is more perfectly adapted for the purpose than any machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , in order that successful reactions may be made to the various situations likely to be met with , is partly developed at birth , while in man it is to a greater extent acquired by experience . The sensory motor intelligence of the bee , by means of which it constructs its comb in such a way as to secure the greatest strength with the smallest amount of material , is , in its success in securing an end , quite comparable to the calculation of the engineer . The bee succeeds in doing this because his sensory motor apparatus is constructed and adjusted in such a way as to produce this definite result . The hawk in swooping upon his prey takes a course which , according to mechanical principles , is known to be most favorable for securing success . In this case success depends not so much upon the structure of the apparatus as upon the rapid making of the proper // adjustments , as the situation varies at each moment . The sensory motor intelligence shown by the goat in leaping with absolute accuracy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite comparable to that of the instruments used by the engineer . Such adjustments as these , and others shown by animals in seeking prey or in avoiding enemies , arc marvelous examples of the adaptation of means to ends favorable to the existence of the animal , that are largely inherited . They are scarcely surpassed by anything that man can do in the way of sensory motor adjustments and only slightly surpassed by his more conscious intellectual activities . Sensory motor activity may or may not be accompanied by consciousness . The accuracy with which such activity is carried on is in many instances decreased rather than increased by consciousness of what is being done , or more especially , consciousness of just how the movements are being made . Instinctive and mechanically habitual acts are usually more perfectly performed when there is little or no consciousness of how they are being done . In the acquisition of new modes of reaction , as previously indicated , consciousness is not necessary , although it may be very helpful . When it is helpful , it is not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the stimuli and movements involved , as it is in showing the results of what has been done and their relation to the end to be gained . The ball player who sees a ball start in a certain direction runs to the exact spot where the ball is to alight , puts out his hands at just the right time , and moves them in just the right way to catch the ball without pain to himself , is not conTYPES // scious of the exact visual and kinaesthetic sensations he is experiencing and the kinds of movement he is making . His consciousness simply tells him what he is trying to do and whether he is approaching success or not . When learning to catch , he was conscious of some of the sensations involved and the kinds of movement to be made , but only of those that were most necessary in modifying his movements so as to be successful . The same truth holds regarding our more conscious actvitics of perception in which movement is not so prominent . In perceiving objects we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only of what they mean in relation to purposes that we are seeking to realize . The same object in different positions and at different distances gives us different sensations , but we are not conscious of these differences only in so far as some practical need may have made discrimination necessary . The image produced on the retina by a rectangular object varies greatly , but the object seems the same to us . It is also true that we may judge with a good deal of accuracy the distance of an object from us and yet be entirely unconscious of the sensations that arc the basis of that judgment . The amount of retinal surface affected , the movements of accommodation , fixation , and the fusion of the two images , as well as variations in brightness and in relation to other stimulating objects , influence our judgments , as is shown by varying the stimulations and movements ; but we are not conscious of the exact sensations involved and of the precise nature of the change that has been produced , but only of the significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTELLIGENCE Imagination and memory are characteristic manifestations of representative intelligence . Unlike sensory motor intelligence , this form is not concerned with present stimulations , but functions by means of stored up impressions received at other times and places . In sensory motor intelligence there is more or less immediate movement so as to properly adjust the body to external stimulations . In representative intelligence there may be no motion made , or if there is , it may be directed in accordance with past impressions rather than according to the stimulations being received at the time . The apparatus concerned in representative intelligence , if not wholly different from that concerned in sensory motor intelligence , at least functions in a different way , so that the result is the same as if the apparatus were wholly different . The apparatus of sensory motor intelligence is modified by experience so that the next time the same external stimuli are received the reaction is different because of the change in the mechanism . For example , a child sees its mother sweeping without making any response at the time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping . Thus the representative apparatus serves as a means of disconnecting sensory activity from motor activity . When the sensory apparatus is stimulated , the motor apparatus is usually called into play ; but where there is a representative apparatus , the impulses originated may pass almost wholly to the representative center and produce modifications in that apparatus with little or no activity of the motor centers . At some future time this activity // of the representative center may be re-excited and impulses sent to the motor center , producing movements which might have occurred in the original experience had there been no representative center to divert the impulse and disconnect the sensory stimulus and the motor response . The possession of representative intelligence makes it possible , not only for movements to be directed by past experiences instead of by present stimulations , but it makes economy of movement possible , images taking the place of actual movement . In trying to open a fastening , an animal or a child manipulates it in various ways , until , by chance , the right movement is made ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what holds it , and represent the effect of.woving any part of it , and then make just the one movement necessary to undo the fastening . A small child , in putting boxes of different sizes one within another , pushes them together in various ways until they happen to be properly turned and one goes inside of the other . In piling up blocks he also tries various blocks for a given place . An older child will look at the boxes and see how they must be turned in order that one may go inside of the other , without making the various trial movements ; and in using blocks he looks at the various blocks before him and , without picking up each one and trying it , selects the right1 one to fill the place . If there is none before him that will fit , he may go into another room and get a block which he remembers to have left there and put it in place . Lindley , in his experiments with a puzzle , the lines of which were traced without raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw lines , while older people represented the result of drawing lines from various points and sometimes // drew only after they had solved the puzzle by means of mental images or concepts . Representative intelligence is not only a means of directing movements without present stimulation and of economizing movements , both of which are of considerable value in the struggle for existence , but it also serves as a means of satisfying psychical needs . When this form of intelligence has developed , pleasure and pain not only have a biological value in promoting activity that is favorable to selfpreservation , but they have a psychical value , ministering to the mental needs of the individual . Representation of past experiences makes it possible to experience again the pleasure and pain that formerly accompanied them . These feelings are often heightened by contrast between the present and former situation . In thus reproducing past experience a pleasurable outcome may be emphasized and the painful experience leading to it utilized for contrast , so the memories of painful experiences may sometimes be enjoyed in retrospect . It is also possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in our daydreams and in our ambitious plannings into representations of a possible future . In man it is certainly true that the pleasures of reminiscence and of imagination are , in the sum total , greater than the pleasure of actual sensory experience . ZEsthetic pleasure also depends largely upon representative activity . It is impossible for animals , none of which have representative intelligence developed to any considerable extent , to experience the pleasures of reminiscence or dreams of the future . Their pleasures must be derived from senTYPES // sory stimulations and anticipatory or perceptual images immediately excited by such stimulation . This is all that is required for the biological ends of self-preservation in animals , but man 's psychical welfare demands more . The practical value to man of representative intelligence is shown not only in directing and economizing movements in the usual situations , but also in learning to meet new ones . Without this form of intelligence , little or nothing can be learned except by actual performance by the individual , resulting more or less accidentally in success . A creature possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , in other words , by imitation . It is possible thus to gain images by which i ovements may be directed without the more direct sensory experience of making the movement . This is of great help , not only in eliminating useless trial movements in learning any given mode of reaction , but it is a short cut to developing the representative apparatus so that it may , under various circumstances , effectively direct movements in new situations involving some of the same elements . The possibilities of representative intelligence are very much increased by the fact that impressions may be associated with sensory symbols which will serve to arouse representative activity in the same way as do sensory experiences of the objects and movements themselves . There is almost no limit to the possibility of arousing the representative apparatus to activity in any desired way by means of symbols , especially visual and auditory words . It is possible for a creature possessing representative intelligence to thus learn from the experiences of others without himself observing those experiences . Knowledge T // of favorable or unfavorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may thus be gained without actually going through the experience and even without seeing another go through it . Representative intelligence therefore has great biological value as well as psychical value to a social creature such as man . Animals may receive warning of danger by seeing or hearing companions trying to escape , but man may get a very definite idea of a danger and of how to avoid it by means of oral or written words . The difference between man and even the highest animals is very clearly evident when we review what may be done by a creature possessing representative intelligence and observe to how slight an extent do animals show evidence of any such form of activity . Even the very simplest form of representative intelligence , that of learning by the experience of another , is , as we have already seen , not shown in the imitation of new acts by animals observed under experimental conditions . The common experience of persons familiar with animals will also verify this statement , that one animal rarely learns by the experience of another . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished in the presence of a companion , he alone , and not the companion who saw the act performed , learns to avoid that act . In the lower races of nian and in the lower types of individuals among civilized men , deficiency in representative intelligence is shown especially in the lack of provision for the future , even though the necessity of such provision would seem to have been taught by previous painful experience . Present experiences largely dominate the activity , and reminiscences of the remote past and anticipations for the distant future have little influence upon conduct . // In lower grades of idiocy there is such a complete absence of representative intelligence that learning is wholly by the trial and success method . Such an individual may try again and again to put a large object in a small hole or a hole of a different shape . In an individual of a little higher type the lowest form of representative intelligence may be shown in a high degree of ability to imitate sounds and movements of others . In such cases , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act . They do not result in the power to perform the act when it is not being observed or , if they do , it is perf i-med literally and without variation to meet new situations , and without selection of parts of the act and their combination into new and complex forms of action . CONCEPTUAL INTELLIGENCE This form of intelligence includes what is usually described in psychology as thinking processes , such as abstraction , generalization , conception , judgment , and reasoning . Like representative intelligence , it functions by means of past experiences instead of present stimulations . It is further removed from sensory motor activity than are representative processes . It involves a finer analysis of situations and a separation of elements , not only from many particular situations , but from any combination in which they have been experienced . It involves a re-grouping of elements , not as they are found grouped in objects and situations , but according to similarities and in relations by which purposes may be served . The apparatus concerned in conceptual activity is , in // part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is primarily excited to action by impulses from the representative centers . The conceptual apparatus is capable of more finely differentiated activity and of very much greater capacity for rapid and various adjustments , and exercises a much greater influence in directing and unifying other activities . The final motor reaction to a situation may be objectively the same when determined by conceptual intelligence as when directed by representative or perceptual intelligence . For example , in jumping from a moving car an animal or a person may respond to the sensory stimuli involved in the situation in accordance with many experiences of jumping from cars with more or less favorable results . A person without much experience of this kind may direct his movements in accordance with a mental image of the movements he has seen made by other persons under similar circumstances , while a person who had never had ' any experience in alighting from a moving object , and had never seen any other person perform the act , might direct his movements in accordance with his general knowledge of the laws governing moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car is moving , just as did the others . The ideas of force , direction , gravity , etc. , used by the one who directs his activity by conceptual intelligence have been derived from sensory and representative experiences , but they are entirely free from connection not only with any particular kind of situation but from any object or place . In performing an act like that described above , conceptual intelligence is likely to be less successful than either // representative or sensory motor , yet it is capable of serving practical purposes in entirely new situations , while sensory motor intelligence is effective only where the individual has himself had a great deal of experience of just that kind , and while representative intelligence would be of little value if fe individual had not himself had similar experiences or had not had the opportunity to observe how others meet such a situation . The less the accomplishment of an end involves the direct placing of materials by one 's own movements , the less effective his sensory motor intelligence and the more effective the conceptual intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a way is to be found across a stream , a creature possessing perceptive intelligence only will run up and down the stream , going out on points , stones , or logs , and may thus accidentally find a means of getting across . A person possessing representative intelligence , without necessarily going to the various projecting points , would look to see if there were any passage across . If there were not , he might , without going to them , look to see if there were any boards or logs that could be placed across projecting points and stones in such a way as to make a bridge , or he might remember that there was such material to be obtained , and judge of its fitness by comparing his mental image of it with the spaces to be bridged . An engineer , on the other hand , directing his activities by conceptual intelligence , might , by the use of his transit and mathematical calculations , determine the distance to be bridged , and kind and dimensions of materials needed to construct a bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would pass over it , and send an order to the city for the materials and workmen . He could do this without definitely imaging the materials needed and the movements involved in placing them . The symbols used by him take the place of objects , and in his consciousness concepts may wholly take the place of images . If a fire breaks out in a city , a creature possessing sensory motor intelligence acts only when his senses are directly affected by the fire or the actions of companions , while one possessing representative intelligence may respond to the cry of fire without directly perceiving it , perhaps by sitting still and picturing in detail the flames , curling smoke , falling buildings , the rushing crowd , etc. ; while one dominated by conceptual intelligence may note the number of the fire signal , think of the direction of the wind , and without any detailed imaging , know at once that the building that he is in is threatened and then take the proper means to secure his safety . He can thus grasp the essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a danger that he has neither directly perceived nor definitely imaged . He could perhaps image the details , but under the circumstances it would be a waste of time and energy to do so . In dealing with abstractions images may be a hindrance , e.g. in geometrical reasoning figures are conceived without color , weight , taste , etc. , and reasoning is then made much simpler and more accurate . Many people engaged a great deal in mathematical and other forms of abstract reasoning often lose the habit and sometimes the power of imaging . Conceptual activity therefore plays the same part in making images unnecessary that representative activity plays in avoiding useless movements . // Conceptual intelligence not only makes it possible to accomplish some purposes more quickly and effectively than by sensory motor or representative intelligence , and to meet new situations which could not be reacted to effectively by any other form of intellectual process , but it er , libles one to go beyond what can be experienced or even represented . It is possible to perceive or to represent two , three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are properly grouped . It would not be possible either to perceive or to represent a million objects as a million , though it would be possible , by spending a number of days , to perceive or represent a series of objects amounting in number to a million . One can , however , in a moment form an accurate conception of a million and almost as easily of a million million . To conceive of an object as a million times as large as the largest object that has ever been seen or one millionth the size of the smallest object that has ever been observed , is not difficult , but to represent such objects is utterly impossible . We can not represent space- as having more than three dimension , but the mathematician readily conceives such a space and has determined the mathematical laws of its relations with as much certainty as those of a space of three dimensions . The fact that conceptual intelligence can deal with relation regardless of things gives it this power . As already noted , auditory and visual symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free elements from particular situations , and making . it possible for an individual to profit by the experiences of others through the medium of words . The part played by symbols in conceptual processes is even more impor280 GENETIC PSYCHOLOGY tant . Without words , there could be very little conceptual activity , and some persons think there could be none . Words may be introduced into any situation , and any element or relation of elements that has received attention may be associated with a word , which then serves to present it to consciousness in the absence of that situation . Elements of various situations that have become freed from their associates by means of words may be combined in any desired way and the combination associated with and held together by means of a word . Words thus serve to organize the elements of experience , and it becomes possible for the concept thus formed to function independently of any particular situation and obviates the necessity of forming images of the elements from which the concept was formed . Without words , by means of which elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of elements held together and organized , the development of concepts would be almost if not quite impossible . The possibilities of the human brain as a mechanism of intelligence are still further increased by grouping a large number of ideas that for certain purposes may be considered as alike , and letting some symbol stand for that group of ideas which may then be treated just as if it were a single idea . A single word thus takes the place of a large number of images . The thought of a sentence held in mind by a single word may take the place of the whole sentence . In a similar way the thoughts of a paragraph , of a chapter , of a book , or even of entire departments of science may be held in mind by means of a title or name and may be considered for certain purposes as a unit to . TYPES OF ADAPTIVE ACTIVITY OR INTELLIGENCE 281 be compared with other paragraphs , chapters , books , or departments of science . By means of this power of selecting and grouping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the most complex situations with much greater accuracy than would be possible by means of hours or perhaps months of sensory motor and representative activity . The architect and the engineer may thus , in a few days , plan in detail structures that will require months of sensory motor and representative activity of an army of men to execute . THE FOUR TYPES OF INTELLIGENCE IN MAN In man we find all four types of intelligence manifested . He possesses physiological intelligence in a high degree . He can live in every variety of climate , and can adapt himself to sudden changes and endure fatigue as well , if not better , than any other animal . In sensory motor intelligence , also , man is not inferior to the most gifted of the animals , although some of them surpass him in special forms of accurate movement and in discriminative ability , yet in general he is capable of acquiring variety and precision of movement and discrimination not surpassed by any . As to representative and conceptual intelligence , even the highest animals show little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings are endowed with these various forms of intelligence in greatly differing degrees . Those who are favored with a high degree of physiological intelligence have the strength , energy , and endurance for // accomplishing many and difficult tasks . All the vital organs , the heart , lungs , and digestive system , are perfectly developed , capable of sustained and harmonious activity , susceptible to adaptive changes and capable of retaining permanently , acquired modifications . The one thus endowed by heredity and by normal healthful growth and development has an admirable foundation for success in physical and mental activities . Unless thus endowed one can not reach the highest degree of success , yet the mere possession of such a physiological endowment does not insure efficiency in other forms of intelligence . One endowed with exceptionally perfect sensory motor apparatus , accurately adjusted , is capable of responding to immediate sensory stimulation with extraordinary rapidity and accuracy . Such a one may execute with the greatest ease and accuracy the most difficult forms of responsive and constructive activity . The athlete , the skilled artisan , artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus that makes it possible for them to do with ease what would be utterly impossible , even after long practice , to others with less perfect sensory motor apparatus of the kind needed ; e.g. the construction of the throat makes the sounding of high notes easy to one and utterly impossible to others . On the other hand , deficiency in the sensory motor apparatus does not necessarily mean deficiency in the other forms of intelligence . Persons of health and vigor may be clumsy and slow in their sensory motor reactions , and those with deficient sense organs or with imperfect muscular development may possess an unusual degree of representative or conceptual intelligence . Even the entire ' T ' ; ? ES OF ADAPTIVE ACTIVITY OR INTELLIGENCE 283 absence of some of the special senses is no absolute bar to the working of the representative and thinking intelligence . If there is sufficient external stimulation to start the development of the representative and conceptual centers of the cortex , they may continue their activity and development independently . This is shown in a striking way in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter of whom , though deprived of the two senses most used by human beings , has attained a development of representative and conceptual intelligence far superior to that of the average human being . One who is highly endowed with vigorous representative centers is capable of imaging with great vividness and of reproducing past experiences after either long or short periods of time with great accuracy . There are individuals who are capable of producing such clear images , as , for instance , that of the printed page , that they can examine its parts with almost as much ease as is possible in ordinary sense perception . There have also been persons who could read a book through once , and then repeat it word for word . Other individuals possess extraordinary facility in producing and combining in all sorts of ways images of various kinds , as is perhaps best shown in imaginative literature , but it is also shown in many practical and scientific inventions . Conceptual intelligence , which depends upon the possession and effective working of the conceptual centers , may be possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially endowed with the other forms of intelligence , and even in cases where they are deficient in physiological , sensory motor and imaginative activity . A // good philosopher may have little physical endurance , slight sensory motor skill and little or no power of imagination , and yet he may reason correctly regarding all forms of activity . When , however , the physiological intelligence fails to keep the conceptual apparatus in good working order , there is immediate decrease in conceptual intelligence . It is safe to say that the great men of the world have usually been highly endowed with all forms of intelligence . They have been able to produce and expend in the most economical way a large amount of muscular and nervous energy , have possessed strength and skill , and have been able to direct their imaging and thinking effectively , not only because they possessed all types of intelligence , but because these types were harmoniously combined .

CHAPTER X TYPES OF LEARNING ACTIVITY NATURE OF LEARNING IN correspondence with the broader meaning of intelligence adopted in the preceding chapter , the idea of what is meant by learning must be enlarged . Each organism and each organ has characteristic modes of functioning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning , whether it be in an amoeba or in man , in a vital organ like the heart , or in an organ of consciousness such as the cortex , is , in the broader meaning of the word , an instance of learning . In this broader sense the stomach learns to digest certain kinds of food and the lungs to function in a certain kind of air , as truly as the conceptual centers learn to deal with the truths of a special science . The chief difference in the different types of learning is that in some cases activities already organized are modified by experience , while in others the activities are organized by experience . The organization of the physiological apparatus and , to a considerable extent , of the sensory motor apparatus is nearly complete at an early age in animals and children , largely as the result of inherited growth tendencies , while the activities of the representative and conceptual centers are for a long period being organized chiefly by experience . For this reason physiological learning and sensory motor learning are largely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then later of modifying the activities of parts and their relations to each other , while representative and conceptual learning consist mainly of acquiring new forms of organized activity . In the lower animals learning consists chiefly of modification of apparatus already organized , but in the higher there is much more organization of new activities . In a broad way all learning is the result of activity in response to the particular environment in which the creature lives . It is brought about by variations in the kind , relative strength , and order of stimuli exciting activity . In the case of the various organs of the body the learning is frequently not in direct response to a stimulating environment , but is produced indirectly by the modified activity of some other organ or organs . The stomach functions somewhat differently when one uses his brain a great deal than it does when he is engaged in hard manual labor ; the muscles of one arm are modified by the exercise of the other , and the development of conceptual and sensory centers is closely correlated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of all activities is somewhat different in different stages of development , the modification produced by a certain kind of stimulus will not be the same at one stage as at another . Foods and modes of treatment favorable to the physical and mental development in one stage of growth may be very harmful in a different stage , hence an effective mode of learning in one stage of development may be very ineffective when a different stage has been reached . // For the purposes of this chapter , learning is used broadly to include habit formation as well as the more or less consciously directed activities that precede the formation of many habits . THE PHYSIOLOGICAL TYPE OF LEARNING Physiological processes are sufficiently organized at birth to maintain life . The lungs begin to function as soon as the air enters them , and in a similar way appropriate food is digested and assimilated . These processes are doubtless perfected somewhat by exercise , but physiological learning consists chiefly in adaptation of these processes for the good of the organism , according to the kind and amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climatic influences of heat , light , and moisture , electric conditions , density and purity of air , etc. , and according to the kind and amount of exercise given the various organs directly and in correlated activity with other organs . Very important physiological changes are produced by residing in different climates and by engaging in different forms of activity , but physiological intelligence directs and unifies these changes for the good of the organism . People living in different parts of the world and engaged in different occupations are on the whole surprisingly similar in size , strength , and length of life , although differences in complexion and other minor characteristics are marked . This is one evidence of the extent to which physiological intelligence unifies and adapts changed activities so as to preserve life and health . Other evidence is furnished by cases in which the most harmful drugs , vitiated air , and // improper exercise are sometimes taken for a long period of time without destroying life . So great are the gradual modifications sometimes produced that a sudden change to normal food conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of this extraordinary power of the physiological activities to become adapted to the conditions to which they are exposed for a long time , it is difficult for physiologists to determine even by careful experiment what kinds of food and exercise are best for an individual . It is hard to tell whether the seemingly favorable or unfavorable results of a change in food and exercise are an indication of their natural suitability or unsuitability , or are merely the result of a change in previous physiological habits . As a result of experience every organ , muscle , and gland , even to the smallest blood vessel , forms habits of acting in a certain way with a certain degree of vigor and perhaps at certain times . Any change in hours of sleeping , eating , or working may therefore produce considerable derangement of the physiological processes . Irregular eating and spasmodic activity are therefore very unfavorable to health , especially in individuals who have been very systematic and regular . Physiological learning involves not only the perfecting and modification of the activities of the vital organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of their activities to the activities of other organs , especially to those of the various nerve centers . It is a we-established fact that whenever any portion of the body is active , whether it be a gland , a muscle , or a nerve center , there is increased circulation of blood in that part . Although changes in u // circulation take place with considerable rapidity , there is reason to believe that habits of sending blood in increased quantities to certain organs may be established by using those organs at certain times . The greater effectiveness with which the brain works at certain times of the day may therefore be regarded as a result , in part at least , of circulatory habits that have been established . So closely are all activities influenced by physiological habits that expenditure and conservation of energy , sobriety , sensuality , cheerfulness , melancholy , physical and mental slowness or quickness , are in part the result of the acquisition of certain physiological habits . Since the physiological activities are the earliest to become organized , it follows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first few years . Proper food and exercise and regularity in taking them are therefore the chief forms of learning to be desired in the early years . If a child of six has good physiological habits so that every organ of his body is in good working condition and in harmonious relation with every other part , it makes little difference , so far as his future intellectual achievements are concerned , what the amount or character of his knowledge may be at that age . The response of the stomach , so that the mere sight or odor of food that has previously made one ill causes nausea , is a result of physiological learning in man , quite comparable to the learning of the crab to respond to the placing of a screen that preceded feeding ; while the readiness of the stomach for food at accustomed times is comparable to the sensitiveness of snails and sea anemones to waves at the time of high tide and to the coming of animals for food at // certain times . In all such cases the learning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning is chiefly a process of establishing relations between sense and motor organs in the nerve centers of the spinal cord , the basal ganglia , and the sense and motor centers of the cortex . In so far as these connections are formed by the processes of growth without much stimulation , they are largely physiological . Reflex and instinctive movements , such as sucking , moving the eyes in a coordinated way , crying , cooing , sitting , creeping , standing , walking , and climbing , are partly provided for by inherited structure and inner laws of growth , but they are perfected more quickly by the ordinary stimuli than they would be if such stimuli were absent . If healthy activity of the nervous and muscular system is maintained , these movements may be made as the result of growth processes without any necessity of actual practice in making them . Special practice hastens the learning of movements , and in the case of human beings some of them , e.g. walking , might , without definite practice , often fail to be acquired . Sensory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimuli not usually reacted to by the species and sometimes in learning to make movements unusual for the species . Sometimes both the stimulus and the form of movement are new , as when a dog learns to walk on his front feet in response to a word . In animals sensory motor learning consists chiefly in developing more highly than is usual for the species , the
