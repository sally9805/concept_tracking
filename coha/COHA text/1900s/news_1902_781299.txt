txt Lawyer Albert T. Patrick , for the past nine weeks on trial . charged with the murder of Millionaire William Marsh Rice , on Sept. 2 : : , 1900 , was found guilty late yesterday afternoon by the jury after less than two hours ' deliberation  --  the record time in this county for arriving at a verdict in a criminal case of this importance . only two ballots were taken . The first stood Seven to five for conviction . On the second all were agreed . Miss Emma Patrick , the defendant 's sister ; Mrs. Addlie M. Francis , his landlady , with several women friends , were excluded from the courtroom just before the verdict was announced . When they learned the result Airs . Francis fainted , and Miss Patrick , who has borne up bravely during her brother 's trial , collapsed completely and went into hysterics . Recorder lloff began his charge to the jury at 10:4 : immediately after court convened . After complimenting the jurors upon their faithful attention to the testimony during the long trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three OpOSi dons , which , if proved to the jury 's satisfaction beyond all reasonable doubt ; they should return a verdict of guilty ; it not , a verdict or acquittal . These three propositions , the Recorder continued , were , that Jones on Sept. 28 , 11100 , placed a chlAiroformed cone over the face of W. M. ' Rice with intent to kill him ; ( 2 ) that Rice 's death resulted from chloroform poisoning , and no other cause , and ( 3 ) that Patrick instigated , aided , abetted , or procured the commission of the crime by Jones . He declared that in considering the weight to be given Jones 's testimony , his bearing and manner on the stand should be taken into consideration , as well ds his interest , his opportunity for knowledge , his motive , his previous conflicting statements , his insistence that he was now telling the truth , and his frankness in detailing the part he . took in the matter . PATRTCK . AND VALET JONES . Continuing , the court charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder Rice , Patrick was equally guilty with Iona , and that the testimony of the latter , though- a self-confessed murderer , was competent , as one of the perils of committing crime was the danger of betrayal by an associate . The law , he said , required the testimony of an accomplice to be corroborated , but 4. he corroboration need only tend to connect the defendant withthe crime , and must not necessarily of itself be sufficient to prove the defendant guilty . The Recorder finished his direct charge at 12:50 . He then charged thirtythree of the forty-four requests of counsel for the defense , and five supplementary requests . At 1:50 he gave the case to the jury , and it immediate-1 , retired . No ballots were taken or expressions of opinion exchanged , before the jurors were taken to lunch at a nearby restaurant at 2:40 . They returned at 4 o'clock , and the actual deliberation began .

Short and Meyers , the witnesses to Pat ? rick 's will , now under indictment for perjury in connection with their first testimony for Patrick , were also waiting . The jury had agreed at 5:55 . At this moment Thomas E. Kearney , the Recorder 's personal attendant , came from the direction of the jury room and Said : " The ladies in the court room will please retire so that the room may be ventilated . " Not suspecting that a verdict had been arrived at , Miss Patrick led the way to the ante-room adjoining the court room . The great doors were immediately closed behind them , and Capt . Lang of the court squad hurried into the Recorder 's chambers . Those in the court room , at this , surinised that the jury had agreed and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Patrick . the defendant 's father , remained behind with Mr. Hebbard . The jury filed in ? at 5:58 . Patrick , in charge of a court officer , stepped into the room immediately behind the twelve men in whose keeping was his fate . He was waved back by Capt . Lang , and went into the jury room in the rear , where his case had been determined but a few minutes 12efore , to await the coming of his counsel . A fifteen minute wait ensued while Alessrs . Moore and House were sent for . They came in at 0:08 , and the Recorder immediately went upon the bench . Patrick was then brought in . He entered with his frock coat tightly buttoned , his features betraying no nervousness , his right hand caressing his blonde beard . He started to take his usual seat , laying his coat and hat down on the counsel table , as he had done for weeks . He was motioned outside the railing to etand at the bar and hear the verdict . He stood erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at the Court . and then back again at the jurors. He stroked his beard nonchalantly as Clerk Brophy arose and in solemn tones inquired : " Gentlemen of the jury , have you agreed upon a verdict ? " PATRICK STILL UNMOVED . " We heve , " said Foreman A.lachell , and a ripple of excitement rap around the court .. room . Patrick looked around , and for the first time missed his sister and her cornPanions . He took one furtive look at his father , and then faced the jury again . The Recorder cautioned the spectators to remain quiet , and Clerk Brophy , ordering the jury to rise , said : " Jurors , look upon the Prisoner ; prisoner , look upon the jurors . " Patrick gazed unflinchingly at the twelve men as they turned their eyes upon him . " How'say you , gentlemen of the jury ? ? continued Clerk Brophy. " what is your verdict ? " " Guilty . " Foreman Machell said the one word firmly , ' and so as to be heard all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patrick squared his shoulders . " Do you find tiw defendant guilty of murder in the first " degree , as charged in the indictment ? " asked the clerk . Guilty of , murder , " responded the tore . man . Mr. House arose and asked that the jury , be polled . Patrick , stole another look a ( his gray-bearded father . Each juror. at his name was called , answered firmly te the clerk 's query . " That is my verdict . " and in chorus added " So say we all of us. ? Mr. House asked for time in whic , h tt prepare the motions for a new trial an to set aside the verdict . The Recordet granted the request , and set Monday weell as the time of passing sentence . He the , / directed the removal of ? the prisoner . Patrick walked out , head still erect , and motioned to his father as he passed down the prisoners ' passageway to meet him at the door leading to the prison pert . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was halted by a court attendant and had , to sit until . court was adjourned , when he joined his son . In the anteroom Miss Emma Patrick and Mrs. Francis were anxiously awaiting the news . They did not believe the hurried announcements of the newspaper runners passing until Mr. Hebbard came in. alias Patrick . seeing him , anxiously cried , half sobbing . Oh . what is it ? A woman was tightly clasping Miss Patrick 's hands . Mrs. Francis leaned eagerly forward to catch Air . liebbards words . " Guilty. - he almost whispered Miss Pate rick burst into tears and sank into her friend 's arms . Airs Francis without a word fell to the floor in a faint . Court officers brought her water and fanned her , but for ten or fifteen minutes she remained unconscious . She was carried into the courtroom , still unconscious . Miss Patrick followed and threw herself hysterically against the railing where her brother had stood . sobbing bitterly and declaring his innocence . Oh , the devil : The " she sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revive Mrs. Francis . All but the intimate friends of the weeping women turned away from the sight of their grief . Old Capt . Patrick came into the room atter a good-bye to his son and tried to comfort his daughter . - It 's not for me , but for you I feel , " she sobbed . The old man . much affected , consoled his daughter , saying they would try and . everything would be all right , and the court officers kindly closed the doors to keep the morbidly curious from intruding on their sorrow . PRISONER 'S COUNSEL DOWNCAST . Lawyers Moore and House visibly showed their disappointment . - We will make motion to set aside the verdict on Monday week , " said Mr. House . - Of course , we are disappointed . We expected acquittal , or , at the worst . a disagreement . When will ate go to Sing Sing if the motions are denied ? The motions will of course be denied , and after sentence is pronounced the Sneriff may wait ten days before executing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal , and hope to get- it before the Court of Appeals in Septembers We are confident the verdict will not be sustained . " Assistant District Attorneys Osborne and faarvan , who successfully prosecuted the case , had only this to say : - It was a triumph for justice . " Mr. Moore . after speaking a few words of comfort to the weeping women , passed out of the building . Going he met a group of the jurors . He thanked the jurors for their attention , shaking hai , ds with Forernaalachell and others , and expressed to them the hope that next time their verdict would be favorable to his client . The jury expressed regret that their finding had been against him , but declared that it had been in accordance with the testimony . " Well , I think that you would have found otherwise had Mr .. Schepflin 's testimony been admitted , " said Mr. Moore . He was called to the stand , but did not testify . " Several jurymen asked why he did not . and the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court . The Recorder received briefs upon the admission of his testmony , " he explained , because he world not hear oral argument , and then he affirmed his original ruling . He said if we could convince him of his error in excluding it he would rule that it should be admitted . " At the time Mr. Schepflin was called , counsel said they expected to show by him that Mr. Rice had told him that he ( Rice ) intended changi.ag his will , and that he purposed leaving all his estate to a young lawyer whom he had met in New York . who could be trusted to fulfill his schemes for the , employment of his fortune . Recorder Goff hail ruled to a previous witness that a conversation between Mr. Rice and a third party was not competent testimony . Counsel protested against the ruling . and the Recorder said that he would reverse it if the defense eculd show him any precedent in the law reports . Apparently counsol was not able to do so , for Schepflin was not recalled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was independently rich , a wholesale grocer . a friend of Mr. Rice for more than fifteen years , and a neighbor of his when Rice lived at Dunellen . N. J. Mr. Moore spoke briefly of this to the jury , and said that Mr. Shepflin had known of Mr. Rice 's intentions concerning the disposition of his property in his will . " The Texas contingent .
