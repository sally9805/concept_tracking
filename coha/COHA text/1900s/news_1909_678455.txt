txt Asserting that he had heard it reported that President Taft would veto the pending Census bill if ft did not provide for placing the appointments of census employes under the Civil Service Commission , Senator Bailey , in a speech on the bill in the Senate to-day , declared that if the President " had thus early In his Administration undertaken to coerce Congress he would find that the experience of the last seVen years was a holiday compared with what the next four years will be . " Senator Lodge made a spirited reply to the Texas Senator . Mr. Bailey made his speech upon an amendment to the Census bill proposed by him , the effect of which would be to allow Senators and Representatives to name employes of the census . His amendment was in the exact language which caused Mr. Roosevelt to veto the bill passed at the last session of Congress . Among other things Mr. Bailey said : " I am one of the men who sincerely hope that the President of the United States will distinguish himself in his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmixed blessing to all the people , but I do not hesitate to say that no man ever had a less desiirable preparationjor it than . trip : : : a64:40tti.c.plpant. of ywent5 ' - from the bench , where the ' tend'enc'y is toward a Certain kind of tyranny . There is scarcely a Federal Judge in the United States of twenty years ' service who has not become arbitrary , irritable , and sometimes tyrannical . I do not mean that this experience would corrupt him in the sense of making him venal , but it tends to corrupt him in the sense that it teaches him to oppose his will against all obstacles . " These remarks followed a general denunciation by Senator Bailey of the civil service law , which , he declared , he had opposed for twenty years as " a humbug and a pretense . " He stated that President Roosevelt had not hesitated to appoint men to public office within the classified system upon his own judgment and without examination , which , he said , was not justified by any law . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , me said , made by departmental bosses . If there was to be a boss he preferred a political boss . He said that he had been told that heads of bureaus and petty chiefs had threatened to discharge employes of the Government if a Senator should go through a department to see that some wrong was righted in connection with him . He added that he had heard that a certain member of a Legislature had introduced a resolution framed in laudatory language in relation to the former President , and that later he had had this resolution taken to Mr. Roosevelt with a request that he get a place , and that he was appointed without examination to a position paying $7 a day . " If any Senator doubts that story , " said Mr. Bailey , " let him ask Senator Scott of West Virginia , whether it is true . " Senator Lodge , in reply , said no attempts had been made by Congress to pass the Census bill over President Roosevelt 's veto , for the very good reason that Congress realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was evident that everywhere except in Congress it was recognized that the classified service was an improvement over what went before . Mr. Lodge did not assume to speak for President Taft , and any member of Congress could judge for himself what the President would be likely to do in the event the bill is pissed with the spoils system included . " It is well to remember , " be went on , " that we are sending this bill to a , President whose views on the subject of the classified service have been expressed in decisions on numerous occasions . It is my belief that he favors the classified service . " Mr. Carter declared that if the old Census bill , passed by the last Congress and vetoed by Mr. Roosevelt , had come before the Senate he would have voted to override the veto of the President . The present bill , he said , provided for a " special " test open to all applicants , while the old bill required a " non-competitive " one , but open only to those designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and the bill , without any important changes from the measure as reported to the Senate from the Committee . on Census , was passed .
