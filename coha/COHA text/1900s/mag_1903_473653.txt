HARVARD COLLEGE was the fountain-head of New England literature . Boston would have been an interesting 4 place without its fructifying neighbor , such was its civic stock ; with its double lobe of Puritan and Pilgrim , it would have been the brain of the State , a mart of trade , and a nest of rebels , but hardly , perhaps , one of the little historic Meccas that perpetually challenge the real importance of metropolitan vastness ; and in the hearts of its people , at least , with Florence and Edinburgh , not to be profane with diviner names , Boston brings up the rear of small but famous towns . Whatever of truth there is in this well-known boast comes from the College . It happened in the old days , long before Harvard became the high altar of learning it now is , the feeding flame of manifold lofty causes , sacrosanct with honorable lives and the votive wealth of dying generations set apart for the disinterested uses of men ; the present University , with its millions of money devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle , with its own future all before it ; but in the time that was , in the two centuries of humbleness when the old College was still only the camp-fire kindled by the Muses in the wilderness , there lies an accomplished past , a work ended and done , whose memory most survives in the literary fame of Boston . The collegiate spark , which is now parcelled out among museums and laboratories , and feeds an immense powerhouse of technical arts , applied sciences , and lucrative professions , was then rather a thing of men 's bosoms , of the instincts of imagination , the guesses of philosophy , the intuitions of religion ; if the University , through the inculcation of scientific knowledge and its varied training for useful pursuits , has now become more a great prop of the materia state , the College discharged wellelder function as a restorer of the humus spirit through the seeking of truth ; am under its plain academic rule , before tht old order changed , giving place to new Harvard came into vital touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unnoticed flower of the soul when seeds at last are blown through the world . It began , perhaps , in the time of Channing , and the first true contac may have been in that pure , mild spirit then the young Emerson left the pulpit . the young Phillips mounted the plat form ; outside ? for the academic race never more than a small part of the various and abounding state ? G-arrisor struck the hour . It was a crude , strange composite time . The phalanx was con. verging on . Brook Farm ; dervishes oi all kinds were camping round the Saad : tent at Concord ; Hawthorne , Longfellow and Lowell kept their lettered seclusion undisturbed ; the Lyceum multiplied , like a torch , from village to village ; and tin new woman of the period bad grown ul in Margaret Fuller , and , in fact , ii : Sophia Peabody and Maria White was already married to Hawthorne and Low . ell . It was the literary age of Boston . The traits of the period are still hari to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our credulity , and at times perplexes us by arousing the sense o : humor instead of exciting the organs o : reverence . " Thou shalt read Hafiz , ' says Emerson , as he lays clown the gos pels ; and the modern reader of Haft : stands aghast . The amazing contradin lions , ? young parsons leaders of th ( mob ; the naive surprises , ? Lowell temperance lecturer at the picnic when Maria White as queen was crowned with a coronal of pond-lilies ; the suggestions now of a deodorized bohemia at Fresl Pond or the Arcadia of married lovers and confirmed hermits at Walden , now of the milieu of ? the Vicar of Wakefield , and again of some fete champetre in Sterne , ? all puzzle the ingenuous and unt-pH/tinted mind . The provinciality of the life is as fresh and startling , and as humanly interesting , as in the work of great novelists . The wonderful rurality of Lowell 's youth , scarcely guessed even by his biographers , is one extreme ; the other is ,  - -  - let us say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a figure he wore in Cambridgeport ! Had Jane Austen lived her girlhood at Salem , or Peacock passed a summer at Concord , what delightful mischief might have been ours ! What an enrichment of our literature in eccentric and ever-laughable realism ! but the society of which Allston was an ornament , the study of Ticknor , the dining-room of Judge Prescott , the counting-room of Francis and Thorndike , the court-room of Mason and Shaw , would have required a yet more masterly hand . We get glimpses of it in memoirs and anecdotes , but the scene yet waits its author , and is most like to pass away without a poet . Yet this conservative , commercial , respectable society of the travelled and home - keeping provincials is the background on which must be relieved the radicalism of Emerson and Phillips , the elegance of Longfellow , the selfsufficiency of Hawthorne , the manhoodworth of Whittier , the Brahmin pride of Holmes , the cleverness of Lowell . If the background be so impossible to sketch , still more is the sway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are firm enough to be put down . Emerson stands the foremost figure . In him the spirituality of New England culminated , and was so blended with practical character as to make him a very high type of his race . Spirituality was of the essence of New England from its birth , and underlies its historic democracy as the things of eternity underlie the things of time . In the earlier age , however , the soul-life was cramped in archaisms of thought and breeding . and all expression was in stiffened forms . This Puritan past impresses our minds now very much as Byzantine art affectsour eyes , as a thing in bonds ; it is real , though remote ; it shrouds mysteries of religious feeling dark to us ; but above all else it seems a spirit imprisoned . Blake might so have pictured it more intelligibly with his rude strength ; a thing gaunt , tragic , powerful , one of the Titan forms of human suffering . The enlargement , the enfranchisement , the new sphere of light , of labor and prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free world . The spread of Unitarianism in New England was a growth in the order of nature ; it was not revolutionary , it was normal development ; and in this mental expansion and moral softening , in the amelioration of the American spirit in all ways , which Unitarianism denoted in the community , Harvard College was the radiating influence . By his collegiate clerical fathers Emerson was in the first line of those who were to share the new thought and advance the new practice . The work of Channing and his friends is not to be forgotten , but in the lapse of time it has lost distinction and blurs into half-remembered things like ancestral strains ; the climax of the liberal movement was in Emerson 's genius , and there shines concentrated , a white Tight of the spirit for a long age . He was a pure radical ; we are apt to forget how radical he was . Harvard recoiled , astounded and indignant at the son she had borne ; yet it was from within her halls ? and it is ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the religious proclamation went forth from his lips , in the Phi Beta Kappa oration , and the Divinity School address ; and however the elders might disown and protest , the words fell on good ground in the hearts of youth , and multiplied sixty and a hundred fold . It is not without reason that the hall of philosophy there should bear his name , now that all old controversies have fallen asleep ; for both by his inheritance from the past and his influence upon the American world Harvard was the corner-stone of his pure and high fame . But though Harvard and the things of Harvard were the essential environment of Emerson , and he was the am of the old College in a much larger sense than is usually meant by that phrase , there was something of much greater import in his genius , deeper , fast-rooted in what lies below education , intellect and books , something communal that made him even more the son of the soil , one of the people . He had that quality of race which marks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose abuse has almost exiled it from the speech of truth . What characterized the stock shone forth in him highly perfected and efficient , in the form of character on both its heavenward and its earthward sides , and he possessed besides that accomplishment of language which allowed him to give the racial element in the form of literature . He would have been called , as the world goes , a poor man , but in his own village he was well-off ; he lived , on his thousand or more dollars a year , the life of a refined gentleman , and reared his family , like others of his own station , on this sum in an atmosphere of true cultivation ; lie was economical , frugal even , and independent ; but . what distinguished him and made him a true leader in that homogeneous community was that he kept the old perspective of the relative worth of spiritual and temporal things , inherited from Puritan days in the habits of the mind , and held to the lasting transcendency of the one and the evanescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of peculiarity , just as his neighbors also did , but he did it in a singularly high and exemplary way . In a world so conceived his freedom was remarkable , his disengagement , his independence of thought and action both , his responsibility only to himself , his indifference to others ' views . Scarce any man was so free as he . His selfpossession in this attitude was almost spectacular to others . It struck them as " sublime insolence , " as any number of such phrases of amazement at a man who was simply true to himself , and took no more thought of the crowd or of the individual than he did of the morrow . Truth had never a better seeker ; he took only what was necessary for the journey , and what he found with his eyes he declared with his lips . Things that were not in the line of his search did not interest him ; they might be matters as grave and sacred , as endeared and in timate , as the Blessed Communion , but he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many a hardy dogmatist , but he was ignorant of it essentially , being clad in a panoply of innocence that was almost simplicity of mind . The same spirit that he showed in religious thought he exhibited also in politics , and not temporary politics only , but that lasting Americanism which he moulded into so many memorable phrases of freedom , equality , and fraternity . His time of illumination was in early manhood , and the little work called Nature was its gospel ; later , as he travelled farther from the light , he declined on more in-andane matters of morals and manners , on conduct , on the question of human behavior in one or another way , and left the old speculative table-lands of his youth ; and with him life after thirty-five was a declining day . Yet always his method was by intuition ; his courage responded to the challenge of the unknown , to the tanglegrowth of poetry and philosophy , to the dragon-jaws of . paradox ; and if at times , in our more sophisticated sight , Emerson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that links in life , almost like some Parson Adams of the mind , he is only thereby brought the nearer to our home-breed , and graced the more with that nameless quality which in other ways also shines from his figure and endears the Don Quixotes of every idealistic race . Such he was , ? the idealism of New England in its human saintship ; or , if not quite that , as near it as heaven ever makes the living Don Quixotes of real life . These analogies may seem derogatory , but they are not really so ; they are in their sphere patents of true nobility ; another sort of crowning phrase to tell how in his mortal life he was not untouched by the pathetic grotesqueness which clings to the idealist everywhere in this tough world , while in his soul he was also the white flower of Puritanism , ? flos regum : the last of his race . Puritanism , the search for God in New England , ended in him ; and he became its medium at its cub minating moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and held condensed , purified , and heightened it qwq of his nature be considered , the fervor of Longfellow 's patriotism was a very marked quality ; his habitual artistic control conceals its real force , but does not hide its clear depth ; from the early days when he was all for Americanism in literature , through his manhood friendship with Sumner and his antislavery poems , to the darker days of the sinking of the Cumberland and the prayer for the ship of state , he was one with his country 's aspiration , struggle , and trial , une in heart with her life ; but he showed this patriotic prepossession of his whole nature , if less touchingly , still more significantly , by his choice of American themes for what . were in no sense occasional poems , but the greater works in which he built most consciously and patiently for her fame in poetry , ? in " Hiawatha , " " Evangeline , " " Miles Standish , " and the like . It is the fashion to decry these poems now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these remains the only successful poem of its kind , one of the Indian life , one of colonial pastoral , one of the Puritan idyl , while the trials made by others have been numerous ; and in each of these , but especially in the first two , there is in quality a marvellous purity of tone which for those who are sensitive to it is one of the rarest of poetic pleasures . It is the fashion to decry also the shorter poems by which Longfellow entered into the homes of the people ; but if heaven ever grants the prayer that a poet may write the songs of a people , it is surely in such poems as these that the divine gift reveals its presence . They are in the mouthy of children and on the lips of boys , and that is well ; but they are also strength and consolation to older hearts , they are read in quiet hours , they are murmured in darkened rooms , they blend with the sacred experiences of many lives . Say what one will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a ramie breathes from " Resignation " in which the clod on the coffin ceases to be heard , and dies out of the ear at last with peace . In the grosser spirit of life that now everywhere prevails even among the best , and is not confined to any one sphere of politics , art or letters , nor to any one country or capital , it is not surprising that thefame of Longfellow should be obscured ; but his silent presence must still be deeply and widely felt in those simpler and million homes that make up the popular life which , as the whole history of poetry shows , can never be corrupted . Longfellow had this remarkable and double blessing : he was the product of the old Puritan stock at its culminating moment of refinement , its most cultivated gentleman , and he enters most easily at lowly doors . Hawthorne is the third great New England name , and many would place him higher than either Emerson or Longfellow in valuing his pure genius ; but from the point of view here taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal life , he falls necessarily into an inferior position . He , too , was the child of the old Puritanism , and , like the others , was emancipated from its bonds from boyhood ; but something stayed in his blood which in the others had suffered a happy change . The genius of Emerson and Longfellow worked in the line of growth , so that they mark in their different spheres the attainment of a new goal ; the genius of Hawthorne involved rather a reversion to the Puritan past , and not only that , but to what was grim , harsh , and terrible in its spirit ; his genius worked in a reactionary way upon the theme of his brooding , and he threw open the doors of the past rather than the gates of the future . He found what people find in tombs , ? dead sins and mouldered garmenta of the soul . Puritanism was to him a dreadful memory , which so fastened on his mind as to obtain new life like an evil obsession there , as if in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could read them by its dark light . This recrudescence of Puritanism , in an imaginative form , in Hawthorne was the cardinal thing about him in relation to the community ; by virtue of it he made Tuscany another Salem , and gave the treasures of Catholic art to feed the fires of the Puritan Moloch . His village world of observation was his own , as he saw it in daily life and faithfully recorded it ; but his world of imagination was the old Puritan country - side seen in spectral , uncanny . Dantesque ways , a hateful past full of pictures turning to life under his hand , to your life and my life , to the life of man as it is in the eternal present . He could not shake it off ; his genius cast shadow ; he was a profound pessimist , ? sin to him was life . Out of all this came a single new creation , which , with Knickerbocker and Leatherstocking , makes the third original American type , Donatello ; like them he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elemental things , a dream of the mind , an emanation half of the artistic senses of a poetic temperament in love with life , half of the remorseful thought of a heart that had " kept watch o'er man 's mortality " ; but , visionary as he is , Donatello is a true imaginative type , no more to be forgotten than the other purely artistic figures of literature , like Galahad , like the Red Cross Knight , of whose race he is . It seems a miracle of time that drew out of the dark bosom of Puritanism this figure of the early world , fair with Greek beauty , and made its plastic loveliness the flower in art of the Puritan conscience . It is art that finally sets Hawthorne aloof from the others in a place of his own . It might almost be said that for him heredity had become environment , so much did the past cversway the present in his moral temperament , his outlook on life and his probings of its mysteries ; his genius , in its most concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject-matter , this reluctant , repellent , stubborn Puritan stuff , the dark hard ore ; but the object of his attention being thus given , and the manner of its interpretation being born in him also , he remained for the rest more the pure literary artist than his contemporaries in New England ; the instinct of romantic art for its own mere sake was in him . In the expanding life of New England this thing , too , had happened with other things : an artist had been born there . He was strangely indifferent to everything in the community , he was solitary and a man apart ; but he was faithful to his own one talent , the power to take an original view of the world , a romantic view , and turn it to pictures in the loom of literature . The world remained the old Puritan world , all the world he knew ; but in his eyes it became a pietorial thing , while retaining necessarily its moral substance and tragic suggestiveness , and it took on artistic form under his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that would feed it was absorbing ; he idled at ail times when not employed with it ; he found his happiness in its exercise . It was his art that was necessary to him , not its message ; he lived by imagination . In him consequently the communal life is seen in the last of its threefold manifestations in the literature of the old Puritan race ; in Emerson it shone forth in the pure soul , in Longfellow it blossomed in the heart , and in Hawthorne it left , as en darkness , its imaginative dream . In these three men the genius of the people , working out in the place and among the things of its New England nativity , reached its height , so far as concerns that partial expression which literature can give to a people 's life . They were surrounded by manifold other activities of the communal spirit , in politics , trade , philanthropy , taking place in a busy state ; they were supported , however , by an educated class in large numbers of similar breeding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors ; and there were also , perhaps , a score of other writers about them , among whom three still stand out with great prominence ? Holmes , Whittier , and Lowell , of whom two , as in the other group , were closely hound to ' Harvard College . Holmes was , in fact , what he liked to be thought , a town wit . His attachment to the English of the eighteenth century was the result cf a native sympathy . He Was a citified man , such as the old Londoners were . He was not so much a NewEnglander as he was a Bostonian ; and not so much a Bostonian as he was a " Brahmin , " to use his own name for the thing , with just that diminishing inclusiveness that Henry James expressed in saying of Thoreau that he was more than provincial ; he was parochial . " Holmes was in certain ways the city parallel to that . It is seen in his consciousness of his audience , which is ever present , in the dinner-talk flavor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his many occasional poems ; he has not the art to forget himself . Such a writer is seldom understood except by the generation with which he is in social touch ; magnetism leaves him : he amuses his own time with a brilliant mental vivacity , but there it ends . Whittier was the opposite of Holmes ; he was the poet of the plain people , born among them , and never parting company by virtue of education or that sort of growth which involves a change in social surroundings . His Quaker blood distinguished him from the others , who were all Unitarians ; but the distinction is illusory , for his Quakerism did for him precisely what Unitarianism did for them in giving mildness and breadth to his religious spirit . It is by his piety that he most appeals now to the general heart ; by his reminiscences of the outward form of New England country life and its domestic types , as in " Snowbound , " he came near to the homes of the community as a whole , while as the antislavery poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times ; the three strains of interest , especially when felt through the medium of his simple goodness , preserve his fame ; moreover , as a people 's poet whose humble manhood remained unspoiled , he is assured of long memory . As a type of character he was as appropriate for the country as Holmes was for the city ; though both are high types , and though it may seem paradoxical , Whittier had vastly the greater range . Both were deeply rooted in the soil , and had native history in their blood ; both , too , were provincial in a way that their three great contemporaries were not . In the case of Lowell there is still something enigmatic . He was younger than the others ; he was more complex in nature , and changed more from youth to age and even late in life . He alone owed much of his public recognition to the accident of office . He can not take his own place in literature until , like Irving , be is forgotten as an ambassador . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same studies as Longfellow , whom he succeeded as a scholar ; he developed criticism , but did not relinquish poetry ; he did not work hard at either prose or verse . The Biglow Papers is his most original work , racy of the soil and the times , in its homelier sphere as native a product of the practical as Donatello is of the spiritual temper of that breed of men . The " Commemoration Ode " is his loftiest achievement . He was the poet of the civil war in a sense not so true of any of the four older poets . Ho lived in a Harvard atmosphere all his life , but no man was less academic . His prose came mainly from his brain , and is of a transitory nature , and steadily grows less interesting . These are the main facts about him . He now seems essentially a man of letters of high endowments , having the accomplishment of verse with his many other rich and varied gifts , and no more than that . It would appear ( hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawthorne had already begun to fail , and beat with a lowered pulse in the youngest . and last of the group . It becomes plain on looking back that the literary age of Boston was before the civil war . With the exception of Lowell and this helps to explain his position ? the character of these men was formed and their work completely determined before ISGO , and most of it was done . It was all the aftermath of Puritanism in literature . The debt it . owed to Unitarianism is clear ; its direct and indirect obligation to Harvard College , though but partially set forth , is obviously great , and just as clearly was due to the old humanities as there taught . In forty years we have drifted farther perhaps than any of us have thought from the conditions and influences that gave our country so large a part of its literary distinction .
