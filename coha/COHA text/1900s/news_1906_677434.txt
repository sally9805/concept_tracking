txt The press of the Continent in these days teems with gossip and speculation as to the alliances the various Powers are said to contemplate . A left-handed and unwelcome recognition of the position of , the United States as a " world ' power " is conceded in the way in which we are frequently reported to be involved in these negotiations . The latest instance is that of the alleged approaching alliance in which we are to engage with Russia for the purpose of forcing Japan to keep the peace . It is not to be denied that . we are wholly desirous that Japan- shall keep the peace , but there are several reasons why we should not enter on an agreement with Russia to secure that end . One is , arikit appears quite conclusive , that we have not the slightest ground for supposingthat . Japan intends to break the peace : Another is that . if we had any such grbund , it would not occur to us to negotiate with Russia in the premises . Russia has her own peculiar relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' opinions on the one hand and on the other with which we have no con-cern whatever . We should no more turn to Russia for aid in influencing the conduct of Japan than we should approach Japan with a view to influencing the conduct of Russia . Another and convincing consideration is that whatever understanding we may seek with other nations for the promotion of permanent peace would inevitably be sought with all nations and could not possibly be confined to individual Governments possessing special interests and aims . We should be very foolish if we did not desire peace and do all in our power to maintain it , but we should defeat our own purpose if we engaged in entangling alliances with one or more States . Probably our Government does not deceive itself with the dream of permanent and universal peace to be made secure within any calculable time . But equally it does not propose to put any - unnecessary obstacles in the way of such a con sommation by entering on dangerous and provocative alliances .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
