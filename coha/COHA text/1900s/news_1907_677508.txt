txt Prof. Lewis BOSS , Director of the Dudley Observatory here , said to-day that ne noticed the disturbance on the sun yesterday . Ile attributes the sun spots to storm influences . " As the disturbance appeared to me , he said , " it was not one single spot , but a collection of spots , ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 miles In Ili/meter , down to spots of smaller dimensions . Electrical disturbances are liable to occur In an auroral display , accompanied by great interruption of the telegraph . " It Is impossible to say with certainty just when these phenomena will manifest themselves , but appearances of this kind upon the surface of the sun are always followed by such manifestations . " These spots have appeared at a time when it is not reasonable to expect them , and their appearance now is not explained . With one or two exceptions the spots are of small size . " That the huge sunspot discovered by Prof. John A. Brashear , Director of the Allegheny Observatory , as told in yesterday 's TIDIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a matter of great doubt by Prof. Harold Jacoby , head of the Department of Astronomy in Columbia University . " By using a piece of smoked glass , " said Prof. Jacoby last night , " ant ' one can verify the existence of the sunspot for himself . It is a spot no bigger than many others that have been observed in former years ; all that makes this particular spot unusual is what I might call its ' untimeliness . ' Every eleven and onetenth years there are a great number of spots on the sun . The maximum of this period occurred about two years ago , so that it is a little unexpected to find So big a spot at this time . The revolution of the sun upon its axis makes these spots appear to travel from west to east across the face of the sun , taking about twelve days in so doing . For the next week , therefore , the great spot will be a very conspicuous object . " We can only theorize as to the cause of sun spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one still in acceptance to-day . " Neither have we any definite knowledge as to the effect of sun spots upon the earth or the terrestrial atmosphere . That there is some such effect , however , seems likely , because the curves representing the frequency of magnetic storms and of the Aurora . Borealis are practically identical with the curve of sun-spot -- EreIt is , therefore , likely that the quency. present sun spot will be accompanied by an auroral display and a magnetic storm . Whether , - either of these will be noticeable in this latitude is ' uncertain . Auroral displays of great beauty are frequently only visible in more northerly latitudes " A magnetic storm is popularly supposed to be only a storm accompanied by and lightning ; but a magnetic thunder storm may occur without such visible and audible manifestations . It may rage in a blue and apparently serene sky . It reveals its presence in the pranks it plays with telephones , telegraphs , and other electrical apparatus . Through the interference with the current messages on the wire will be interrupted or come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without human agency . " We are not watching for the Aurora Borealis from the Columbia University obmrvatory . If it occurs in tilts vicinity we will get such data , as we may want from the Weather Bureau .
