txt The work of tightening and strengthening the Rate bill went on at a rapid pace in the Senate to-day . The bill that goes back to the House will be vastly different from and much stronger than the measure which came from there . The radicals were in the saddle , and the conservatives , who have not got the votes , mostly joined in the rush to amend . Only Foraker still battled on , delivering vehement speeches until his face was flushed purple . Even he voted for the amendments . To-day the Senators swept back on the statute books the law providing Imprisonment for givers of rebates which was stricken from the statutes in 1903 by the Elkins law , and increased the fine fourfold . Then they went further and levied a penalty upon all corporations which violate the law , levying on them a fine of three times the difference between the rebate and the published rate . For the first amendment La Follette deserves the credit , and for the second McCumber . La Follette 's name is not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate is firmly resolved it is that he shall get no credit for anything that is done in this debate . Whenever he introduces an amendment that apparently must be passed they get some other Senator to bring up an amendment practically the same , and then they pass the other Senator 's amendment . So to-day , as soon as It became evident that La Follette 's hard labor proposition must go through , Lodge dug up a forgotten amendment of his to the same tenor as La Follette 's , and it went through , Lodge 's amendment with an addition offered by Stone makes the penalty imprisonment not exceeding two years , and a fine not exceeding $20,000 or both . It was originally $5,000 fir ? but Stone 's amendment quadrupled it . La Follette 's proposition was for $20,000 and five years ' Imprisonment , with hard labor . The hard labor feature was not in the amendment as passed . Under McCumber 's amendment the Statute of Limitations does not become operative for six years . The McCumber amendment was carried without division . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . La Follette was much in evidence ; so were Bailey , Tillman , Stone , and Dolliver . Aldrich sat most of the time with his chin in his hands and his elbows on his desk . Spooner walked around the Senate once In a while , but mainly sat still and said nothing . Knox occasionally InterrApted other Senators , but had little to say for himself . The Democrats voted with La Follette , the vote being 49 to 87 . When his amendment was lost they voted with the Republicans on the Lodge amendment , which was carried by 73 to 2 . The two negative votes were cast by GallInger , a Republican , and Pettus , a Democrat . With these amendments must be coupled the amendments prohibiting railroads from holding mines , and prohibiting the Issuing of passes . In addition to these the Senate has crippled and rendered practically useless the right of the railroads to get a stay of proceedings , and has stricken out Senator Knox 's pet words , " fairly remunerative , " which a short time ago were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The end is not yet . What the Senate will do to-morrow is a matter for conjecture , but there is no prospect of a letup in the tightening process and the radicals are still in the saddle . The Allison amendments are to come up to-morrow , and in anticipation of a strenuous day the Senate has agreed to meet an hour earlier than usual , Senator Platt Startled . Senator Platt of New York , who is likewise President of the United States Express Company , thinks his colleagues have struck him below the belt . All Winter long Senator Platt has been closely watching rate legislation for the sole purpose of preventing express companies from being made subject to the provisions of the act . As late as 4:30 yesterday afternoon he sent his secretary to inquire whether express companies were to be included or whether any agreement had been reached to incorporate them in the bill . lie was informed that no Senate understanding had been reached on the subject and left confident that nothing further would be done . The aged New York Senator had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Bailey offered the amendment making both express and sleeping car companies subject to Inter:State commerce regulations . There was no one present to speak for the express companies , and , apparently . the Pullman Palace Car Company had been caught napping . The amendment was adopted by a unanimous vote .
