road across it the Isthmus from the violence of local factions ; but it is regarded as the undoubted duty of the Colombian Government to protect it against attacks from local insurgents . " And in 1885 President Cleveland , describing the action of our forces on the Isthmus , in the insurrection of that day which gave rise to claims against Colombia not yet settled , said it was " always in aid of the sovereignty of Colombia . " So , as we have said , was the action of President Roosevelt last year . There was a revolution then . It was a real one  --  not a New York promoted affair  --  with real fighting . Admiral Casey telegraphed that it would have been a triumphant insurrection but for the presence of United States troops . " I firmly believe if our men were removed from shore the insurgents would be in Panama in forty-eight hours . " But he was informed from the Navy Department that he must " overlook matters of minor importance , " since " negotiations for the ship canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of irritation on the part of the Colombian representative " Here we get the first glimmerings of the brilliant idea that a canal is a ? bigger thing than a treaty . But the State Department was not idle . On September 11 it had a dispatch from our Minister at Bogota reporting a request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the exercise of our good offices , as against the insurgents on the Isthmus . It was explained that the insurrection was delaying the " canal matter " ? that everlasting canal ! Thereupon Acting Secretary Adee informed the Secretary of the Navy that he had " communicated with the President , " and . had " received from the President a telegram approving of my suggestion as to intrusting such a mission to the commander of the Cincinnati . " Accordingly , orders were duly issued , and the insurgents , before whom , Admiral Casey wrote , " Panama would fall an easy victim but for the restraining influence of our naval force here , " were induced to make peace . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombia in restoring her sovereignty over the Isthmus .. To bring out the lightning change which came over our Government 's interpretation of the treaty in only fourteen months , we have merely to put , side by side two naval orders , one issued on ' September 20 , 1902 , the other on November 2 , 1903 . In the former , Secretary Moody telegraphed to the commander of the Cincinnati simply to prevent " the line of transit " from being converted into the " theatre of hostilities . " He added : " Transportation of Government troops not in violation of treaty , and which will not endanger transit or provoke hostilities , may not be objectionable . " Now turn to the dispatch of November 2 , 1903 ? two days before the cooked-up " revolution , " ' of which our innocent Government knew nothing  --  and we find Admiral Glass ordered to " prevent landing of any armed force , either Government or insurgent , with hostile intent , at any point within fifty miles of Panama . " The case is absolutely clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing Presidents , but from his own of a year before . The same treaty which in 1902 led him to aid Colombia , in 1903 compelled him to antagonize her . This is obviously to convert a treaty into a nose of wax . Into it the President seems to have been willing to read his passing and changing wishes . His one controlling desire appears to have been , not carefully to observe precedents and good faith , but at all hazards and under any pretence to " get that ditch . " THE POSTAL THIEVES . Mr. Bristow 's report on the postal investigation is one of the most sordid revelations ever made in a public document . He slides under the microscope a cross section of the Department , and shows us in a flash the tissue alive with squirming parasites  --  a group of public officers without conscience , conspiring with depraved citizens in schemes for plunder . Trusted employees were busy filching from the Treasury everything on which they could lay their fingers , clown to a cent and a sixth on each money-order book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of standing in business , society , and politics , like ex-Congressman Edmund H. Driggs of Brooklyn and ' State Senator George E. Green of Binghamton . In this history , which gives the world its first clear idea of the extent of the frauds , there is not one tale of courage or audacity  --  nothing to lift the operations of the gang above those of the ordinary sneak thief , unless one excepts the brazen recklessness of Beavers and Machen , whose wholesale robberies rival what Burke called the consolidated corruption in the heroic times of Roman iniquity . One can find something admirable in the desperate bravery of Jack Sheppard or Dick Turpin : though with misdirected energy , they at least led the strenuous life . But most of these postal officials never rose above the level of the housemaid who fibs and plots day after day for the sake of adding to her hoard a spoonful of sugar and a pinch of tea . Among the twenty outsiders who are under indictment , Mr. Driggs and Senator Green are the most conspicuous . Both have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public judgment until they should have a chance to defend themselves . But unless Mr. Bristow and the Government attorneys are the victims of mania , both statesmen should soon be wearing the stripes of a felon . Each case , as Mr. Bristow presents it is absolutely plain . Congressman Driggs accepted a bribe of $12,500 to secure an order for 250 automatic cashiers , and part of this money has been traced to the bank account of Beavers . Green is deeply involved : as president of the company that makes the Bundy time recorder , he paid Beavers 10 per cent , on all sales made to the Department . He also bribed Beavers in order to get a contract for cancelling machines . There are checks showing various transfers of money from Green to Beavers ; and-when Green was asked by the grand jury for an explanation , he declined to answer , on the ground that he might incriminate himself . The methods of the other conspirators were much the same . They persuaded pbstal officials to order excessive quantities of supplies at exorbitant prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nephew of James N. Tyner , assistant attorney-general for the Department , added a touch of variety by obtaining from his uncle decisions allowing getrich-quick and other swindles to use the mails . But from Driggs and Green down to Cupper , the paint contractor , all were diligently picking the pockets of Uncle Sam . There is another group of rascals , whose names are withheld , and who are otherwise treated rather gingerly ? Congressmen who intrigued with Beavers to secure for various favorites unwarranted and unlawful increases in salaries . One case , from a hundred or more , wall serve as an example . A member of Congress recommended an increase in the allowance for clerk hire at Conyers , Ga. , which was then $40 a year . The amount of mail ' handled would have entitled the office to $160 , but when the Congressman called on Beavers personally he got $820 ; for a clerk whom he recommended . When the Congressman 's favorite was transferred to another office , the allowance was reduced to $100 , plain proof that the $720 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the payment of a Congressman 's political debts . By , such means Beavers made himself " solid " with the politicians of both parties , and held his place through thick and thin . The President surely speaks ironically when he says : " So highly were Messrs . Beavers and Machen thought of by those who had been brought into close connection with them , that the Congress actually provided at its last ' session for raising the salaries of bath . " In fact , so many members of ' Congress were morally , if not legally , partweps crminis that they had to strike hands in a general undertaking to reward their accomplices . One of the big fish , Perry S. Heath , managed to slip through the meshes of Mr. Bristow 's net . He still declares that he is an innocent man , pursued by malicious enemies ; but it was under his administration that these frauds flourished ; there is testimony , corroborated by circumstantial evidence , that he , or members of his family , received stock from at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the grace of the statute of limitations he escapes certain charges , and on others the district attorney regarded the evidence as insufficient . But he is saved as by fire . Under the circumstances the quicker the Republican National Committee turns him out of the secretaryship the better for the party . Mr. Bristoiw 's investigation has been thorough and fearless , and he deserves high honor . He expresses his thanks for the hearty ' cooperation ' of the President , First Assistant Postmaster-General Wynne , and Assistant Attorney-General Robb . For obvious reasons he can not thank the one man who should have sup-pelted him ? Postmaster-General Payne . Indeed , when Mr. Bristow writes , " What the service most needs is honest , intelligent , and vigorous administration , " he points out unerringly the glaring defects of Mr. Payne 's management . ' President Roosevelt 's course is most creditable . He directed - Mr . Bristow to spare neither high nor low , and in spite of frantic appeals for clemency he has unwaveringly backed the investigators . His memorandum on the subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedient " to see that " justice is meted out to the offenders . " His attitude robs these shocking disclosures of much of their force as a political issue . Of course , many voters may argue that though the President 's own hands are clean , the party is so deeply fouled that a complete purifying is needed . There will be general agreement that one man should go at once ? Mr. Payne . To-'day he stands revealed more clearly than ever as a miracle of incompetence . If the President will put in his place some man whose ' honesty and ability are unquestioned , he will strengthen incalculably both his Administration and his party . The investigation of which Mr. Payne wished to see the end is now completed ; and the folly of ' the past can no longer be " urged as a reason for the insanity of the present and the future . " SENATE , PRESIDENT , AND HOUSE . Great ' changes in the working of Governmental machinery often pass almost unperceived , in their beginnings . They are not heralded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The Senate of the United States , for example , attained its present pitch of power with no blare of trumpets . Small successive increments did the business . Hence it is not surprising that a movement to clip the wings of Senatorial privilege should not have caught the popular attention as it ought . We refer , of course , to Speaker Cannon 's resolute refusal to submit to the dicta tion of the Senate . Important in itself and for present purposes , it is vastly more important for what it portends . Mr. Cannon is apparently determined on a course which , if unflinchingly persisted in , will do much to restore the ancient prerogatives and repute of the House , will redress the balance of power as between it and an overweening Senate , and thus will have a powerful influence upon Congressional practice as well as upon Constitutional theory . Readers of the press dispatches from Washington are familiar with what occurred . The Senate , in its usual complacent fashion , had arranged everything . Its committees had " decided " that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of December , and that accordingly the extra session should adjourn on the eve of Thanksgiving . These lordly gentlemen never dreamed of consulting the House . What was it there for but to do as it was bid ? The Speaker and the Committee on Rules were , to be sure , necessary officials , but the main object of their existence was , after all , to execute the orders of the Senate . So these particular orders were transmitted to Speaker Cannon ; but that grim and square-jawed personage contemptuously flung them back in the Senate 's face . Senators said that the special session should now adjourn , did they ? Well , Congress would not adjourn , said the Speaker . Congress is made up of two houses ; and he intimated that it was time for Senators to learn that " there are others . " In this opening battle of what promises to be a prolonged Constitutional struggle , we can not think the President 's part happily chosen . He has appeared not ' to know his own best friends . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' certain amount of aid and comfort . Of course , we understand that a President seeking a renomination is bound , in a party sense , to maintain that everything is for the best possible in the best possible of Governments . Accordingly , the humble pie which the Senate prepared for Mr. Roosevelt he could but eat with true ' Thanksgiving relish . So we had on Thursday the inspired announcement that the President was not at all disappointed at the failure of Congress to do as he asked . Everything was coming out just as he expected , and exactly to his mind . If this is simply the customary official optimism at which . all the world smiles , it may pass ; but if it implies that President Roosevelt is not alive to the real nature of the impending ' conflict , the pity of it is great . For the Senate ' has been steadily working to reduce the President as well as the House to a nullity . President and House , therefore , should feel themselves natural allies in this fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : " Resolved , That the power of the Senate has increased , is increasing , , THE PASSING OF " INTEGRATION . " The last two years have witnessed the shipwreck of many a fine financial theory . Aerial navigation is , in fact , no nearer attainment in Wall Street than in the Bois de Boulogne . In neither place can the dirigible balloon be - constructed out of such stuff as dreams are made of . Recent industrial developments show this , and are bringing into contempt the most ambitious and far-reaching of our latter-day economic doctrines  --  that of the " integration of in , industry . " This phrase Is , in a large sense , the antithesis of the time-honored expression , " specialization of industry " ; and so means " nothing less than the counteraction of a- tendency which has operated in industrial affairs from the beginning of human effort . Integration of industry does not strike necessarily at the very letter of the law of the division of labor , but it certainly runs counter to its spirit . That law signifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , under the old policy the main thing was an ever-increasing differentiation of industrial effort , the unification of results being left to natural law to work out . Under the new , the chief feature is a conscious human effort to coordinate a vast number of hitherto conflicting industrial elements , and to bring them under common control . But the new departure was purely fortuitous . It was not an evolution ; neither was it a suddenly devised scheme to meet a great and unexpected change in the basic conditions of industry . It was just the application of a priori notions to the financial and industrial situation . Nor was integration one of those movements which break out simultaneously in widely scattered localities . Its origin is easily traced to Wall Street , and to a mere handful of individuals even there . - There was a fair presumption at the start that the integration argument contained a fallacy , but in many minds this was felt rather than perceived . Most persons were disposed to suspend judgment till they saw how the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that they have waited long enough , and are now ready to express their minds forcibly . The experiment was tried on a pretty extensive scale , and seems to have broken down at about every point . A chain of industries was formed , the work of integration was begun , the principle of making one hand wash the other was strictly applied , and for a time the new theory was triumphant . But the fact is , a chain is no stronger than its weakest link , and this particular chain contained a number of links that were very weak indeed . Steel was easily king when it came to the integration of industry . Combine a great number of already overcapitalized companies into one corporation of almost unthinkable magnitude , and add some hundreds of millions of new capitalization . Then buy up  --  or think you do  --  all the sources of the raw material at any price which the owners may take a fancy of naming . Incidentally , of course , you must own railroads and lake transportation lines . Next you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale anywhere in the world , without regard to their age or fitness for modern conditions , paying three prices for them . If , finally , you can identify yourself with the Various construction companies , so much the better . The beauty of the scheme is ? in theory  --  that if one branch of the business goes back on you , the others will pull you through . But , unfortunately , in this most signal instance the theory has failed to work . There has been integration within integration . The United States Steel Corporation was an integration , but was itself integrated with nobody knows yet how many other projects . The sources of the raw material were coordinated with the transportation companies and with the crude manufactured products , and through other stages with the finished commodities . But this beautiful scheme was like Hawthorne 's railroad to the Celestial City  --  it ended on this side of the river . There was one fatal defect  --  the consumer was not also integrated . He seemed to have been at the start , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated integration  --  that which was going to insure such a community of interest between the Steel Trust and the Shipping Trust and the great railroads and , it is stated , certain large contracting companies , not to mention important money-market interests  --  has also apparently broken down Probably the real explanation is that every step in this integration upon integration was marked by rash extravagance . Every detail was apparently overcapitalized . The boasted " economies of management " seem all to have gone to the promoters . It is stating the case very mildly to say that it is hard to see how the situation could be any worse if all the factors of this huge integration had been left to work out their own salvation , governed only by what Adam Smith calls the " higgling and bargaining of the market . " Integration shrewdly managed may be a good thing , though even so it can not be a magician 's wand to make profits where none exist in natural conditions . Managed as we have seen it , however , with lavish overcapitalization and reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much as if it were spelled " disintegration . " - - STYLE AND STATECRAFT . That accomplished woman who chooses to be known as " Vernon Lee , " suggests in the Contemporary Review a new method of criticism . Assuming that the style of a writer betrays inevitably his personality , she argues that syntax in the last analysis is psychology , and she applies to Thomas De Quincey an analysis as searching as ever one of Gildersleeve 's pupils devoted to an Attic orator . Her results show that De Quincey 's moral flabbiness reveals itself most distinctly in his use of verbs . Dissecting one of the finest passages of ' The Opium Eater , ' she finds that the verbs , adverbs , and active participles are as one to four against all the other parts of speech ( 50 in 200 words ) . More significantly yet , the famous passage would fairly stand coat- plete though ? bereft of its verbs : " The verbs are for the most part verbs of existence or of mere explanation . Whatever they are ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' ( in the sense of naming ) , ' found , " learned. , ' etc , etc ? they serve only to bind the nouns and adjectives into logical sentences , but do not bring much sense of action into the passage Most of them , moreover , might be replaced by equally indeterminate words without altering the total effect " The conclusion of the whole matter is that De Quincey 's undoubted eloquence is that of the noun and adjective . His appeal is to the eye ; his grasp of the world of action the fumbling of a moral incompetent  --  and of a superb dreamer. - " Vernon Lee " will tell us later how it stands with the verbs of Stevenson and De Foe . Meanwhile , it seems to us that the test may have utility outside the garden plot of belles-lettres . Why accept hearsay and the plaudits of the vulgar on our great men , when we have their verbs as an infallible criterion of their moral status ? In this confidence we have been at the pains to examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words ) of ' The Strenuous Life , ' taking so large an extract to avoid the risk of hitting upon an exceptional lapidary period . Without pointing the literary contrast between De Quincey and Mr. Roosevelt  --  though that would be a pleasing task for the special student  --  suffice it to say that the President 's style has an excellent underpinning of strong verbs . We count sixty-nine out of five hundred and twenty total words , and of the verbs only thirteen may fairly be dismissed as negligible . What may be called the category of effort requires sixteen verbs  --  among them help , demand , win ( several instances ) , work ( ditto ) , strive ( ditto ) , help , try , succeed , get ; and , naturally , the opposites , shrink and fail . Next to action , exhortaVon is prominent ; speak , teach , preach , are present in six cases . Beyond this , the miscellaneous verbs only bear out the same stalwart quality , and of the six adverbs , even , the notable ones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Believing that knowledge of Senator Hanna 's inmost nature and intentions would be more precious than rubies to the political forecaster , we have likewise analyzed an equal portion of his works Here the difficulty'is met that Mr. Hanna is not a " literary feller . " But in choosing the peroration of his ship-subsidy speech before the Senate , March 6 , 1902 , we feel that we have caught the orator 's authentic note In some 525 words the junior Senator from Ohio shows some slight inferiority to his chief  --  sixty verbs against sixty-nine . In their choice , however , the difference is much more striking . Nearly one-half ( twenty-five , to be exact ) must be classed as colorless words of existence and the - like . The category of effort and strifeis pitifully small . Yet the inference that Senator Hanna is temperamentally akin to De Quincey  --  is addicted to opium , lacks moral stability ? would be premature . Good intellectual words ( understand , know , realize , think ) , conciliating verbs ( propose , induce , invest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hanna 's nine adverbs , compared with the President 's six : merely , quickly ( three times ) , regularly , satisfactorily are the qualificatatives that indicate an ingratiating attitude towards the Senate and the world . Without setting up as an arbiter of styles , we believe that Senator Hanna 's verbs are none the less formidable because less aggressive than Mr. Roosevelt 's . We have shrunk from applying the statistical yardstick to anything so precious as Senator Beveridge 's diction , And yet our temerity has been rewarded by discovering that his large utterance is the ideal union of the qualities of De Quincey and Roosevelt . In sheer copiousness of verbs , Beveridge lies between the opium-eater and the apostle of the strenuous life . Nearly eighty in five hundred words is the proportion ; of these eighty , fifty are colorless verbs , such as De Quincey used , but the remainder is more inspiring than even the President 's list . Retreat , proceed , pant , desert , throttling , administering  --  it is a perfect trumpet-call to excursions and alarums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwanted , masterful , mighty , divine , imperishable , undying , infinite , golden . In respect of the nouns , De Quincey in the glamour of his opium visions never arrayed them so opulently . Civilization , glory , opportunity , Agincourt , Waterloo , Australia , New Zealand , Africa , India , Egypt , mummy of the nations , Pharaohs , duty , fame , profit  --  are only a few of these truly orbed words . This style lacks only a minor perfection  --  the diplomatic adverbs of Mr. Hanna . In general , it fuses indissolubly the sturdy frankness of Mr. Roosevelt with the insinuating , visual suggestiveness of De Quincey . It need hardly be said that we have been studying Mr. Beveridge 's epoch-making speech of February , 1899 , " The Republic That Never Retreats . " Here , too , one must guard against over-rapid inferences , such as that Beveridge may be President if he will only not eat opium or abuse his impressionistic vocabulary . But the investigation seems to prove at least that the stylistic supremacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the non-heroic would make Mr. Hanna a most formidable candidate ; while the addition of a certain Oriental sensuousness to our present robust ideals would make Mr. Beveridge the very man of destiny . Such at least is the verdict of the verbs . FIELDING . Shortly after Henry Fielding returned to London from Leyden , where he had been studying-law for two years , a distinguished Frenchman arrived in England on the Earl of Chesterfield 's yacht This was Charles de Secondat , Baron de Montesquieu , who , during a residence of two years in the country , made some observations on the people that have never been succcessfully discredited Among other unflattering things , he said that " An ordinary Englishman must have a good dinner , a woman , and comfort . Sp long as he has the means of getting these , he is contented , if these means fail him , he either commits suicide or turns thief . All classes are corrupt . Honour and virtue are held in small esteem There is no religion in England If one speaks of religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly and precisely , an enlightened foreigner described the society which Fielding began to write about at the age of twenty-one , upon which during twenty-five years , as dramatist , journalist , novelist , he lavished a frequently ribald ridicule and a constant rather splendid sort of scorn By portraying his ordinary countrymen ( some of whose habits were too notoriously his own ) , this extraordinary Englishman made for himself an uncertain living , poor at best , yet not dull , very great fame as a writer , and an almost correspondingly bad reputation as a man . He treated his material with the freedom and independence of a great humorist , and part of his reward has been identification with the baseness and corruption that he satirized He drew many characters of a shining . yet not superhuman virtue , he clearly perceived and sincerely loved real goodness ; he continually proclaimed that human nature was his book , and his field the manners of many men . Yet , along with his fame , has been passed from generation to generation an impression that it rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameless exposure of his own black heart . This personal disparagement began in his own time . Richardson , who hated him ( with cause ) , grieved for the " lowness " of a man who had so much talent , belonged to a great family , and had such nice sisters He would not read ' Tom Jones , ' but believed that the author wrote the " coarse-titled " book to fill his pockets , and " to whiten a vicious Character and make Morality bend to his Practices " Dr. Johnson , expressing for once ( we think inopportunely ) a popular opinion , " would not sit with Fielding . " Smollett , whose own work is GO chaste and discreet , reviled him , and Horace Walpole delighted to repeat evil gossip , spicing it with his natural malice . Through most of the nineteenth century , Henry Fielding ( now absolutely identified with ' Tom Jones ' ) existed under the grand tabu , and those who felt they must record a tribute.to his literary achievement , let it be clearly understood that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoundrel . The eloquence of Thackeray 's appreciation is marred by sighs and groans , and a generally missyish attitude towards a scandalous rake who had had the luck to write in a time when it was possible to depict himself . Twenty years ago , Mr. Austin Dobson gallantly broke a lance in defence of Fielding 's character ; but , as late as 1892 , so tolerant and humorous a writer as Mr. Augustine Birrell declared that the " very name Henry Fielding " rings in the true tradition of the eighteenth century  --  the tradition that the proper place for a , novelist was " either the pot or the sponging-house " ; that he ought to be " either disguised in liquor or confined for debt . " Mr Saintsbury and Mr. Leslie Stephen have striven to discredit the assumption that a man must be depraved because he wrote a good deal about rakes and blackguards of both sexes , and because he is known to have been pretty steadily in debt and sometimes drunk ; and now , introducing to the twentieth century an edition de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co ) , comes the late Mr. Henley , eager , inlldicious , extravagant , in his wish to re ' move every stigma from the man whose work has such an important place in our literature His partisanship hurts the case Contemporary criticism was not wholly instigated by envy and malice , nor nineteenth-century disparagement by prudery . Richardson and Dr Johnson at lease did sincerely believe that this young man , who belonged by birth to the world of fashion , and by nature to the world of letters , had the vices of both and the virtues of neither . And the reappearance of a Puritan spirit in England during the Victorian era offers some guarantee of the good faith of prevailing disapprobation . In considering ' Jonathan Wild , ' Mr. Henley says " it is a tremendous achievement in pure irony ; and for this reason it is isolated in English letters . It is given to few to love irony for its own sake . " He might- have suggested as one of the reasons for his author 's bad reputation that it is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fielding 's severest reproofs of vice have been taken for indecent approbation or callous indifference . Undoubtedly he has suffered much from the dulness of the human understanding and- the self= protecting impulse of human egotism The number that can distinguish between natural virtue and formal morality , or , distinguishing , more highly honor the former , is not great , and nobody ever heard his own faults censured without rushing for extenuation to ' the " thou-too " argument . The facts that can be arrayed either for or against Fielding are insignificant , and that which testifies for him most favorably is his marriage to the love of his youth , the beautiful Miss ' Cradock of Salisbury , and their mutual devotion , tried by years of poverty , the loss of children , and her protracted illness . ' Tom Jones ' was written . in the years between her death and his second marriage As he believed his work would long survive him , he wished her name to be linked with his , and explicitly de , . lares that she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the whole inspiration , and it is not going too far ' to suppose that both books were deliberately intended to celebrate her beauty , charm , and virtue ? a tribute to a woman who had forgiven much becanse she loved much . Mr. Henley says little about the " four great books , " because everything has been said already . His comments on the Plays and Miscellanies may lead people to examine them . Of the ' Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon ' he says : " In every sentence is stamped the utterance of a humane , stately , and honorable gentleman " This is one of his extravagances , but any one who wishes sincerely to get away from the " pot and sponging-house " tradition had better read the ' Journey ' and the Preface to the Miscellanies and perhaps one or two of the papers on public affairs which were written by Fielding in his quality of Justice of the peace for Westminster . Then he may bring an opener mind to the " four great books " ; may be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however imperfect , never ignoble , may come to think with My Henley that , in achieving these - books , " a master of life , a master of character , a master of style did so nobly by his nation and his mother-tongue that he that would praise our splendid , all-comprehending speech aright , has said the best he can of it when he says that it is the speech of Shakspere and Fielding .
