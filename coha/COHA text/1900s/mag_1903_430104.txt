 | THIS great country that stands to-day the hope of the helpless everywhere , has achieved its greatness by mighty struggles against the fiercest foes ; against nature , savagery , tyranny , slavery . It has developed a race practical , alert , brave , intelligent and proud . And now in its most glorious era , it has its gravest problem to solve , the problem of uplifting and developing an alien black race , but one century removed from barbarism , and doing this in such a way as in no wise to jeopardize its most sacred responsibility ? the preservation of an untainted white civilization developed to its utmost possibility . The entire country is agreed on this , the south as conscientiously as the north . But there is one point of disagreement : social equality between the two races . Because the south , not as a spectator or theorist , but as a sufferer , in tie midst of actual calamities , realized what social equality would mean , and that no citizen who values our civilization or respects white womanhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white woman , it has taken an unalterable position on this subject . In order to be fair in this matter , the justice must be done the south of understanding and believing its true attitude toward the negro , also of understanding the real dangers that threaten . The southerner has no antipathy for the negro as a human being or an individual ; he merely declines to take him as a social equal . The south does not drive the negro population from its towns , does not refuse work to any negro who wants work , nor food to those who are hungry . The south makes allowances for the negro 's inferiorities , has a real affection for many of its colored citizens , loves and cares for the faithful old servitors , has genuine respect for negro families who conduct themselves well , and is glad to see the prosperity of negro institutions and individuals . The south would see the negro self-respecting , capable , ambitious , establishing social grades and positions in his own circles , to he attained only by worthiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The south is always ready to put out its hand to help its colored citizens in every way . But it does not believe that instilling into them the craze for association with the whites is the base upon which to build the upward progress of a self-respecting colored citizenship . Right to associate with the whites should not be the goal to which the negro is taught to strive . It is on account of this very thing that so many negro women hold themselves more honored in being the mistress of some white man than in being the honest wife of any good colored man . For the same reason the white negro bastard , instead of being taught to be ashamed of his whiter skin , which is proof of his disgraceful origin that all the world may read , is proud of the ivIiite blood , which is there only through infamy and vileness . Effectually he is absolutely negro still , for the white never absorbs the negro , the negro absorbs the white ; one smallest ancestral part of negro makes the whole man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reversion to type . Yet the mulatto child of infamy dares to look down with scorn upon the honest-born , pure-blooded black . Let the colored man understand once and for always that he is to be a negro yentlernan , educated , successful . respected by the whites , but building his separate social structure , in which different degrees of merit and virtue shall be rewarded accordingly , and the  | white man will help him to this standard . As long as the idea of social equality is fostered in the negro , it makes impossible much that the white race of the south could and would do for him ; for the instant that the effort for social equality is thrust in , it makes impossible real kindness between the man who is striving to get in and the man who is determined to keep him out . Then any kindness on one side seems like insincerity and on the other is apt to seem impertinence . The greatest wrong ever done civilization was when thousands of beings hut two degrees removed from naked barbarism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social equals of a race which represents the refinement , the chivalry , the bravery of thousands of years of civilization . To many of the negroes " equality " means license to be *nsolent , the kind of " equality " that says : " I 'm a lady , you bet , and by thunder do n't you forget it ! " The negro should be taught to respect himself intrinsically as a negro , since the All-wise has created Lim negro . Someone asks : " Is there to be no chance for him to rise , no matter what his excellence or attainments ? " Certainly . Would it he nothing to him to have the respect of the world : to be a great leader in his own race ; to he a professor in his own colleges ; to be an able business man , own a beautiful , hone , earn the luxuries of life ; have his own theaters , picture galleries and libraries , as he has already his own schools and churches ? That is the kind of race pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that he does n't amount to anything till he can associate with the whites . The tiger probably has no humiliating regrets at not having been created a lion . The negroes are free , and the south rejoices that they are . It has gentle , loving memories of its dusky playfellows and black " mammies . " It does not hate the negro , it hates his crithes . And with all kindness it is ready to help him uplift his race and raise his standards . The great , masses of the negro race , as of the white race , will of necessity belong to the laboring classes , and to be trained for skillful , intelligent work , according to Booker Washington 's plan for benefiting his race , is the ideal means for making them self-respecting and progressive . The distant mountain is picturesque : it is only those who are struggling up its sides that see the danger of the precipices they walk beside , the chasm that yawns , or the boulder that has slain . Those at a distance can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor the conditions arising from living in the midst of hordes of negroes . One or two negroes may be to some tastes picturesque , spectacular , but to be in the midst of a whelming black flood , rolling its waves against the bulwarks of our civilization , overflowing our public highways and public conveyances , threatening our homes , is the condition which the men and women of our own race should investigate and realize , before they devote themselves to that strange philanthropy which is so tender of heart for the black brother or sister , and criminally ignorant of , and careless about , the terrible dangers that threaten the women and children of their own race , and which they may be so largely instrumental in precipitating . The all-pervasiveness of the negro , not by ones and twos , but by the million , with his " equality " insolence , his odoriferous perso his criminal tendencies , is a factor for danger and discomfort that must be held in check by the most farseeing intelligence . There is no community where the blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves offensive to the white ; ? Washington , for example ? and there is no other part of the country where this offensiveness , when short of actual criminality , is borne so forgivingly as in the south . They put on extra police force that their daughters in going to and from school may be protected from infamous remarks made to them by passing negro men ; city districts must have extra guards that negro fiends may not enter homes and knock sleeping women senseless that they may he  | violated afterward . This happened in the same city over and over again for two years , in spite of extra guards . Several of the women died . One wretch was at - last caught , and the tolerant people decided that he was a degenerate and sent him to the insane asylum to be cared for by the state . Yet there are people at a distance , unknowing the conditions in the south , who throw all their sympathies with " the poor downtrodden negro . " It is time that they knew better . Let all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear : The white woman is the coveted desire of the negro man . The despoiling of the white woman is his chosen vengeance . The white woman must be saved ! The vital point in the race question to-day is the safety of the " southern white woman , and all the helplessness of womanhood appeals to the manhood of the world to protect her with every possible safeguard . " Social equality " is battering on the walls that protect her , and for what purpose ? To make ' a breach where the negro may climb up and over . And who is to be helped by this invasion ? Not the negro , for it puts him in a false position , and the white race will certainly be no better for the mixture . All philanthropical claims can be fully met mentally and morally without taking the negro , even the best negro , into the home circle . It makes no difference that social equality is asked for only those who are worthy . The social recognition of one good negro stimulates in thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouses them to fresh insults and outrages aimed at the southern white woman . Negro equality is a theory ; negro outrages and insults resulting from the inculcation of the doctrine of equality are hideous facts . Behind the southern adamantine resolve that the southern white people shall forever be white people , is an instinct which few have analyzed ? the instinct for the preservation of species . Preservation of species is one of the strongest laws of nature . The lion does not mate with the tiger . Race aversion is simply the unconscious recognition of this creational difference , and the normal attitude toward a mingling of the two races should be one of instinctive animal revolt . Today because the negro has been taught " you are the social equal of the whites . you have the right to whatever the white man has the right to , " the object most desired by him is the forbidden , the unattainable white woman . In that over-and-over repeated story of outrages in the south , it is almost invariably a white woman or white child that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The southern white man knows that his wife is not safe in her home , nor his child in her bed . except for the vigilance and the surveillance of the law . When one American woman was carried off by bandits the entire nation , even the government , was roused with indignation and anxiety . Almost daily in our own country beasts worse than bandits despoil the tender and the helpless . Good , conscientious , mistaken women are sympathizing with the black man , because they have not head , the little child 's voice crying in the night and found their baby girl out of doors in her own blood , mangled. and torn , nor seen some white woman 's body with skull crushed , and bruised breast . nor even heard the obscene infamies that , in wanton insolence . am spoken to the white girl or woman by the passing black . Social equality is not the cure for it . The south has a great , half savage , criminal body to deal with , and whenever the north denounces the southern whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state penitentiary of this state now has 1885 convicts , of whom only ten per cent are white . This is not because of discrimination against the negro . The mayor of this city in six years tried thirty-two thousand cases , of which eighty-five per cent were negroes . And just so surely as the rape of the white woman is the crime which the savage negro commits over and over in spite of certain death , just as surely  | will marriage with the white woman be the goal to which he will struggle , if the social barriers are removed . Miscegenation is the inevitable outcome of social equality . Can you eat with a man at your table , and not stop to talk to him ? If you talk to him in your dining room , how can you avoid talking to him in your drawing room ? If he talks to you socially , how can you forbid his talking to your family socially ? If you have entertained him socially , how can you resent his aspirations for your daugh-ter ? Miscegenation is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement on the white race . Nor is he any improvement on the fullblooded black of the best type . Nature stamps him for ex term i nation by making him physiologically inferior to both races , . with far less endurance and vitality , according to statistics more susceptible to disease , to tuberculosis and insanity . The report of the Alabama insane hospitals contains the following : " The Africans in America came out of their servitude inherently improved people , mentally and physically . While they were slaves , there was very little deterioration among them , and consequently little insanity . Since then their rapidly increasing insanity is a result and an indication that many among them are mentally degenerating . In 1870 there were thirty-three negroes in our hospital . In 1900 there were four hundred and fifty-one . In 1900 there were about thirteen times as many negro insane under state care as in 1870 . There were about six times as many white insane . " From the Mississippi superintendent there is the following statement : " Looking at the books , to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites and the negroes , and the blacks had this advantage . Our total ' insane household numbers twelve hundred and sixty patients . I think that perhaps the mulatto is somewhat more susceptible to insanity than the pure ' negro . " The south deserves commendation for the way it bears its burden of negro criminals , of negro insane , of negro paupers , of negro schools , and above all for its defense of its social life from negro invasion . The world should at least do nothing to make more difficult the protection of the white woman , and the world should know and honor the southerner 's reasons for insisting upon absolute social separation , not from hatred of the black or because he does not like him and often respect him , but because preservation of species demands it . A recent issue of the New York Herald had an article in which , after recounting one of the horrible crimes daily occurring in the south , were these words , which may well bear repetition , because it is the duty of every American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country before he sits in judgment or shapes his actions . " Once more I beg , try to be sorry for the white woman of the south . All are in danger ; from the four-years-old babe to the grandmother of sixty-five . Aye , and pity the white men too , that are frenzied by such crimes . Reason with them like brothers . Do n't outrage them by calling them brutes , cruel , bloodthirsty outlaws . . . In your notices and editorials on lynchings , express some concern , some pity for the white woman whose ruin or murder brings them about . She belongs to your race : she is your countrywoman . Her ancestors fought in the Revolution , bled in the war of 1812 , died bravely in the civil war . She is worth your protection . Help to save her . " 1t " ithin the past year or so the horror has crept acroks the line , and what the north once viewed with incredulity and indifference from afar has lately become visible from its very doors . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . for it has manifested itself in Delaware , Kansas and Illinois . It has come too close to he ignored or pooh-poohed , or relegated to the limbo of malignant fiction . Suppose it were to be your daughter next ? What are you going to do about it , Americans ?
