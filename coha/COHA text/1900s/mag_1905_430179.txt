 | In an argument in favor of the Freedman 's Bureau , in 1866 , William Pitt Fessenden , of Maine , said : " It can not possibly be supposed for a moment that the people of the Confederate States feel kindly toward us . I should not at once feel kindly towards any enemy who had conquered me and through whom I had suffered even if I was in the wrong . Such is human nature . Time is necessary to soften all animosities . Time is necessary to overcome prejudice . " This spirit is shown in James Ford Rhodes 's last volume on the history of the United States during 1864-1866 . Forty years is a vista through which men appear in a different light . In this time the really great men have " come into the possession of their own " and are appreciated irrespective of their views and actions during the war . Furthermore , good qualities are visible now that were unseen and unappreciated at the close of the struggle . Of all the men who took part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-partisan appreciation . To others this reward has come more slowly . Sherman 's march to the sea has obscured other qualities of the man . His " irreparable damage , " his " making Georgia howl , " his " smashing things to the sea , " and his " making war and individual ruin synonymous terms " have blinded the South to his nobler and more generous qualities . With newspapers and politicians he was never popular ; in camp he was nervously restless , though in battle calm , but to a busy brain he joined the unfortunate habit of reckless speech . When Sherman heard of Lee 's surrender he felt sure that the war would soon end . Jos . E. Johnston felt it also and wrote Jefferson Davis : " My men are daily deserting in large numbers . Since Lee 's defeat they regard the war as at an end . If I march out of North Carolina her people will all leave my ranks . My small force is melting away like snow before the sun and I am  | hopeless of recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss the terms of capitulation . When Sherman showed Johnston the telegram announcing the assassination of Lincoln , Sherman says : " The perspiration came out in large drops on his Johnston 's forehead and he did not attempt to conceal his distress . " Unlike Lee , at Appomattox , Johnston 's army was not surrounded . Sherman knew this and saw the possibility of guerilla warfare , a thing he was anxious to avoid . To accomplish this purpose Sherman granted probably the most liberal terms ever granted by a conqueror and defended his action by saying : " We should not drive a people into anarchy . The South is broken and ruined and appeals to our pity . To ride the people down with persecutions and military exactions would be like slashing away at the crew of a sinking ship . I will fight as long as the enemy shows fight , but when he gives up and asks quarter I can go no further . " Stanton was very bitter toward Sherman for these liberal terms and tried to discredit him in the popular estimation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are determined to drive the Confederates into guerilla warfare . They may fight it out , I wo n't . " There were many beautiful things that occurred in these closing days of the war , and none more so than the surrender at Appomattox . Lee was dressed in a new , full dress uniform of Confederate gray " buttoned to the throat " and a handsome sword studded with jewels , while Grant wore a rough traveling suit . Lee had said , " There is nothing left me but to go and see General Grant and I would rather die a thousand deaths . " Grant said later , " I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly . " The surrender was made and in a few sad words Lee bade farewell to the army . On the side of the victors there was no unseemly jubilee . The soldiers at once fraternized and all began to think of the " homegoing . " There was a great contrast in their home-goings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times were hard and economy was practised ; gold and silver disappeared from circulation and gloom and depression followed . In the autumn of 1862 , a revival of business began , and till the end of the war trade and manufacturing were active . " It was a period of money- making and accumulation of wealth , " says Rhodes . John Sherman wrote in 1863 , " We are only another example of a people growing rich in a great war . Every branch of business is active and hopeful . " There were those who thought this prosperity was temporary and artificial , but time revealed that it was real . Of course , the cotton mills were hampered , but still some cotton found its way from the South to the North . There was much illicit trade carried on between the sections and at times with the connivance of those in authority . This trade was one of the greatest difficulties to regulate and much correspondence was had on the subject . Benj . F. Butler was sharply criticised for the part he took in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade with the enemy . Nevertheless during four years of the war the North consumed more than 1,000,000 bales of cotton , most of which came from territory under the control of the Confederacy . While the North had grown richer the South had grown poorer . Prices were high , gold and silver were soon scarce and later their currency became worthless . The commonest luxuries were soon given up , and then followed the necessaries . Tea and coffee were used only for medicinal purposes . In Columbia ice could be bought only on a physician 's certificate . Common medicines disappeared , causing great distress . Substitutes for quinine were concocted by the physicians . Many devices were designed to secure this drug from the North . A large doll filled with quinine was brought through the lines " for a poor cripple girl , " as the owner declared with tears in his eyes . Clothing soon became very scarce . When Jackson took Winchester in 1862 , his soldiers discarded their well-worn gray and donned blue uniforms . Jackson had to order them arrested as soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war both in the North and in the South . In the Northwest the Knights of the Golden Circle and the Sons of Liberty thought that the war ought to cease . They held peace meetings and among the nervous caused some excitement . Morgan 's raid into Ohio was intended to test this sentiment , but it was found to be very weak . It was thought that the resistance to the draft would create a sentiment favorable to the Confederacy , but it did not . Frequent plans were on foot in Canada  | to make incursions into the North and a few were made , but with no important results . Designs were also on foot to free the prisoners in Chicago and to burn New York . In the South there were also secret societies and peace parties . They were of no service to the Union armies , but they caused much trouble to the Confederate government . It was necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus , and in many places martial law was declared . This caused much opposition , even from men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of political arrests at the South were fewer than at the North and the large proportion of them were made in the immediate seat of war . The enjoyment of despotic power so noticeable in the proceedings of Seward and Stanton is not apparent in the officials of the Confederacy . " The loyalty of the slave has been well noted . They made no effort to rise . " It is a wonderful picture , one that discovers virtues in the Southern negroes and merit in the civilization under which they had been trained , " says Mr. Rhodes . Henry Grady said , " A thousand torches would have disbanded the Southern army , but there was not one . " From his prison at Fortress Monroe , Jefferson Davis wrote his wife , " I hope the negro 's fidelity will be duly rewarded . " There were great revivals of religion in both armies . There was a profound religious sentiment . Bibles and Testaments were in every hand . Upon request the United States government permitted Bibles to be sent from Philadelphia to the Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents and their actions under various circumstances . Mr. Rhodes writes in a discriminating and balanced way of the two : " Lincoln was a man of much greater ability and higher character than Davis , yet Davis was a worthy foeman . He had trials similar to those of his Northern compeer . As Lincoln had to contend with Governor Seymour , so had Davis with Governors Brown and Vance . Brown and Vance had what Sir Walter Scott called the ' itch for disputation . ' Davis lacked the tact and magnanimity of Lincoln . . . . . The Southern president was a born controversialist . . . . . Davis received neither sympathy nor support from the vice-president . . . . . Those  | who like similitudes will recall that Lincoln and Davis each lost a beloved son during the war ? Willie , ' at the age of twelve from disease , while Joseph , a little romping boy , died as the result of a fall . If Davis had won he would have been a hard master to the vanquished The moral heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The treatment of prisoners is one phase of the war that is not yet discussed impassionately . There is evidence to prove any view . Both Northern and Southern prisons were over-crowded , and the life in each was hard . Exchanges were made till May , 1863 , when such was stopped by order of General Halleck , probably because of the attitude of the Confederacy toward negro prisoners and their white officers . " To the refusal to exchange prisoners and to the threatened retaliation by the North and to Andersonville at the South are due for the most part the bitterness which has been infused into this controversy " The Confederative government was aware that it could not feed its prisoners in Richmond , and therefore sent many of them South . In 1863 the Andersonville prison in Georgia was established in the very heart of the granary of the eastern part of the confederacy . That this prison was horrible , Southern testimony bears witness . Grant was opposed to exchanges and wrote that it was hard on the men in the prison , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a system of exchanges would continue the war till the whole South was exterminated . " At this particular time ( August , 1864 , ) to release all rebel prisoners North would insure Sherman 's defeat and would compromise our safety here " ( City Point ) . Abortive efforts were made to place the blame on Jefferson Davis , but they failed . " The freer judgment of history leaves no stain on his character . " Lincoln bore no part in this controversy and never made in messages or letters any charges of cruelty against the Confederates . Reconstruction was a difficult problem and there are few who praise the way in which it resulted . And yet in view of the passion and radicalism of the day probably no set of men could have done it better . The North was divided . Gov . Andrews , of Massachusetts , declared that opportunity should at once be given to the natural leaders of the South to lead , since they surely would by-and-by . Andrews saw things as they really were , but others  | clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put forward the preposterous claim that the Confederate States were entitled to all their constitutional rights just as if there had been no war . Theoretically there was such a claim , practically there was none . Had the policy of reconstruction been left to the officers and soldiers of the two armies , a plan of mercy would have been offered by one side and necessary conditions accepted by the other . Grant said to Stephens , " The true policy should be to make friends of enemies . " Sherman favored Johnston 's policy and was not disturbed by harsh negro legislation . Sheridan thought that congress ought to legislate as little as possible for the negro and let his social status be determined by the necessity for his labor . Lee thought the North could " afford to be generous " and that it was the " best policy . " Lee , Mallory , and Stephens thought some negroes would be granted the suffrage . But things were not left to them . Johnston tried but was overcome by radical opposition .
