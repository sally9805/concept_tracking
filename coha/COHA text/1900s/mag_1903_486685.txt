SIR : In your interesting editorial of October 1 , you say , concerning the theory of numbers and ' the theory of functions , that " no practical application , and ( as far as one can see into the future ) no scientific application , either , is likely ever to be made of one or other of those two theories , outside of pure mathematics itself . " This statement would probably have passed unchallenged a few years ago , perhaps even as recently as the time when the lamented mathematician to whom you allude was devoting himself to that pure and secluded virgin , the theory of numbers ; but the mathematicians and physicists have been coming together within the last decade ; they are comparing their standing problems , and are learning how to be mutually helpful and stimulating It is realized that certain physical problems are at a standstill for want of appropriate modes of mathematical expression , and that there is need for the invention or discovery of new forms of functional relationship Increased attention is accordingly being directed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable The complex plane is one of the meeting-grounds of mathematicians and physicists , and the latter are now quite at home in the presence of that coy handmaiden , the complex variable ; indeed , the well-known transformation scene in which she and her image play such a prominent part , is now an important feature in the solution of some practical problems . The discovery of a new form of function to correspond to a new physical relation is at once a gain to natural science and to mathematics , and it widens the intellectual horizon . A single concrete example of the way in which the mutual stimulus operates may be of interest . In 1891 Dr Pockels of Heidelberg , in his treatise on the partial differential equations of mathematical physics , made the following suggestive remarks : " Both from a mathematical and physical standpoint , multiform functions are important , and it is very desirable that the properties of such functions , their winding-points and singularities , their behavior on Riemann surfaces , etc , should be systematically investigated  --  in - short , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newtonian and logarithmic potential . . . In this direction of , inquiry without doubt a wide and rich field offers itself " About six years later , Professor Sommerfeld of Aachen , and his pupil , Dr. Cars-law of Glasgow , contributed papers to the London Mathematical Society on the multiform functions that satisfy certain differential equations subject to various boundary conditions , and they used these functions to solve some standing physical problems One of these was the following problem in diffraction " Plane waves of sound , light , or electricity are incident on a thin infinite half-plane bounded by a straight edge : to find the resulting diffraction of the waves , " This problem had been mentioned in Lord Rayleigh 's article on Wave Theory ' in the ' Encyclopmdia Britannica , ' in the following terms " The full solution of problems concerning the mode of action of a screen is scarcely to be expected Even in the simple case of sound , where we know what we have to deal with , the mathematical difficulties are formidable , and we are not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound past a rigid infinite thin plane screen bounded by a straight edge or perforated by a circular aperture . " The appropriate solution was obtained by - the conception of a twofold Riemann space having the ordinary physical space as one of its folds , the half-plane as a branch membrane , and the straight edge as a winding line . The characteristic multiform function that expresses the wave motion was derived by the most beautiful use of pure function-theory . I doubt if either Cayley or Sylvester would regret to see the sway of the virgin queen thus extended over new dominions . If she no longer has the seclusion of a " Leibnitzian monad , " she exemplifies in a higher sense the Leibnitzian doctrine of preestablished harmony  --  the harmony of the world of nature with the world of the intellect . What God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . Very truly yours , TAMES MCMAHON . ITHACA , N. r ? October 10 , 1903 . An- apposite instance ! Had we known of it , we should have softened our remark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications have been made of propositions worked out by Cauchy and earlier mathematicians before the " theory of functions " was christened , and for which ( though they are now incorporated in it ) it can take no more credit than the theory of numbers could to the carpenter 's rule of three-four-five , which was known to Pythagoras , but the principle of which may to-day figure in a treatise on that theory But now , for the first time , we meet with one genuine case of an application of the theory of functions , upon which we may ground some hope for further such triumphs It is a convincing and striking proof that a line of thought which seems to relate exclusively to impossil4e states of things may , if resolutely pursued , eventually bring great light upon familiar experiences . Let us give this instance a permanent place in our memory alongside of the fact that Pascal , after his wonderful discovery about conic sections , abandoned that study as an idle pastime having no application to any matter of im-portance - All this , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our remark was designed to make ; for at the time when it could be said that the British were neglecting the theory-of functions ( which is-no longer true ) , there was no glimmer of reasonable hope that it could ever be of any use . As for the theory of numbers , the first application of it has , we believe , yet to be made , Notes . A new edition of Stevenson 's ' Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde , ' with illustrations by Charles Raymond Macauley , and a reissue of the century-old ' Peter Piper 's Principles of Polite Pronunciation ' ( for children ) , may be looked for next month from the Scott-Thaw Co of this city . The pioneer missionary of the Episcopal Church in the Northwest , Dr J. Lloyd Breck , is to be commemorated in a volume of biography and reminiscences by the Rev. Theodore I.

L A Index to Portraits This great undertaking is , we learn from the September Bulletin of the Central National Library in Florence , to be paralleled ( and of course overlapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' which has been in compilation for a decade . The impulse to this index was the gift to the Library of more than 20,000 portraits by Professor Buonamici , but the range of the work transcends this collection to embrace other portraits possessed by the Library as well as th.ose in books . In this last particular , a base exists in a manuscript ' Iconografia Universale ' begun an 1828 by Vincenzo Follini , in sixteen volumes , and including portraits scattered through the works in the Magliabechian section of the Library . The Bulletin , by the way , notices the Government appointment - of a committee to catalogue and regulate the travellthg libraries ( hbrerte ambillatttp ) One of the unnoticed events that deserve commemoration infinitely more than most battles is the completion of Mr. Charles Booth 's description of the ' Life and Labor of the People in London ' ( Macmillan ) . This . work , which in most respects far surpasses similar essays under Governmental auspices , such as our own census reports . will be of as much value to future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer be ignorant of how the other half lives . One cause of the success achieved was the unbiased character of the investigation , the design . having been solely " to observe and chronicle the actual " In recognition of the magnificent public service so nobly rendered by Mr. Booth , if for no other reason , every one will join in the prayer with which he concludes : " May some great soul , master of a subtler and nobler alchemy than mine , disentangle the confused issues , reconcile the apparent contradictions in aim , melt and commingle the various influences for good into one divine uniformity of effort , and make these dry bones live , so that the streets of our Jerusalem may sing with joy ! " Four years ago we had occasion to praise Mr. Frederic C. Penfield 's ' Present-Day Egypt . ' and now we can welcome a revised and enlarged edition ( The Century Co . ) . That there was room for this will appear if we mention solely the completion meanwhile of the mighty dam at Assuan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , reset and brought closely up to date . Two editions of the works of Henry Fielding reach us together , and yet not precisely in rivalry The first , in twelve volumes , is in the satisfactory form of Thomas Y. Crowell &; Co ' s earlier meritorious reprints . It requires no further comment , except that it has agreeable introductions to each book , - by Dr. G H. Maynadier , and an etched frontispiece of excellent quality in every volume . The second edition , by Croscup &; Sterling , in sixteen volumes , is of the de luxe order , and itsued in only 1,000 copies The books have all the attractions of clear type , deckle edges , and labelled red buckram covers , with the additional feature of more than a hundred illustra ? tons , being facsimile title-pages , manuscripts of the author , portraits of himself and associates , and eighteenth-century illustrations to his works . Under this rubric the names of Stothard , Rowlandson , and Cruikshank ( his ideal illustrator ) are prominent . Furthermore , the present edition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fifty titles , mostly under the head of dramatic and legal works , appear for the first time The editorial compilation was a labor of love of the late W. E. Henley , whose essay on the genius of Fielding appears in the last volume The general reader will do very well with the Crowell edition , the student and bibliophile must have recourse to Messrs . Croscup &; Sterling Charles Scribner 's Sons have imported the volume on ' Cricket ' in the " Country Life " Library of Sport . It is edited by Horace G. Hutchinson , and elaborately 11- lustrated with an assortment of old prints obtained from the Marylebone Club and from private collections . There are chapters by well-known experts on Batting , Bowling , Fielding , County Cricket , Australian Cricket , University Cricket , and so forth , full of excellent advice , discriminating comment , and interesting reminiscence ; and the most exacting enthusiast would find it difficult to point out any important development in the history or practice of the game that is not recorded in these 440 pages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories as well as to convey useful information , there will always be room for new books on the Alps . We do not re= fer alone to the record of mountaineering exploits , but to all kinds of writings which bring brown rock-wall or green pasture before the inner eye ' A Pleasure-Book of Grindelwald , ' by Daniel P. Rhodes ( Macmillan ) , is to be recommended for its title . its illustrations , and its text . The author is apparently a " centrist , " for he does not take us into outlying parts of the Oberland . His theme is the region between the Grosse Scheidegg and Marren ? the region , one might almost say , which can be controlled from the Bear Hotel . All the pleasant things of Alpine life and leisure enter into his pages . Winter and summer are alike recalled . We may hear echoes of climbing , but Mr. Rhodes does not look upon the Eiger and the Jungfrau as greased poles . Sliding , skating , and skiing have in turn their share of attention , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpses of the most beautiful landscapes which Switzerland affords . The illustrations , though not of the most expensive order , are so very attractive-that they extort a word of more than conventional praise . This is not a book to be itemized , but to be read by all who love and miss the Alps . ' Sidelights on the Court of France , ' by Lieut - Col . Andrew C P Haggard ( Dutton ) , the most lenient reviewer would find it difficult to praise . Its subject is the court life of France from the days of Francis I. to those of Louis XIII , or , rather , its subject is the scandalous history of that period . Col. Haggard , we must admit , professes to be shocked at the profligacy which he describes , but - why should he describe it ? As a contribution to historical literature , his farrago of gossip deserves but the scantiest notice . For example , a single passage will suffice . " It was said and generally believed that the famous ' Man in the Iron Mask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the elder brother of Louis XIV. , being in truth the son of Anne of Austria by the Duke of Buckingham . " As a piece of story-telling this book also fails to justify itself , for though it would fain be vivacious it is not so . There is no reason that we can see why books of this sort should be written , printed or bought . ' Sweet Violets and Pansies ' ( Scribners ) is a book for such as would cultivate these exquisite floral cousins successfully The fragrant violet is the favorite of the poet and the society woman , the pansy of the amateur gardener , because of its beauty and endless variety of coloring It is not often that man can improve on . nature , but in the case of the pansy he has done so amazingly . The wild Alpine pansy , is a thing of beauty , but not such a joy forever as the garden pansy , which owes its present charms to persistent selection and weeding out . No variety of pansies can be depended upon to reproduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the editor of this volume , E. T. Cook , points out ; for " nothing imparts such zest to gardening as watching a bed of seedlings for the:opening flowers ; . . there are certain to be pleasant floral surprises in the way of highly promising novelties " He quotes the best authorities on pansy and violet culture freely , gives descriptions of many , famous varieties , and full directions for raising from the seed or by means of cuttings . It is instructive to watch the efforts to interest this country in its wards in the Far East , while our people can not be said to concern itself yet with PortoRico  --  nothing like as much as with Alaska . Mr. Samuel MacClintock , Ph B , principal of the Cebn Normal School , has compiled ' The Philippines A Geographical Reader , ' " which the American Book Company has ; brought out in good shape , with photographic illustrations of manners and customs , scenery , architecture , etc , and with - simple maps . The last chapter describes the government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing connection with the United States . The Smithsonian Institution 's annual report for the year ending June 30 , 1901. has just appeared It embodies the report of the United ' States National Museum , by Richard Rathbun , which in turn embodies the report on the Museum 's exhibit at Buffalo in the year named above . The photographic illustrations are very attractive . Room is found at the close of the volume for a narrative of a visit to Indian tribes of the Purus River , Brazil , by Joseph Beal Steere . The Cambridge Antiquarian Society decided , in 1894 , to commemorate the scholarly work of Henry Richards Luard , sometime Registrary of Cambridge University , by publishing the old records of academic life called " Grace " books . In accordance with this resolution , Grace Book A was most carefully edited , annotated , and indexed by Mr. Stanley M Leathes of Trinity College , and appeared in 1897 . Now , after an interval of six years , appears Grace Book B , Part I. , contarnmg the proctors ' accounts and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Grace Book A , be it remembered , covered the years 1454-1488 ) The second part of Grace Book B , promised by the Society for 1904 , will cover the years 1511-1549 . Thus will become available for students of the momentous period which saw the growth and triumph of the new learning in Europe the minutest records of academic life at Cambridge . Already , in his edition of Grace Book A , Mr Leathes called attention to the fact that , among the numerous books listed as pledges deposited up to 1488 in various university chests , there was no trace whatever of the revival of learning , and only one record of a printed book , mentioned as a curiosity . Turning to this year 's publication of Grace Book B , Part I , we find that what must be a printed book , Ficmo-s Latin translation of Plato , was pledged in December , 1500 . Here , then , is a trace both of the new art of printing and of the new learning . The editorial work upon Grace Book B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Mary Bateson has written the Introduction , and several hands have prepared the annotations , established lation , while in New York the ratio was one to 333 , or almost exactly the same ratio as for the whites . Mr. 0 . W. Price urges the immediate application of practical forestry to the lumber industry of this country . It now ranks fourth among our manufacturing industries , with an annual product valued at $566,000,000 , but it is run on the fundamentally unsound principle of regarding only present profit without relation to the future . He advocates the gradual elimination of the large sawmill , the substitution of those of moderate size , and the adoption of measures to secure a second crop from the lumbered area . In connection with that interesting event , the opening of the Germanic Museum at Harvard on November 10 , Mr. Heinrich Conned has arranged to give a performance of three German plays  --  by Hans Sachs , Goethe , and Ludwig Fulda  --  typical of different epochs in the history of the German drama . The good impression which foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evidenced , among other things , by the fact that a member of the Academy of Sciences of Christiania , who does not want his identity to be- known , but who has spent a year in the United States , has given 6,000 crowns to the Nansen Fund for the promotion of science , which was established , it will be remembered , after the return of Nansen from his Arctic expedition , to serve as a nucleus for an American Fund . The donor desires in this way to give expression to his admiration and veneration for the American people , and he hopes that the fund will grow by contributions from others entertaining the same sentiments . That Henrik Ibsen 's health is better than it has of late repeatedly been reported to be , appears from a story told in a Christiania newspaper . Ibsen , it seems , is very fond of spending a part of his forenoons sitting on a bench in the Queen 's Park , a secluded part of the Royal Park surrounding the castle ; but one day , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate closed , to his great disgust , for he was unaware that the Queen 's Park is always closed to the general public when the Queen honors the city with her presence . The King , however , learned of the matter , and immediately gave orders that Ibsen should be admitted to the park at any and all times , sending him , besides , a key to the park , so that he could always be sure of his ability to enter . On the 27th of October a remarkable expiatory memorial will be unveiled in Geneva on the spot where Michael Servetus was burned to death for heresy Just three hundred and fifty years ago The placing of this granite block is the outcome of the agitation of Professor Doumergue , the great historian of Calvin . Beneath the record of the historic event the tablet contains the following memorable words : " Fils respectueux et reconnaissants de Calvin , notre grand reformateur , rows condamnant une erreur qui fut cells de son siecle , et fermement attaches 9. la libertd de conscience selon les vrais principes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le 27 Octobre , 1903 . " With what difficulties the students of modern history must contend in Prussia is clear from an article published in the last Heft of the Htstortsche Vierteljahrschirlfi , by Professor Rochfahl , who reports that the Government of that country refuses to scholars and savants all access to the state archives later than the year 1840 . Permission to study the materials since that year is granted only as an exceptional privilege and with sharp restrictions . Rochfahl , who once secured such permission to secure data for the March Revolution of 1848 , was compelled to submit his extracts to the authorities , who eliminated the best and most important portions . ? The first number of the Scottish . Historical Review appears this month with the imprint of Messrs . MacLehose &; Sons , publishers to the University of Glasgow , and is adorned most appropriately with the rampant lion of Scotland , associated in academic circles with the arms of Balliol College , but nowhere , be it admiringly said , more correctly and artistically portrayed than on this beautifully printed quarterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which this Review is technically a " New Series , " emerges a periodical which takes its place worthily by the side of the American and English historical reviews . It is intended to cover history , archaeology , and literature , " with more particular attention to Scotland and the Borders , " and prominence will be given to " the discussion of problems in old English and Scottish literature " ? according to the account of it offered by the editor , whose name does not appear . A long list of prospective contributors , including most of the well-known authorities on Scottish antiquities and many others , shows that this review has a most solid backing in Scotland , and makes it certain to deserve a wider support than could be given to the Scottish Antiquary . To the present number . Prof. Walter Raleigh contributes a paper on the lives of authors , illustrated by uncommonly well-executed facsimiles from the Bodleian engravings and drawings of Isaak Walton , John Aubrey , and Anthony a Wood . Mr. Law 's account of Lislebourg and Petit Leith explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France and Spain for a considerable period beginning shortly before the birth of Mary Queen of Scots Edinburgh was called Leith-lebourg , and its pert Petit Leith , he thinks . However that may be , he absolutely disposes of the popular account of the matter which requires Edinburgh to figure in the mind of the French as the island-city , L'Islebourg . What Mr Law desiderates is examples of either Lislebourg or Petit Leith before June , 1640 , the date of the dispatch of Marillac , in which he finds the earliest use of Lislebourg for Edinburgh . Mr Millar reports on a curious volume in which Scotland was described for Queen Magdalene by Jehan Desmontiers , whom James V. engaged to do the work for his bride 's enlightenment . Only one copy of this book exists in Britain , nor is it frequent on the Continent , where it was printed in 1538 . Interesting as the other contributions are , only Mr. Andrew Lang 's publication of a letter from Sir William Stewart and Mr. James Wilson 's account and publication of an English letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mentioned here . ? The article in the July number of the Burlington Magazine ( New York : Samuel Buckley &; Co. ) possessing the greatest general interest is that which deals with the Sir Joshuas , twenty-six in number , in the collection of the Earl of Normanton Thirteen of these are illustrated in the plates . two in photogravure , and the rest in halftone . They include the seven paintings of the cardinal and theological virtues which were made as designs for the stained-glass window at New College , Oxford , and are as charming as independent works of eighteenth-century art as they are inappropriate to their purpose ; the other pictures a:e portraits , the best of which , to our mind , is that of George , third Duke of Marlborough . As a whole , this group of Reynolds 's works is pronounced by Mr. Max Roldit to be " unparalleled in any other collection , public or private , all the world over . " Of the other articles , that on " The Plate of Winchester College " is most splendidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' occurs the following paragraph , which is worthy of the attention of some of our mural painters ' " But modern art is just at a point where Pintoricchio is really more sympathetic than the masters of the great style , for in the break-up of artistic tradition and the decline of classical taste the decorator of to-day is thrown back upon parading the mere materials of his art , upon bright color and relief , upon sumptuousness , and the startling and attractive He has , in fact , dedicated himself to ornamentation  --  for we must not debase the word decoration , And of ornamentation , of the sumptuous , the attractive , the gay and , the ingenious , Pintoricchio was a master The go " geousness of the Borgia apartments delude even critics who ought to distinguish more subtly , into praising them as art " This coincides so exactly With our own opinion , as expressed in our review of the same work , that it is a pleasure to reprint it . ? The August number , though of the usual high standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georg Gronau seems to us to overrate Titian 's portrait of the Empress Isabella , wife of Charles V. , of which an admirable photogravure is given . The picture , in our Judgment , shows lust that lack of vitality which was to be expected in the painting of a person whom the artist had never seen The publication of the presumptive original from which Titian worked gives its main interest to the article . Mr Campbell Dodgson writes of a " newly cbscovered portrait-drawing-by Ddrcr , " not of the highest quality , recently acquired by the British Museum , which he thinks he has succeeded in identifying as a portrait of Margaret , sister of Casimir , Margrave of Culmbach , and Mr. Pennell " does not argue with us , but tells us " about " Later Nineteenth Century Book Illustrations . " On the whole , we are most thankful for the " Portrait of a Lady , " by Itembrandt , in th " collection of Mr. J. Hage , a picture of the year of the " Anatomy Lesson , " and a teautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early period , with all his invariable sense of life . It is published in a good half-tone plate with brief comment . ? Of particular interest were two recent meetings of the Massachusetts Historical Society . The address of the President , Mr. Charles Francis Adams , in which he tells the story of the battle of Salamis , would alone distinguish the proceedings , for he restates the subject in the light of a personal visit to Marathon and Salamis . Apart from this presentation , to which we ; nay return , the Society prints a remarkable series of letters written to Dr. Richard Price , who was so good a friend to America in the Revolution , and a second series of letters from Benjamin Vaughan to the Earl of Shelburne . In the eighty-one Price letters is new material from Franklin , Jefferson , Chauncy , Winthrop , Gordon , Rush , Shelburne , and others , extending from 1767 to 1790 . The quality of this correspondence is unusually high , and throws much light upon English and American politics during and after the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jubilee in Hell , " and Chauncy believed the Continental currency and its failure a real blessing to the country . The phrase " prudential algebra " is worthy of Franklin , and his criticism of Necker is quite as good " I will not say that the writer thinks higher of himself and his abilities than they deserve , but I wish for his own sake that he had kept such sentiments more out of sight " Shelburne makes the suggestion that the displeasure so long displayed against Carleton arose from his not employing the Indians sooner . Hazlitt , the father of the essayist , gives a warning against Dr Rush which is all the more curious as being undoubtedly true , though much against the character of the doctor " Sandford and Merton " Day offers a not unjust criticism of American poetry , in connection with a proposal to dispose of the copyright of Barlow 's ' Columbiad ' in England The one letter in the collection written by Dr. Price contains a very appreciative account of his friend , Adam Smith , who had recently passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Adams , and were copied from the originals with an intention of including them in the " Works of John Adams . " The nine letters now printed relate to the peace negotiations of 1783 The writer ingeniously urged reasons for retaining the Floridas as a base for threatening the possessions of Spain in America .. " ' While wars are among our foolish customs , I can not see why the Gulf of Mexico should not as well belong to England as to Spain " With Canada , the St. Lawrence , the Lakes , the Ohio , and the Mississippi in English keeping , there would be a " trading coast " at the back of the American " colonies " answering to the Atlantic in front of them . This was late in 1782 , when Vaughan was urging haste so that no interruption could come from Adams , then at The Hague and believed to be hostile to Great Britain and her desires Later he looked upon Adams as very favorable to England The two series of letters are notable ? One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greek , the interest in Greek civilization , are not destined to fall into the background , is the popular support regularly given to the revival of a Greek play . Whether at Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania in the East , or at Stanford or Berkeley on the Pacific Coast , there seems to be no difficulty in securing large audiences who not only sit out a play in a language they do not understand , but follow it with unflagging interest . Aristophanes won no more flattering tribute from his admiring Athenians than was paid him by the 7,000 American spectators who witpesSed P. single performance of the " Birds , " last month , in the new Greek theatreat Berkeley The fact that seven representations of the " Antigone " were given in southern and central California last year by the members of Stanford University , and that the receipts met all the expenses , is , some will think , a more signal triumph for Sophocles than that famous victory over . eEschylus won more than two thousand years ago . To commemorate its success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attractive little volume entitled " Antigone " ( San Francisco . Paul Elder &; Co ) , with a full account of the presentation and a score of full-page photographs , which should be useful to the promoters of any Greek play in the future A.critical study of the play by A. T. Murray is included , but perhaps the most , important feature is an essay on the " Choral Side of the Antigone , " by H Rushton Fairclough , who gives a clear and accurate account of the musical setting of a Greek play and the functions of the chorus , together with a discussion of Mendelssohn 's choral music , which was composed for the " Antigone " in 1841 at the request of Frederick William of Prussia It is the great advantage of the " Antigone " that it possesses this set of choruses for male voices in which the genius of Mendelssohn offsets the antiquarian accuracy , or attempt at accuracy , of more modern imitators of Greek music . ? It is usually a dull task , if not unprofitable , to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the selections from Pliny 's Letters prepared for Macmillan 's Classical Series by Prof Elmer T Merrill . From the humor so frequently observable in the introductory pages we are disposed to infer that Professor Merrill has sat at the feet of the sage of Johns Hopkins  --  if not as a pupil , at any rate as a reader of those delightful editorial coruscations which appear from quarter to quarter in the American Journal of Philology . Professor Merrill sets a high value on the Letters , not discounting them so heavily as some because of their artificial character A man may be excessively self-conscious , he holdd , may write with a constant view to future-publication , and still be sincere . It must be conceded , however , that one writing under these conditions will hardly come as near telling the whole truth as he might otherwise do The loss of Pliny 's speeches and poems is not regarded as a serious misfortune . As to the former , the possession of the ' Panegyric ' " will go far towards solacing our grief for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told : " As every man of letters then or m any period of the world ought to do , Pliny loved poetry , and as few men then or ever ought to do , he tried to write it . Naturally enough , he loved what he had written , but , worse than that , he also admired it " Professor Merrill has made an independent and careful study of the manuscripts , and his readings differ in about one hundred and thirty cases from those of Keil 's critical edition ( 1870 ) . Grammatical discussions are excluded from his Introduction , as he does not choose to display " the bleached and arid bones of grammatical and stylistic framework , laid out in classified order before the student 's repugnant vision " right at the start . The commentary is sufficiently full  --  about two pages to one of text  --  and is well adapted to elucl. date the thought . THE " CAMBRIDGE " UNITED STATES. - The United States .

It is all ( except the two chapters on the French in Canada ) occupied with the history of the United States , and out of its 751 pages nearly 200 , filling six chapters , are devoted to the War of Secession  --  a proportion perhaps excessive when one considers that , immensely important as that struggle was , it represents in a certain sense rather a side channel than the main stream of American development . The history of democratic institutions and the history of economic development are , after all , the two lines of progress with which the present and future have most to do In conformity with the general plan of this great work , the present volume is the work of different writers selected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the particular topic committed to him . Thirteen contribute , all but three of whom are Americans One of the three , Mr. John A. Doyle , writes four chapters , covering the history of the colonies down to the end of the Revolutionary war . The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are fully treated by Mr. Melville M. Bigelow . Prof. J B McMaster gives us in three chapters a general history of the nation from 1783 till 1850 , while the war of 1812 , considered as a sort of military and naval episode , is allotted to Mr. H W Wilson President Woodrow Wilson , in a chapter on the State Rights controversy , carries the reader down to 1860 , where the late Mr John G. Nicolay takes up the tale , and narrates minutely the operations in the civil war After chapters on the South during the War by Professor Schwab , on Political Reconstruction by Mr Theodore Clark Smith , and on the United States as a World Power by Prof John B. Moore , which bring the narrative down to 1902 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett Wendell give a general survey of the economic development of the United States and of the work of America in the field of literature and art . This enumeration shows how difficult it is to review the book as a whole . One can not , within the limits of an article of this kind , attempt to describe or criticise the method , the style , the idiosyncrasies of thirteen different writers , nor can one examine the general views of the course of American history presented , for each writer has his own point of view , and it is in the variety of points of view as well as in special competence that the value of this sort of composite work resides . This , however , we May say of the volume as a whole , that , like Volume I. , it is a piece of good , solid , thorough work from beginning to end . There- is very little rhetoric and , indeed , very little ornament of any kind All is practical , direct , and business-like Few of those general reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when the result of a series of events might he profitably summed up in that form However , in several of the chapters , such as President Wilson 's on the last political phase of the " irrepressible conflict , " before the ship was hurried into the rapids by the Presidential election of 1860 , we find a clear , broad , and vigorous presentment of most of the forces that were at work worthy of his reputation , as well as an admirable sketch of Calhoun Mr. Bradley 's account of the campaign which wrested Canada from France and gave it to England is full of spirit , and Prof. Barrett Wendell 's chapter entitled " The American Intellect " is a striking piece of work in its conciseness , in the constant precision and frequent felicity of its - expression , and in the effort to interpret each part of the products of American thought by the other parts , so as to convey a general impression of the typical features of the national mind There is no harder task than to present such a view which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving undue prominence to any one leading idea And although those who have meditated on the topics Professor Wendell handles may find themselves differing from some of his judgments , they will , if they are candid , admit that he has given them suggestions deserving to be pondered over , and fit to awaken new ideas in their own hearts One task , however , which the composition Of this volume involved is scarcely less formidable than that which confronted Professor Wendell : It is the task of telling the political story of the last few years  --  years which are in the memory of all of us ; , years whose events are still the subject of strenuous controversy . Many of the data by which the judgment of history on the actors in those events will be determined have not yet been made public , nor can the most courageous and candid writer venture to say-all that he thinks , . even when he is sure that he possesses sufficient data , because nobody can be expected to embroil himself in disputes with living men or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history ofone 's own time as it is to speak the whole truth regarding some prominent person who has just quitted the world Prof. J B Moore had therefore a duty of extreme difficulty and delicacy when he undertook the last narrative chapter , which covers the period from 1885 to 1902 . He has addressed himself to it with honesty and impartiality . He has wisely made it a mere record of facts , and has abstained from the expression of opinions , whether on politics ' or on persons Yet without some expressions of opinion it is scarcely possible to convey the whole facts , for the significance of the facts can not be understood without a knowledge of the personal factors . Mr Blaine , for instance , and President McKinley are in these pages little more than names , yet it was the character of the two men that at certain points made all the difference to the course things took We could not send a European to this portion for an account of the proceedings which led up to the war with Spam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that he Would knoW all the causes , or even all the main causes , that determined the momentous ? change that war has brought . This may suggest a doubt whether the editors have been well advised in trying to bring the narratiVei , ex- cept in the form of a ha-1'e- chronological record , down to the date of publication of each volume Returning to the book as a whole , and repeating the impression of fairness and thoroughness which it makes , we may add a few criticisms on points which seem inadequately dealt with In chapter v. Mr. Doyle describes the incidents in the quarrel with Great Britain with the knowledge and judgment we expect from him , and in chapter vi ( " The Declaration of Independence " ) Mr. Melville Bigelow gives an extremely careful and valuable analysis of the legal questions at issue between the mother country and the colonies But a chapter , or a section of a chapter , is also needed to describe the moral and ? sociaL forces which were tending to draw the nations apart  --  a branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two writers . The chapters devoted to the struggle over slavery may appear scarcely satisfactory to those , now becoming few , who remember the ante-bellum days . Slavery was a worse thing , not only in its ultimate economic results , but also in the actual suffering it inflicted , in the moral evils it engendered , in the spirit and temper it created , than would be gathered from chapter xiii. , and although the moral feeling of the North which expressed itself most forcibly among the Abolitionists is touched upon , its importance as a factor is not quite fully recognized . In the later parts of the volume three topics receive. , less prominence than they deserve One is the growth of the party system  --  a growth which is really the most distinctive feature of American democracy , the most remarkable contribution to the " natural history of democracy in general " which America has made . Another is the part played in the public life of the country by great cities and the problems of municipal administration Though it would have been impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purification , of reform and relapse , in New York or Philadelphia or Chicago , the influence ' of the cities has grown so notably that this important subject ought not to have been passed over almost in silence Lastly , there is the negro problem It is touched on ' in the chapter on Reconstruction , but its later developments , both social and Constitutional , receive slight notice , though the whole history of the colored race in America is one of the most remarkable and instructive branches of the ethnological annals of mankind .
