txt An officer and five men were killed and an officer and a man dangerously hurt yesterday by an explosion in the forward turret of the battleship Kearsarge . A charge of powder , which was ignited while going below , in some manner not yet known , caused the fatalities . It is evident the explosion was not due to hurried firing , because the target practice in that turret had been finished when it occurred . The Kearsarge had accompanied the Atlantic fleet for the drills in the Caribbean Sea and was engaged in the quarterly target practice . Some excellent results in rapidity of fire and marksmanship were expected from this practice , as it was known that the rivalry among the men on the various ships was keen . First news of the accident came late this afternoon in the following cablegram from Rear Admiral Evans : " Caimanera , April 14 , 190B . " Secretary Navy , Washington : " On April 13 , about 3:16 P. M. , shortly after the completion of the target practice of the Kearsarge 's forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of a thirteen-inch charge of powder were ignited . The charge of powder in the other lift , just below , and one section inside the thirteen-inch remained intact . " The cause not yet determined , nor accountability . The matter is being investigated . " Lieut . Joseph W. Graeme , the gun umpire , has been sent to the Maryland in a very critical state . The following have since died : Lieut . Hudgins , turret officer ; Peter Norberg , gunner 's mate ; Theodore Naegely , seaman ; Anton 0 . Thoreon , ordinary seaman ; Julius A. Koester , turret captain , first class ; Ellis H. Athey , seaman . The following was dangerously Injured by the accident , and recovery is doubtful , W. King , ordinary seaman . Will bury dead at Guantanamo . Vessel uninjured . " Acting Secretary Newberry carried the message to the President at the White House and was authorized to send this reply : April 14 , 1908 . Evans , Maine , Naval Station , Caimanera : The department is deeply grieved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injury in the performance of duty of brave officers and men in the navy , and it extends its heartfelt sympathy to the injured and wishes for a speedy recovery from their wounds . Spare no effort to ease the sufferings of the injured in every possible manner and show every honor to the dead . NEWBERRY . The first feeling of the officers at the Navy Department after reading the cablegram was one of surprise that the accident had resulted in so little loss of life . The Kearsarge 's forward turret , where it occurred , is of the superposed type , an eight-inch gun turret sitting on the top of the thirteen-inch gun turret , where the accident occurred . In the lower turret were twenty-four men and in the upper turret sixteen . An ammunition hoist connected the two , and had the powder in the lower hoist exploded probably every man in the two turrets would have been killed . The full charge of powder for a thirteen-inch gun is ' too large to be handled by one man , so it is divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably just enough to fill one compartment in the ammunition hoist , which ignited . As the cablegram states , the cause of the ignition was not known , but the first belief at the Navy Department is that in cleaning up the turret and throwing open the breeches of the big guns after the last round had been fired some small bit of smoldering canvas bagging was blown out of one of the guns only to fall upon the loaded ammunition hoist , where the surplus powder was being returned to the magazines . i Had the remainder of this powder exploded there might have been a repetition of the Missouri disaster of last year , when twenty-six men were killed in the turret and in the magazines below . The cause of the accident in the case of the Missouri was entirely different , however . The Missouri turret breech block was swung open before the burning powder gases had escaped , resulting in the ignition of the powder in the turret . The ordinance officers were quick to guard against a repetition of an accident of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battleships with automatic spraying devices and air blasts . Lieut . John M. Hudgins , the only officer who lost his life , was a native of Virginia , and was appointed to the Naval Academy Sept. 8 , 1890 . He was assigned to the Engineer Corps upon leaving the Academy , in 1894 , and took an especial Interest in wireless telegraphy .

Graeme , who was perhapsgata.:1-ly injured , was appointed to the Naval Academy from Pennsylvania on Sept. 8 , 18.93 . He served at the Washington Navy Yard from Nov. 10 , 1902 , until April 17 , 1405 , when he was assigned to the Marylane . He is a son of Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieut .
