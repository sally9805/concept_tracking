txt A NEW CRIME . Consists in Presenting Another 's Tip to the Waitress . Can you or any of the readers of THE TIMES tell me what crime , If any , a man commits who , when arising from a table in a restaurant , takes the coin which the diner sitting opposite him had left beside his plate as a tip for the waitress and places It alongside his own plate ? I witnessed such an incident the other day , hence my inquiry . It seems to me the man who transferred the coin stole it , and the fact that he immediately gave it away had no bearing on the case from a legal standpoint . .. But I am not a lawyer . Do you think the courts would sustain a charge of petty larceny in such a case on the testimony of competent witnesses ? Anyhow , do n't you think it Is rather bad taste to do such a trick ? Do persons of good breeding do it habitually in New York ? STRANGER .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
