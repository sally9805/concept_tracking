 |p643  IT would seem that we are coming back to the world 's ancient wisdom touching the housetop , which has been neglected these many centuries in Western lands , although once given high honor , as we know , by men of the East , who set it apart in their dwellings as a much-prized breathing-place , a daily gathering-spot for rest and pleasure . At last in this eager , thoughtless city of New York ( which still allows its river-fronts to go as slums ) we are realizing how sadly we have erred in this matter , we and our fathers , and how we have wasted a choice part of our municipal heritage by giving over the roofs and topmost spaces of our buildings to garrets , clothes-lines , water-tanks , chimney-pots -- neglecting them , in short , when we might have put them to a precious use . It is good to know that we are doing better now and are setting an example in housetop cherishing that is sure to be widely followed . Our @#  |p644  summer roof-gardens gave a hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our towering office structures gave the opportunity , and our swift , safe elevators did the rest . And so the mid-air dining clubs have come to Manhattan , springing up as by magic over all the lower island , and offering , I doubt not , more of comfort , possibly of beauty , than ever was found in the famous hanging gardens of old-time Babylon . Fancy climbing afoot and in August to the top of a hanging garden ! Much simpler , one must own , to say , " Up , " as we do , and be there . What a wonderful thing it is truly to be able thus by a word and without an effort to fly away from the fume and worry of jostling crowds , from the noise and smell of the streets , up , up over roofs and domes and steeples into the silent skies , where the ledge of your window actually scrapes the sky , as they say ! Look ! Here comes a man out into Broadway through a door in one of the great stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary with the strife and strain . Where shall he go for a brief respite and the strengthening of his body ? A few years back it must have been to some clattering , bustling restaurant level with the roaring pavement , where was no respite at all , but crowds always , noise always . Now he walks a few blocks , turns in at another door , and takes an express elevator for the fifteenth , the eighteenth , the twentieth floor , and in ten seconds is as much out of New York as if he had made an hour 's journey into the country . The din dies away . He is far above dust and clanging cars . He can breathe pure air . And , sinking back in the arms of a hospitable leather chair , he looks down over the city as a tired traveler might look down from a mountain crag . Such refuge-places from the struggle of business are increasing in New York every year both in number and patronage , and the benefits they have brought already and must bring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midday , thanks to them , is that depressing spectacle of a prosperous man in the prime of life perched on a stool at some rushing lunch-counter , gulping down a sandwich and a piece of pie . The old idea was that an hour spent at luncheon was an hour lost , and men in fine positions ate like travelers catching a train because ? well , partly because it was the custom , and largely because the available cafes and restaurants were topsy-turvy , unattractive places where the one effort was to hurry the feeders through and replace them with others . The j new idea is that a man will often do mo business , really accomplish more , betw one o'clock and two , or one o'clock and th at his mid-air club , than in all the hours his office , and this while enjoying a leisu meal with a friend or two , eating as gent men should , and chatting a bit afterward the smoking-room . Whatever may be thought of the business advantages offered by mid-air clubs ( I shall consider these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit here for the health and a very real calming and fortifying influence- . The value of a hilltop to the fretted sou. has been known from all time ; there is peace at a great height , hope and strength in a broad panorama : is it a vain fancy to ascrile like helpfulness to these midday retreats ? Let one who doubts this remember what manner of place is Broadway in the swelter of August , with its glare of light , its burning cobblestones , its din of hoofs and wheels . its cars jammed with women and men of all kinds and colors , one of the greatest and richest streets in the world , no doubt , but one of the hottest , surely , when the sun beats straight down at noon . In vain the pavemen : swarm strive to keep cool with shirt-waists and flapping fans and buttermilk at three cents a glass . There is no such thing . They , are prisoners in a stove ; they gasp for air and look longingly upward where flags fluttering at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean that is sr , near , alas ! and yet does them so little good . As things were , one might as well have beer in the Jordan valley as here on such a day . But now ? well , suppose we leave our toil of the morning , our business scheming , and try what the mid-air clubs can do for us . A few blocks above the Post-Office rises the Central Bank Building , a gray granite mass piled up sixteen stories over the street and capped by a wide cornice so high that , why . when you look up at it , ? bend your head farther back , ? it seems to sway out unsteadily . We shall be lunching presently just above that cornice ! It is better already , as we turn into the marble-columned corridor ; the outer dazzle is subdued ; and as the rapid car bears us upward we feel a welcome downrush of cool air . There is no stop-this is the members ' car ; and nine , twelve , fifteen , here we are ir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying . And first for a table in the southwest @#  |p645  corner of the large dining-room , if we may secure one , for here is the finest outlook . A big place , as spacious as a ball-room and Lorne up imposingly by white columns ; walls finished restfully in green ? that is , what walls there are , for on three sides we look out over the city through continuous windows with single panes five feet square ! Now turn to the left , then slowly to the right . Ah ! splendid , is n't it ? We are so high that all else seems beneath us , and the view sweeps free from river to river and far down the bay . There is the Brooklyn Bridge , with strings of doll cars trailing over it . There are the spindle piles of Newspaper Row , once counted lofty . And straight to the south cuts the deep , gloomy cation of Broadway , a narrow cleft between gray and red precipices , in the depths of which we can make out the silent wriggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches the wide Hudson , and on a clear day we can  |p646  follow it from Grant 's tomb yonder down through its spreading mouth to the mass of Staten Island . And see the river-craft ! What quiet pleasure there is in watching them , the drifting barges , the laden schooners , the fat ferry-boats plying in and out , with white foam streaking their wake , all comfortable , one feels , out in the cool , wet river ! There goes a liner steaming lazily ? one of the ocean racers , says the waiter , who knows them all by their funnels . Yes , even the waiters yield to the charm of this place , and one of them stayed his table-setting long enough to tell me how it fills him with awe , sir , every evening when the sun dips suddenly in golden splendor there behind the Orange Mountains . And he described the look of fairy-land that the Jersey shore takes on with all the electric lights twinkling along its water-front . What a contrast , I reflected , between this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street who never see the river or the hills , who never do anything but hustle plates in red-hot rooms and bawl out orders ! This Arkwright Club ( named , of course , after Sir Richard of spinning-jenny fame ) does for men in the wholesale dry-goods trade what similar clubs do for men in a dozen other trades . There are the Drug Club , the Wool Club , the Hardware Club , the Merchants ' Club , the Aldine Association , the Midday Club , the Transportation Club , the Fulton Club , the Business Woman 's Club , and various others , all unique in this , that they have been lifted to the top of very high buildings ( no one of them under ten stories ) and offer to their members such relief from the stress and nerve-tear down below as was not dreamed of a few years since . They are all prosperous , with a membership ranging from three hundred to twelve hundred , and with long waiting-lists . The dues are from fifty to one hundred dollars a year ( usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant charges are so moderate that a profit is never looked for in the dining-room ; in fact , these are really cooperative eating enterprises , where members get better food for less money than would be possible at any restaurant , and where the cost of membership is virtually paid by the saving in tips . So that one may consider all the social and esthetic and health-bringing features of these clubs as furnished free . What wonder , then , that they are popular ! " Our club has been in existence only six years , " said one of the officers of the Arkwright to me , " and we have made money from the start . We limit our membership to seven hundred , and have a hundred applicants waiting . Why , you ca n't imagine what this place does for a man on a hot day ! " The Arkwright is remarkable among midair clubs for being a " double-decker ' ; that is , it occupies the top floor and the one beneath it , the sixteenth and fifteenth . these being united by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . The men have the fifteenth floor , the ladies the sixteenth . As to its general arrangements , this club is like the others in having a wide hallway ranged with easy-chairs and lounges , a luxurious smoking-room. abounding in creature comforts , a writing-room , a cafe . a ladies ' room , the two large dining-rooms mentioned , also many pictures about the walls , and everywhere a splendid panorama to rejoice the eye , everywhere the coolness and quiet that make for restfulness . Before considering other mid-air clubs in detail , I may explain how it comes that they all have accommodations for ladies ; for this , too , is significant in our changing city life . While women are not yet members of these lofty clubs , excepting one of their own , provision is nearly always made for them in the shape of a ladies ' dining-room , a ladies ' reception-room , and a trim lady's-maid in cap and apron always in attendance . So that , virtually , ladies may enjoy , and as a matter of fact are every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the simple condition that they be the wives , sisters , daughters , or friends of members . They use the clubs as they please , order what they please , give luncheon-parties , dinner-parties , tea-parties , anything they like , and at the end it is merely necessary that some one of them sign an authorized name for the expense incurred . Needless to add that the familiar presence of ladies in these mid-air  |p647  resorts gives a charm and color never found in clubs that are merely masculine . I may add that a step beyond this has been taken ? a pioneer step , we maybe sure ? by a club of wage-earning women who have secured as their very own the fourteenth floor , quite at the top of the tall Downing Building on Fulton street . This is the Business Woman 's Club , and has the same fine view , the same advantages and general arrangements , found in the mid-air clubs for men , except that the furnishing is less pretentious ; for everything here , from the annual rent of twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception-room , is paid for by the women themselves . And I am glad to say that this club does not owe a dollar and has a membership of nearly three hundred , although it has been in existence only a little over a year . It may encourage other workingwomen to know that this fine success has grown from the efforts of one young lady , a stenographer , who in the spring of 1900 e up her mind that women accustomed to nice homes should have , even if they are poor , better luncheon-places than the noisy , stifling ones on the streets , where aggressive waiters everlastingly cry , " Sinkers for two and draw one ! " " What are your dues ? " I inquired in a visit here . " Six dollars a year , " said a young lady at the desk , " and two dollars initiation fee . " " How much for luncheon ? " " Twenty-five cents for the table d'hote , and a guest fee of five cents for non-members . You see , lots of girls want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 show you about , if you like . " She led the way into a large room furnished in green and red , with windows on three sides and cushioned seats . Here is the piano and the circulating library , from which members may take books without charge . We looked out from river to river , and standing there in the refreshing breeze , it needed no argument to show what good there is for tired girls in such a club .  |p648  Then she showed me two " rest-rooms " furnished in blue , with lounges for half an hour 's nap against nerves and headache , and the spick-and-span kitchen , and the neat dining-room . " No men allowed , I suppose ? " She smiled . " I do n't think a man would feel very comfortable with a hundred girls staring at him and giggling . On Saturdays , though ,  - -  - that 's visitors ' day , ? members may invite their men friends . And then through the winter we have men at our evening entertainments , and wind up with dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Most of them are stenographers , and they earn good wages . You know , we have an employment bureau in connection with the club , and when ten- or twelve-dollar positions come in nobody wants them . I guess half of our members get twenty dollars a week . " Coming back now to the more elaborate mid-air clubs of the men , we shall find this distinguishing feature in them , that they are developing among New York business men a new kind of sociability . With the old restaurant regime the members of a certain business house or office found small variety at luncheon-time from the monotony of their narrow round . Day after day t same little groups would go out together a return together , seldom meetingnewmen. dom getting out of the deep-worn chant . of thought and talk . It was astonishing ho few acquaintances they made in years this life . New York has a terrible consrr vatism that walls men about and keeps the apart from their fellow-men unless something comes to break through it . In this case the mid-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers , though in similar lines of effort , were brought into friendly relations , to their mutual pleasure and profit . Rivals in many enterprises , enemies in trade , merchants , importers , manufacturers , jobbers , have met in some mid-air smoking-room day after day , and somehow . between the soothing of a good cigar and the wonderful view , have come into better understanding . Nor can any one say how many deals have gone through by the friendly mediation of a mid-air meal together in one of those favorite corners .  |p649  where the boats pass , or what troublesome business tangles have untangled themselves through the magic of an after-dinner coffee , with the breeze blowing in . It is hard for a man to be petty or mean or to higgle for trifles with the majesty of those patient rivers bearing in on him . These are the business advantages I mentioned , and experience has shown that they are very real . We shall find this element of noon-time sociability very marked at the Drug Club , which stands , or shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused business region east of lower Broadway . No wonder men are glad to escape from such a tangle of streets and jangle of sounds ! Nor may I omit the smells , as every one knows who has sniffed at William street on a hot day ? smells of paint , sponges , tobacco , oils , soaps , and drugs without end . Now we stop at a massive building , very high and very wide , a smooth reddish precipice over granite columns . It looks a little severe , but in we go and up we go , and find at the fifteenth floor that it is not severe at all . Most genial fellows they are , these linseed-oil magnates , dealers in quinine , manufacturers of drugs , distributers of paints and chemicals . Before you know it they will have you down at the governor 's table , where better things than paregoric are served and good stories go the rounds . What a buzz of talk about one o'clock ! What jolly faces ! Among the four hundred members are men who journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . And there are some not in the drug trade ; here is a lively table of John-street jewelers , here are men from the Hide and Leather Bank , and behind that screen are a dozen Seventh Regiment veterans . " We are like a big family , " said one of the managers to me . " I suppose a third of our members have offices right in this building . The club brings lots of them here . And see how they enjoy themselves ! " This genuine enjoyment was even more apparent after the meal , when the smokingroom at the east end was crowded and as many chairs as possible were drawn close to the row of panorama windows that bring the river and Brooklyn into the club 's front @#  |p650  lawn , as it were . The ferry-boats are so near that fancy almost catches the splash of their paddles . The old bridge , with its twin towers and drooping cables , reaches away almost underfoot , while on the left is the new bridge , the daily growth of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietary interest . And there at the left is another familiar landmark ( but not up to our height ) ? the tall , strange shaft of the dingy shot-tower . One would scarcely expect to find a choice collection of paintings in a club of this kind , yet here they are on all the walls , a genuine Murillo , a genuine Rubens , and dozens of others , fifty thousand dollars ' worth , nearly all of them loaned by members . So that , looking within or looking without , the eye rests upon something of beauty , and that in itself is a quieting and inspiriting influence . Also , for the further joy of all concerned , there is the ladies ' dining-room down at the other end , finished in pale green and abundant in gaiety . Coming back now to Broadway , we may look in at the Hardware Club , one of the largest and finest of these mid-air institutions , and fortunate in site , for it overlooks the City Hall Park from atop the Postal Building ? overlooks all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming feature of the club is the long stone balcony that stretches in front of the windows , full a hundred and fifty feet of open promenade circling the fourteenth story on the east and mainly on the south , whence the eye takes in all the bay , the islands , the Statue of Liberty , and the ever-changing colors . Sometimes in summer tables have been ranged along this balcony , but usually , the treasurer assured me , there is too much breeze for that . Fancy a place on Broadway where there could be too much breeze ? in August ! The rooms of the Hardware Club are large . and arranged to open one into the other , so as to give continuous space for banquets or special gatherings . Among the six hundred resident members are many not in the hardware trade ? lawyers , judges , politicians , business men in general ; and all of them have been generous in loans for decoration . There are many paintings , one by Troyon . There is a portrait of Lincoln over a bronze tablet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large stuffed alligator . I suppose I should mention that the kitchen here is above the club proper , in a separate wooden structure resting on the roof . In this structure are kept all the odors of cooking , and all clatter of the steam  |p651  dish-washer . It appears that no fewer than eighty servants are required for the work of this one club . Passing on in our tour , we shall find the Wool Club , in the Wool Exchange Building , ministering to the midday needs of men located west of Broadway and a little farther up-town than the Hardware Club . Here are some five or six hundred members , about forty of whom have offices on the premises , so that these men need not put foot outside the building during business hours unless they please . They may even , in times of stress , order meals in advance , and not start up for the dining-room until things are actually on the table . Think of that for refinement of modern business ! What I liked best in this club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an effective frieze and a dome-shaped ceiling that shows a pleasant blending of soft tints . There is also a circular lounging-room finished in a dull green , and a circular hall in marble . The tendency of these mid-air club buildings to become great business homes for the dwellers in them is seen best , perhaps , in the New York Life Building , which carries on its top floor the Merchants ' Club , the oldest and most exclusive of the mid-air brotherhood . This is a rich man 's club , a rather formal club , with everything very solid and expensive . The older partners in prosperous concerns like to come here ? men who can take things easy ; while the younger men still in the hard fight of business prefer the Arkwright , which rises high only a block down Broadway , and seems to nod briskly across the gulf to its venerable white marble friend . It is remarkable what attractions this New York Life Building offers to its tenants . Besides the Merchants ' Club there are within its walls a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news-stand , a fruit-counter , a manicure-room , an office of type-writers , a corps of messenger-boys , a chiropodist , a cigar-stand , and a dispenser of various drinks . All that is needed , one would say , to make the thing complete are a theater and a church . Moving on up-town to the region between Union Square and Madison Square , we shall find the Aldine Club , with an outlook on Fifth Avenue and an inspiring panorama besides . It occupies the fourteenth story of the Constable Building , near Nineteenth street , and in matter of sociability offers even broader advantages than the others , for here the membership includes not only business men , but workers in many other lines . Architects  |p652  come here , and writers and editors . Men who follow the arts chat with men of affairs across board and brush against them in argument , to the general broadening , while the club itself takes on a peculiar and interesting character that is indicated somewhat in its decorations . There are more books here than in most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autograph letters from celebrities , and rare old playbills , and in the directors ' room an interesting collection of samplers , some of them over a century old , these , as well as many of the paintings , lent by a member who is a connoisseur of art . No one can lunch at the Aldine without being impressed by this diversity of its interests . One meets all sorts of men here , and most of them worth knowing . There are representatives of great publishing houses , editors of well-known magazines , editors of religious weeklies , keen advertising men , heads of the retail dry-goods houses , names that everybody knows from seeing them constantly in print ; and here they are in the flesh , red-faced men , gray-bearded men , stout men , real men , eating with an appetite and talking with animation between groups . It may be that outside they are at swords ' points , this owner of a department store cutting prices in a shocking way on the books of that tall publisher who is offering him a cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tables of schoolbook specialists , who almost come to blows in their newspaper quarrels , are laughing now at one another 's funny stories , on the best of terms . A feature of the Aldine Club , and to some extent of the others , is the regular occurrence of special dinners in honor of this or that distinguished person . There was one for Sir Henry M. Stanley , one for Conan Doyle , one for Mark Twain ; and there have been various jollification dinners , midnight suppers , college-society spreads , April-fool banquets ( with wooden cigars and cocktails that wo n't pour out ) , all tending to keep the club spirits young . The Arkwright Club has done something of like sort with dinners and speechmaking in honor of Andrew Carnegie , T. B. Reed , and others . In short , these midclubs are every year extending their fu tions and reaching much beyond the role of pleasant luncheon-places . This applies to many that I may not now consider in detail ? to the picturesque Pilots ' Club , overlooking the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island , where the brave men who take our liners in and out are wont to meet for a quiet hour ; to tt.e little-known Standard Oil Club , on lower Broadway , where industrial kings find inspiration in the view ; to the Transportation Club , on top of the Manhattan Hotel at Forty-second street , that puts railroad men in touch with the skies ; and to many others which are rapidly taking a distinct and permanent place in the city 's club life . Of course when all is said and done , and mid-air clubs have increased and multiplied over the island as much as may be , there will remain tens of thousands who can never join these clubs and would seem condemned to follow the old stifling , noisy way of restaurants on the streets . Yet even for them there is hope . With increasing demand for lofty eating-places must come the supply . Why not ? Rents are lower at the top of buildings than down below , and elevators run everywhere . Already the experiment of public roof-restaurants has been successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every day , for instance , men and women crowd for luncheon to the twentythird story of the American Tract Society Building on Nassau street . And there are scores of other high buildings the top floors of which might be turned into delightful restaurants , to the general rejoicing . When we consider what blessings have been brought already by the mid-air clubs . we can only hope that hundreds of similar places will in time be established , so that people of all kinds , harassed toilers in every part of this terrible summer city , may , if they will , for at least an hour every day . find a breath of cool air and a little rest and comfort .
