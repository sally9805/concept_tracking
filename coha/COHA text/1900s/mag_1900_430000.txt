THE leavening of the vast Chinese Empire , begun within the past quarter of a century , by Western thought , is now strongly felt throughout the realm . Under the fostering influence of a wise and progressive government , it is effecting in a nation of over 400,000,000 souls marvellously beneficent changes . These have been watched by the peoples of the West with the utmost gratification , and with the liveliest anticipation and hope . He must be a curious man of the West who does not feel a certain pride in the fact that the creations of his half of the world have begun to enter the thought realm of what is practically the remainder of the earth , and to effect methods , to establish modes , even to subvert forms in a region which for many centuries esteemed itself , and was in truth , the Supreme of the Universe . There is an element of sympathy in human nature which feels gratification in the advancement of a fellow-being , and contemplates with admiration and applause his rise to higher things . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers of your Christian faiths to establish schools , asylums , and hospitals , to usher the young into a flowering maturity , and to nurse the sick to health . There is an instinct , as natural to mankind as the instinct of self-preservation , which makes for the promotion of others in the scale of being ; and this instinct , operating on a plane as wide as the human nature of which it is a part , takes no account of race lines or color limits . Your missionary conceives that his doctrines will secure happiness to the soul after death : straightway he traverses cities and plains and jungles in search of all men not in accord with his views , be they pale , black , yellow , or red . But this most noble quality , like every other benevolent trait of our natures , may , in individual instances , be perverted . Where there were heartiness , helpfulness , and generosity there may come narrowness and selfishness ; and , unfortunate as the fact may be , these faults , which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , material conditions , regard with  | envy their more successful brothers , may exist in those who have not the excuse of material pressure , but who evolve their views from philosophy . It is a false philosophy , however , that leads to such conclusions ; for any reasoning which results in pitting man against man is just as wrong as the notion in chemistry which once designated filth as waste matter . We have since learned that filth is but matter out of place , that , in the harmony of nature , there is no such thing as waste . In the realm of human brotherhood similar harmonies exist ; and if any line of thought concludes with a postulate that the prosperity and advancement of one people are irreconcilable with the prosperity and advancement of another people , that the living of one body of the race upon a plane of high ideals can be maintained only through the degradation of another body of the race , or through the continuance of it upon a level distinctly inferior , that line of thought , depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a most painful circumstance that this idea of the success of one nation being dependent upon the non-success of another nation , and hence of the world , should be so widely diffused in the United States ; and it is remarkable , too , that it should be diffused not only in the teeth of philosophy , but in the very presence of facts incessantly proclaiming to the contrary . It is a school of thought which , I am glad to say , England has survived , and which , it is comforting to note , the United States , under the sagacious administration now existing at Washington , is rapidly putting aside through the avenue of reciprocity treaties . Nevertheless , there are those who , in all seriousness , maintain , with specious arguments , that the development of one nation must operate to the harm of the nations with which it trades if trade be left open between them . The most striking instance which I have lately observed of the assertion of this fallacy , elaborated with wrongly drawn deductions , is the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 1899 . It is more notable to me since the nation against which it is aimed is China . Mr. Young is the first man who , to my knowledge , has specifically declared in public print that the industrial development now progressing in China will resat detrimentally to the welfare of the United States . If this voice had come from New York I might have thought that it was moved by rivalry on the part of the Eastern metropolis caused by the impending greatness of the chief seaport of the Pacific coast , fronting , as  | San Francisco does , the very face of China . But when it is considered that Mr. Young is a resident of San Francisco and managing editor of one of the largest newspapers on the coast , a newspaper which makes it its especial province to foster the industrial growth of the city and State , his error becomes all the more perplexing . Mr. Young takes the curious position that the development of China , which would mean her rise in the production of those things esteemed by Westerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Western industry . It is singular that any American should be found who asserts that American industry stands upon so unstable a basis . If the assertion were true , the country would have good reason to fear , and would urgently need to post geese on the Capitol to quack out in the night at the approach of an invader . Any civilization built upon such sands would surely be swept away ; and the day of its downfall could never be far from the date of its rise . Mr. Young feels that the vast natural resources of China , together with her myriads of population , among whom the laborers are willing to work for a mere pittance per day , when acted upon by the methods in Western use , will result in producing so cheaply that the producers of the United States will be unable to compete with such products in their own market . The result will be , Mr. Young thinks , not only to drive American salesmen out of China , but to a large degree to close American mills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The picture is exceedingly dark . Here we have China 's import trade entirely eliminated , and an immense export trade developed , by which China is inundating the United States with the things her people want , and taking nothing in return . Mr. Young would say , however , that China would demand gold for her goods , and , in this way , would drain the country of gold . But China does not want gold ; almost every pennyweight mined within her territory being sent abroad . Gold is not currency with her ; it is a commodity no more specialized or valued than cloth or grain ? indeed , not so much . China 's standard is silver , and silver you do not want . Seven out of every ten of your silver mines are to-day lying idle . The people of the States in which the mines are located have recently been waging a vigorous campaign to open the mints of the country to the coinage of silver , in order that a market for their commodity may be created . Now here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be willing to take their silver and to give goods in return . Consequently , in any event , if Chinese competition should close the cotton mills of  | Massachusetts , the iron mills of Pennsylvania , the tanneries of Chicago , the furniture factories of Michigan , and so on throughout the whole gamut of American enterprise , it would at least open the silver mines of Utah , Nevada , and Montana , and make populous and powerful those now neglected States . Meanwhile , it must be remembered that China has immense resources of silver of her own . The mountains which flank the Great Desert of Gobi , the Tsin-lings , the Pelings , the Nan-lings , all contain great deposits of silver ; the mountains of Yun-nan being particularly rich in it . When the concessionaires to whom China has granted the privilege of digging and reducing much of this ore shall , by modern methods , have completed their task , then as much silver as all the needs of art or trade require shall be let loose over the Empire ; and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . If in the eyes of Mr. Young such a calamity takes place , and if , as he assumes , China still persists in sending to the United States her goods , why then , manufacturing everything cheaper than like articles are made here , there could , of course , be nothing taken in return ; and the United States would be deluged in clean gift with infinite quantities of superior Chinese goods to the closing of all her mills and to the utter idleness of her people . Imagine such a state ! Every person in possession of all he could desire to eat , drink , and wear , all of Chinese production , for which nothing could be taken in return because of your cost of manufacture , and , withal , lolling in enforced and complete indolence ! Surely the possibilities of such a catastrophe might alarm any one . To avert such a misfortune the pens of such publicists as Mr. Young might well be engaged . Mr. Young gives reasons for inclining to the opinion that the Chinese will take nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Chinese want nothing . He tells us that " for nearly half a century Europeans and Americans have had very few obstructions placed in the way of introducing their wares to the attention of the millions living in and near the treaty ports ; and in that time they have not succeeded in securing as great a market for their surplus of manufactured products as that created in half the time in sparsely populated Argentina . " He tells us , too , that , in California , " such a thing as Europeans and Americans manufacturing for Chinese ; consumption is never thought of ; and , if the idea ever did occur , it would be speedily abandoned ; because if the article were one which this really envious people wanted . they would turn to and make it them .  | selves . " And then he remarks that " the workers of Europe and the United States may not take kindly to the prospect of China 's vas stores of mineral wealth being converted by Chinese into finished arti Iles for consumption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is probable that , in the earlier stages of modern industrial de velopment , the vast surplus energy of the Empire will be utilized it manufacturing for outsiders rather than for Chinese . The latter , un til they radically change their habits of living , until they learn to con sumo wastefully , must necessarily be poor customers for the ware ; which they may produce in profusion . " So he concludes that " ii may be safely predicted that the effect of the opening of China t ( the trade of the world will not be followed by results so confidently expected by people who have surplus products that they are anxious to dispose of at a profit . Instead , the effect of the opening and awaken . ing will probably be to bring disaster upon Western industrialism un less a barrier be interposed to the competition of a race whose moss striking characteristic is an entire absence of those desires and aspirations which Americans and Europeans strive to gratify . This notabh peculiarity , at this stage of the world 's development , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , and compel the Western working classes to abandon their ideals . " So it is plain that the Chinese will persist in sending without taking , and that they will not take because they do not want . They dc not want because traits , the " result of an intense struggle for existence extending through thousands of years , " have trained them to the utmost parsimony in living . Their houses are of " a uniform low level and monotonous appearance , the interiors being as uniform as the exteriors . The meagre furnishing and extreme plainness which mark nearly all interiors are due to a national trait , and are not enforced by lack of things with which to make home beautiful . " In communities like the Chinese , he says , " the only incentive to accumulation is a mere desire for subsistence which takes the form of providing for a rainy day . The desire for reputability , which is responsible for the system of conspicuous waste that marks the expenditures of all highly civilized Western peoples , and is accountable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western world , is almost unknown in China ; and it is doubtful whether such a struggle could be incited in that country . " But , not only in his house , we are informed , are the Chinese con- tent to dispense with luxuries , but in the matter of dress the utmost uniformity prevails . Fashion , that incentive to incessant change and unending waste in clothes , is not known among us ; hence , he argues , much less material would be consumed by us than is consumed by Western peoples . Consequently , on the whole , there would be no demand by the Chinese for Western goods ; while the cargoes of utilities which we would deliver upon these shores could only be warded off by high and hostile tariffs , for the enactment and levying of which Mr. Young 's article is especially framed . The absurdity of the statements of Mr. Young and of his deductions is so palpable that ordinarily I would not bother to reply to them . But it is an unhappy fact that his views are shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to publish them . He seems to have taken his cue , however , from what he calls a " warning note " sounded by " Bradstreet 's Trade Review ; " reciting that " some day China will figure as a competitor in many lines of industries in the markets ' of the world . " This competition is what these champions of monopoly fear . They are champions of monopoly , though they may not know it . What afflicts them is the unfortunate perversion of ideas which has arisen in the United States through a trade system created by legislative acts in opposition to , the natural trend , and which is built upon the error that foreign trade means an exchange of goods for gold . If , therefore , you can have vast quantities of goods going out of your country and great amounts of gold coining in , then you have the acme of what you call " national prosperity . " The very statement looked at as a cold formula is ridiculous . Suppose this sort of thing possible . Suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain of pure gold , and we should send this stuff to you by shipload , as we probably should , in exchange for your goods . What would be the result ? Why , very shortly gold would become so plentiful in your country that its purchasing power would not equal the cost of digging it from the mountain and transporting it , slight as might be that cost in cheap labor in China . As a consequence , your one-sided foreign trade would be shut off entirely , snuffed out by the very process upon which , in lack of wisdom , you wish to base your foreign trade , and which such disputants as Mr. Young are alert to defend . Nay , this mountain of gold idea may not be altogether allegorical . Our alchemists have always held that gold is a compound ; a view now finding sanction among the metallurgists of the United States . It may be that  | we who discovered gunpowder and the fact that the magnet inclines to the pole shall yet discover the reaction which produces gold . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , as a result , you will find how quickly you will correct your notion that foreign trade consists of an exchange of goods for gold . You will then learn the great and universal truth that trade is barter , an exchange of goods for goods . You will learn , too , this potent and sadly overlooked fact , that the more goods that come into a nation the more goods must go out to pay for them . Consequently , that heavy imports are much to be desired ; and all limits and restrictions upon them which impair their free ingress should be as far as possible swept aside ; for , as the night follows the day , heavy imports into your country must be followed by heavy exports . Mr. Young does us Chinese a keen injustice by his inference that we would send any goods without demanding a full and adequate return ; and he is entirely wrong when he supposes that we want nothing that you have . On the contrary , the Chinese want a vast number of things . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to advance . What does Mr. Young suppose to be the incentive which forces the lowest born coolie to strive in salt mines or to pack burdens day by day over long and tedious roads , if it is not that he desires to better himself ? Wherever the Chinese have gone they have become distinguished , not alone for industry , but also for the wealth which attends it . Where the Chinese have settled , in all of those kingdoms and communities adjacent to China , they are foremost among the men of wealth and influence . In Corea , the Straits Settlements , and the Philippines they have long constituted the very backbone of commerce and finance . It is wrong , too , to say that the Chinese do not desire or enjoy luxuries . Mr. Young does not understand us . Our ideas of those things are different from his , but they are none the less expensive . He thinks that because we do not wear starched linen and silk hats , and because our women do not wear lingerie , we consume little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary Chinese about equals in cost that of the Americans . Your negroes working in the rice-fields of the South are scarcely better clad than our coolies in similar occupations . Among the upper classes your dress does not compare in cost with ours . If your gentleman of leisure pays $100 for a suit of clothes his habit may be considered expensive : with us the very embroidery on the breast-piece of the jacket frequently costs more . Mr. Young  | must not think that because we do not follow Western styles we have no luxurious tastes . There is nothing in Western styles to tempt us . I have myself donned the European garb on several occasions , and I have always found it stiff , tight , and awkward . It encases the body with an inconvenience which would be intolerable if the wearer knew better . Mr. Young must not forget that progress in China does not mean our forsaking national habits in such things as clothes and modes of life . In a thousand things we do not bow to the West . Your effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not superior . We were a civilization more powerful than Rome at her best , in a day when the hills of Rome were pasture , and when the only peoples of the wilderness which is now your land were savages . You can not expect forms which the wisdom of thousands of years has confirmed to be swept away because you have another fashion . Mr. Chester Holcomb , who was for years a member of the United States Legation at Peking , speaking of our poorer classes , in his work , " The Real Chinaman , " p. 311 , says : " The Chinese do not live poorly because they desire nothing better . Like all other men , they live as well as their earnings or resources will allow . A wealthy Chinaman dresses as expensively , though in a different style , has a table as luxurious , though his taste may be esteemed peculiar , and generally maintains the same elegance as his Western brother . There , as everywhere else , income must control the expense . " But the fact that Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is nothing used in Western life that they want . They want , as I have said , thousands of things you have . It is not anticipating too much to opine that the modern American house , with its conveniences and comforts , will be the future house of China . Her cities will be severed and paved , lighted with electric lamps , and threaded with electric car lines . They will have water-works and fire departments and spacious public edifices . The materials for many of these things must come from the W est . But Mr. Young must not forget that before we can procure these things we must first have something to buy-them with ; and the only things with which we or any other people have to buy are the products of our labor . If , then , our products are of slight value , reckoned upon the unit of population , our exchanges must be correspondingly small , and our trade must be worth little . This must always be the case so long as China produces by hand labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to labor ? It is a multiplication of the power of the hand that runs it . A cobbler will make one pair of shoes in two days . Give him a machine and the skill to run it , and he will make twenty pairs of shoes in the same time . What is this but a multiform increase of the potentiality of his hand ? With his bare hands and his tools he had one pair of shoes at the end of two days with which to buy food , clothes , and furniture ; with his machine he has twenty pairs , less cost of materials , to devote to the same end . Chinese labor is cheap , but only because its effectiveness is small . Let this be magnified with the power of machines , and it will be dear enough . Chinamen will be prompt to demand their full share of the wealth which their hands produce after they have been potentialized by the machine , just as Mr. Young correctly remarks that , as toilers in the West , they have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of the Western world . " Mr. Young , in common with his school ; overlooks a salient fact . He concludes that the demand for labor arises from a scarcity of labor 's products . Hence , if abundance comes into a nation from abroad , there are consequent congestion and idleness within . It is doubtless this mistake that causes Mr. Young to fear the onslaught of goods which , he argues , will come from China into the United States in free gift and without value exacted in return . The idea of there not being " enough work to go around " was the idea of ancient China , just as it is the present idea of Mr. Young 's school . It was this that tabooed machines " because they produce so much that there would be nothing left to  | do ; " consequently , dearth was cherished as a national necessity . But such modern statesmen as Prince Ching , Yung Lu , Li Hung Chang , and Wu Ting-fang have perceived differently . With a vision unaffected by interests other than truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its machines , and that , as the effect of the machine is to multiply produce , so the produce thus created in turn calls upon other mechanisms and other labor . The starched linen of which Mr. Young speaks would not exist if you did not produce more corn and potatoes than you require for food . Take away your steam-ploughs , cultivators , diggers , and shellers , and if any one wears starched linen some one will have to go hungry to allow it . It is the presence of wealth that creates a demand for wealth . The human mind is so adjusted that as soon as it is gratified it begins to evolve visions of further desires . Demand breeds upon what it feeds ; it can never be surfeited . Take your Indian out of his canvas tepee and build him a house , he will forthwith want it furnished ; put carpet on his parlor floor , and he will crave a piano ; give him china dishes , he will abolish jerked beef and require ragouts . This quality is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitive , alert , calculating , and eager Chinaman . It is not we who are the adherents of uniformity ; it is Mr. Young and his class . Through the installation of monopoly , which seeks to control certain lines of production within the country , Mr. Young would have a crystallized condition that nothing could disturb ; and you would go on purchasing the products of your combine which , secure and absolute in its market , would have no need to regard the world 's progress in its utility , and would continue indefinitely to supply you with whatever it might please . W e , on the other hand , seeking a market for our like product , would be constantly watchful to cheapen its cost and to increase its merit . Left to itself the world of production is constantly changing , constantly working toward higher planes ; being unceasingly drawn into accord with the higher reaches Df human thought . It is only when its action is obstructed by such " barriers interposed to competition " as Mr. Young asks for , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow man in all his ideals ; interfered with by " barriers " it becomes paralyzed . After all , what are utilities , or these things we call " goods , " which we import and export ? They are no other than expressions of human thought impressed upon matter . Looking to your imports and not beyond them , from which countries do you get evidences of the highest  | civilization ? from Europe or from Africa , from England or from Turkey ? You do not have to look beyond what a people puts forth to fix its position in the scale of being . In truth , by such alone may they be judged ; for goods are acts ; and , as men or nations act , so are they high or low in the domain of thought . The reason why China is behind the United States in material ' achievements is , that our masses , as compared with yours , have little potential thought . Our government understands this . It is our effort now to acquire for our people a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a people is great and powerful just in the degree that it possesses the ability to turn nature in all her departments to the gratification of human desires . But , aside from these abstractions , we have only to look about us to find refutation of the hypothesis and fear of Mr. Young that " the Western world will not be benefited by Chinese development . " A few years ago , when our neighbor Japan ? a much smaller nation than our own , and , therefore , more sensitive to Western influences ? manifested signs of the revival which has since so distinguished it , Mr. Young attacked that kingdom just as he is now assailing us . He had then the same fears that the United States would be swamped by the goods of Japan , just as he now expresses fear that it will be deluged with the products of China . If his doctrines had been believed they would have driven Japanese trade away from San Francisco through the erection of those " interposing barriers " which he so much desires to be built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost to the city and country about $15,000,000 of sales to Japan a year . But his alarms were not heeded ; and the trade with Japan increased , because , by the introduction and use of machines , the country , which produces little or no gold , came to have something to buy with In 1898 , it bought 40 , 000 , 000 yen worth from this country , though only four years before it could buy but 6,000,000 yen worth . In 1898 , you took from them 47,000,000 yen worth of goods ; so that you have shown a disposition to increase your purchases just as they have increased their imports from you . If Mr. Young 's conclusion , that the development of one nation is harmful to the condition of another nation , were correct , you would naturally expect to find the part of the United States nearest the developing nations showing the worst effects of the blight . What part of your country has the most industry , business , finance , development , the side that fronts Europe , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you could put the United States on a turntable and twist it around until the Golden Gate opposed the English Channel and New York was before Hong Kong , would San Francisco be benefited or damaged by its contiguity to Europe ? Would New York benefit China or would China sink back from her rising evolution ? Obviously , Mr. Young 's theories are thin indeed ; he has against him the proved experiment of unfolded Europe . Since 1888 England has advanced prodigiously . You are now taking from her vastly more than you took then ; yet , in 1888 you sold to her but $32,000,000 worth , while in 1598 this amount was increased to $74 , - 000,000 . Germany has kept full pace with Europe 's advance , a fact made manifest in the great increase of her exports to the United States . Yet , in 1878 you sold her $16 , 500 , 000 , and in 1898 , $32,700,000 . England and Germany and France and Italy have increased in their power to buy from you ; and the size of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their power to purchase , however , is not the power to send gold , which would be all drained out of their countries in one year 's buying , but the power to send to you the things which your civilization desires . So will it be with China . The trade which now only amounts to some thirty-two millions both ways is so small because of China 's inability to make larger purchases . When we multiply the things you want , that same variation will excite in us a desire for the things you have . If our goods are cheap , so much the better for you . We thereby bring you more of labor than you return to us . The teamster gives to the lawyer the product of thirty days ' toil for an hour of the lawyer 's thought . Both are benefited ; but , in the aspect of things , who acquires the higher advantage from the transaction ? We may give you abundance of our goods for little of your goods ; but you will be the more favored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of the Chinese Empire by the little group of people in San Francisco 's Chinatown . They consume little of American wares , it is true ; for few expect to remain here permanently . Most of them look forward to the time when , gathering their accumulated stores , they can return to China . This is caused by two considerations : ( 1 ) the hostile feeling that exists against the Chinese here , due to the agitations of labor leaders and political charlatans ; and ( 2 ) the obstructive legislation influenced thereby , with the result that their freedom is curtailed and Their peace and property are made insecure . Moreover , the difference .  | in the purchasing power of their money here and in China impels them to aspire to live in the country where their wealth will give them more return . All of these conditions will undoubtedly cease to exist . I do not believe that the American people will always be deluded as to the value and necessity of Chinese residents , or , that the types of men who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I am very sure that , in not many years , the Chinaman 's money earned in the United States will buy him little more in China than here . For , the cost of living will rise with the rate of wages ; and in China both will presently reach the American standard . I do not expect this change to take place slowly . The movement now progressing in China has attained marvellous speed ; and , with the aid of the kindly offices of the Western peoples , especially the people of the United States , and under the guidance of the present sagacious and efficient government of China , we shall continue our progress , advancing ever upward , making ourselves more and more fitted to be a benefit to the world and to merit the highest esteem in the family of nations .
