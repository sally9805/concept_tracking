 | THE author of the Anti-Saloon League movement was Howard H. Russell , a young Congregational minister , a graduate of Oberlin College , and a man who had already achieved remarkable victories against the saloon by his courage and skill as an organizer . For several years he had seen the wisdom and necessity of a unification of the energies of the Church against the saloon ; and on two occasions , first in Ohio and later in Missouri , he had temporarily effected State-wide combinations of the Church for aggressive work against the saloon . Finally , iii 1892 , while he was in charge of the Armour Mission in Chicago , so insistent became the cony lotion that upon hint devolved the duty of rallying the Church to combined and concentrated effort against the saloon , that he gave up his work in Chicago , and set himself heart and soul to the new cause . At Oberlin there was a band of temperance workers who had more than once come to his relief in the past : and now , again , he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter upon such a vast enterprise , but Mr. Russell 's common-sense plans at last won them over ; and on Mav 24th , 1893 , at a meeting held in the library of Oberlin College . this sturdy company of temperance reformers , the Oberlin Temperance Alliance , adopted his plan , and formally voted to fix- a nominal salary for his support and to stand by the work until he should be able to effect a Statewide organization . It was decided also to call a union meeting of the churches of Oberlin on Sunday evening , June 4th , in order that they might formally and publicly adopt Mr. Russell 's plan . So it is to this Sunday evening meeting , held in the Old First Church at Oberlin , that the Anti-Saloon League traces its origin . " The Church in action against the saloon . " This trenchant phrase characterizes the movement . It is interdenominational , embracing all creeds , yet so practical and tolerant that it ignores all creeds . It solicits the support of all churches ; and recognizes any church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands . fn most of the States it is the official , authorized agency of - the Church in its warfare with the saloon . It is the creature of the Church , having no entity apart from the Church . It does not seek to enlist membership ; and , indeed , has no membership apart from the ties of allegiance that men owe to their respective churches . Its officers are members of the church appointed to this particular work by their respective organizations , and elected to their positions in the League by trustees chosen by the various churches and temperance organizations . It draws its financial support . as well as its moral authority , from the Church . It is manifest , therefore , that its power and effectiveness are conditioned by the devotion the churches show toward it . It can go just as far and just as fast as the Church permits ? no farther , no faster . The League is omni-partisan . It is here that the common sense of its founder is most apparent ; for the conviction that the saloon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic and social life is common to hundreds of thousands of Christian men regardless of party . In the past temperance movements have been ineffectual because they have not been able to register their opposition to the liquor traffic in any telling and practical way . But it is the peculiarity of this movement that it isolates the saloon interest from all the complicating issues with which it has hitherto been able to ally itself , and so makes it possible for Christian voters to express themselves upon that naked issue . The Anti-Saloon League " pledges itself to avoid affiliation with any political party as such , and to maintain an attitude of neutrality upon questions of public policy not directly and immediately concerned with the traffic in strong drink . " So it is not so much interested in parties as in measures  | and men . It uses its influence to secure the nomination of men in the various parties who favor its ideals , and throws the weight of its influence for the men who are most friendly to its interests . It is , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then in arraying the Church vote solidly for the measure when introduced . It is on the alert against adverse legislation . It , moreover , defends at the polls officers who have wrought faithfully in the cause of temperance , and uses its influence to defeat men who have put themselves on record as adverse to temperance legislation , or delinquent in the enforcement of temperance laws . It grasps the possible while reaching for the perfect ; and so , while seeking as its ideal aim the complete overthrow of the saloon by legal prohibition , with cool common sense counts that day lost that views no worthy intermediate action done . The watchword of the Anti-Saloon League from the first has been agitation . The temperance cause has everything to gain from agitation and nothing to lose ; the saloon has everything to lose and nothing to gain . This work of agitation is a necessary preliminary to effective effort against the saloon , and must be kept tip continually . It is important , too , that the representatives of the League should come often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of temperance reform , in order to instruct them in the practical task of combating the saloon and holding what they gain , and in order to encourage them to still greater activity . By a stroke of economic genius on the part of the founder of the League , this agitation work is put on a self-supporting basis thru the collections taken in the churches on every occasion when an Anti-Saloon League representative occupies a pulpit . Thousands of churches thruout the land open their pulpits to the League speakers once a year , with twofold advantage to the League , an aroused and instructed congregation and a substantial addition to the treasury of the organization . By this means ? together with private gifts solicited by the officers of the League ? a large force of paid workers is kept in continual and active commission against the saloon . A second essential activity of the League ? one that is the direct outcome of agitation ? is law enforcement . There is frequent misconception concerning the policy of the League with respect to law enforcement . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that the liquor laws are strictly observed in any community where its aid is invoked . Some think of it as a sort of infallible and invincible executive of anti-liquor laws . But here . again , the wisdom of its leaders is in evidence . The League does not often take a case into court ; it does not keep in its employ a far-reaching detective force ; it does not , in short , profess any magic " painless , dustless process of closing saloons or compelling them to obey the law . that works while the people sleep . " What it does attempt to do is to keep the public sentiment in a given locality up to the law ; to instruct the people as to their rights and the surest way to secure them ; and to give expert legal advice in any exigency . But it seeks to lay the burden of law enforcement upon the regularly appointed officers of the law . It does not believe that it is the duty of a private citizen to take the initiative in prosecuting lawbreakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn to perform this duty . It believes that harm rather than good usually results from such interference on the part of the reformer . So it aims to bring the pressure of public opinion to bear upon the officers themselves , and in this way force them to do their duty . Officers who do thus . even tho reluctantly , discharge their duty faithfully the League supports at the polls and encourages with its moral support . The delinquent officer it does its utmost to remove from office and to bring about the election of an honest and zealous official in his place . But the supreme aim of the League is the legal suppression of the beverage liquor traffic . To this end it seeks to arouse public sentiment thru agitation ; to this end it makes use of such repressive laws as have already been enacted , however weak and imperfect these laws may be ; to this end it restricts , harasses , and combats the saloon by every temporary and intermediate process at command ; but this is its ultimate goal ? the absolute  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of small things . It does not refuse the legislative crumb because it can not get the entire crust , nor the crust because it can not get the whole loaf . But tho it gladly avails itself of the possible good at hand , it rests in nothing short of the ultimate best . It will not halt to quarrel either with those who insist in demanding more than can be achieved , or with . those , who , tho announcing themselves friendly to the cause , are either quiescent or reactionary . It moves on bravely and strongly , and continues to do the best possible with the means at hand . It has " put the saloon in the path to extinction , " and with the utmost possible rapidity it seeks to hurry it along that path . The Anti-Saloon League adopts local option as the most effective legislative expedient . In principle local option is American and democratic , submitting , as it does , the issue to a majority vote in any community interested . It transforms large areas into prohibition territory while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expel the saloon ; it keeps the temperance people thruout the country in heart by reason of continuous victories . By means of frequent local-option elections the issue is kept constantly agitated , and the saloon is kept under open and continuous condemnation ; and it has , besides , strategic advantages , as every community gained for local option becomes a new center of propagation , the result being that the local - option sentiment rapidly spreads from township to county and from county to State . From its origin the Anti - Saloon League has had trained and able leaders . The chief men in the movement have taken up the work because of special fitness and natural taste for such a moral enterprise . From the beginning , too , the League has been able to pay these men regular salaries , so that they have been free to devote their energies and talents to this particular work . The result is that the Church has in its employ a small army of gifted specialists whose sole aim is the destruction of the saloon . The founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.D. , of New York City , is a brave , modest man who seems to have been peculiarly fitted for his great task and definitely called to it . He is a man at once of vision and practical wisdom . The Rev. P. A. Baker , D.D. , general superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League in America , has been an officer in the League since 1895 . He is a quiet , fearless , sagacious man ? somewhat resembling General Grant in stature , bearing and temperament ? with a heavy square-set jaw that speaks volumes for the cause he champions . He is a born general and tactician . He is cautious , resolute , tenacious . Next to his sustained and concentrated passion for the cause he leads , is his sanity , sobriety , moderation . The growth of the Anti-Saloon League has been rapid . It was set going at the psychological moment . In fifteen years the League has grown from an idea in the brain of its founder to an organization of vast extent and resources . It is now organized thruout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ordered offices ; it supports thirty-seven papers and publishes millions of pages of literature every year ; it keeps four hundred people in continual employment , paying them regular salaries out of the four hundred thousand dollars a year which it raises from its constituents ; and , best of all , it has back of it a solidly federated and splendidly mobilized Church , which renders it prompt and enthusiastic support . It is difficult to estimate even approximately the concrete results of the movement , but the following are some of the things that have been accomplished . The army canteen has been banished , and thru the efforts of the League more than two and a quarter millions of dollars have been set aside by Congress for the construction and equipment of recreation buildings at army posts thruout the nation ; the sale of intoxicating liquors has been prohibited in both wings of the Capitol at Washington ; the sale of liquors has been abolished at emigrant stations and soldiers ' homes ; local-option laws have been past in Ohio , Indiana , Virginia , Kentucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other States in the Union ; and by virtue of these laws the saloon has been voted out of large areas of almost every State  | in the Union . Seventy-one of the one hundred and fourteen counties in Missouri have rid themselves of the saloon . In Tennessee the saloon exists in only four of the ninety-six counties . At the last session of the legislature of Colorado , after a hard fight , the Anti-Saloon League forces secured the passage of the Drake Local Option Bill , which gives the commonwealth , municipal , ward and precinct local option . Of the one thousand and sixteen townships in Indiana , seven hundred and twenty-four are now dry . In Virginia 78 per cent . of the one million nine hundred thousand inhabitants live in local-option territory , and seventy-three of the one hundred counties in the State are free from the saloon . In Illinois at the last session of the legislature the temperance forces were not only able to defeat all attempted liquor legislation , but were able to secure the passage of a local-option law by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cities and a number of counties . Also at the same session of the legislature a law was past prohibiting the location of saloons within a mile and oneeighth of military posts and naval training schools . At the recent election in Illiivas more than twelve hundred saloons were voted out in a single day . In Ohio the saloon has been expelled from eleven hundred and fifty of the thirteen hundred and seventy-six townships in the State , from four hundred and ninety towns and from residence districts in great cities to such a degree that four hundred thousand people in these cities now live in dry territory ; and very recently a county local-option law was past that will result in eliminating the saloon from all but eight or ten counties . Most astonishing of all , the State of Kentucky seems to be entering upon a long dry spell . Very recently a prominent distiller of the State said to a newspaper man : " I am an old man and have spent my life in the whisky business . If a young man were to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should advise hint , Yung man , get out of Kentucky . " Ninetv-eight per cent of the area of the State is dry 75 per cent . of the population live in prohibition territory ; and ninety-four of the one hundred and nineteen counties have voted the saloon completely out . Space does not admit of a further enumeration of results State by State but in all but five or six States of the Union the liquor business is steadily losing ground and the Anti-Saloon League is steadily making gains . A number of large cities have recently taken advantage of local-option laws to banish the saloon . among them being Knoxville , Tenn. , with a population of sixty-five thousand . and Worcester , Mass. , twenty-ninth in size of the great cities of the United States . During the past year five States . Oklahoma , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi and North Carolina . have absoluteIv prohibited the liquor traffic ; and , finally , one-half of our national domain is free from the saloon : more than thirtynine millions of our people live in nolicense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly than our population .
