 |p556  SOMEBODY has spoken of the coquetry of white hair . " Possibly it exists for the ordinary , unsophisticated individual , although the alluring delights of the hairrestorer must be an immense temptation . For the successful actor and actress , however , " the coquetry of white hair " is a delusion , pure and simple . There is no such thing . The stage declines to tolerate the waning powers , the lessened vitality , the atrophying beauty that white hair ushers in . The public is fickle , chameleon-like , and unreliable . There is that terrible bugbear " a new generation " to reckon with . Nothing is really sadder than the last years of the successful actor , usually spent in a tame , pussy-cat retirement . The old man becomes reminiscent , and ? worse still ? sees nothing but degeneration in the new art of the hour . The " good old days loom up in his conversation , and become very distressing . For " good old days " are a sop that age throws out to itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seclusion , with her " memoirs " as a last chapter . The " memoirs " of an old actress can safely be relied upon to tell you only that which you do n't care to know . The recent passing of Sir Henry Irving " in harness " ( one has to go to the stable to find a simile ) was a really picturesque ending to a signally artistic and highly-colored career . Toothless inarticulation stared Irving in the face . The " new generation " had nearly decided to refuse its endorsement ; the actor had become an interesting ,  |p558  magnificent relic offered to the appreciation and loyalty of the more or less grateful " old generation " ? when , behold ! in the very midst of his work he was artistically snuffed out . The actor knows that it is never sage to rely upon the mere gratitude of the public , for , as the French cynic said , gratitude is for favors to come , not for those received . Moreover , a gratitude that costs money is unpopular in there money-grabbing days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble sentiment . Irving 's death , if not sensational , was beautiful . Other actors have died sympathetically . It is recorded of Paterson that he dropped ( lead in Moody ' s arms , after repeating from " Measure for Measure " the lines : " Reason thus with life , If I do lose thee , I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep ; a breath thou art . " The well-known John Palmer also died agreeably , during a performance of " The Stranger . " His last words were said to " There is another and a better world though people who preferred cold fact silly people ! ? declared that his final spec was , " I left them at a small town hard b , . Last words , of course , need doctoring . This season has been inordinately interesting by reason of the " farewell tour " of the untiring Sarah Bernhardt , and it is t farewell tour that has moved me to t above reflections . Wonderful it was every way , for we saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " three score and ten , " playing exhausting roles in eleven different plays , all crowded into a two-weeks ' engagement at the Lyric Theater , New York . We watched powers that have excited the admiration of the multitude all over the civilized world . We saw that they had slightly waned , but we paid a tribute to youthful spirit that will survive the decay of the physical husk . Never has Sarah had such a phenomenally sensational reception . When she was younger we went to see her apathetically . This time she was  |p560  a famous personage as well as a magnificent actress , and we delighted to do her honor . Moreover there was the tingle of an eternal adieu in her appearance . We like to he sentimental occasionally when it is in a good cause . Sarah , throughout her astounding career , has died in all styles .. She has jumped into a river and ended ; she has been extinguished by poisons ; she has succumbed to tuberculosis ; she has been shot to kingdom come . She has rare1v elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living happily ever afterward has invariably been repulsive to her . It was her joy to dismiss her audiences with the notion that she was dead , and that there was nothing further to linger for . In all her dramatic flights Sarah has courted death . There is an artistic side to this , of course . In plays that end happily you can imagine anything you like . The hero and heroine are usually at the wedding point . In real life this is often where the trouble germ sprouts . On the stage it is where the trouble germ ends . Sarah preferred to let you go home with nothing to imagine . She was dead and that was the end of the heroine and of her play . The remarkable thing about this woman , who would have been great in whatever line she had selected , is that she has had no other life than that of the stage . There has been no private Sarah . She has invariably belonged to the public . She has acted as much off the stage as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has never been a " society " Sarah ? the Sarah with a domestic side has never existed . Off the stage , Sarah has been startling . sensational , intense . Impossible to escape her . " Scare-heads " in the daily prints were as much in demand for Sarah off the stage as for Sarah on it . When she used to go up in a balloon ; when she loved to be photographed in her coffin ; when duels were fought on the subject of her Hamlet ; when she got herself crowned immortal ? when she did this , an , : when she did that . Sarah was always acting . It is easier to be a successful actress on the stage than off it . Sarah has been an electric success in both styles . Can anybody imagine that she is going to die a placid death , in pussy-cat retirement ? Think of Sarah , knitting on a summer balcony for her two granddaughters ! Or telling the adoring young women grandmother stories beginning , " My dears , when I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sarah is and has been for all time . The mind refuses to contemplate her giving good advice to console herself for being no longer in a condition to set a had example . How will Sarah die ? We can not think of her as a slave to senile maladies in a rheumatic hobble or a bronchitic debility . Impossible to imagine her in the gruesome peace of a second childhood , arranging a cozy lace cap over her snowy tresses . " The coquetry of white hair " would scarcely attract her . If it could , the splendid artifices that are hers to-day would be less splendid . For this season , we have seen a Sarah with hair blond as the peroxide  |p561  glories of the aureate chorus-girl ; with her throat rejuvenated by an artistic collar , so artistic that silly voting women will probably adopt it as a fashion , forgetting that Sarah uses it as a necessity , with her figure draped into the outward semblance of eternal youth . Has Sarah selected any mature roles to portray ? Not a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camelias , an impersonation identified with her youth , the vitriolic Tosca , the ardent Fedora , the elusive Magda , the beautiful Adrienne , and the willful siren of " La Femme de Claude . " No old women for Sarah . And remember I have said that Sarah 's stage life is her whole life ; that she has no other . What she is on the stage , she is off the stage and vice versa . Nobody would be in the least surprised if she ended as electrically as she has lived . Sensation is the very breath of her life . Perhaps it will be her last breath . Perhaps she will make history in the last supreme moment as fervently as she has ever made it . She has dreaded the horror of anticlimax throughout her life . Will she permit this to write the finis to her astonishing career ? How will Sarah die ? Let me imagine it . Let me do so with no other reason than the impersonal , artistic pleasure of constructing a picturesque denouement for a series of matchless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah is , after all , a woman , subject , of course , to the laws that govern our frailty ; and regard her as a mere sensational figure clamoring for one last sensational feat . Let me imagine something that posterity ( yours is at school just now , so is mine ) may read with a squirm of delighted awe . It is a gala night , and an eager throng has fought for tickets to the playhouse , big as the Metropolitan Opera House . It is Sarah 's night , and she is to present  |p562  a play of which we know nothing , except that its end is to cap all the climaxes , and show us Sarah , for the very last time , in a role that she intends to make immortal . The reporters sharpen their pencils , for they can at least say that " the house is packed from pit to dome . " It is . The multitude surges in the lobbies . The boxes are filled with diamonds attached to shimmering ladies . The performance begins . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather . More febrile than ever and torrential in her moods . The audience rises to her . At the end of the fourth act , she is. called tempestuously before the curtain and bows her acknowledgments in her accustomed way . In the last act there is no way of escape from the horror of the melodramatic situation in which the playwright has plunged her , but poison . The audience murmurs a little . This , after all , is tame . Did she not die from poison quite recently in " La Sorciere " ? Sarah is more febrile than ever . One last " Queue horreur ! " One final " C'est atroce " and she takes up the phial , and drains it to the dregs . There is a fall ? a stage fall more realistic than any that Sarah has ever shown . Of late she has avoided falls and has peacefully expired on well-cushioned sofas . This fall astounds the house . There is something unusual in the thud . For a moment there is an awed silence . Then the audience sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright and dismay . They rush to Sarah . They lift her in their arms ; the curtain falls . The audience cheers . There are cries of " Sarah ! Sarah ! " The quick response to plaudits usually given by the actress when she comes forth with outstretched arms and upturned eyes remains unmade . There is no Sarah . Insistent tumult . No Sarah . The audience refuses to be pacified and grows unruly . No Sarah . The lights are extinguished ; the burly forms of the police are seen , but there is no Sarah and a mob goes to the stage door . There all is chaos , confusion confounded . Out troop the stricken actors ; in troop stern officials . Sarah has ended herself with- her play . The poison was real . What was it ? It must have been prussic acid . Until the investigation is made nothing can be affirmed positively . Tomorrow all will know ? to-morrow -- There are " extras " already out . Sarah is dead . A mock death was a real one . Great excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So on , and so forth . Pardon my imagination . It has run away with me . Sarah 's life has always been to me such an overweeningly delightful mystery that I have ? er ? constructed its finish ? artistically , of course .
