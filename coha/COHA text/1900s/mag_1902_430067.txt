 | The reflex influence of the new world upon the old has often been noted and it is one of the most notable instances of that influence that two men of New England birth should have successively ruled Madras for the East India Company in the end of the seventeenth century . In 1687 , the town of Madraspatam , or Chinnapatam , as the natives called it , was probably the most important possession of the Company in India . Situated well up the Coromandel Coast stood Fort St. George , where the Company 's agent had established a trading post some years before . The fort occupied an easily defensible position between the sea and the river Cooum and became a great mart of trade . In the year we mentioned above , Elihu Yale succeeded " our too easy Governor , " William Gyfford , as ruler of the settlement . The territory over which he governed was a narrow one , for the native Nabobs controlled all the back country . Other European settlements were neighbors too near for comfort , the Dutch being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Portuguese just across the harbor at the St. Thorne . The black town , or Madraspatam proper , and the villages within the Company 's bounds contained by far the greatest part of the population of 300,000 people . The white town , or Fort St. George , only covered a space of some 400 yards along the sea and 100 yards from the sea to the river . In this contracted space were twelve streets and alleys and 129 dwelling houses where the Europeans lived . Crowded together in this narrow compass and with little knowledge of proper sanitation , the little settlement had the terrible mortality of 101 persons in 1688 , while there were but 11 christenings that year . Here lived the little band of Englishmen , who were writers , warehousemen , and other servants of the East India Company , in a quarrelsome , gossiping little community , often eating at a common table and yet broken up into the bitterest of cliques . Hither came Elihu Yale as a writer in June , 1672 , and five years later we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annum.  | The salaries were ludicrously small , ranging from ? 5 to ? 100 per annum , the last being what was paid the governor . With such salaries , it is no wonder that the officers yielded to the temptation to engage in private trade and to aid the " interlopers , " who were gaining wealth from the country . In 1684 , Yale had gained the position of second in council by slow steps of advancement and he acted as governor during the absence of William Gyfford , the governor , for some months . We next meet Yale as bringing up the rear of the troop of English gentlemen in the procession with which Fort St. George celebrated the accession of James II . to the English throne . In 1687 , the Mogul army under Arungzebe , besieged Golconda and fears were entertained at the Fort that after that town was captured he would proceed against Madras . Clearly the " too easy " Gyfford was not the man for the emergency and we imagine that men breathed easier , on July 25 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right Hon'ble Company " constituted Elihu Yale , President , and revoked Gyfford 's commission . Yale was to hold the office for more than five years , which were critical ones for the settlement . He was a member of a family which sprang from Denbighshire in North Wales . His Grandfather , David Yale , married Anne , daughter of a Bishop of Chester , probably George Lloyd , who held the see from 1604 to 1615 . After David Yale 's death , leaving two sons , David and Thomas , his widow married Theophilus Eaton , the London merchant , who later became the first Governor of New Haven Plantation and Jurisdiction . The two step-sons went to New England with Eaton , but the elder one , David , seems to have removed from New Haven to Boston in a short time . He married Ursula , whose maiden name is unknown , and to them was born , probably in Boston , on April 5 , 1649 , Elihu , the governor of Madras . David Yale was a merchant and being " not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony , " as Prof. Dexter shows , he left Massachusetts to return to England about 1652 . Many years later Cotton Mather addressed Elihu Yale as one who " left his native country in such an early infancy as to be incapable of remembering anything in it . " Apparently , he never returned to his native land , though his gifts to the college there which bears his name , have preserved the memory of the man .  | The industry of Prof. Dexter has found but one fact , in regard to Yale 's life in England , that he spent three months at Master Dugard 's school in 1662 . When he was 23 years of age , he went to India and , after an apprenticeship in various grades of the service , he became governor at the age of 38 . His brother , Thomas , who was born probably in England , after the family 's return , probably came out after Elihu , and we shall meet him Later . Before he became governor , Yale had married Catherine , widow of Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 28 , 1680 . She had at least three children by her first husband , and by Yale she had four more , three daughters and a son . The daughters returned to England and two of them married and loft children , though the direct line of descendants has since become extinct . The son bore the ancestral name of David and was born on May 15 , 1684 . Before he was four years old , on January 25 , 1687-8 , he died and lies buried in the old cemetery in Madras . The tombstone is one of the few still standing there , and recalls to all that great loss , which the old Consultation Book thus chronicles , January 26 , 1688 : " The Council did not meet this day , the President 's only son dying last night , was interred this morning to their great grief and sorrow . " Yale 's morals were far from being irreproachable and we are told that he lived in improper relations with two women in his garden house at Madras . One of these bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape of Good Hope , and with his mother is buried there . With all this looseness of life , Yale was a benevolent man and a religious one , and doubtless each Sunday morning at Madras , we should have seen the following sight : " Twixt eight and nine the bell tells us the hour of devotion draws near . A whole company of above 200 soldiers is drawn out from the inner fort to the church door for a guard to the passing President . Ladies throng to their pews and gentlemen take a serious walk in the yard , if it be not too hot . On the governor 's approach , the organs strike up and continue a welcome till he is seated . " To the fort church of St. Mary 's , which had been built some ten years before , he gave in the year of his accession to the Governorship a large and handsome alms dish of silver , seventeen inches in diameter and weighing over three pounds , which is still used in the services . His own marriage had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | 1680 , and the church registers show that he frequently acted as godfather for infants and " father " for brides . The community of the Company 's servants was a small one and all dined together in the middle of the day . The Governor presided at the head of the table ; on either side of him sat the merchants , writers , and factors . This closeness of contact must have had its great inconveniences in the many quarrels between the members of the little colony . Mrs. Penny , the latest historian of Madras , speaks of Yale as follows : " He possessed a strong character , but it was the character of the bold enterprising merchant . Though he was no politician , there was nothing weak or undecided about Yale ; his attitude toward the shifty native was firm and confident . He was quite ready to carry out Sir Josiah Child 's policy of showing an independent front to the native ruler and of resisting the demands made so often for money . Under his hands , the mercantile interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort St. George , Yale became governor with a guard of 20 peons and the privilege in the center of the Fort . His hands were full of all sorts of affairs , negotiations with the Mogul , and arrangements to obtain a cowle or grant of the neighboring town of St. Thorne , formerly possessed by the Portuguese . He managed the trade in slaves , directed the commercial affairs of the trading factory and doubt-less engaged largely in private trade for himself . Partly through his influence , and in his time , Madras was made a municipality with a form of government modeled on that of the Dutch towns . The constitution for the municipality was a curious one . It provided for a Mayor , and Aldermen and Burgesses , describing their robes of office and forming a municipal court to hear minor cases . Of the twelve aldermen and the mayor , not over three should be English and these should be the Company 's servants , not more than three should be Portuguese and the remaining seven should be " Moors and Gentoors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tax is to be levied for building schools , and paying school teachers for teaching the " English tongue " to the natives , and " by degrees for many other public good works . "  | The municipality , with Nathaniel Higginson for the first mayor , was set up on September 29 , 1688 . Trial of pirates sent from the Dutch settlement at Pulicat , establishment of an assurance office , the reception of Agent Job Charnock and his clerks who had fled from their new settlement of Calcutta ; these matters occupied the attention of the government of Madras in the ensuing months . The position of the English towards the Hindus was an humiliating one . In 1689 , the " Mogul 's Dewan " sent word that now since the government had passed from the King of Golconda to him , the rent should be increased . The Council was determined , however , not to grant a " great present , " since " it can do us , little kindness and may encourage their exactions . " In 1691 , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cowle , or grant , but also in having the whole annual rent of 1,200 pagodas for Madras and Triplicane removed . Other lesser favors , such as the right to establish a mint and to extend control over three more villages , were granted by the Mogul . To show appreciation of this firman , Yale , dressed in a rich native costume which was the gift from the Mogul , received the grant in person from the Nabob . " Small presents " were given as a matter of course and in the same year the Council sent the " Chief of Conimere with a suitable retinue " visit the " Rama Rajah at Gingee with a present " not to exceed 600 Pagodas in value , and to consist of a Persian horse " with handsome furniture ; three or four pieces of broadcloth , fine and ordinary ; firearms ; with other varieties that may be most pleasing and acceptable to him . " News shortly came that a " considerable force from the Mogul is coming against us . Through Yale 's energy , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the out town and bridge over the river were " trenched and fortified with turf and clay work as well and as soon as possible . " Shortly afterwards , too , came news that James II . had abdicated the throne of England , that William and Mary reigned , that the French at Pondicherry were foes and the Dutch at Pulicat firm allies . In August , 1690 , the allied fleet met the French vessels off the harbor of Madras and the former beat off their foes , who do not appear to have returned to terrify the English at Fort St. George . The East India Company 's benevolence and tolerance were shown during Yale 's governorship . In 1688 , agreement was  | made by the East India Company with a body of Armenians that they might reside at Madras and have their church there . Some of these were speedily chosen Aldermen of the municipality , and doubtless their thrift in trade added to its prosperity . That Yale had already shown beneficence has been inferred from the fact that the Company in 1691 desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate in our service to set on foot another generous charitable work before he leaves India , that is the building a church for the Protestant black and Portuguese and the slaves which serve them . " There was no Protestant Portuguese Church before , and the Company was just on the point of sending out two ministers who knew the Portuguese language . During all this time , Yale was amassing wealth , and probably used his brother Thomas as a convenient partner in his schemes . There was trouble about certain transactions of Thomas Yale in a voyage to China , and the Council and Governor fell into a furious controversy over these difficulties . In November , 1690 , the Council wrote Yale that his efforts to explain his brother 's affairs " were stuffed with evasive arguments and false affirmations to blind the Right Honourable Company and cloak your brother 's frauds . " His assertions were " wholly malicious and untrue . " To this document , Yale 's only answer seems to have been to omit to call the Council together in weekly sessions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write him again , complaining that they can not examine " the Company 's cash , which you have by an assumed unwarrantable and arbitrary power , made use of as suited best your own profit . " They are willing to bear with his " continual affronts , abuses , and ill language , " but will not " let the Company 's business suffer . " Yale now answers in words as bitter as their own , speaking of their " scandalous forgeries , " " venomous production , " " audacious falsities and threats . " He accuses the members of failure to attend to business , of ineffectiveness , and denies their charges , while hinting that they may intend a mutiny . Yale has " often freely supplied " the Company 's " occasions with many thousand Pagodas , " but thanks God that he " had never any inclination or occasion to make use of theirs . " The successful course of his administration is also referred to by him . The Council answers this with a plain statement that they hope for an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale 's wealth . In his answer , Yale admits that he has gained a fortune of 500,000 pagodas in his " twenty years ' diligent service in India and trading , " probably chiefly in the latter , as his salary was never over ? 300 , while his fortune amounted to about ? 175,000 . The controversy dragged on through the rest of Yale 's term of office , was the cause of his removal , and plagued both him and his successors throughout the latter 's administration . Finally , the end came to Yale 's governorship , amid the usual complaints on the part of the Company that he had engaged in illicit trade and held fast money which should have gone into the Company 's treasury . The ship Berkeley Castle came into the road of Madras on October 23 , 1692 , and brought a governor 's commission for Mr. Nathaniel Higginson . The " Company 's servants and commissioned officers " were called together at the Fort , the commission was publicly read and , " after the usual ceremonies , Governor Yale delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nathaniel Higginson was just forty years of age when he became Governor , and he had married Elizabeth Richardson only five months before . He was born in Guilford , Conn. , probably in the famous Stone House built by the Rev. Henry Whitfield at the settlement of the town in 1639 . Rev. Francis Higginson , his grandfather , was one of the first clergymen who came to Massachusetts Bay and his father , Rev. John Higginson , had early gone to Fenwick 's little settlement at Saybrook as its chaplain . Learning the Indian language there , he had served as interpreter for Fenwick 's friend , Rev. Mr. Whitfield , when he and his company bought Menunkatuck from the Indians . The attractions of the place and the people drew the clergyman to Whitfield 's town and he became the son-in-law , assistant , and successor of that clergyman in his place in Guilford . When Nathaniel was but seven years of age , his father left Guilford to return to England , doubtless being one of those discouraged with New England conditions . The vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under stress of weather and the church there , being in want of a minister , summoned him to their service , in which he remained until his death in 1708 , in his ninety-second year .  | Nathaniel spent his boyhood in Salem and then went to Harvard College , where he was graduated in 1670 , the highest in social standing of that year 's class of four . Of the next four years we know nothing , but in 1674 , when he was twenty-two years of age , he left New England behind him , probably never to return to it . He had relatives in England , whither he went , and his father told the Salem friends that Nathaniel thought to hide himself " from the evil of the times for the space of seven years and then return . " The father added , he did not expect to see his son again , " for he could not expect to live seven years . " He lived five times seven years more and even outlived the son for two months , but many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's fate , for communication with the Far East was difficult , and Nathaniel seems not to have been one to write often . What was the " evil of the times " we know not . In England , Higginson spent about seven years with Lord Wharton as steward and tutor of his children . Later , he was employed by the same nobleman for some years in the mint of the Tower . In 1683 , he entered the service of the East India Company and was stationed at Fort St. George , Madras . While he " continued in England , " his brother wrote him , " I was often favoured with letters from you , " but now nine years elapsed , during which but one letter came from him to those left behind at Salem . At Madras , Higginson soon began to achieve such a reputation that after four years of service , when he was thirty-five years of age , he was named second in Council and Sir Josiah Child , the governor of the Board of Directors in England , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the speedy advancement of Mr. Higginson . We do not do it out of any partiality to him , for he has no relation here to speak for him , nor ever had the ambition to think of such a thing himself , neither have we done it out of any ill feeling or disrespect to any others now being of our Council , but sincerely as we apprehend for the public good , knowing him to be a man of learning and competently well read in ancient histories of the Greeks and Latins which , with a good stock of natural parts only , can render a man fit for government and political service , martial prudence , and other requisites for ruling over a great city . Formerly , when the activities of the place were merely those of trading merchants , being bred a boy in India or studying long there and speaking  | the language , understanding critically the trade of the place , " were enough , but now the Company were formed " into the condition of a Sovereign State in India , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed . Such the Company believed they found in Higginson and a year later , when Child sent out orders to form Madras into a municipality , Higginson received another mark of favor in being made the first mayor . The forms of English municipalities were followed in his inauguration . The oaths were administered in the Fort Hall to all the municipal officers , the Aldermen being robed in scarlet serge gowns and the Burgesses in white China silk . After this they dined together and then marched in procession to the Town Hall " with the Maces before the Mayor . " Higginsou , profiting by his English experience , took " the care and charge of the General Books and Accompts and the Mint , " and held Mayor 's Court once a fortnight . The ends of the municipality were not all accomplished at once and a year later we find that the corporation had not been able to levy a tax , and successfully asked the Council to grant them certain " petty dues " for their necessary charges and expenses . During the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though we feel sure he had much to do with the proceedings against " the rogues from the northward " who " falsified and counterfeited our Pagodas coin , " and we know he was one of the embassy to the Dutch governor , Herr Lawrence Pitt . In May , 1692 , just before he became governor , Higginson married Elizabeth , daughter of John Richardson , who died on the passage out to India in 1681 , having been appointed to be chief of Ballasow factory in Bengal . His wife and only other child died in Bengal a few years later and Elizabeth Richardson was , " when a very young orphan , placed under the care " of a pious woman , " who initiated into her the principles of piety and caused her to learn the Malabar , Gentow , and Portuguese languages very perfectly . " The same pious woman took Higginson 's eldest daughter Elizabeth , " when very young , and spent such care and pains in her instruction , that before five years old she could read well in the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her proud father wrote his brother in Salem that " she bath read over the greatest part " of the Scriptures , and " upon reading an historical chapter in English can give a very good account of  | the contents in the Portuguese language . " This precocious child died in London about 1700 . Three others of his children died in childhood , a fourth , a daughter , married in England , while the only surviving son , Richard , after going to Holland for his education and planning to go into the New England trade , finally returned to Madras , his birthplace . There he became seventh in the Council and died in 1726 , in his thirty-second year . Not only in his family but also in his official life , Higginson seems to have been beyond reproach . After he resigned his post , he wrote " I have gone through the most considerable employment in the Company 's service in India and have had opportunities enough for gaining a great estate , which , though I have not , yet I thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because gained by God 's blessing upon my laborious diligence , without indirect courses and I have enough for me . " His letter shows him to have been a man of religious feeling and his claim of probity in his conduct is born out by the historian of Madras , who writes that Higginson " seems to have been the first governor of Madras on record , who retired from the Presidency without a stain on his name . After a careful perusal of the many volumes of records referring to his government , we find none of those charges and insinuations which were so frequent during the administration of his predecessors . " His government was in a troubled period . The Mahrattas were warring with the Great Mogul . The Dutch and English were in alliance against the French , and owing to the Revolution in England and the dethronement of James II . Pondicherry fell to the Dutch in 1693 . In the midst of these weighty external matters , Higginson and the Council found their hands were also filled with arrangements of sittings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulation of legal , trade , punishing one man for contempt of court and another for speculation in his office of steward . It was a truly absolute government , in both Church and State . Higginson determined who should be priest in the Roman Catholic churches , in the territory under his control , telling the Bishop of St. Thorne , when he refused to receive the priest appointed by him , " that no foreign Episcopal authority can be admitted within the limits of our jurisdiction . " The Bishop may have " friendly and neighborly correspondence " with  | Madras , but Higginson " admires at your usurption of authority which did not belong to your predecessors nor to yourself nor successors , viz. : to appoint Vicars in any place under the English government . You have made a wrong account and if you would reckon right you must begin again . " Not alone among Christians did Higginson act as head of the church , but we also find that he settles disputes concerning the ownership and management of the pagodas of the Brahmins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French padre however is too difficult and must be referred to the Company . It was desirable to widen the Company 's territory from time to time and Higginson strove with success to obtain " firmuns " and " perwannas " granting him the right to add some of the neighboring towns to the domain over which he ruled . From these towns , came the " conicopolies and chief inhabitants to make their salaam to the President and presented him with a patch of cloth and brought sheep , fowls , cocoa nuts , with a basket of oranges , limes , and plaintains , which were delivered to the Steward for the use of our General Table and made their acknowledgements o the great satisfaction and security they enjoyed under our government . " Private or illicit trade still continued in spite of all the best efforts at repression and one Englishman was thrown into prison for obtaining a personal firman for " Novo Porto . " Brawling and dissipation among those who composed the small band of Englishmen , and troubles between masters and crews of vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Hindus . Presents and " loans " must be made to Zulfikar Khan , the Mogul general , to the Nabob , and to other commanders . If the presents were not sufficient to satisfy the Oriental 's mind , difficulties followed and the position of the Governor was a hard one . In 1696 , in consequence of an exorbitant demand , we find the consultation books contain the following entry : " We can not pay or lend the Nabob the sum of a 100,000 pagodas , either out of the Right Hon'ble Company 's chest nor by imposing a Poll tax on the inhabitants , nor can we admit of a Thasildar over the Black town , and if the Nabob shall send an army as threatened , besiege the place and compel us to compliance , we ought to defend the place as well as we can . But that it is better to prevent a siege and the ill consequence that will follow it , if the same can  | be done by spending a reasonable sum without rendering the place liable to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empire , but merely of maintaining trading factories along the Coromandel coast . Spies were kept in the Hindu camp and at the proper moment a present of 1,000 pagodas was sent and the difficulty blew over for a time . It was a heterogenous community and Higginson found among his duties that he had to distribute prayer books among his Portuguese subjects and to secure a promise from the Armenian merchant not to trade with interlopers . Now and then , too , rumors came on the side of the water of danger to the existence of the place or to its trade as when six French ships appear in the offing , or a supposed pirate vessel moors at St. Thorne . During all of Higginson 's administration , Yale remained in Madras and must have been an additional thorn in the side of his successor . Wheeler says that " Yale was trying to evade the Company 's claims against him " and hints that one cause of the removal of the judge of the Admirality Court was his two favorable decisions towards Yale . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Council at home that the authorities at Madras had seized his property to the amount of E30,000 , which was about five times as much as they had given judgment against him , " in their own arbitrary court and illegal way of proceeding . " He further alleges that he has been imprisoned in the fort since November 1692 , " with design to enforce him into despair , or otherwise to bring on him some distemper that may hasten his death , which not long since by poison was near effected . " Higginson and the Council deny these charged in toto . They say that Yale is at full liberty to go , if he will , and that the reflection " is not only groundless , but basely scandalous . " They broadly insinuate that Yale 's own record as to poisoning was not a clear one and bring up accusations against him of loose living . At last in 1699 , Yale set sail for home , a year after Higginson gave up the governorship to Thomas Pitt , the grandfather of the Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitt or Regent diamond . Higginson was violenely opposed by William Fraser , a member of the Council and because of this quarrel asked leave to retire . Giving up office in July , 1698 , he returned to England with his family in February , 1700.  | From the Higginson family left behind in Salem , we have several letters preserved which show that only once during the governorship did word from Madras reach them and then it was speedily followed by disappointment , for the news received by the aged clergyman that his son was sending him ? 180 came only a little before tidings that the ship bearing it was lost . It took nearly a year for news to come from Madras to Salem and the letter which Nathaniel Higginson wrote to his brother John was dated September 26 , 1698 , but was received only on August 3 , 1699 . It told of Higginson 's intention to leave Madras and suggested that he might come to Boston to live and manage a wholesale trade for East India goods . His brother John answers the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you had your education here and you do owe some service to your country . Come and pay it . It is possible you may see your aged father , before he dies . " At least one other friend wrote from Salem urging this return , with the quaint language of that day , and laying stress on the religious advantages of Massachusetts , but the gift of ? 100 sent to the old father was not followed by the presence of the son . In February and in October , 1699 , Higginson wrote again to his brother , telling of his family life , asking as to the possibility of the two brothers trading between England and America in partnership , and suggesting that he would be glad to care for one of his New England nephews , possibly by placing him in the East India Company 's service . A letter is extant from John Higginson , answering the queries as to trade but evidently not hoping for much from the venture . He urges that Nathaniel try to obtain the governorship of Massachusetts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not known whether Higginson engaged in trade after his return to England and we catch but few glimpses of him . In 1706 , he headed a petition to the Crown to remove Joseph Dudley from the office of governor of Massachusetts and , two years later , he died on October 31 , 1708 , and was buried in Bow Church in Cheapside . Judge Sewall wrote when he heard the sad news , " Alas ; Alas ; That he should escape 1,000 deaths in going to the East Indies dwelling there and returning , and die so soon in London of the smallpox . "  | Yale outlived Higginson for thirteen years and died on July 8 , 1721 . At his return to England he was fifty-one years of age and possessed of great wealth . For the last years of his life , he spent his time as a private citizen , living in the winter in his town house near the site of the British Museum , and in summer at Plasgronow near Wrexham , in Wales , where an estate had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation for benevolence . The legend is , that the Church of St. George the Martyr , which stands near his town house in Queen 's Square took its name from the fact that one of its founders had been a governor of Fort St. George . As the church was built in 1706 , it is most probable that Yale was the governor referred to . Apart from these straws of evidence we know little of his later life . A fire in his house in 1719 caused him to receive as insurance the extremely large amount of ? 4,500 and the enumeration of his goods , made after his death , shows that he was a great collector of curiosities . Chiefest , however , in the interest of Yale 's later life is his connection with the American university which has recently celebrated its bicentennial and which bears his name . Ten Congregational clergymen of Connecticut assembled in the parlor of the Rev. Mr. Russell , of Branford , in 1701 , and gave books from their scanty libraries to found a college in the Colony . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James Pierpont , of New Haven , the chief founder of the Collegiate School of Connecticut , that Governor Yale " told me that he intended to bestow a charity upon some college in Oxford under certain restrictions which he mentioned . But I think he should rather do it to your college , seeing he is a New England and I think a Connecticut man . " Soon after , Dummer sent over about 700 volumes for the college library and between 30 and 40 of them came from Yale , who did nothing more for the college till the renowned Cotton Mather in 1718 asked him to give a contribution towards the building in New Haven of a permanent edifice for the college . " Sir , " wrote Mather , " though you have felicities in your family which , I pray God continue and multiply , yet , certainly , if what is forming at New Haven might wear the name of Yale College , it would be better than a name of sons and daughters . And your munificence might easily obtain for you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be much better than an Egyptian pyramid . " As a result of the effort in America and England , Yale sent over gifts amounting in value to ? 800 . The amount seems small to us of to-day , but it came at a critical period in the history of the institution , ensured its permanence and was not surpassed by any gift from an individual for 120 years . Yale sent ? 100 more in February 1721 , and told Dummer that he would " remit ? 200 sterling per annum during his life , and make a settled annual provision to take place after his death But he died , five months later and the will left unsigned was void . It contained a legacy to the college , but the heirs refused to carry out Yale 's wishes in the matter . Prof. Dexter well says that " no inspired vision could have given " Mather " firmer ground for this faith that was in him . The morsel , the merest fragment of his great possessions which the rich man , thoughtlessly perhaps , grudgingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this appeal , has not been lost or scattered ; it has preserved his name from extinction , long after his latest descendant has mouldered to dust and given him lasting fame which a better man might have envied.
