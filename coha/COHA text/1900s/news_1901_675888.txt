txt No verdict having been agreed upon after six and onehalf hours deliberation , the jury which heard the evidence against Police Captain Thomas J. Diamond of New York , charged with neglect of duty in failing to suppress Lena Schmidt 's disorderly house , was locked up at 11 o'clock to-night by Justice D. Cady Herrick . Capt . Diamond was placed in the custody of his coUnSel , a ? 314-court was adjourned until to-morrow at 9 o'clock . Capt . Diamond 's case went to the . jury solely upon the evidence adduced by the prosecution . The four lawyers for the-defense , Messrs . Cady , House , Henderson , and Vorhaus , when the State rested , had a short consultation with Deputy Commissioner Devery and Capt . Diamond , a longer conference among themselves , and finally decided W offer no defense . They held that the State had failed to make out a case of neglect of duty against Capt . Diamond . Ex-Judge Cady and Assistant District Attorney Osborne then engaged in spirited legal debate upon the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Cady attacked the State 's case vigorously , and Mr. Osborne in turn endeavored strenuously to refute Mr. Cady 's arguments and to set forth the prosecution 's view of the evidence against the accused official . A vague report that the jury stood ten to two or nine to three for acquittal , heard after it had been out some time was given no credence in the courtroom . After the jury retired , in the evening , Capt . Diamond and Gov . Odell met by chance in the Hotel Ten Eyck lobby . The Governor greeted the Captain , shook hands , and spoke with him briefly . THE DAY IN DETAIL . The corridors of the Hotel Ten Eyck early began to fill with persons prominent in New York police and reform circlet- , who had arrived on the 6 o'clock train . Conspicuous among these was Deputy Commissioner of Police William S. Devery , present in response to a subpoena of the State . As he rode up from the station in an automobile . by craning his neck from the window , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together up the street , Assistant Superintendent George P. Hammond of the Parkhurst society and Agent Charles F. Dillon , who dogged his footsteps during the Mazet days . With them was Agent Robert S. . Assistant Secretary George W. Morgan of the Committee of Fifteen was not far behind , and bringing up the rear were Tombs Warden Hagan and Deputy Sheriff Daniel Kelley , having George Bissert , Capt . Diamond 's convicted Wardman , in charge . Deputy Assistant District Attorney Howard S. Gans came up also and joined the forces of District Attorney Philbin . The greater portion of the morning session of the trial was taken up by Assistant District Attorney Osborne in getting into evidence the rule of the Police Department which prescribes that weekly reports of all suspicious places in precincts shall be made by the Captains . The defense strenuously fought the introduction of the rule and the proof that it was now in force . Sergt. Schulum of the Fifteenth Precinct was recalled to identify certain papers , and Courtney N. Kennelly , clerk of the Yorkville Police Court gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her three successive arrests . Then Lena Schmidt herself was recalled . She said that when the girls were chased out of her house she never was . " Did you get a red light when you started up in business ? " asked Mr. Osborne . " After Oct. 1 , 1900 , " replied Lena .. " I got a red globe for the hall light and ' put up red curtains in the windows . " " How long did the light stay there ? ? ' " When the Committee of Five started " - " Object , " shouted Mr. Cady . " Those men came in and told me " - " Never , , wind that , " bean Mr. Osborne . " Well , I had orders , ' the woman declared . How long did your lamp burn after Oct. 1 ? " inquired Mr. Osborne . All night , " was the reply . The ... court laughed . " Four months , " added Lena , " but I changed the globe : I put a blue one on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . STATE RESTS IT 'S CASE . After Lena 's testimony Mr. Osborne suddently announced that the State rested . It was 11:55 A. M. Mr. Cady moved that the jury be instructed to acquit Capt . Diamond on the ground that the prosecution had failed to make out a case . " I guess I 'll hear you , " said Justice Herrick denying the motion . Mr. Cady then asked for an adjournment , stating that the four lawyers for the Captain were undecided whether . or not to put in any defense . They asked for an opportunity to confer and decide . Mr. Vorhaus and Capt . Diamond seemed to think that they could prove nothing that the State had not proved for them , as they put it , that Capt . Diamond stationed men in front of Lena Schmidt 's 1 door , raided the place , arrested her , had her held for trial , and closed the place . Justice Herrick granted the adjournment . Ex-Judge Cady announced immediately after court reconvened that the defense rested . He began to sum up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution 's case , following the departure from the room this morning of ten or fifteen persons , when witnesses were excluded under the rule , " he said , " has materially changed the aspect of our case and of our course . We supposed that after the Grand Jury indicted Capt . Diamond for this grave offense and from the time since last August the District Attorney has had to study the 1 case , some strong case would be prepared and presented here . But after the incident Ialluded to we do not feel called upon to interpose any defense . " The counsel called attention to the fact I that only one case of neglect had been I cited in a precinct containing 150,000 pert sons , and inquired further why not one of i these 150,000 persons had been called as a witness to testify against Capt . Diamond . Lena Schmidt and Rosie Greenberg , he said , were outcasts unworthy of belief , even if they were sojourning at the Hotel Ten Eyck at that time , along with Judges of the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic to be a police officer , " he continued . " It is not all gold lace and I brass buttons . I do n't claim the police are i all saints . They are men like the rest of iUS . ' ' I Mr. Cady explained the absence of Lena Schmidt 's house from the list of suspicious places reported weekly by the Captain by stating that it was not the custom of the Police to place on this list any house where an arrest had been made . " Capt . Diamond did suppress this house . " he continued . " The only charge brought against him is that he did n't do it quickly enough . If you convict Capt . Diamond I do not see how the District Attorney can escape indictment when lie gets back to his own county . " MR . OSBORNE 'S SPEECH . Mr. Cady spoke fifty minutes . Mr. Osborne immediately began his answering argument . He said in part : ? ? The prosecution stated at the outset that we would show that a disorderly house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been no denial of the fact . No witness has been brought here to dispute it . The fact that Diamond allowed it to run from the 1st of October , 11 ) 00. to May 2. 1901 , goes on the record also undisputed . As Mr. Cady says , the police business is not all gold braid and tbrass buttons . Some of them have much to do with real estate and bank accounts . ? ? ' Chen things got lively the Captain got eviuence quickly enough against this house , " continued Mr. Osborne . " That 's not disputed here . It was not necessary for me to call any citizens of this precinct . You would not cull a citizen of Albany County to prove that this Court House is here . Everybody knows it . We proved by Diamond 's own Sergeant that the Captain told the whole patoon that 27 Stuyvesant Street was a disorderly house . What did he do to close the house ? Sent an officer to pace tip and down outside . He might have paced there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was not Lena Schmidt driven out when the girls were ' : If you leave the queen bee in a hive and drive the other bees away they will surely return . Was it that the queen bee was n't getting all the honey the bees colleeted " " Object ! " shouted Mr. House . Justice nerrick said it was quite hard to straighten facts out of flights of oratory . Mr. House suggested that the court hold Mr. Osborne down to facts . The court said he would . ? ? If you do you 'll be the first Magistrate on the New York bench who has succeeded in doing so . " observed Mr. House . Diamond . Mr. Osborne asserted , did not dare- report to his chief that Lena Schmidt 's existed , and he never reported it as suspicivus until June 10 and then he had raided it three times . Mr. Cady 's explanation about the reports here , Mr. Osborne said , was made up out of whole cloth . He added that if the District Attorney prosecuted at once every witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of them would have the greatest picnic the world ever saw . " " Your own common sense , " he concluded , will tell you that it might be a good thing for a Police Captain to have a house run on the quiet , and a bad thing to have it run openly and notoriously . Lena did not like the officer at the door , so she went to this good , wise . and discreet Captain and requested that the officer be taken away . And for this most persistent violator of the law he does this thing . If the officer was put there for any good purpose , why was he removed ? " ' Mr. Osborne spoke one hour and ten minutes . JUSTICE HERRICK 'S CHARGE . Justice Herrick began his charge to the jury at 4:10 . He advised the jurors that neither they nor he had anything to do with the transfer of the case to Albany County and that they were to draw no unfavorable inference from the fact that Capt . Diamond submitted no defense . He continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preponderance of evidence . The defendant is indicted for willful neglect of duty . Willful means not only knowingly. but with a bad purpose , an evil intent . It is not incumbent upon the prosecution to prove by direct evidence a bad motive.kYou have a right to infer evil purpose from circumstances or manner of conduct in actions or neglect to act . if the circumstances in this case warrant that kind of an inference it is your duty to find in accordance therewith . The prosecution must establish the existence of a disorderly house , and that Capt . Diamond knew of its existence . The evidence shows that he stationed a man in front of it , and gave special instructions to his men about it . It is for you to say from this if he had knowledge of it . In regard to whether he took all the means in his power to suppress it . the evidence is singular in that each side relies upon it to support their contention . It has been testified that the special instructions given were to arrest women on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no falling off of business while the policemen were stationed in front of the door . Regarding the weekly reports of Capt . Diamond . on which 27 Stuyvesant Street does not appear . Justice Herrick charged that the reports were allowed in evidence to show the bad purpose of Cant . Diamond . Whether the omission of Lena Schmidt 's place did or did not show evil purpose was for the jury to determine . In conclusion the Court said : The case turns on this question , whether or not Capt . Diamond refrained from closing up this house for a bad purpose . If you think he cid ? it is your duty to find the defendant guilty . The decision in this case is important to the public . The peace and good order of our cities Lhrgely depend upon the faithfulness and efficiency of their police officers . If you convict this man , it will end his career as a public officer , and . although police officers should be held to a strict accounting , you . should not find this defendant guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect was willful and from a bad motive . Justice Herrick spoke twenty minutes . There were no exceptions to the charge by either side , and at 4:30 the case went u. the jury . Five minutes later the jurymen filed out . TO WORK WITH CHURCHILL . Capt . Chapman Says He Will Help the Acting Captain to Make the Bowery Clean . Capt . George S. Chapman , transferred from High Bridge to the Mercer Street command , walked familiarly yesterday morning into his new station house and home for some time he has lived at the headQuarters of his command  --  and had a cheery greeting for his subordinates and visitors . As is his wont , he endured some gibing about his famous black whiskers with a smile and an occasional repartee , and then settled down to business , talking over the condition of the precinct with Sergt. " Ed " Walling , son of the former Superintendent , and others of the command . Then he turned his attention to his lares and penates and the fitting up of his room , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied to a. question , " the ? Little Drummer Boy ' is glad to be back . I 'm , of course , ready to do police duty anywhere , and no one ever heard me rebel at orders from Mulberry Street I 've no programme except to do police duty . I have an idea that the precinct is in fair shape , but I shall know better about that when I 've been around . Of course I shall cooperate with Acting Captain Churchill in ' keeping the upper Bowery and Fourth Avenue clean . I feel at home here , mainly , I suppose , because I first wore a Captain 's shield in this house . I was last here eight months ago . By cats ! I feel more comfortable than up at High Bridge ? " " Blew through ' em up there ? " suggested a bystander . " Oh , you let ' em alone , " retorted the handsome little man , fondling one of his facial adornments . " Beat ' em . You 're envious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not paradise , but I gained twelve pounds there , all the same . " Acting Captain James Churchill expressed himself as very well satisfied with affairs so far as they have gone . " The precinct has been whipped into shape , " said he . " It is fairly clean , and I will keep it so , and maybe do better . But I am to-disy the same policeman I was a week ago . It wo n't be a case of ' swelled head ' with rne . CoL Murphy sent me here , and I followed his instructions in ' what I did . I came to enforce the law as I found it , and have done it as well as I could , and shall keep on in the same way . Oh , yes , Capt . George is on the other side of the Bowery now , and will no doubt keep his end up . - As to criticising my superiors , well , one of the newspapers published a very interesting and clever story . It was so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say is that the incident is closed , and that I know police duty too well to criticise my superiors . So I have taken back nothing because there was nothing to take back . I do n't know how I made out at the mental examination for Captain . I was confronted by two or three tough propositions , but I fancy I disposed of them properly . In the physical examination I was marked up 100 per cent "
