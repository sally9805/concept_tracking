txt As the result of the Missouri inquiry and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the State of Missouri , Attorney General Hadley believes a new day has dawned in Standard Oil . The policy of secrecy and subterfuge has been abandoned , he thinks . In its stead has come a policy of enforced candor and open dealing , There will be no longer a masquerading of Standard offshoots under other names . Wherever the trust operates it will assume responsibility . These conclusions reached by the Western prosecutor who invaded New York to clinch his case against the corporation , ; are practically admitted to be correct by the attorneys who fruitlessly endeavored to stop him . So well satisfied is Mr. Hadley with the situation that he rejected yesterday a proposal made to him to examine John D. Rockefeller in private . The suggestion came from John D. Archbold , the Stand-ard 's Vice President , who announced on the witness stand that it was made with the knowledge of Mr. Rockefeller . It was prefaced with the declaration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suit against the ' Standard 's Missouri offshoots , and that his only reason for dodging process servers was his fear of " notoriety and cartoonists . " Mr. Hadley could n't see that Mr. Rockefeller was entitled to special consideration , and did n't hesitate to say so . He openly rejoiced , however , over the changed spirit in Standard Oil . " In Nebraska and in Indiana the Republic Oil Company has already transferred the properties standing in its name to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , " said Mr. Hadley at the conclusion of the hearing yesterday afternoon . " To my mind , coupling the move in these two States with the new-born attitude of Standard Oil officials , this means that the company has decided to do business in the open . " " It is my personal opinion , " said Frank Hagerman , the Standard lawyer who has been the acknowledged spokesman of the corporation since Mr. Hadley fired his opening gun , " that Federal control is the solution of the trust problem . There is no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their policy . When the Government of the United States charters and supervises industrial combinations there will be no trouble with them and no criticism of their methods . " Some radical change is necessary . The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey has admitted the ownership of a controlling interest in the Standard Oil Company of Indiana , the Republic Oil Company , and the Waters-Pierce Oil Company . The admission implies the fact that it is doing business in Missouri under assumed names , although it is conducting its operations in a manner wholly within the law . The statutes of Missouri forbid the operation within its borders of a corpora-1 tion capitalized at more than $10,000,000 . Other States , insist that foreign corpora tions shall keep out . What other remedy is there than Federal control ? " The frank statement of Mr. Hagerman and the conclusions drawn by Attorney General Hadley at the close of the day 's 1investigations were foreshadowed by the testimony of Mr. Archbold , Vice President of the parent company , which controls 70 per cent of the oil business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination can Mr. Archbold be considered as a man to whom publicity is pleasant . Yet he freely recited the tale of Standard methods and ' told without reserve what would have been regarded a month ago as Standard I secrets when Mr. Hadley put him on the witness stand yesterday morning and I questioned him as to the inside workings of the Standard combination . It was n o'clock when the inquiry be-1 gan . Attorney General Hadley slept late after his dinner with the Plaeides Club , and the Standard lawyers were berated in appearing . When Special Commissioner I Sanborn was finally able to open the proceedings Mr. Archbold was the first man called . He wore a frown and a blue sack suit . No sooner had he taken the stand that he registered a hearty kick against the presence of newspaper artists . At a previous hearing he smashed a camera . Yesterday he had hardly settled himself in his chair when half a dozen men with pencils got busy . Their industry was not lost upon him . " I desire to protest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the sketch artists . They are positively indecent . " Mr. Sanborn obligingly requested the ' " sketch artists " to cease their activities , Mr. Archbold then admitted , in answer to the questions of Mr. Hadley , that he was the Vice President of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and that he owned stock in both that corporation and in the Standard Oil Company of Indiana . M. M. Van Beuren , he said , is his sonin-law . Mr. Van Beuren is in New York . " I saw him yesterday , " he said , and Process Server Palmedo left the hearing immediately . " Who is the President of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey ? " Mr. Hadley asked . " John D. Rockefeller . He has not , however , taken an active interest in its business affairs for several years . He has an office at 28 Broadway , but is in ill-health and seldom goes there . He retains the Presidency at the desire of the stockholders . " " Who is the active head of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OIL It is made up of an aggregation of individuals who are experts in the oil business and who work in Concert . The term ' committee " as applied to the management of the company is a misnomer . " Mr. Archbold acknowledged that he knew H. M. Tilford , and said he thought Mr. Tilford was in control of the oil trade in the Missouri territory . He said // ARCHBOLD TELLS FULLY ' ABOUT STANDARD OIL // that the 2,750 shares of Waters-Pierce stock standing in ' the name of Mr. Van Beuren were the property of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , and were formerly held by the Trustees of the Standard Oil Trust . " Are you familiar with the product of oil in this country ? ' he was asked . " I am . " " What is it ? " " The daily production of crude oil in the ' United States is about 350,000 gallons , and the Standard 011 Company produces about one-seventh of this amount . It probably sells and markets about 70 per cent . of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that wherever there is an oil refinery in the United States owned by the Standard there is a competition refinery . There is much more competition in the oil business than outsiders are aware of . It is particularly strong , of course , in the big oil region of Pennsylvania . " The Standard 's Vice President insisted that the company was not in- control in the new oil fields of Kansas . There were a number of independent producers and refiners there . He was asked about the men at the head of Standard Oil , and said he knew Francis D. Carley , Col. William T. Thompson , Horace D. Hutchins , D. S. Cowles , and H. M. Tilford . Q. ? Who composed the original Board of Directors of the Standard Oil Trust under the agreement ? A. ? John D. Rockefeller , Charles Pratt , William E. Vorden , H. M. Brewster . J. A. Bostwick , 0 . H. Payne , and myself . ? Q. ? Did you know a man named H. P. Tins-. ley ? A  --  I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. ? He was . Q. ? Did you ever hear him designated as " agent " ? A. ? I did not . Q. ? Mr. Tinsley left the Waters-Pierce Company and , went with the Standard Oil Company , did he not ? A. ? I believe so . Q. ? Where is he now ? A. ? lie is either now in Japan or on his way to that country . Q. ? He left about the time this suit was instituted ? A. ? Mr. Tinsley 's departure had nothing to do with this suit . Absolutely nothing . He left some time last Summer . Mr. Archbold said that there were about 125 independent refineries in the United States . He was asked as to the present whereabouts of H. M. Tilford , and said he was in New York . " I saw him Sunday , " he added . " Where is John D. Rockefeller ? " Mr. Hadley demanded . " He is at Lakewood , " calmly replied the witness . " As I explained , his health is not good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buisiness for ten years or more . He is between New York and Lakewood constantly . " When did you see him last ? " " About two weeks ago in New York ; a few days ago in Lakewood . If it is proper for me to say so , he knows nothing about the matters concerned in this suit . His health is such that it imposes quite a care upon him . He has no desire to evade testifying , Mr. Hadley , but he is very much averse to the idea of the notoriety and cartooning which would follow his appearance in public . I am authorized to say for him that if you desire to question him in private he will be very glad to talk to you . I am sure you will find him willing to answer any question you may ask . " " There is only one way and one place to examine witnesses in. this hearing , " said Mr. Hadley decisively , " I will agree to no other mole of procedure . " " Mr. Rockefeller 's health is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stand . - rs he confined to his bed ? " curtly inquired Mr. Hadley . " By no means ; but his general health is not good and has not been for several years . That is why he takes no active interest in the oil business . " Mr. Hadley inquired if Mr. Archbold- was not really the head of the oil end of the Standard and the witness replied that he thought he could say , in all fairness , that he had as much to do with the management as anybody else . When Mr. Archbold was excused an adjournment was taken for luncheon . When the hearing was resumed Wade Hampton , the general auditor of Standard Oil , was called as a witness . He testified at the hearing in January , and at that time refused to answer several questions on the advice of counsel . He was more obliging yesterday . He said that while he was the auditor of the Standard Oil Company he aid . not audit the accounts of the Waters-Pierce Company . He admitted that men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts , but explained that when they were assigned to this duty they were put on the pay rolls of that corporation . After further questioning he owned up to having misled the Attorney General at his previous appearance . It was unintentional , however . " I presumed , " he said , " when I testified the last time , that I was being asked about the auditing of the accounts of the Waters-Pierce Company as formed prior to 1800 . " " Do n't you think your answers then were calculated to mislead ? " questioned MrM . Hadley . " I do not . " replied Mr. Hampton , and went on to explain what he had endeavored then to convey . He told of auditing the books of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana and the Republic Oil Compan y . Mr. Hadley sprung a mine by producing a letter written by Mr. Hampton to H. Clay Pierce , the President of the WatersPierce Oil Company , July 7 , 1890 . This letter introduced " our Mr. Hornberger , " who came , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books of that corporation . Mr. Hampton admitted having written the letter . Other letters of similar nature were shown him . " Do you wish now to correct your former tesimony concerning the auditing of the Waters-Pierce ' books ? " asked Mr. Hadley , significantly . " I have already corrected it , " was the reply . Further correspondence was introduced in evidence showing that Mr. I-lamp n , as auditor of the Standard Oil Company , placed men on the rolls of the WatersPierce Company from time to time . Some of the letters were used to contradict testimony previously given by Mr. Hampton . Harry E. Platt , a former employe of the Standard Oil Company at 26 Broadway . was the last witness examined . He testified as to the supervision exercised by the company over the business of the Waters-Pierce Company , saying that daily reports were made to 26 Broadway as to the cash balances and daily receipts of the Missouri concern . These reports went to the controller . The Standard directed the business of the WatersPierce Company in all details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjournment was taken until this morning . Mr. Hadley told the Special Commissioner prior to adjournment , that he would probably finish the introduction of testimony to-day .
