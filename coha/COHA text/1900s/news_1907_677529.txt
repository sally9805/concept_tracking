txt " The Church and Labor " was discussed at the meeting of the Presbyterian Union in the Hotel Savoy last night . Two of the clergymen had been workingmen , and they criticised the attitude of churches toward labor . The workingman was beginning to look with less hestility upon church organizations , but there was still too much patronizing of the workers in the missions where a $900 man had charge , while the main church was not content with a $6,000 man . The Rev. Henry Sloane Coffin , pastor of the , Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church , having told something of a campaign of noon meetings in large shops , said the Church looked with disfavor upon the working-man after he had been induced to attend by means of such outside agencies . " What impression does the laboring man get , " he asked , " when he comes into some of our churches and sees our pew arrangements upon purely a mone : tary basis . If you pay so much you sit on the centre aisle , a little less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little less and you are at one side or the other of the church . This is democratic ! This is brotherly ' And then when a laboring man has been placed in somebody 's pew , the pew owner says : ' A stranger was taken to my pew to-day . I ! ike to be friendly and all that , but I was very mu. * annoyed because of hit appearance . " There is a great social unrest in this country . The Socialist Party is piling up more votes with every election . What are the churches going to say to this ? They should say first , ' You are restless and so are we . We protest against all unkindness in the relations of society . ' Next they . should offer a programme not of Socialism , but of religion , and finally they should make it apparent that God is back Of this protest and this programme . " The Rev. Charles Stelzle , Chairman of the Church and Labor Committee of the Federation of Churches , said that the laboring man expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' democracy . " The laboring man , " he said , " expects to find the Church taking an active interest in the things that are dear to his heart . Child labor aff'cts nim deeply , and he expects to see ice Church interest itself in it . I was born on the east side and went to work when I was 3 years old . I lived in two rooms with my mother and sister in a tenement . My mother worked in a sweatshop making wrappers for $2 a dozen . So I sympathize with the workingman who sometimes thinks the Church is not working for his interests . " I say frankly that although I am a minister I would cut out the church if it had no thought , for child labor . The workingman expects to find a more prophetic spirit in the church . Too many churches boast of their glorious traditions . The average workingman cares nothing about their glorious traditions . " " ClyilIzation In a large degree , " said the Rev. John , who has been a coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward labor . The laboring people expect the Church to protect them Ir . their Sunday . Yet I am informed that when the bakers of Brooklyn sent out more than E00 letters to clergymen asking that this be done that scarcely more than half a dozen took the trouble to reply . " The Church should have toward the laboring man the attitude of leadership . Nothing damages the labor movement so much as unwise leadership . The Church should be willing to undertake it . If the ideal of this movement is not Christian it will be un-Christian . The laboring man does not want to be treated as a laboring man merely , He wants the Shurcia to remember that he is a free man first and a producer last . " MAY AID IN IRRIGATION. , Investigat3rs Tell of the Fuel Value of Denatured Alcohol . The report of Charles Edward Lucke , Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University , and S. M. Woodward , irrigation engineer , who have been investigating the use of denatured alcohol as a fuel for the Department of Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was distributed yesterday . The Government Director , A C. True , attaches great value to the report . He says : The pumping of water for irrigation and drainage has already assumed great importance , as approximately 600.000 acres of land are irrigated with pumped water . A large part of the unreciaimed arid land can get water In no other way , and as a rule it is so located that fuel of any kind is difficult to get . Alcohol offers In such cases a hope of cheaper fuel , which may . mean the reclamation of large areas , since the land irrigated can produce the fuel to maintain its water supply . At present it does not appear that alcohol will produce power as cheaply as gasoline where the latter can be easily obtained . but as a rule the regions where there will be the greatest demand for pumping are the farthest removed from sources of the common fuels , and , on the other hand . they can produce large quantities of crops from which alcohol can be made . This , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may bring alcohol Into use as the distinctive fuel for pumping water for irrigation . Prof. Lucke says that alcohol should immediately supplant gasoline for use in boats by reason of its greater safety and adaptability to the work . Cleanliness in handling . increased safety in storing , and less offensiveness in the exhaust , are given as reasons why alcohol should supersede gasoline in automobile engines . One of the most important conclusions of the report covers the fact that " any engine on the American market to-day , operating with gasoline or kerosene , can operate with alcohol fuel without any structural change whatever , by means of proper manipulation .
