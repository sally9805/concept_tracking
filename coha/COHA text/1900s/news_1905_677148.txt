txt Contrary to the expectations of either their friends or their opponents in the press , the Liberals are about to take over the government of the United Kingdom pending an election . As they have only a minority in , the House of Commons , the election must come promptly . In many ways the result is a triumph for Mr. CBIAMBRLAIN . It practically places him in the position of leader of the Unionist Party , and it gives him the tactical advantage of the aggressive instead of the defensive in the ensuing canvass . He enjoys also the prestige a having forced the hand of Mr. BALFOUR . That gentleman had asked ' his party to maintain a united front , and while keeping or adopting such views as they preferred on the fiscal question , to go into the campaign under him on the old issue of home rule and such other questions as naturally divide the Conservatives from the Lit , - erals . Mr. CHAMBERLAIN scouted the idea , insisted that nine-tenths of the party were with him on the fiscal question.and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. BALFOUR eould not ' accept any such programme without more mortification than even he is willing to endure , and he resigned . Precisely what will be his part in the pending contest it is not easy now to see , but it can not be more dubious , perplexing , and humiliating than the part he has been playing for the past two years . As we have said , no one expected that the Liberals would accept office in the conditions made for them by Mr. BALFOUR 's resignation , and they would have been fully justified had they refused . Apparently they have felt that victory was so sure , the real issue was so well defined , that it was better to waive all technical rights and I take the appeal to the people as directly and candidly as possible . It is not at all impossible that the influence of , the King has been used to smooth away any obstacles in the way of the promptest and least disturbing settlement of the contest which no longer can be deferred .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
