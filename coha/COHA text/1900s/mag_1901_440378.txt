Loan ROSERERY gives no the Last Phase of Napoleon . Sir Herbert Maxwell gives as a new Life of Wellington , in a notice of which the Quarterly Review , the last place in which we should have expected to see the Tory hero freely handled , gives us what has been paraphrased as the ungilding of the Iron Duke . The two masters of war who met at Waterloo to decide the destinies of Europe were as strongly as possible contrasted in character . Napoleon , a man of extraordinary genius as well as of marvelous fortunes , was as devoid as it was possible for any human being to be of any idea of duty except that of the duty of others to himself , and as regardless as it was possible for any human being to be of the restraints of honor and of truth . Wellington can hardly be said to have been a man of genius , unless consummate good sense deserves that name ; but he never swerved from honor , never swerved from truth , never swerved from that which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a mistaken path ? of duty . The character of each man had , of course , been largely formed by his breeding and his surroundings . Wellington had been brought up at an English public school and among English gentlemen , who , with all their vices , were loyal and feared to lie . Napoleon was a Corsican who had taken service under the Jacobins , then under the Directory . He said himself that lie had imbibed none of the revolutionary enthusiasm . Self - advancement , pure and simple , had been his guiding star . Few would compare Wellington with Napoleon as a general . He can hardly be compared with Marlborough , of whom it was said that he " never fought a battle which he did not win ; never besieged a city which he did not take ; 772 Wellington . never made a movement which was not successful . " Fuentes Oases and Toulouse were doubtful victories , and Wellington besieged Burgos , but did not take it . Yet if it had been Napoleon 's lot , at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their wooden armies , to encounter Wellington or Suwarrow , it seems not certain what the sequel would have been . Wellington probably was not capable of such brilliant combinations as Napoleon , but he was cool , wary , and indomitable . Nor was he wanting in enterprise . It is unjust to say , as niers does , that he was capable only of defensive war . This could hardly be true of the man who forced the passage of the Douro , swooped like an eagle upon Alztrniont at Salamanca , marched through Spain , shattering the French army at Vittoria , forced the barrier of the Pyrenees , and stood victorious in southern France . That war is hell Wellington knew as well as General Sherman . But in justice it must be said that he did what in him lay to keep it within the bounds of humanity . He is Mitt responsible for the outrage which soldiers , maddened by the fury of storm , committed at Badajos and St. Sebastian . Account /mist be taken of the political element in war power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining political supremacy with military command , had , as generals , a perfectly free hand . When Wellington said that Napoleon 's personal presence in Spain would be equal to twenty thousand men , what he meant was , that whereas the marshals were trammeled by superior authority or divided command , Napoleon 's war would be controlled by a single will , which would at the same time be master of all the resources of the state . Wellington had to contend with the attacks of the Opposition in Parliament and of its press , and with the shortcomings of the government , which , though it showed aristocratic tenacity by its per sistence in the war , was feeble in its war policy and in its support of its cum . wanders . His brother , Lord Wellesley , was a support to him . When all was over , Wellington loyally refused to lend his name to aspersions of the govern . ment . He even went so far as to hr. stow upon it high praise . But at the time he had bitter complaints to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vimeiro , the fruits of victory were plucked from his grasp by the safe sea . iorities whom the government had put over the bead of capacity . He had al . ways to walk warily , and could hardly give his genius fair play , because there would have been nothing to sustain him if he had fallen . Napoleon answered for his miscarriages to nobody . After the Russian campaign and Leipsic he re . inained master . Nor had Wellington the power of promoting capacity even among those who served under him . He complained that he could not appoint a cor. portal . The provisional government of Spain , with which it was his hard lot to coaperate , was literally worse than worthless ; its conduct was so imbecile , so fatuous , and so faithless that Wellington 's self-control must have been adamantine , or it would utterly have broken down . Wellington had to see his men starving while the Spanish government had abundance of supplies . The Spanish generals were almost as bad as the government . Their conceit and fractiousness were equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayward act of disobedience , threw away half the fruits of Salamanca . Whatever them was heroic , patriotic , or even respectable in Spanish resistance had its seat , not in the government , the commanders , or the upper classes , but in the people . From that same quarter perhaps regeneration may one day come to Spain . Carlyle 's description of the officers of the British army as valiant cocked hats upon a pole was generally applicable to those whom Wellington had under his 773 cosunsand , though the trials of the war , forcing rapacity to the front , gave him some able lieutenants , such as Crawfurd , llardinge , Pakenham , and Graham . He was himself about the only man in the British army who had received even a smattering of military education . The officers generally , appointed by patronage , were wholly uninstructed , and , moreover ? according to the fashion of the times , largely given to drinking . They often got their commissions when they were very young . A boy went at fourteen from Eton to Waterloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dear mamma , cousin John and I are all right . I never saw anything like it its my life . " It is true Wellington had no right to complain of the results of patronage , for he upheld the system on aristocratic grounds . Macaulay , in his description of the battle of Landes-1 , expatiates on the bodily infirmities of the two generals , William of Orange and Luxemburg , which be deems a striking proof of the extent to which strength of body had been superseded by powers of mind as the qualification for leadership in war . " It is probable , " he says , " that among the one hundred and twenty thousand soldiers who were marshaled round Neerwinden under all the standards of western Europe , the two feeblest in body were the hunchbacked dwarf who urged forward the fiery onset of France , and the asthmatic skeleton who covered the slow retreat of England . " A modern command-or is not required , like Achilles or Ajax , to distinguish himself by his personal prowess ; to wield arms which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other mortal could hurl . The telescope , to the general of to-day , is sword and spear ; his charger is a hack , though sculpture persists in representing its military subjects as bestriding rampant steeds . Still , a modern general must have physical vigor enough to sustain great and protracted exertion , bodily as well as mental . Napoleon , as Lord Rosebery tells us , had physical vigor enough to fight Alvinzi for five days without taking off his boots . His stomach , as the same authority assures us , was capable of enduring the severest trials . BrillatSavarin , in his Physiologic du Gogh has alluded to the unwholesome haste with which the great conqueror swallowed his meals . In vigor Wellington vied with Napoleon . He started , Sir Herbert Maxwell tells us , at seven A. nn. , rode to a place twenty-eight miles distant , here held a review , and was back at the place from which he had started , for dinner , between four and five P. sr . He galloped twenty-six miles and back to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rode seventeen miles in two hours from Freneda to Ciudad Rodrigo , where he dined , gave a ball , and supped ; was in the saddle again at three A. m. ; galloped back to Preneda by six , and was doing business again at 110011 . He rose regularly at six , and wrote till nine ; and after dinner wrote again from nine till twelve . It most be essential to every general , and indeed to every man who is bearing a heavy load of anxious business , to be a good sleeper . Napoleon was a first-rate sleeper ; so was Pitt ; so was Brougham ; so was Mr. Gladstone ; so was Wellington . At Salamanca , Wellington , having given his order for the battle , said to his aide-de-camp : " Watch the French through your glass , Fitzroy . I ant going to take a rest . When they reach that copse near the gap in the hills , wake me . " Then he lay down , and was fast asleep in a minute . In the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laid himself down , put a newspaper over his face , and took a nap . In the Pyrenees , ass officer who had got into a dangerous position with his guns came to the commander in chief for advice , and found him sleeping , with a box for a pillow . Wellington told him he must get out of the scrape as well as he could , and in a moment was asleep again . As if his military exertions were not enough , Wellington kept a pack of hounds in the Peninsula , and keenly pursued the sport , provisions for which are curiously intermingled with the cares of a commander in chief . It is suggested that all the time his mind was at work on his campaign . But if it was , he must have exceeded in his powers of mental abstraction all other men who have followed a fox . It is remarkable that he never was a good rider , and when he rode with hounds in England he was often parted from his saddle . He did not like this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , seeing him thrown , came up to express his hope that he was not hurt . He made the mistake of riding across country in military fashion , with long stirrups . A farmer , one day , seeing him thrown , came up to him and said : " I see yer Grace often parted from yer saddle . You should talc ' yer stirrups up shorter , and ride as I do . " The reply is not recorded . It would be the height of imprudence in a civilian to touch the everlasting controversy about the Waterloo campaign . Wellington was reticent on the subject . It appears to be admitted that lie had reasons for his reticence , and that it has never been thoroughly explained why , when all manifestly depended on the result of a pitched battle , he and Blitcher allowed themselves to be caught apart . All critics seem agreed that if d'Erlon 's corps , on the day of Quatre Bras , instead of being bandied to and fro between Quatre Bras and Ligny , had been brought to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been disastrous to the Allies . It is generally admitted , also , that Wellington would have been in great peril had Napoleon , after Ligny , instead of lingering on the field and talking about Parisian politics , pressed on with the vigor and celerity of his early days . On the other hand , it is a platitude to say that Waterloo would not have been won by Wellington if the Prussians had not come up , since it was in well-founded assurance of Bluchers junction with him that Wellington ac. cepted battle . Wellington was certainly not taken by surprise . He knew that the enemy had passed the Sambre and was advancing . But he admitted that Na. poleon hail " humbugged " him ; that is , probably , that he had been deceived as to Napoleon 's line of advance . Blame is laid on the Prussian General Ziettsl , who , it is said , left Wellington for twelve hours without the intelligence which he ought to have given . In numbers there was no great dis . parity between the two armies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance must always be made for Wellington on that ground . Napo . leon 's seventy-one thousand men were all Frenchmen , and probably as good soldiers as he had ever commanded . Of Wellington 's sixty-seven thousand , twenty-four thousand only were British , and of these a part were raw . The rest was made up of other nationalities , including seventeen thousand Dutch Belgians , who were untrustworthy , and most of whom ran away . An attempt has been made to rehabilitate the Dutch Belgians on the strength of their returns of killed ; but it seems that in the killed they included the missing . Napoleon was vastly superior to Wellington in artillery , having two hundred and forty-six guns , while Wellington had only a hundred and fifty-six . He was greatly superior , also , in cavalry . It is pretty evident that Wellington , at the critical juncture , felt that the situation was grave . Nevertheless he kept his head , remained cool as usual , and when he felt sleepy could take his nap . That on the evening before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive from Blucher an assurance of support , is a story long current , but evidently without foundation . It is " a lie with a circumstance ; " for a part of it is that when , after the long ' tide , Wellington , dismounting from his horse , Copenhagen , gave the horse a slap on the flank , Copenhagen showed his bottom and mettle by kicking at him . Copenhagen ended his days as a discharged veteran , in a paddock at Strathfieldsaye . His portrait hung on the wall in the mansion . A visitor asked Wellington 's heir whether that was not Copenhagen . " Yes , " was the irreverent answer , " d d low-shoul-dered brute . " Copenhagen was a half Arab , and horses of that breed , it is believed , are apt to be low in the shoulder . Wellington freely exposed his person at Waterloo , had narrow escapes , and was forced to take refuge in a square . When a cannon shot took off Lord Fitzroy Somerset 's right arm , he was riding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Uxbridge lost his leg , the cannon shot passed over the withers of Copenhagen . " By God , I 've lost my leg ! " cried Uxbridge . " Have you , by God ? " was the duke 's reply . The finger of Providence , " he afterward said , " was upon me , and I escaped unhurt . " His biographer observes that this is one of the very few cases in which he paid the Almighty the compliment of a pious reference , though he often swore by his name . The late Lady Dukinfield , niece of Crawfurd , Wellington 's commissary gen-eral , and named " la belle Anglaise , " ? justly , as all who see her portrait will own , ? was one of the last two sur-vivors of the ball at Brussels . Her memory remained perfectly clear . Her testimony was conclusive as to the fact that the advance of the French was known at the ball , and that the duke had wished the ball to take place to prevent a stampede such as afterward occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her father , who was a diplo-matist , was dining with the Prince de Conde , when news came ' that the Brit- ish had been totally defeated , and the French were advancing on Brussels . The prince at once left the table , and ordered his carriage . Lady Dukinfield 's father hurried her to their lodgings , and ordered his . But the horses had been stolen . Later in the day they got horses , and were on their road to Ghent when authentic news arrived of the British victory . The road , Lady Dukinfield said , was crowded with fugitives . The scare is commonly ascribed to the rush into Brussels of Dutch- Belgian runaways from the field . Another account is that a portion of d'Erlon 's corps , having been taken prisoners early in the day , were passed to the British rear , and being seen in their French uniforms on the Brussels road , were supposed to have carried the British position . It never occurred to the writer to ask Lady Dukinfield where the ball had taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the subject . Since her death there has been a controversy on the question . Some have supposed that it was held in a great loft over a coach house . But if this had been the case , Byron , who must have known , could hardly have made " Brunswick 's fated chieftain " sit " within a windowed niche of that high hall , " ? a phrase inapplicable to a. loft over a coach house . As a statesman , Wellington is generally held to have been a failure , and he is cited ' as a notable example of the unfitness of camp training for political life . Curiously enough , he is the only military Prime Minister that England , an old war power , has ever had , for Stanhope , though a soldier , was not distinguished in war ; while in the United States , an industrial community , military distinction has made several Presidents , and the other day was not far from putting Admiral Dewey , without any civil qualification , at the head of the state . Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his earlier days he had sat in 776 Wellington . Parliament and had been Irish Secretary . In the Peninsula he had proved himself a first-rate administrator and man of business , and had shown great diplomatic skill and temper in his dealings with the Spanish and Portuguese governments . More than this , as a European statesman he had played a leading part in the resettlement of Europe after the overthrow of Napoleon , and had enjoyed in a supreme degree the confidence of the allied sovereigns , who continued to pay the utmost deference to his judgment . ' flue wisdom of his European policy , which was undoubtedly Bansbonist and Tory , is a different question . If lie erred , as the sequel certainly showed that he did , he erred not only with Metternich and Pozzo di forgo , but with Talleyrand . Nor was he the most reactionary of that conclave . His good sense penetrated their hypocrisy and repelled their chimeras . When , under the inspiration of the sentimental Czar , they proposed to reorganize the world on Christian principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distinct , When victory brought lion into the South of France , he steadfastly refused to declare for the Bourbons , or to accept any advances of their party , before the question of resettlement had been determined by the Allies . He never gave way to military ambition , or did anything to inflame the military spirit . His foreign policy as a minister was pacific , and he strongly opposed the fatal Afghan war . Sonic time before his acceptance of the premiership , he had said that he would be mad if he ever did accept it , ? a declaration which , when he bad become Premier , his adversaries ( lid not allow him to forget . But this so-as little more than an exaggerated disclaimer of ambitious intentions at the thee . His fame as well as his popularity would probably have gained if he had never left the Horse Guards for Downing Street . He Wan by no means inclines ! to sabre sway ; Corn Laws , clothing his submission in his usual phrase , that the question was , not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen 's government was to be carried on . " Though a ready writer , the duke was eat a ready speaker , mid in debate was much beholden to the reporters . Those who have little command of language are It to say sometimes less , sometimes more , than they mean . Wellington probably said more than he meant when , at a critical juncture of the question of parliamentary reform , the true policy of his party being the introduction of it moderate measure , he , excited in debate , vehemently declared that the constitution was as perfect as the wit of men could make it ; that if he were called upon to frame a constitution , that was the constitution which he would frame ; and that lie would oppose to the uttermost any sort of change . He did not himself understand the sensation which he had made , and when he sat down asked Lord Aberdeen what it meant . Lord Aberdeen replied with words and a gesture of despair . This , however , must be said with regard to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events , in his antiquated way , look into the heart of the matter . He asked how , when the sweeping change had been made , the Queen 's government was to be carried on . That was a question with which even a political philosopher like Macaulay forgot to deal , while he proved with brilliant lucidity that it was absurd to give representatives to Gatton and Old Sarum when they were denied to Manchester and Birmingham . Wellington 's resistance to Catholic Emancipation did not arise from religions bigotry ; it was purely political . There was therefore no violation of conscience in his concession . Nor can he be truly said to have been swayed by fear ; that was not his weak point . He must have known that he had the means of physical resistance . But be saw that the state of things could not last , and , like a nom of sense , gave way . AS Irish Secretary , he had deplored the divided state of Ireland , and had dwelt strongly on the necessity for union of parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union was justice . Though devoted to the service of the crown , which may be said almost to have been his religion , the duke was no courtier . Ho thoroughly despised George IV. , whose unveracity must have been particularly hateful to him . The story Was current that the King , in his last years , became the dupe of his own inventive imagination so far as to fancy that he had commanded a regiment at Waterloo , and used to appeal to the duke for confirmation ; and that the duke used to reply , " So your Majesty has often told me . " The belief that Canning had been slyly insinuating himself into the good graces of George IV. , with a view to the premiership , was probably the main cause of Wellington 's quarrel with him . The duke showed himself on this occasion , as he too often did , captious and suspicious . It must be owned , on the other hand , that in Canning there was , with all his brilliant qualities and titles to admiration , a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duke , who might have said with Achilles that he hated like hell the man who tittered one thing , and had another in his mind . From Peel , also , Wellington was for some time estranged , though there was no quarrel . Both were somewhat touchy and suspicious . There was , however , a perfect reconciliation in the end . Wellington 's hearty acceptanee of Peel as a leader , and loyal cooperation with hint , after having been Premier himself , are a fine trait in his character . The continuance of his military supremacy would no doubt help to reconcile him to his political subordination . 778 Wellington . A high aristocrat , in a certain sense , Wellington was , but it was not as a duke ; it was as an English gentleman , a member of that social caste . " More than all 1 ant an English gentleman , " was his winding up of his list of titles to consideration , when he suspected an affront . The Midge and the religious obligation of that caste , when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Canning fought Castlereagh ; and Wellington , when his honor seemed to be questioned by Winehelsea called him out . But on the last occasion dueling , at least between people of that rank , was nearly out of date . The unpopularity caused by the duke 's resistance to parliamentary reform soon passed away , when his good sense had led him to accept the change and make the best of the new system . He became once more a national idol . Only the iron shutters which had been put up at Apsley House , to prevent the windows from being broken by the mob , remained monuments of former unpleasantness , and mute protests on the duke 's part against popular injustice . Looking out from the windows of Apsley House , he could behold his equestrian statue surmounting the arch at the top of Constitution Hill . A Frenchman seeing that statue might have felt that Waterloo was avenged . Wellington was wholly devoid of literary interests and sympathies . There has seldom been a more ridiculous piece of servility than that of which the Tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To mark the absurdity , at his inauguration he put on his academical cap wrong side before , and made false quantities in reading his Latin speech . He paid the penalty of his incongruous elevation by being , to use his own phrase , " much exposed to literary men , " who pelted him with their dedications and petitions . He was equally devoid of taste . The church at Strathfieldsaye , which is in the park , had been put up by the former owner , Lord Rivers . It was a strange cruel . form structure , in a highly uneceleshistical style , surmounted by a cupola . The duke 's nephew , Gerald Wellesley , was the rector . Being a man of ecclesiastical tastes , he had often begged the duke to put up something more like a church ; but the duke had always refused . At last , one day , at luncheon , after service , the duke said : " Gerald , I begin to think you are right . That building does not look like a church . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a steeple upon it . " Gerald recurred no more to the subject , Once , at least , Wellington said a good thing . When he first went to the court of Louis XVIII. , the French marshals whom he had defeated turned their backs upon him . The King apologized for their rudeness . " Never mind , your Majesty , " replied Wellington ; " they have got into the habit , and they ca n't get out of it . " As a writer , however , the duke was , in his own line , excellent . A selection of his papers may be read with advantage , not by military men alone . They bring you into contact with a strong charac ? ter , thoroughly upright and veracious , a clear intelligence , and firmness of purpose , all expressing themselves in a calm but vigorous style . The quantity which he wrote in lois ? cellaneous correspondence and otherwise , we are told by Sir Herbert Maxwell , was astounding . Mr. Croker haying sent him a number of pamphlets on foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duke replied on sixty sides of large letter paper . It is computed that Its used up hundredweights of gilt-edged letter and note paper , the drafts being duly retained , indorsed , and filed , usually in his own handwriting . To an unknown quack who sent him a box of salves he replies ? SIR , ? I have received your letter and the box of salves , etc. , which you have // to inform him in what manner it is to be returned to Edinburgh . He gives notice . that if he does not receive an answer by return of post , the box and its contents will be thrown into the fire . He will not allow things to be sent to his house without his previous consent . It is difficult to understand bow a powerful mind can have stooped to such trivialities . But the most astonishing thing of all is the correspondence with Miss Jenkins . Miss Jenkins was a young lady , fashionably educated , beautiful , emotional , and a religious zealot . Having converted a murderer , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all the duke . The result was a correspondence , alternating with interviews , of a most absurd and twaddling kind , which lasted for seventeen years . Doubts have naturally been raised as to the authenticity of the letters ; but Sir Herbert Maxwell is satisfied the letters are authentic . As the duke was far from religious , the only explanation suggested is amatory , and lie was certainly weak on that side . Fail-ing intellect must also surely have played WALMER CASTLE , 3rd November , 1849. a part . prohibited without permission . that he gave large sums in charity , and went to church wherever his presence could operate as an example , ? never being absent from divine service at Walther , or at Strathlicldsaye , or in any place in the country where his presence or absence could be observed . The last place at which the present writer saw Idol was at the dour of Strathfieldsaye church , after service . One of the party told him of the death of an old general who had served Ivith him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that death had knocked at his own door . Then he cheered up , said , " Alt ! He was a very old man , " put his arm in that of Lady Douro , and stumped away with an air of physical reassurance . A religious enthusiast he was far enough from being . Recommending his old army chaplain for preferment , he said that Methodism hash more than once broken out in his army , but , by the judicious exertions of his chaplain , had been suppressed . He did not know how Methodists had fought at Fontenoy . The duke had no sentiment and little affection . As a husband and father he was cold . His marriage had been one of honor . As a youth , in Ireland , he had won the heart of a very pretty but frivolous girl . After twelve years of absence abroad , he came back to find her , as he was assured by a matchmaking lady , waiting for him , though site had rejected him before , and to renew the offer of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallpox seems not to have been the fact ; but it was the sort of beauty that would be greatly marred by years . As much affection as he could feel for anybody he felt for his daughter-in-law , Lady Douro . Female connections he had , and this is a part of his life over which biographers throw a veil . Allowance must be made for the habits of the eighteenth century , in which his notions had been formed . ' Pie most unamiable feature of his character , and the most aristocratic in the worst sense , was his want of feeling for the soldiers to whom he owed so much . He would even speak of them in almost brutal tents , as a pack of vagabonds who cared for nothing but drink , and could be kept in order only by the fear of corporal punishment . They naturally , while they thoroughly trusted him , and hailed the appearance of his hooked nose as a pledge of victory , loved him not . Daring his long reign at the Horse Guards he did little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood up obstinately till the last for the brutal and degrading punishment of the lash , which was carries ! to an extent incredibly cruel , and which experience has since shown to have been totally needless . He failed to see that the practice must deter decent men from enlisting . In his parsimony of medals and military decorations there may have been more reason . He was laughed at for saying that you would have every fellow trying to distinguish himself . But what he meant was sensible enough : it was that , in striving after individual distinction , men would cease to be faithful to the common plan . There were , in fact , instances of this , if we were not misinformed , in the American Civil War . There was something , at all events , to be said for parsimony , against the prodigality which at present prevails . Medals are now solicited and given for a campaign without an enemy , and even for a defeat in a petty skirmish . Wellington 's personal tastes and habits , like those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for show or pomp of any kind . Instead of building a counterpart of Blenheim , for which money had been voted , he bought and improved Strathfieldsaye , a common country gentleman 's house . In his diet be was very abstemious , even to the injury , it appears , of his health . He of course kept a first-rate French cook for his guests . The cook , it was said , one day suddenly resigned . The duke , in as- // tonishment , asked the reason . Was his salary insufficient ? ? No , my salary is very handsome . But I am not appreciated . I cook your dinner myself , ? a dinner tit for a king . You say nothing . I go out and leave the undercook to cook your dinner . He gives you a dinner fit for a pig . You say nothing . I am not appreciated . I must go . " The duke punctually fulfilled every duty of life , that of country gentleman among the rest . When , business per-witting , be came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentry , mud showed himself to his people . Familiar to the present writer , who lived in the next parish , is the figure of the F. M. , with a little cape over his shoulders , riding about , making his calls and leaving his cards of ample size . As a landlord , he was not only upright , but generous in his dealings . Being told that he could buy a farm which jutted into his domain , and which he had desired , at a low price , in consequence of the pecuniary embarrassments of the owner , lie answered that he did not want to take advantage of any man 's pecuniary embarrassments , and directed that a fair price should be given for the farm . At the time of the railway mania , he did not , like too many landowning members of Parliament , notably of the House of Lords , use his parliamentary influence to extort compensation for damage . He did exact a condition , which was that there should be no station within four miles of his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , who lost their stage , but it was not blackmail . His last years as commander in chief were a senile autocracy which it would have been thought profane to disturb , though it was fatal to improvement , and had partly to answer for the breakdown in the Crimean Vur . When a regiment was going out to fight Kaffirs in the bush , he met the proposal to arm it with the new rifles by saying that he had done well enough with Brown Bess at Waterloo . Ile did not like to feel that he was growing old . His feinting stud was still kept up at Strathtieldsaye , and nobody was allowed to ride the horses but himself . When the hounds met at his place , as they did when he entertained the judges , he got upon a limiter and rode to cover . He was offended when , on account of his age , his name was omitted from the royal hunting parties . Though he had been long declining , his death made a profound sensation . He was buried with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment . Many thought that the huge catafalque was less suitable for a hero than a gun carriage . A. P. Stanley , whose taste for the moral and historical picturesque was supreme , said that the only part of the ceremony which greatly touched him was the last wave of the ' Annie on the cocked bat , as the coffin , on which the hat lay , was lowered into the vault . It seemed to wave the farewell of a world .
