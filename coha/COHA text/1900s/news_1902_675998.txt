txt The Ways and Means Committee is getting ready to do something with thlp Cuban relief question . It Is understood that just as soon as Mr. Grosvenor gets back to Washington the committee will be- called together and asked to order a favorable report on the Payne bill , giving the Cubans 20 per cent . off the tariff rates for a year and ten months . Mr. Payne has secured the requisite support to warrant this course unless he is greatly mistaken . He lacked one vote this morning , and is said to have obtained it by bringing to terms Mr. Babcock of Wisconsin . When the day opened Mr. Payne and Mr. Dalzell , the members of the committee Who are engineering the fight in committee for the Payne bill , were in great distress . They did not feel sure they could get the bill out of the committee , without having an amendment added to ? it providing for wiping dut the differential on refined sugar . As the story goes , the beet sugar men told the President a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . reduction proposed in the Payne bill if they ? could secure the abolition of the differential . " I do not see any objection to that , " the President is reported to have remarked . The beet sugar men left the White House feeling very happy , and it was not long before the story of their talk with the President was in wide circulation . The story did not please the Houseceders , and last night Messrs . Dalzell andenderson , accompanied by Mr. Long of Kansas , waited on the President for the purpose of persuading him that he ought to have some objections to the movement against ' the differential . There always had been a differential and there always should be one . There is no exact information as to the effect the House leaders produced on the President . But this morning Me . Payne began bright and early to fight for the ancient and honorable institution . But do his best , he could not count enough votes on his side . There was lacking one vote . He decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is committed to the scheme of Cuban relief . He explained to Mr. McClellan how he proposed to proceed . As Chairman of the committee he would decide that any proposed amendment abolishing the differential was not germane to the pending bill . He expected an appeal from this ruling , and he asked Mr. McClellan to agree to join the eight Republicans who would vote to sustain the Chair 's rulings , and thus save the day for the plain reciprocity measure . It is said Mr. Payne was quite upset when Mr. McClellan told him he agreed with the President that there would , - be no objection to cutting the differential out of the sugar schedule . Several hours elapsed before it was given out that Mr. Babcock would supply the missing vote . Nobody to-night seems to doubt that Mr. Babcock has yielded , and the only . question now seems to be as to the manner In : w.hibh he was led to surrender . When %Mr . Babcock almost succeeded in ? getting his iron and steel reduction bill added to the War Revenue bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do 1101 ... sloalfa-out , foriamomr , selfe- ! - .. Mr. Payne said : go up into . your State and cut the duty off lumber . " Mr. - Babcock replied that Mr Payne could " Go up into Wisconsin and - be. d ? d. " but he seemed to have repented of his defiant mood when the War Revenue bill was brought into the House and emphatically , if not gracefully , declined to join the Democrats in an effort to secure consideration of his iron and steel bill . Whether Mr. Payne has renewed his threat or made some other threat outsiders do not know , but the general . belief is that Mr. Babcock has been brought into line , and that he will stay in line . In the House Speaker Henderson , according to the programme , will rule out amendments to the bill , and the House leaders hope to send the bill to the Senate unimpaired and unadorned . Over in theaSenate , it is figured , there will-be some amending of the bill . It is supposed the Senate will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of 20 per cent . In conference there likely would be another Change , and , according to a popular forecast , tha outcome would be a twenty-five-per-cent reduction . It is hard to decide what the beet - sugar people would expect to gain by cutting off tile differential . Some of them say it would ruin the Sugar Trust , inasmuch as it would open the American market to German refined sugar . Asked for his judgment on this proposition a member of the House . who has studied the sugar question carefully , said : " The present differential is about oneeighth of a cent per pound . The total amount of sugar refined during the past year was about 4.800.000.000 pounds . It was testified before the Ways and Means Committee that of the total the American Sugar Refining Company refines about twothirds and the independent refineries , ten in number . of which three are controlled by the same people , refined about onethird . Of the total amount refined last year the AmericariaSugar Refining Company refined 3.200.000,000 pounds . Assuming that the refiners got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential would mean a loss in profit to them of 3.200,000.000 times .125 cent , or 4.000.000 . The total capital of the American Sugar Refining Company is $100,000 , - 000 , of which $711,000,000 is water and $:10 , - 000.000 cash paid in . Dividends have been from 6 to 12 per cent , on the total capital , an ' avera-zre of 9 per cent . on $100.000.000 , or S9.000.000. or 30 per cent . on $30.000,000 . Assuming that the loss of $4.000.000 must be charged to dividend account , the dividends will still be $5,000,000. or 5 per cent . on 5100.000.000 , or over 16 per cent . on $30 , - 000.000 . " There are some persons who think the beet sugar men proposed- the movement against the differential for the sole purpose of complicating the situation , assuming that the American Sugar Refining Company . if its-interests should be threatened , might come into the fight in a way to help beet sugar . The theory is that if the differential amendment should be put on the bill the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to get rid of the part attacking the differential . PRESIDENT PALMA PLEASED . Chosen Head of Cuban Republic Confident that Congress Will Grant Reduction of Tax on Sugar . Gen. Tamas Estrada Palma , Presidentelect of the Cuban Republic , returned to this city early yesterday morning from Waghington . He expressed himself as perfectly satisfied with the change in the date of his inauguration from May 1 to May 20 . He was particularly pleased , as lie raid all Cubans would be . over the decision of the United States not to establish a naval station at Havana . as was originally intended . ? ? The Cubans believe , " he said , " that only their flag should fly over the capital , " The President-elect has fought vigorously and unceasingly for a tariff reduction on Cuban sugar . and hopes now for even an increase of the 20 per cent . reduction recommended by the Ways and Means Committee . The United States . " said Gen. Palma , ?
