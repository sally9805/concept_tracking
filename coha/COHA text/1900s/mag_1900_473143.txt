IN a previous paper I discussed the re-sults of psychical research up to the date of Dr. Richard Hodgson 's last report upon what is known as the Piper case . Dr. Hodgson is the secretary of the American branch of the Society for Psychical Research , and after a most painstaking iii vestigation announced his conversion to the hypothesis that the evidence was sufficient to justify the belief in a future life . T propose now to give a brief account of my experiments in the same field , which confirm Dr. Hodgson 's conclusion . The experiments are the subject of a report to the above-named society . Fm ' years Mrs. Piper has been relieved of all responsibility for the scientific value of the phenomena obtained through her trance . This has been assumed by Dr. Hodgson or the sitters , as the case may be . All arrangements for the sittings are made through Dr. Hodgson , who conceals from Mrs. Piper all knowledge of the sitter 's identity in an cases where scientific importance attaches to the results . Mrs. Piper simply has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American secretary . It may be interesting also to learn that the arrangements for specific sittings are made not with Mrs. Piper in her normal state , but with the trance personalities while she is in the " trance . " There are absolutely no physical trappings or mechanical apparatus necessary for the experiment except a writing-pad and pencil , furnished by the sitter himself . Mrs. Piper 's personality and opinions are completely excluded from consideration in the estimation . of the importance of the phenomena . She does not know , after recovery from the " trance , " what she has written during it ; and it is kept from her knowledge until published . The experimenter thus assumes the responsibility for the value of the results , The messages are written by Mrs. Piper 's hand while she is in a completely unconscious state , with her head resting on a pillow on a table . All questions and remarks addressed to the " communicators " are spoken slowly and distinctly to the hand , and are recorded in their proper place and chronological order with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of everything that occurs is effected . To conceal my own identity I wore a mask covering the whole of my face . I also concealed my voice from Mrs. Piper 's hearing , and never touched her during the seventeen sittings , so that identification and muscular suggestion were completely excluded . I was equally careful during the writing of the " messages " to avoid questions of a suggestive sort . The history of the case is briefly as follows : The original " control " claimed to be a discarnate spirit by the name of Dr. Phinuit Seliville . But he failed to prove his identity . During his regime , so to speak , a friend of Dr , Hodgson , who is called George Pelham in the last report , died in New York , and appeared through Mrs. Piper to keep a promise made to Dr. Hodgson to identify himself after death if possible . After Dr. Hodgson was satisfied that his identity was established , he asked this George Pelham to hunt up Stainton Moses , who had been a former medium in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thought that Mr. Moses might prove a good communicator . He was found , but expectations entertained regarding him were disappointed . But through him De . Hodgson asked for his old " guides " or " controls , " who had called themselves in England by the assumed names Imperator , Rector , Doctor , and Prudens . They appeared under the direction of Stainton Moses , and after Dr. Phinuit could be induced to surrender the field to them , they took charge , as it were , and there has been a distinct improvement in every feature of the case since their assumption of power . They represent themselves as a little band of disearnate spirits endeavoring to reveal a future life to man . Whether they can be accepted as what they claim to be depends upon the success of proving the personal identity of some deceased person . The mode of the " communications " is somewhat as follows : Mrs. Piper goes into a " trance " ? some state of iusensibility and unconsciousness of whose nature we know little or nothing ? her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pencil is placed in her fingers , and the communicatious " are written out on a pad provided by the sitter . Mrs , Piper is not touched in the mean time , so that muscular suggestion is excluded , from . consideration , The sitter simply remains in silence until he finds it necessary to ask a question , which is addressed to the medium 's hand . In the mean time , and without any suggestion or question , all sorts of " messages , " corn-prising incidents in the previous life of the " communicator , " may be written down , all unknown to Mrs. Piper , and often unknown to the sitter , but verified afterward among those at a distance whom he may interrogate . To many these facts will seem trivial , but their value consists in that fact . The first problem for the psychical researcher is the personal identity of the alleged discarnate spirit , and only the most trivial incidents imaginable can make that certain . Generalities , profound philosophy , poetic description , and similar phenomena would only condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that living , intelligent men choose trivial incidents to prove their identity , and that the choice of them does not serve as an index of their charaCter or conditions of life and conduct . The confusion and paucity of coincidental material in my first sitting were so noticeable that I was not impressed with it at the time . I learned afterward that there were several pertinent and true things in it that were unknown to me when obtained , Toward the close of it there were several interesting facts that suggested the importance of the " communications , " They were the purported messages from a brother Charles , who gave his name and relationship to me , mentioned typhoid fever as the sickness that took his life , this being wrong , and then said that he " had a very bad throat which took him out . " I learned from an aunt that this was true . I asked when he died , and the answer was given : " In the winter . I remember seeing it snow . " This was correct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the morning of his death . I then asked what had caused his death ; and no answer was given to my question until the third sitting , when this Charles appeared and asked me if " scarlet fever was a bad thing to have in the body . " Scarlet fever was the cause of his death . At the opening of the second sitting I was at once addressed by the name that I had always been called by my father after 1877 , and the " communicator soon indicated that he was my father , though neither the name nor the relationship was distinctly stated until the close of the sitting . But very early the " communicator " referred to a conversation that we had had on this subject in 1895 , one year before his deatli , and stated that I was very doubtful about communication on that occasion , that he thought it would not be all " hallucination , but a reality , " and . that he " was not so far wrong , after all . " I was very sceptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of psychical research as hallucinations . My father had astonished me on the occasion because he showed so receptive a mind toward the whole subject , as he was especially strict in his orthodoxy , and did not know enough of " spiritualism " to despise it . In the fourth sitting he returned to the subject , and asked me if I remembered our talk on Swedenborg and his doctrine of the spiritual sense . I did not remember this , and did not believe that he had talked about that person , as I felt certain my father knew nothing of him , his library be ing made up of books that eschewed Swedenborg 's ideas very decidedly . But inquiry showed that we had talked about this very man and his ideas . This my step-mother especially remembered , as she had asked him after my departure about Swedenborg . Recurring to it again at a later sitting , he said : " Shut out the thought theory , James . I went on theorizing all my life , and what did I gain by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a God , an all-wise and omnipotent God , who is our guide , and if we follow the best within us , we will know more of Him . Now speaking of Swedenborg , what does it matter whether his teachings were right or wrong , so long as we are individually and ourselves here ? " At a still later sitting he brought the subject up again and said : " Well , now , I feel satisfied that you are at least pulling with my push , and that is all I can ask of you . I remember perfectly well what my own theories were concerning this life , and my too often expressing doubts about it . I do indeed ; but I think I was moored in the thought that I should live somewhere , and not die as a vegetable . Do you remember our conversations on this subject ? " I asked here if he remembered when this was , and the reply came that it was on my last visit , which was true . I then asked what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lecture in Indianapolis would be mentioned , But the reply was , " Yes ; I believe you had been experimenting on the subject , and I remember of your telling me something about hypnotism . " He immediately asked , " And what did you tell me about some kind of manifestations which you were in doubt about ? " I replied that it was apparitions near the point of death and the response made was , " Oh yes , I recall it very well ; and you told me about a young woman who had had some experiences and dreams which interested . me very much , but you were doubtful about life after so-called death . " Now the facts are that in that conversation I put forward telepathy , " the thought theory , " to explain away the facts that I told him about , not being satisfied with the spiritistic view . It is true that my father did a great deal of theorizing in his life within the limits of his theology which he made desperate efforts to render intelligible . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a future life . Nor do any of his relatives . But if the mistake here is the same as was made a few minutes later , and then spontaneously corrected to the right statement of facts , it was intended to refer to my doubts on the matter . It was correct also that 1 had been experimenting on the subject at the time , and I talked to him about hypnotism . Ile brought the subject up , having heard of some strange public performances in the town . I discussed it at some length , and tried to hypnotize my brother at the time , but failed . much to the disappointment of my father . I also narrated to him an experiment with a lady that I had performed in connection with a dream of hers . She had dreamed of seeing a strange person in a coffin some six hundied miles distant , with her own sister sitting by . A few days later the lady mceived a letter from this sister telling her of the dangerous illness of a girl in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arelapse of pneumonia from which she was suffering . I sent and obtained , unknown to the lady here in New York ( this lady being the wife of an orthodox minister and utterly despising spiritualism ) , a photograph of the girl who was sick , and put it among six others as nearly like it as it was possible to secure : and without having been told my object , or allowed to see my preparations beforehand , the lady instantly identified the right face as the girl she had seen in tier dream , though her husband and myself tried to change her mind to another and false picture . The single coincidence . of course , has no scientific value but the reader can understand how such a fact would impress my Father when I told it to him , as he was not a scientific man . I also discussed the subject of apparitions or hallticinations near the point of death , and one in my step-mother 's family was told me at the time as a result of the discussion . It was in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and explained them away as possibly hallucinations pure and simple . But having recalled the subject here at the sittings , my father went on to tell me of one that my uncle , who had died three weeks before my first sitting and six months before the one going on , had before his death , and interpreted at once as a notification of his sudden demise . But I could not verify this statement . In order to test the theory of telepathy , I asked at one of my sittings the question , " What was the trouble when you passed out ? " The question was badly expressed , but I wished both to adopt the spiritistic lingo for the amanuensis , and to make the inquiry as vague as possible and in as few words as it could he put . I knew that my father thought his disease was catarrh , but we thought it was probably cancer of the larynx . If I had gotten the latter name , or something like it , telepathy was to be presumed , while the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got for my first answer an expression of surprise that I had implied that there was any trouble between myself and my father , lie remarking that he thought we were always very congenial , which was true . But I corrected the misapprehension by saying that I meant " sickness . " This was at once taken up , and amidst much confusion all the main physical symptoms attending his death were given , with two very significant questions and one important statement of fact , I shall not detail them here , for lack of space , as they did not involve the answer to the question with which I started out . But they did show the right interpretation of my question as it was expressed . I then tried the query whether I had ever had the same disease , and though my question practically implied an affirmative answer , which was given , there was spontaneously added , without suggestion from me , " a long time ago . " This was true , but I got no nearer the correct answer at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of association for calling out what I wanted , and also getting another evidential fact at the same time . Hence I asked , " What medicine did I get for you in New York ? " An attempt was made to give it , but I refused to recognize it as correct , since the writing was not clear enough to evade the accusation of an illusion of apperception in it . The nest day he returned to the subject voluntarily , and gave hyomei as the medicine . A few minutes later he added strychnine , with the implication that he was taking it with the hyomei . Hyomei was the correct answer to my question , but I got him an strychnine . I ascertained , however , from three of the family at home that he was taking strychnine with the hyomei . This I did not know myself , though it must be said for the believer of telepathy that I found in a letter written to me two months before his death the statement that he was taking arsenic and strychnine with the hyomei . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morphine was given . Inquiry , however , showed that he never took morphine . A large number of smaller incidents were given in this first series of sittings , which , though evidential , are not so complex as those already mentioned . For instance , direct indications of the recent death of two uncles were given , and appropriate expressions of consolation sent to his two sisters , the widows of the two uncles . Their names were given , and those of three living brothers in appropriate connections . Many characteristic modes of expression known only to members of the family or relations appeared spontaneously in their natural places . Allusion was made to the place where he left his spectacles when he died , to his books , to a cap knit for him by my stepmother , and to a brown-handled knife with which he used to pick out his fingernails . The last two items were wholly unknown to me . Dr. Richard Hodgson then held five sittings on my behalf while I remained in New York . The purpose of this was to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true incidents were communicated to Dr. Hodgson at these sittings , many of which were as unknown to me as to him . Among such were allusion to a paper-cutter , trouble with the left eye , a skull-cap , a mark near the ear , and a thin morning coat ? all trivial inci ? dents , but well calculated to establish personal identity , There were , however , a number of much more complex and important incidents which may be briefly outlined . In one of the five sittings my father ( to use the spiritistic lingo ) carried on an intelligent conversation with Dr. Hodgson regarding the latter 's father , who was a Wesleyan Methodist , and finally remarked : " I can preach very well myself . Ask my son if this is not so . ? I recall many things that I would gladly have altered if I had seen them as clearly as I do now . " After excusing himself from further communications he bade Dr. Hodgson good - by , with the closing remark : " Listen . This is passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thee . Hyslop . " When I saw this quotation from the well-known hymn , I recognized one of the strongest evidences imaginable against personal identity , and looked at the whole passage as an admirable instance of secondary personality influenced by the suggestions latent , in the previous talk about Wesleyanism , though the allusion to preaching was pertinent to my father 's habits when we had no church services . My father was a severely orthodox believer , so much so that he was opposed to all hymn - singing and instrumental music in worship of any kind . He would not tolerate hymn singing of any kind in religious services . But I was explain-mg to my step-mother the difficulties of the communications and how this special instance told strongly against personal identity , and she agreed with me emphatically , but added , innocently , that my father had a special dislike to this very hymn , and used often to express his surprise that orthodox people could sing a Unitarian hymn . The fact thus turned out to be decidedly in favor of identity , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have preaching of our own , my father , who would not allow us to attend the services of any other denomination , would take the Bible and comment upon a chapter of it much as the regular minister did . The pertinence of the allusiOn to the fact that he would have gladly changed things had he seen them as clearly as now is evident of itself , though it is not proof of identity . In the next sitting he alluded to the rough roads and country on the way to church . This was correct , and he immediately mentioned the State in which he had lived most of his life , namely , Ohio , and mentioned the fact that he had talked to the principal of the ( high ) school about one of my brothers , specifying this brother 's name . In the same connection he alluded to some anxieties regarding this brother that he said were common to himself , an aunt whom lie mentioned by name , and myself , whom he also indicated . In fact , be had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? twenty years regarding this brother , my aunt , and myself . Following this was an allusion to his having moved out ' West and having been separated from me for some time . Both statements were true , and they were connected with the mention of the skull-cap , and the name of its maker , which was not quite right . There is another incident , having much greater complexity than any that I have mentioned , and which was completed at my later personal sittings . It refers to two canes which my father had . He mentioned a curved-handled cane on which lie had carved his initials , and soon afterward gave a careful description of movements that I finally identified , on inquiry , with the breaking of one of them by prying . But on my first inquiry I found that he had never carved his initials on any cane . As I knew , however , that I had given him a curvedhandled cane , and that we children had earlier given him a gold-headed cane on which his in i tints were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion of the two canes by association . I resolved , therefore , to test my conjecture in an indirect way . I had given him the curved-handled cane during the political campaign in which the gold standard was the issue . On ' the cane was the representation of a " gold bug . " On his deathbed my father was visited by my cousin and his wife , and on being asked by my cousin what his politics were , my father replied simply by showing my cousin the " gold bug " on the cane . I therefore asked , with the hope that association might spontaneously connect the incident with previous messages , whether my father recalled shaking a walking-stick at my cousin , naming him . The answer came promptly , and after some excitement in the hand that was doing the writing : " Yes , I do , and I was never more excited in my life , and I was right , too . " I ascertained from my cousin 's wife in the West that my father became so excited in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband had to leave the bedside for fear he would have a spasm of the larynx , in which he was likely M collapse . I then asked who had given him that cane , and the hand , after stopping the writing , reached up and tapped me on the temple for perhaps half a minute , and then pointed to Dr. Hodgson and wrote : " You did , and I mentioned ' it to him before . " This was in June , and be had mentioned the cane to Dr. Hodgson in February . I then asked what was on the cane , intending to see ' if any allusion would be made to the " gold bug , " The first answer was , " I think it was the little top . " The hand shook as in dissent , and wrote the word " ring , " amid dissenting violently again , drew the lines for a beetle or " gold bug . " Inquiry in the West showed what I had wholly forgotten , namely , that my father bad another eurved-handled cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which had been broken by some prying . It bad then been mended by a tin ring nailed around it . It is apparent , then , that there was some confusion in regard to the three canes , but that there are traces of all of them in the messages , with decided evidential incidents regarding the " gold bag " cane . Another illustration in my later series of sittings occurred in a way to exhibit the natural play of association , My father alluded to the organ which we had at home , and indicated that he had wished my sister to learn to sing . This was true , and he added he was trying to mention incidents that had occurred when I was a member of the family circle . All at once he broke out with the sudden recollection " Oh yes ! Do you remember the flute that Will used to play ? " Noticing his own mistake , the message was corrected to " fiddle . " By this time I saw what was intended , and remarked to the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick as a flash came the reply , " Yes ; I think I am thinking of George " ; and then , after starting to give the word " violin , " the hand violently dissented of its own volition , and began to pick the air as if playing a guitar . Now my brother as named in the message had a guitar , and the incidents mentioned all belonged to the time when I was a member of the family circle . At another sitting I asked ray father if he remembered a certain man , giving his name , and who was an old neighbor . The answer was promptly made in the affirmative , and a question put to me about the church in the old home . Knowing to what church the man named belonged , I asked if that particular church was in mind , and with the affirmative response the communicator went on to say that an organ had been put into that church . Of this I knew or remembered nothing at the time . I am quite certain that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West I not only found that the statement was true , but also that the man whom I had named was one of the three or four persons to leave the congregation on account of it . There were some remarkably clear communications from an uncle in the following facts . He began with an announcement of his name . He said " I am James McClellan , and you are my namesake . " I was the namesake of this uncle . He added , " I always despised the name of Jim . " This I did not know , but I felt that the statement was quite probable , as we always called him " Uncle Mack . " On inquiry of his living daughters , one of them did not know whether this was true or not . But the other recalled it distinctly , and mentioned several instances in which her mother and father had endeavored to correct the habit of their neighbors of cailing him " Jim . " He went on to mention that his father had been in the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their father had been in the war , and they one and all denied it . But I found in the history of the county in which he had lived that lie had been in the war of 1812 , having been commissioned in 1810 . My uncle also added that his father had a brother David who had a sunstroke and was never well after it . Inquiry showed that only one of the living brothers recalled an uncle by this name . But it also showed he was a brother-in-law instead of a brother . After two months ' inquiry I found where he had lived , and got into communication with two of his living sons , and ascertained from one of them that about 1867 his father had a light sunstroke . The other did not remember the incident . Two or three other evidential incidents were mentioned by this uncle , such as the , name of a living brother whom I knew when at college , and also the name of his own mother , whom I did not know , and the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of whose death I did not know . There were also a number of " communications " from a cousin , the son of this uncle ; from another uncle , who had died only three weeks before the first sitting ; from a brother and sister whose names were given and who had died in 1861 ; and a few from my mother , name being given , who died in 1869 . But by far the largest Dumber of " communications " came from my father , numbering in all perhaps as many as a hundred definite and concrete incidents in his life , In all there were 152 true incidents , 16 false , and 37 indeterminate or unverifiable cases . In classifying the false incidents I have been very severe , and even included some that with a little stretching could be made true ; and in the true instances , by a little different method of classification the niunber could be increased , though it would not alter their evidential value . But the reader will see that as between the true and false about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeterminate 74 per cent . are true , with the possibility that a much larger percentage would be correct . Now as to the explanation of such phevox , . CL ? No. 501 , - 10nomena , the Society for Psychical Research has excluded fraud from account as much as ten years ago , and insists that the choice of theories must be made between telepathy and spiritism . In this I agree , and add that whatever value attaches to the facts above enumerated , and to be reported in full details in a forthcoming volume on the Society 's Proceedings , it must accrue to the report only as a confirmation of Dr. Hodgson 's conclusion already announced . My - report is not an independent piece of work , but is only a ink in a chain . Keeping this fact in mind , we must indicate the results of my own facts in their bearing on the choice between the two theories mentioned . The difficulties with the telepathic theory are numerous . In the first place , in order to exclude the teleological unity that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so selective as it actually is in the choice of incidents . Thus there is not one verifiable incident in my whole record that represents my individual knowledge or memory alone , but all are the common knowledge of myself and the alleged communicator . This indicates a selective power of enormous magnitude , and in no way resembling the mechanical nature of a telepathy that would exclude an intelligent conception of what is wanted to establish personal identity . But the selectiveness of it does not stop here . There were something like twenty-five or thirty incidents about which I knew nothing , and which I had to verify by personal inquiries in the West . Besides , to shut off direct telepathy , as already explained , Dr. Hodgson held five sittings in my behalf , and all the facts then obtained were unknown to him , and a good percentage of them equally unknown to me . To obtain such incidents telepathy would have first tolrunt up the right person among all living consciousness , this person being absolutely unknown to the medium , and from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicator . The reader can imagine for himself the character of such a hypothesis , and must determine also ? whether he chooses to accept it . Any man who can believe it ought not to find it difficult to believe in spirits , as the latter is certainly not any larger in its demands upon credulity . This is especially true when we reflect that in all the phenomena of experimental telepathy , as indicated in the Society 's Proceedings , there is not a trace of a tendency either to reproduce personal identity or to select any other known incidents from the mind of the agent than those in the active state of consciousness at the time , and intended to be communicated . In other words , in all the scientific evidence for telepathy there is no trace of such a power as must be ascribed to it in the Piper case , where all the criteria of personal identity are satisfied . Against the hypothesis of telepathy also are both the false and the indeterminate incidents , A power so large and discriminative as telepathy must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to get incidents wholly false , and it ought to exhibit intelligence enough not to present either the false or the indeterminate , assuming that it can determine so infallibly what is necessary to illustrate personal identity in the discrimination between the relevant and irrelevant in the memory of the sitter . But I shall not press the argument from positive error , as we may well concede telepathy some fallibility and yet produce difficulties enough against it . The chief objection to it is the confusions and mistakes committed by it in matters that ought to be as clear and correct as incidents often less complex than those in which it is supposed to be successful . A power that can reach out into the world and defy all limitations of space and time in the access of the most complex incidents ought not . to stumble at some little fact in the mind of the sitter . For instance , take the guitar case . The idea that my brother Will played on a flute was not in my mind , nor in the mind of anybody living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such incidents as I have narrated ought easily to have obtained the right fact here from my memory . But it would be natural for a finite mind , incarnate or discarnate , to commit this error of memory , while so simple an error ought not to occur to a telepathy with such powers as the facts narrated indicate . Another instance of this is particularly interesting . On one occasion my cousin tried to give the name of his wife , still living . He succeeded only in giving her Christian name , and had to disappear . The trance personality , Rector , immediately said that my father and sister had brought her to communicate several times before . This implied that she - was not living . The fact was that the person whom my father and sister had brought was another cousin by a very different name . I knew all the while who was meant , and , according to telepathy , Rector must be considered as the secondary personality of Mrs. Piper , and should have power enough , if the successes indicate any power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here the very natural error of a false interpretation by Rector is committed . A similar mistake was committed as my brother closed a communication with the attempt to give this name of my cousin and failed to complete it . He had just given rightly the name of my sister , and followed it with this unsuccessful attempt to give that of my cousin . As soon as he disappeared , Rector said , " I got it all but the Hyslop . " Now my brother was not trying to say " Lucy Hyslop , " but Lucy McClellan , which I knew very well , but was refusing to recognize it until given in full . If telepathy is to be assumed with the enormous powers supposed to account for the successes , it ought not to commit so bald a mistake as this where it had every opportunity to be successful . The mistake might very well be an incident of the natural difficulties of communication between two worlds . There are other important facts against the telepathic hypothesis . For instance , it hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the clearness of the communications between different communicators . The facts regarding the deceased are subject to precisely the same mental conditions in my memory for all of them , and it is absurd for telepathy to be clear respecting one person and uniformly confused respecting another , But this was the case . One uncle and a cousin , both of whom had died comparatively recently before the sittings , were not clear in any of their efforts . Dr. Hodgson found in his experiments that persons recently deceased , and especially suicides , were not good communicators . My own experiments bear out this induction in so far as recent deaths are concerned . Still further , one uncle , whose death occurred two months before my first sitting , was indicated very clearly in two messages ; though I was very intimate with him , and had much in ? common with him in our intellectual experience , yet he never communicated with me once . All this is absolutely incompatible with the telepathic hypothesis . The discriminative power assumed in the acquisition of the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one just mentioned , where on any telepathic theory I should have obtained abundant incidents . Besides , no one can conceive , on any known psychological law , why the memory of a sitter or distant living person should be more difficult to penetrate in the case of incidents pertaining to recently deceased persons , especially when emotional interest appears to be an aid Lo communications rather than a binderance . The only natural hypothesis , as illustrating the proper unity and known psychological laws , is the spiritistic . There is still another very important fact against the telepathic and in favor of the spiritistic theory . It is the dramatic play of personality . I can give no adequate Conception of this without detailed quotation from the records . But I may briefly indicate its general nature . It represents the various interlocutions , remarks , explanations , suggestions , etc. , directed now to the sitter on this side , and now to the " communicator " on the " other side , " precisely as we should expect to see in the management of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to attain a common end . Conversation purporting to go on with the " communicator , " and representing the various procedure necessary in explaining the process of communication and the conditions of its success , is very frequent . This of course involves unverifiable facts , but it is just what ought to occur in the real process , as it does on our side , the record bearing testimony to this circumstance . Thus George Pelham may suddenly interrupt the messages with a statement , " Let me get that , " and then proceed to give a proper name which Rector can not obtain . Or Rector may counsel the " communicator " to " speak slowly , " explaining to him that if the sitter spoke so rapidly , the " coin unidator " would never obtain anything , etc . All this is not telepathic , whatever we may choose to call it . ft is certainly very realistic , and if the criterion of personal identity be once satisfied , it is almost impossible to resist the conviction that we are dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Case comes from our knowledge of secondary personality , which so often simulates another than the normal subject and its powers that we have to be extremely careful to see that this dramatic play is inexplicable by a secondary consciousness , with an infinite telepathy to account for the acquisition of the objective facts for the reproduction of personal identity . But the thorough student of secondary personality will find himself much nonplussed to discover in its phenomena any real likeness to the spiritistic realism of the Piper case . I must say to the reader , however , that I shall not remain by the spiritistic theory if a better can be obtained to explain the phenomena . I advance it simply as a hypothesis that will explain , and not as one that is demonstrated by the facts . It is all very well to say telepathy to explain coincidences , but at best that process is but a name for our ignorance of the real modus operandi in the production of the phenomena . It is , in fact , only a name for the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be explained by chance , and though we assume that it is some direct process between mind and mind independent of the ordinary channels of sense , yet it has displayed no other powers in its experimental form than access to the active state of consciousness of the agent at the time , and exhibits no tendency to play ad libitum with the memories of living persons without regard to space and time . Only our ignorance of its actual limitations prevents us from rejecting it with perfect confidence . But if the sceptic will as patiently establish its infinite powers , with its contradictory weaknesses , by experiment , and produce evidence that the existence of discarnate spirits is not necessary to explain such plienomena as I have indicated , I , for one , shall riot resist the sceptical conclusion .
