IN the time of Napoleon , it was said that " all roads lead to Paris . " This is still true , but it is also true that all roads lead from Paris and radiate through the beautiful country of France . Thus is the way provided for the traveller to see real France , which he can not do from the window of the fast express . While Paris itself is representative of French civilization , art , and thought , it has lost much of individual French character . Since the days of Louis XIV . it has been a resort for pleasure-loving people , until it has become a sort of great watering-place ? a Spa . Few of those who visit Paris from year to year know what true France is . In a like way , Americans know , unfortunately for themselves , little of America . France is filled with things to interest and amuse , and a coaching trip affords a unique pleasure . Coaching , however , is not in very great vogue in France . The Frenchman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Englishman does . He is content to admire them from a distance . To the stranger , however , and to him who loves the peaceful grandeur and beauty of the country , there are few things so delightful as a drive through one of the provinces of France . Here is solace for the cliff-dweller ? the man who lives in the beehive of New York activity , ? and those who cling to the glitter of Paris know not the joys that might so easily be theirs . The American finds beneficial rest for mind and body , and forgets the clanging trolley-cars , the clicking of type-writers and stock-tickers , the tinkling of telephones , when for a few weeks he leaves all that behind to revel in the calm of the country , and listen only to the music of the road . But if the Frenchman is not an enthusiast in this kind of sport , he has at least built his roads as if he had no other aim in life than to make driving a luxnry . Thanks to the excellence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France are kept always in perfect condition . The net-work of highways forms an elaborate system , comprising the Routes Nationales , leading to the ancient provincial capitals ; the Routes Departementales , binding the chief cities together ; and the Chemins Vicinaux , uniting the smallest villages . All the roads are wide , and usually lined with carefully trimmed trees , which lend beauty to the scene and protection from the rays of the sun . Large stones are placed each kilometre , showing the distance to the nearest towns in both directions , while smaller stones mark the hectometres . This minuteness is characteristic of the French administrations minuteness so much decried , and yet , in this instance , shown to be so useful . The system of roads provides cheap and practical conveyance for all , and we in America , where our roads are so poor in comparison , might study the system to our advantage . There are , by-the-way , no unflagged crossings in France , and consequently little chance of mishaps when crossing railroad tracks ; and the garde-barridre , presenting arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form ) , is a comely silhouette , reminding one of Millet . It is on such roads that coaching is a real pleasure . The start of a coach drive in Paris , and elsewhere in France , is always an interesting scene . A crowd gathers , expressing comical astonishment at the busy grooms , impatient horses , and the great carriage laden with baggage and hampers of eatables and drinkables . When the horn announces the start , and we are oft , these enthusiasts follow to catch the last glimpse as we disappear in the distance . We made many trips through the provinces ; for instance , through Tourainethe Garden of France ? where all seems prosperity , richness , and joy . Some of the prettiest views are along the various canals , with their edgings of tall trees , and their slow-moving tow-horses . These C1V ? No 624 ? 104 canals are sources of prosperity , passing , as they do , through all portions of the country and affording cheap transportation . Anon a picturesque suspension-bridge varies the scene , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once we passed through CompiAgne , where the castle with its treasures was recently opened for the visit of the Czar of Russia ; also to Chantilly , with its magnificent chateau bequeathed by the late Due d'Aumale to the Institute of France . While at Chantilly all lovers of horses should visit the Grand Conde 's stables , which are large enough to house hundreds of horses , and are built with regal luxury . The inside taan ? ge is , in itself , a marvel of art . The kennels , too , are curious , and still resound with the echo of the chasses ri course of the Due de Chartres . It is a pathetic sight to see this son of a French king hunting there , for now he rents what was once one of the prerogatives of the monarchs . In our journeys we used three or four teams . daily . All the details of the changes were arranged by Morris E. Howlett , the professional whip , and the horses were sent by rail in advance . By this means it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for horses or driver , besides allowing sufficient time for stops along the road , to visit ancient castles , beautiful cathedrals , bric-a-brac shops , and the many objects of interest . With a rest every five or six days , I have been able to keep on the road for months without a horse becoming ill , and without any undue fatigue . No discrimination need he made in the choice of roads . One may go where fancy leads him , provided , of course , that changes of horses he sent a few hours in advance . There is never any difficulty in sheltering horses at night . During the reign of Napoleon the Third , the French government undertook the breeding of horses for the army , and for this purpose established farms in various parts of the country . From these government farms are turned out horses exactly suited to the different branches of the army : for instance , light horses for the light cavalry ; heavy , strong horses for the heavy cavalry ; and a medium between these two for artillery purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ( as do other European governments ) . Many cavalry remounts are also purchased throughout France in general , horse shows being held in connection with their selection . It was our good fortune on several occasions to come across one of these country horse shows , and , although we usually happened to arrive at the last moment , the authorities never refused us permission to participate . No words can describe the interest created by our strange carriage " that came from Paris , " drawn by four horses and heralded by a horn . To me , these simple country people are never-failing sources of interest , and their wonderment and open curiosity were most amusing . Travelling alone on the coach one day and driving six horses ( for the road had been hilly ) , I slowed up at a hamlet preparatory to making a change of horses . As the men led out the relay of four horses , I noticed a boy , whose garments were far from being complete or new , gaping at me in astonishment , and then , seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coach , and all ? he exclaimed , with true Parisian gavroche accent , " Is all of that for only you ? " Driving out of Paris , it is interesting to note how far the influence of the great city penetrates into the country ? long after the obnoxious octroi or municipal customs are passed , and the clumsy and obsolete fortifications are left behind . After the passenger of the Versailles coach has left the Avenue de l'Opera , with its crowds of idlers , and has driven up the Champs Elys ? es , even after the relay of Saint-Cloud , he feels the artificiality of the country so near the capital . The Bois de Boulogne , with its well-kept alleys and its green-uniformed guards , does not give the idea of solitude , of abandon , that is felt when passing the deserted forests of Fontainebleau , or the aristocratic forest of St.-Germain . These economically managed forests make one regret the waste of timber in America , and the unceasing care and toil needed to preserve them should serve as a timely warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of the Third French Republic drives out . Once we had a narrow escape from arrest for breaking through the cordon of ser gents de yille lined up along the route , and who seemed to think that we intended to smash the daumont of M. Loubet with ray heavy road-coach . After driving through the royal but empty avenue of the old and sleepy city of Versailles , and when the sharp turn into the difficult passageway has been successfully made , we find ourselves in the Hotel des ROservoirs , the mansion that was once the home of Madame la Marquise de Pompadour . We visited also the marvellous palace which at the time of the Roi Solcil was the rendezvous of all the nobility of France , and on which the eyes of Europe then centred . One 's veins tingle with interest in this place , once overflowing with beauty , wit , and elegance . After Versailles or St.-Germain , where large crowds watch our departure , we travel over roads that stretch in straight lines for miles through charming country , with here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of a hero of bygone days . Sometimes a windmill standing on a hill will animate the scene , or the ruins of some medi√¶val castle will cast their picturesque shadow upon the horizon . My thoughts turn to the vulgar patent-medicine advertising-boards to be seen along the roads of America , and I shudder at the comparison . Everywhere we met the Berger ( with his flock of sheep nearly hidden in a cloud of dust ) , whose cheery greeting , Bonjour , .21esieu ' , was always welcome ; or a party of Bohemians , ? the men earnestly engaged in the manufacture of baskets , while the women cooked the chicken and potatoes by the side of the road . The hotels of France may be divided into three classes : the really smart hotel , which is very fine ; the medium - class hotel ( with the hostler in his hired dress-clothes to wait upon you ) , which strives to be very smart and is very poor ; and the small " dinkey " hotel , where the proprietor-chef does everything and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its curious old kitchen arrangements and spits , and shining brass cooking utensils , to the virtue of which the French claim to be due the excellence of their cooking . ( It has been said that France , defeated at Water- loo , has recovered in great part its supremacy in Europe through its cuisine ) . It is in a place of this kind that one learns to know the people and their joie du metier . The proprietor and his wife , though they could readily afford to live better than their confreres in America , prefer to live plainly . The women do not wear silk dresses , nor are their daughters taught to play the piano . To me it has always seemed that women are better off if they have a little house-work to do . During a recent trip in Texas , I visited one of the largest lunatic asylums . There I found that a large percentage of insane women were wives of farmers , the chief cause of their insanity being simply ennui . One failing of the French innkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one occasion at a certain town , we were subjected to the most abusive harangue from a landlord , whose place I knew by experience to be poor , although it was generally accepted as the best hotel in the town . We passed it by to partake of the plain hospitality of a very small but scrupulously clean au-bergs . The landlord of the larger place became delirious at the " outrage , " and shot at us a speech to the effect that , as the best and oldest nobility of France always put up at his house , we showed very bad taste and very little consideration for the said nobility in going to a place which did not enjoy even the privilege of being called a hotel . Any one travelling by coach in France is liable to be greeted with hisses , and hailed as cochon.s d'Anglais . In order to harmonize with the popular feeling , we would respond , Vivent les Boers , or , at the time of the Dreyfus affair , Vive l'Armee , thus bringing about the desired result , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be met by the proprietor-chef of the hotel , embodied in one fat and ever-courteous person . With him it is useless to put on " side , " but by shaking his hand , patting him on the back , and so forth , one can get almost anything under the sun from him , from his wife , or from his children . Another personage of interest is the cur-6 . One day I met a jolly " Monsieur le Cure , " for whom the republican form of government was not a nightmare , and he very readily accepted my proffer of a seat beside me on the coach . Among other things , he said , " When I wish to do as other people do , je me mete en pain " ( I doll the cloth ) . But the good , plain , kind-hearted gendarme is perhaps the most interesting character of all . He can he seen on the road everywhere , day and night , looking for vagabonds without pupiers . We had an amusing experience one day : Passing near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and learned , upon inquiry , that one of the gendarmes had just been robbed of a chicken , and had happened to see the thief running away . There is a regulation in France declaring an arrest illegal when made by a gendarme who is not in uniform . Therefore our gendarme , who was in cigshabiW , rushed up stairs to don his tunic and bicornc . When he returned , a few moments later , the thief was , of course , out of sight . Though it is easy to ask one 's way in the country , the information given is not always to be relied upon . The people have an engaging way of replying " Straight ahead , " and , if you . follow their advice , it may lead you in an opposite direction to that in which you want to go . Or , they will obligingly describe the road and the country in such detail that you will know less about it when they have finished than you did before . In America , few words are wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate , and show higher average intelligence In speaking of the hotels or inns of France , it may be of interest to mention some of their names . Going about the country , one may come across the HOtel du Cheval Blanc , Hotel du Cheval Noir , de l'Ecu , du Grand Cerf , Soleil d'Or . Some names are still more picturesque , as , for instance , Intel de la Guimbarde , HOtel du Coq Hardi , IIOtel du Coq Efflanque , and these titles are usually illustrated on the sign . above the door , and bear the indispensable " On loge a pied et a cheval . " Oftentimes these signs have been painted by some artist of talent , whose empty purse forced him to take this means of paying for his food and lodging . I have seen genuine works of art on such signs , and I remember upon one occasion using every ruse I knew to secure an ex-ceptionally fine one . The landlord would neither sell it nor let me have it as a gift . I offered him many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not want your money ; I want my sign . " It is interesting to note how the cooking varies with the locality . The farther south one goes the more spicy the dishes become , and the wine more liberal ? although a drunkard is seldom to he seen . In the north the meals are not so rich as in the south , and wine is , to an extent , replaced by beer or alcohol It may be safely said that one reason for the non-success of France as a col-onizing nation may be found in the good cooking of their country , for Frenchmen are seldom satisfied with the culinary products of other countries . The French are a very patriotic people . On the fourteenth of July , their national holiday , we decorated our coach with American and French flags . The populace at first seemed to be on the point of shouting " A bas les Anglais , " when , catching sight of the " stars and stripes " and the " couleurs tricolores , " they became transported with joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were another Bastille ; this time , however , with friendly intentions . When we talked French to them , and told them we were Americans , they nearly deafened us with their shouts of " Viye l'Ame'rique. "
