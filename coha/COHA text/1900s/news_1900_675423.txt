" RESCUED FROM AN - ICE FLOE . Two Men Drifting Down to Sea from Yonkers Saved by a Fort Lee Ferryboat . Two colored men . adrift on a cake of ice in the Hudson River , were res-mea by the crew of the ferryboat George Washington of the Fort Lee Ferry , late yesterday afternoon . The two voyagers were sighted by Capt . Marcus ' at 5 o'clock , just as the George Washington was leaving her slip at the foot of West One Hundred and Thirtieth Street . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been irawn upon a long ice floe , made feeble attempts to signal , for help , but both were apparently too exhausted to shout . The ice was moving rapidly down stream with the outfloWing tide . Capt . Marcus headed the ferryboat in pursuit , and was soon near enough to throw the men a line . One of them grasped at the rope in response to the Captain 's shouted directions , but the other seemed at first too benumbed by the cold to move . Shouting to the men to keep firm hold on the rope Capt . Marcus revefsod the ferryboat and headed ' her back for the slip . As the line pulled taut . however , it became evident that the effort was too much for the men , overcome by their icy voyage . The rope slipped through their hands into the water , and the cake of ice again shot downstream with its disappointed burden . Capt . Marcus again reversed his boat and took up the pursuit . The tide and current caught up the Hoe , and for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuer . With the turning tide , however , the advantage reversed , and oft Eightieth Street the ferryboat again came within speaking distance of the men . Under directions from the crew of the George Washington the two castaways were aroused to an effort to launch their skiff . Then , still directed from the ferryboat. they tumbled into it . barely escaping an upset , and a second line was thrown them . One of the men fastened the line to the bow of tile rowboat , and- it was towed . back to One Hundred and Thirtieth Street by the George Washington . When taken from the boat the men were half frozen and barely conscious . They were warmed at the ferry house and given stimulants . After being revived they said that they were Charles Jones and Walter Leggett of 12 Washington Street , Yonkers . The , two men , who are employed in a tallow factory situated on the New Jersey shore opposite Yonkers , had crossed the river from Yonkers Saturday night in the rowboat to deliver some material at the factory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the factory . Late yesterday morning they attempted to recross the river , but the outilowine tide and the floating ice were too much for them . Their boat got wedged in a floe , and after vain efforts to extricate it they climbed onto the ice , and drew the boat up after them . They had been unable to attract any one 's attention until opposite the Fort Lee Ferry . The men left for Yonkers by train .
