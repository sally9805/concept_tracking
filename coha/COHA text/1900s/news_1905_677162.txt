txt The ease against Abraham H. Hummel ; the lawyer on trial before Justice Rogers in the Supreme Court on a charge of conspiracy to deceive the courts , probably will go to the jury before night . It is ex1pected that the defense will let It go to the jury room without offering any evi1 dence . After having Charles F. Dodge , the former husband of Mrs. Charles W. Morse , and Capt . James T. Morse , uncle of her second husband , on the stand through the morning and early afternoon yesterday , Assistant District Attorney Rand announced at 8:15 o'clock that the people 's case was complete . It was evident that the other side was surprised . A conference of geveral minutes ensued between Lawyers Stanchfield and Nicoll and their client . Mr. Stanchfield then made the customary motions for the defense , all of which the court denied . Then , after another consultation , came a request for adjournment until this morning . which caused a colloquy between counsel . The defendant 's lawyers said their case would be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The court granted adjournment and again warned the jurymen that they must not talk about the case with anybody . The twelve jurors walked away , evidently pleased , for when they started last Thursday they heard that the trial would last two weeks . Contrary to expectation Mr. Rand called Charles F. Dodge ahead of Capt . Morse yesterday morning . The former husband of Mrs. Morse looked in fine health and took the stand unconcernedly . To those who saw him brought here from Texas in December , 1904 , surrounded by a score of detectives and marshals , a great change was noticeable . Then he was a physical wreck , whose clothes hung about his emaciated limbs in deep folds . Yesterday there was not a wrinkle in his dark suit , and his face was as free from signs of care . Dodge testified with an alertness that went so far as to annoy the opposing counsel . Mr. Stanchfield made almost as many objections as Mr. Rand asked questions . In three or four cases , notably when Mr. Rand began to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alleged conspiracy the court sustained ob-jeotions , ? Led by Mr. Rand , Dodge began by telling about his life up to ' the time of his agreement with his wife , early , in 1897. to allow her to get a divorce . He was born at Barry , Vt. , he said , sixty years ago . Twenty-three years were spent in the hotel business . For five years he was a Wall Street broker 's clerk . Then he was a dining car waiter in the South , and when Hummel looked him up he was in the restaurant business in Atlanta . He met and married Miss Clemence Cowles in 1877 while manager of the Palace Hotel at San Francisco . The twelve years they lived together were marred by disagreements , he said . He came to this city in 1897 and called on his wife at the boarding house she kept on West Forty-fourth Street . He agreed to be at the Everett House on March 31 , 1897 , that he might be served with summons in proceedings which she had authorized William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served by the lawyer , and identified the paper handed to him then . He also described the letter he wrote to the late Mortimer A. Huger , engaging him as counsel , and identified the letters , In June , 1898 , at Tampa , he learned through a New York paper that his wife had obtained a divorce , and in 1901 he heard she had been married tol Morse . Asked if he questioned the regularity of his wife 's divorce at the time , he replied " No . " His answer to the question when he had first heard that his wife 's second marriage might be invalidated was : " In the office of Abraham H. Hummel . " Edward T. Bracken , the missing detective , telegraphed twice , then came on to Atlanta and took Dodge out for , dinner , where he told the witness that he was wanted by Hummel at New York because of trouble with Mrs. Dodge 's divorce .. Dodge replied that he had just got a backer for a restaurant and could not afford to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the witness said . Dodge arrived in New York on a Sun- I day , and the next day went to Hummel 's office . Asked what the lawyer said to him , Dodge replied : " He patted me on the back and said , ' Dodge , you 're a mascot . ' " An appointment was made for the next day , when Hummel asked about the circumstances conected with the divorce . Dodge said he told the straight , story about having been served and having retained a lawyer . " What happened next , " asked Mr. Rand . " A stenographer was brought in , " said the witness , " and Hummel dictated an affidavit . " " In a continuous stream , or did he refer to you ? " " He just asked me for dates . After I had been out for luncheon I signed it . " Then the document was shown to him ' and identified . Another call by Bracken at Atlanta brought Dodge back to New York on Oct. 16 , 1903 , when again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words with the defendant , who then introduced him to his partner , Benjamin Steinhardt . Another affidavit was dictated , in the same manner as the first one , Dodge said , and again he signed , , having " just glanced it over . " " Did you make no objection ? " asked Mr. Band . " I told Steinhardt about Huger , " answered the witness , " And what did he say ? " " Oh , Ruger 's dead , " he said . He then described how he received five " $1,000 bills from Steinhardt in the pre4- , ence of Bracken . In November that year 1 // HUMMEL CASE TO JURY TO-NIGHT , SAYS DEFENSE // he returned once more to Nadi Yolk and appeared before Referee Hall , where , according to his admission yesterday , he testified to not having been served nor employed counsel in his wife 's suit for divorce six years earlier . The witness identified his own signature affixed to the testimony taken on that occasion . Mr. Nicoll conducted the cross-examination . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in as many forms as possible that he had deliberately perjured himself . Finally the lawyer remarked that , evidently , the only true thing to which Dodge had sworn was that the railway he served once did not run into New York . The witness took this with a smile . The making of the other affidavit by Steinhardt was gone over again . " It was at that visit you demanded money ? " asked Mr. Nicoll . " I asked Bracken for the money before I left Atlanta , " explained Dodge . " You thought you oght to get something for leaving your business ? ' Wanted Some Easy Money , " I told him there was something doing and I wanted to be declared in on it , " the witness retorted , Q. ? What did you ask for ? A. ? Five thousand dollars . Q. ? Bid you think that price high ? A ? No , I saw the opportunity , and I thought I ought to get In on the game . Q. ? What game ? A ? Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendants could not stop for a while . " . You saw a chance to get that much out of it , and you thought you ought to get it ? " insisted Mr. Nicoll . " I was forced to do it , " replied the witness . Q. ? Forced to lt ? Whoever compelled you to do such a thing ? A. ? Well . after I got the money I thought I had to testify . Q , ? But you have just told the jury you took the money In lieu of the loss to your business in Atlanta ? A. ? Well , that 's it . Q. ? That Is , you testified falsely of your own free will , did n't you ? A. ? Yes , I guess that 's so . Q. ? You got the money for expenses and not for swearing falsely , is n't that It ? A. ? Well , I think that was It . Mr. Rand 's re-examination was brief and contained only this interesting point : " Has at any time a promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one connected with the prosecution ? " " No , Sir . " Dodge was followed by Capt . James T. Morse , who had been paying close attention . Like his nephew , Capt . Morse spoke In very low tones , and had to be admonished every little while to speak up . He , said that he lived at 44 Beacon Street , Bpston , and was connected with the Eastern Steamship Company , as well as being interested in many other large concerns . He said he went to Hummel , whom he knew by reputation , and asked him to pee if Charles W. Morse 's marriage could he broken up . Capt . Morse 's Testimony . " I told him the marriage was very distasteful to the family , " said Capt . Morse , " and that my nephew 's new wife was leading him away from his sister and children . I asked him to look into the divorce Mrs. Dodge had got in order to see if it was regular . " Nothing was said about a retaining fee until several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Boston by Hummel over the telephone . Hummel. whose voice he recognized , said he had found flaws in the divorce , and asked $15,000 as a fee . The witness told him to go ahead . Right afterward he went to the bank , drew $15,000 , put the roll in his pocket , and started for New York , where he handed the money to Hummel . Asked what Hummel said on that occasion , Capt . Morse replied that Hummel told him he was sure the divorce was irregular , and that the marriage could easily be upset . " Did you give him any instructions as to the second marriage ? " asked Mr. Rand . I told him to go ahead and break it up , " answered the witness . Early in February Capt . Morse had another long-distance call from Hummel . " He told me , " said the witness , " that Dodge , had been arrested somewhere in the South and that bail had been fixed at $10,000 . He added that he thought I ought to come to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought it to New York , and turned it in to Hummel 's office . " After that long-distance calls were frequsnt . Each time Capt . Morse , according to the story he told yesterday , drew money without protest , , took the train for Stamford , Conn. , and handed the requested sum to Lawyer Nathaniel Cohen on behalf of Hummel . These dates and sums were detailed by him : Feb. 24 , $3,000 ; February , later , $1,500 ; March 5 , $5,000 ; March 12 , $5,000 ; March , later , $9,500 ; June 3 , $3,000 or $3,500 ; Aug. 1 5 , $2,500 . In some cases t14 checks drawn were produced by Mr. Rand and identified by the witness . In several instances sums I had been drawn evidently which were not recalled by Capt . Morse . " Did you ever get anything back ? ' " Was Mr. Rand 's last question . " No , Sir , " said the witness . Mr. Stanchfield drew from Capt . Morse the statement that he bad spent some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Hummel . Pressed to say that he had heard that Dodge had never been served , Capt . Morse replied that all he had heard was that irregularities were connected with the decree , the nature of which he was unaware of . He went ahead without conferring with the sister of Mr. Morse or the children . " You were particular to impress on Hummel that you did not want anybody to know that you were connected with the case ? " asked Mr. Stanchfield . An affirmative nod was the answer . Q. ? You would have regarded it as a gross breach of trust If he had told ? A. ? I should . Q. ? There were no quibbles or troubles over cost ? A. ? No , Sir . Q. ? When he asked for these sums Mr. Rand has enumerated . you had no protest or complaint to make ? A. ? No , I had not . Q. ? You are not here in the role of a complainant or prosecutor ? A. ? No , Sir . Q. ? In regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hummel. you have no fault to find ? A ? Not the least . He testified that he had no idea of any perjured testimony to be used , and had given no orders for employment of such means . In regard to furnishing means for Dodge to keep away , he said , he thought the man had told the truth and should be helped . Mr. Rand asked but one question on re-direct examination : " Did Hummel ever tell you he , paid $5,000 to Dodge for his testimony ? " " No . Sir , " was the answer . William A. Sweetser was then recalled to identify a register which he had produced at the demand of the prosecution . Mr. Stanchfield protested against its introduction . " The situation is this , " explained . Mr.-Rand . If I do n't produce it , they 'll go to the jury with the proposition , that , because it was not produced , Sweetser lied when he said he made an entry in it . " " Well , they can not do that now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sustain the objection . " The last witness was Frederick G. Wattles , who served as clerk in the Long Beach Hotel with Dodge in 1808 and who was placed of i the stand to identify Dodge 's handwriting in several documents . DR . GUNN BEFORE CORONER . Declares He Will Fight for the Legacy Mrs. Poole Left . Dr. Robert A. Gunn , the aged physician who was engaged to marry Mrs. Florence Ballou Poole of 870 West End Avenue on Dec. 3 , which was the day following her death , was called before Coroner Golden* kranz and Assistant Dlstrnct Attorney Turnbull yesterday . " I went willingly , " said Dr. Gunn yesterday afternoon at his office in West Ninety-second Street . " Indeed , I had started to go down before I knew that they wanted me . I court the strictest investigation of this case . " It has been said that Mrs. Poole left me $10,000 . I know that she left me something , but I do n't know how much .
