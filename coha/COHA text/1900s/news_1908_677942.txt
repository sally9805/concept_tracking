txt Ex-Justice 's Paper for $100,000 Juggled In Two Morse Banks  --  Morse Got a Million Through Dummies . Two indictments , one of them at least charging grand larceny , were returned yesterday against Charles W. Morse by the special Grand Jury which has been investigating financial matters corning under the jurisdiction of the State courts . The Grand Jury reported to Justice Dowling , in the Criminal Branch of the Supreme Court , at 3:30 yesterday afternoon , banding up the two Morse indictments among several others resulting from routine cases . As no arrest could be made , Mr. Morse now being on the ocean , the text of the indictments was not made public . Justice Dowling fixed the bail at $20,000 , covering both indictments . More Indictments to Come . It is understood that other indictments have been ordered in this investigation , which has concerned Itself mostly with the financial doings of Morse and E. R. Thomas . The two Morse indictments refer to the faerte developed in connection with the sale of a block of the stock of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien last Spring . While the allegations of the indictments themselves will not be released until Morse gets back from Europe at the end of this week and the formalities of arrest are gone through , the situation out oe which they were developed has become known in its entirety . When Morse offered to Mr. O'Brien a block of the stock of the National Bank of North America last Spring with a plea that he thereby become interested in the bank and enter its Directorate . Mr. O'Brien gave three notes for $100,000 each , payable to himself and indorsed to Morse . The understanding between the two men was that the notes should not be discounted , but held , Morse professing that his desire to have Mr. O'Brien invest in the stock was to get a man of his prominence and reputation connected with the institution . Morse gave , at the same time , a written agreement to buy the stock back at the price at which it was sold at any time within two years . Meantime If Mr. O'Brien wanted to realize whatever profit might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stock , he could close out his shares , take up the notes , and credit tiifilibiance to his profit and loss account . $100,000 Surprise for Mr. O'Brien . The first intimation that Mr. O'Brien received that this agreement was not complied with , came when one of the notes was presented to him for payment by the Mercantile National Bank , in which Morse and F. A. Heinze , now under indictment for overeertification , were the controlling interests . It was at this stage of the matter that the things were developed in the criminal investigation from which the indictments came about . Morse took one of the three $100,000 notes to the Mercantile National Bank , deposited it for collection , and received against it a check for $100,000 , payable to ex-Justice O'Brien . This check Morse indorsed " Morgan J. O'Brien , per C. W. Morse , " and had it collected through the National Bank of North America , of which he was at that time Vice President and the controlling stockholder . Susequently , Mr. O'Brien took up the note and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been put through a somewhat similar process elsewhere , and the bank stock , which the . notes represented , was transferred to the law firm of O'Brien , Boardman &; Platt . A. B. Boardman , one of the partners in this firm , is now acting as Morse 's counsel . He had nothing to say about the indictment of his client yesterday . Although these indictments , were brought by the State Grand Jury , it is believed that the facts were first developed by the Federal , Grand Jury , which has been probing the Morse-Heinze-Thomas combination . This Federal Grand Jury , it is learned , has before it a situation out of which It is probable that an overcertification indictment will be framed against some one by reason of a transaction in the National Bank of North America . It came out yesterday that when the Clearing House authorities were busily at work upon the elimination of Morse , Thomas , and Heinze from the New York banking situation , the latter said that in no event would he retire from the Mercantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Morse paid him $600,000 . Heinze declared that he had lost this amount in the United Copper slump , which he laid in a large measure to Morse 's failure to live up to his agreements with the other parties in the United Copper situation . Morse eventually produced a check for this amount , worm was certified late one afterr oon at the National Bank of North America with the understanding on the part of A. H. Curtis , the former President of that institution , that funds would be produced to meet it the following morning . Heinze collected on the check , but the fund : : were never forthcoming . Accordingly Morse 's account at the bank was charged up with the amount , and in that shage matters have stood down to the present time . Dummy Loans to Morse . This is not the only National Bank of North America transaction recently come to light which will be subjected to the detest investigation by the authorities as to - its criminality . It was learned yesterday that loans aggregating fully $1,000,000 were made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality dummies for Morse . Since that institution has beep in the hands of Receiver Hanna , and efforts have been made to straighten out its tangled affairs , many Of these apparent borrowers have been approached for the collection of their accounts . In almost every case has the story been the same  --  that the borrower went to the bank at the request of Morse and for his benefit . It appears , however , that not a few of these individuals are men of substance , and that there : is a pretpect of collecting a good many of the accounts for the banks , leaving the *Iriandam borrowers to fight it out with Morse as beat they may . All of these facts have come to the ' attention or the Federal Grand Jury : That body had before it last week Morgan 3.1 Continued on-.Paige 3 , MORSE IS INDICTED FOR GRAND LARCENY // O'Brien and A.

A conference was held between District Attorney ' Jerome and United States District Attorney Stimson . The next step came when F. A.

Mr. Boardman came to the building with former Assistant District Attorney William Rand , Jr . who i has appeared for several of the nsuranco otfidals when they were indicted , and has had several conferences with Mr. Boardman in the last few days . Neither of the lawyers would discuss his visit or its possible results , Heinzo a Grand Jury Witness . Mr. ** went to the Criminal Court Building again yesterday afternoon , and was before the Grand Jury for not more than ten minutes. ? Mr. O'Brien was the next visitor , and for an equally short time , and then came Miles M. O'Brien , who was President of the Mercantile National Bank prior to F. A.

Soon after that the Grand Jury came out and filed down into Justice Dowling 's court , where District Attorney Jerome was waiting . Five papers were passed up to the court by Foreman Edward Cuddihy . Two of them were liquor tax indiettnents , one was the dismissal of a liquor tax case , and the two others were the Morse indictments . Your Honor , " said District Attorney Jerome . " there are two papers in that batch on which I should ' lice to have bail fixed . I would suggest $20,000 on one of them and nothing on the other . " Morse 's Bail Fixed at $20,000 . Justice Dowling read through the indictments and then said : " I would suggest that the bail be fixed at $10,000 on each of the two . " " Oh , very well , " said Mr. Jerome . " The man who is indicted is on his way to this ' country now . " The indictments were filed away in the box marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Deputy Sheriff Forges yesterday received many more returns from the various banks and trust companies on which the attachment against Mr. Morse was obtained in favor of Charles A. Hanna , receiver of the National Bank of North America . All stated that they had no property or money belonging to Mr. Morse . The Trust Company of America sent in an amended certificate to the effect that Mr. Morse has fifty shares on stock in that company . Stories which have been current in the Street recently of stock market operations by Morse before his departure for Europe were taken with sufficient seriousness by Receiver Hanna and his counsel to induce them to obtain attachments against possible Morse funds in a score of brokerage houses yesterday . The receiver has located about $2,000,000 of Morse collateral so far , but investigation has shown that the loans under which it has been pledged total very nearly Its full market value .

Criticises His Co ! receiver and Replies Sharply to O'Brien , Boardman &; Platt . Charles M. Higgins added somewhat to the interest that has attended the unraveling of the affairs of the Brooklyn Bank by sending to the law firm of O'Brien , Boardman &; Platt yesterday an open letter referring to a notice previously received by him from the lawyers . This is the reply of Receiver Higgins in part : For myself , as receiver , I want to here state that In Your ufOresaid donee you have- in no waY latimiditted me from my clear legal right and . duty as I see it for the reasons that I have already given ; hilt for my co-receiver , Mr. Hasbrouck , Igannet say quite so much , as you seem to ' eve seriously scared or affected him ' by your notice and warnings , so ? much. - so that he seems to be even opposed to allowing old and undoubted depositors of the Brooklyn Bank to have their pass books on the Brooklyn Bank written up to show their true and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bank , because , forsooth , somebody has erroneously put a few entries at some time into a pass book marked the " International Trust Company . " and because yon have scared him with the foolish idea that this false and erroneous entry works a kind of abandonment of the deposit In the Brooklyn Bank ! And for the same extraordinary and groundless Yeason , induced by your notice , he has persistently denied true and undoubted depositors of the Brooklyn idafik their clear legal right to offset their loans with their deposits . I now give you notice that if you any longer continue your semi-threat to embarrass the free action of the receivers of this bank In properly liquidatins Its affairs and paying the just claims , I shall have a legal investigation made at once Into your conduct and into any possibie violations of law which your ' obstructive actions may Involve .
