txt If Gov . Hughes ? as some of the Republican leaders assert  --  has alienated the support of the farmers and the powerful agricultural societies by his vigorous and successful campaign to end the betting evil at the race tracks there was no indication of it in the reception accorded him here to-day when , for the first time since the passage of the law , he plunged into the situation and addressed the first of the many farmer audiences that will hear him speak at county fairs during the next few weeks . Speaking from an improvised platform , erected on the race course in front of the grandstand in the Greene County fair grounds to-day , the Governor almost at once took up a discussion of his racetrack reforms . His audience applauded and at times cheered when he voiced his satisfaction that the anti-gambling bills had passed and " the connivance of the State in the betting evil at the race tracks " had been stopped for good . The assertion of the leaders , who have told President Roosevelt of late that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , in substance , - this ' : That the officials of the agricultural sOcieties , under whose auspices the counts fairs are being held , and who are re ? garded as controlling the farmer vote as . they control uany of the rural legislators . at Albany , were disgruntled because the revenue that had previously gone to the maintenance of the fairs in the form of a. percentage tax levied by the State on the gate receipts at the race tracks had been cut off by the passage of the anti-gambling bills . While a bill was passed at the same time providing for a direct appro. priation of not less than $230,000 annually for the maintenance of the fairs , the lead. , ere declare that the county fair officials did not feel nearly as secure under the new as under the old arrangement , and would give vent to their dissatisfaction at the polls if Gov .

" And the best part of it all is that nOW you can take this money and look every Man in the face without blushing , because nobody can question the source of the money by which these admirable fairs are supported , since tile connection between the State of New York and the race track gambling evil has been severed for good .
