The fire , it is supposed , started in the dry goods shop of Morris Friedman , which occupied part of the first floor and was so far advanced when discovered that nobody , could escape by the stairs . When the cry of " Fire ! " was raised there was an immediate panic , and the women and children began to scream in terror when they found that exit by the stairs had been cut off .

Pincus Friedman 's son ' CC illiam says that , hearing shrieks , he jumped up and opened the door of their apartment into the hallway . The smoke was pouring upward , and men , women , and children were running about as if they had completely lost their heads . He hastily secured the board and passed it to the opposite window and over this the terrified tenants crawled to safety . The fire was discovered about a quarter before 8 o'clock , and within ten minutes Chief Purroy was on the scene , and two more alarms were turned in .

The butcher 's shop and the bookstore on the ground floor escaped any injury , and when the fire was over were still lighted and apparently open to business . Some of the dwellers in the tenement affirmed that the fire started by an explosion in the basement , but Chief Purroy himself said he was confident it originated in the dry goods shop . The burned house , situated just half way between Clinton and Attorney Streets , belongs to A. Moses . The loss was estimated at $10,000. covered by insurance . Neither of the two adjoining buildings was injured at all , and the inmates of them looked out of the windows at the firemen as they fought the flames . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
