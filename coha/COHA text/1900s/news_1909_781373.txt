txt At the instance of Street Cleaning Commissioner Edwards , District Attorney Jerome and Magistrate Krotel , assisted by detectives , lawyers , and Deputy Street Cleaning Commissioners , began an inquisition last night at the Criminal Courts into an attempt to swindle the city out of about $50,000 by . means of dummy snow removal checks . It was announced after midnight that nine men had already been arrested , and that many more arrests would be made to-day . Deputy Street Cleaning Commissioner Hogel of the Bronx was suspended indefinitely after midnight and served - with a subpoena to appear before the Grand Jury . The swindle , as explained , by Commissioner Edwards , was by means of dummy checks purporting falsely to represent the removal of a certain amountof snow from the streets . Snow removal check blanks are printed in triplicate , and are punched by an Inspector of the department , all three parts at once . One of these copies is kept by the driver to show what he has done , another is kept by the city 's representative , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep account of what Its-Employes have done . The Street Cleaning Department felicitated itself highly upon the adoption of this scheme of paying for snow removal . Both the city and the contracting firms were supposed to have checks against the other , and each in turn against the driver . But , of course , the system went all wrong If a supply of checks got out of the regular hands and were punched and signed by dishonest inspectors . It wits estimated last night that some $30,000 ' of these bogus checks had been punched and were ready for presentation to the city . The money , however , has not been lipid , and all snow removal payments have been held up pending investigation , with the exception of tile " bread line " men . Commissioner Edwards suspected some time ago that attempts would be made to swindle the city , ft this had not already been done . He engaged a detective ; who ingratiated himself with David Jacobs . Superintendent in charge of the office of deleted paragraph Some of the contracting firms whose men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daly &; McBean people , were E. M. Hart , Phillip P. Brown , Hector Garten. and Quinn Fitzgerald . Nearly all of the men employed in the Street Cleaning Department stable at the foot of East Seventeenth Street , were called to the inquisition . Jacobs confessed , according to Edwards , that duripg the last snow this Winter he made $100 a day by the sa'e of the dummy snow checks . He declared , Mr. Edwards said , that at least 40 per cent , of the checks now ready for presentation to the city for alleged removal of the present snow are bogus . Eight city employes in the Street Clean-ing Department were arrested , charged with attempted grand larceny . Most of them were employed in stable A at the foot of East Seventeenth Street . Jacobs was arrested on the same charge .

District Attorney Jerome said early this morning , after the ' Wine prisoners had been sent to Police Headquarters , that it had been discovered that some of the Street Cleaning Department foreman who had in their possession the triplicate checks would ptuicn a number of them and then sell the proper parts of the triple set to some one connected with the contracting firms ' offices . The department rnen would ' send in their slub which would be found to tally with stubs sent in by the man in the contracting offices , and upon which money was expected to cla paid . It was Jacobs 's plan to buy from the department men these stubs for 80 per cent . of their face value , get a profit of 10 per cent . for himself , and allow to a man outside a 10 per cent . profit . This outside man furnished the money , and was called " the capitalist " in the game , according to Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners were arraigned before Magistrate Krotel , sitting in Mr. Jerome 's office , ' and held In $2,000 bail for examination on Feb. 4 .
