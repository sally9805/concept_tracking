" Lord Russell was once good enough to take me to the Derby , and that was enough for me .

As a result of that convention an amendment prohibiting gambling was added to the Constitution , thus becoming a part of the organic law .

He said , in part : " We are met here to-day to take account of a very serious evil of the gravest concern to all the people of the State , and I am very much gratified that there seems to be a disposition to take the matter up and to show the power Of public sentiment behind this movement , irrespective of race or creed , and without regard to any special religious or moral policy . " In other words , it is not a matter for the churches ; it is not a matter for any particular sect of social reformers ; it is not a. matter of Puritanical insistence Upon restriction of personal liberty ; it is not a matter in which there can be any proper . division of sentiment among the people . It is simply a plain question ? of whether the Constitution of the State of New York shall be enforced according to its letter and its spirit . Applause . " My friends , the .
