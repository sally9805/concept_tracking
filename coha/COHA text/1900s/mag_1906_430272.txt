 | NOTHING could have been more complete than the contrast between Susan Somerset 's old life in her brother 's home and the new life in her husband 's . It sometimes seemed to her that the whole thing was incredible , as if she must have changed places with her brother , she received from her husband so exactly the same services she was used to giving Peter . She ascribed it to the difference in their training . Peter had always been the only man in a New England household of women , and he expected as matter of course to be considered first and waited upon by whatever petticoated creature happened to be nearest him . One by one the aunts had died , the cousins had married or gone away , and Susan and Peter were left alone in the big house , so that it fell naturally to Susan 's lot to make up to Peter for the absence of the others . She had never thought consciously of it , taking it as the inevitable course of nature that everything should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter did not like onions , and so she never cooked them , although she was very fond of them . Peter did not like the sun shining in the windows , his eyes not being very strong , and so the shutters were always closed , although to Susan , alone day after day , the yellow glow would have been a cheering companion . Once in a while , when Peter was at work in a field far from the house , she ventured to throw open the shutters and bask in the warmth , but she always took pains to close them before the time for his return , lest he cast one of his sharp words at her . Peter liked " boiled dinner , " and they had it always for Thursday , ? although Susan disliked the smell of boiling cabbage so that she never could eat anything on that day . Peter took pride in the fire and spirit of his young horses , and they always drove to church behind a prancing , curvetting pair whose antics made the timid Susan sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet jog would have been so inexpressibly soothing to her , ate their hay in the barn . It must not be supposed for a moment that Susan resented any of this ; she never once even thought of it , in her entire devotion to her brother and in her absorbing desire to do her duty by him .  | She accepted the terrors of the ride to church quite as she accepted the horrors of a thunder-storm when she found herself alone in the big house . There was as little thought in one case as in the other of rebelling against the inevitable . It was a perpetual amazement to her to see how differently her husband looked at things . During their brief engagement she had not noticed the change so much ; but he could stay but a short time on his visit East , and insisted on marrying her and taking her back to Montana with him . On the way there Susan was like one in a dream . Jack was so surprisingly , so overwhelmingly kind to her l She was almost afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant compliance ; but the whole journey was so new an experience to the untraveled New England girl that she hardly realized that any of it was real . After they had settled down in the bright new Montana town , in the comfortable house Jack had bought , and the familiar business of housekeeping began , the reality of the difference between her husband and her brother was borne in on her . Jack had grown up on th frontier among men , and it seemed like a daily miracle to his superstitious admiration of women that he had been able to persuade the shy and flower-like Vermont girl to share his life . He looked at her adoringly as she moved about the pretty rooms , occupied with her careful reproduction of New England housekeeping , and felt a passionate desire to think of more services he could do her . Her surprise at his kindness touched his tender heart , and stirred him to wrath against the absent Peter . " Great Scotland I Your brother must be a hog and no mistake 1 " he exclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was apropos of a conversation on the subject of boiled dinner . Susan had prepared one for him , and he enjoyed it vastly , as he did all of her cooking , although he was disturbed by her eating nothing . Little by little he extracted from her the confession that it made her sick to cook cabbage . In a fury of indignant tenderness , he cried out , " Why in thunder did you cook it , then ? " And Susan , as a matter of course , " I thought you might like it . Peter does , and we always had it Thursdays . " Jack jumped up from the table , snatched the dish of cabbage and bore it outside to the chicken-yard , where he scattered it far and wide . On his return he said , with mock roughness , " If ever I see another bit of cabbage in this house , I 'll get out my gun and shoot the dishes off the table . " Later , as he smoked his pipe on the veranda , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . After that he took to investigating his brother-in-law , and was always discovering new horrors . " Say , a ' man like that would get strung up to the first tree handy if he lived out here . " This was his final verdict . At first Susan defended Peter , but so quickly do ideas change and ' so relative are all values that she soon fell into Jack 's way of thinking of him as some sort of dreadful domestic tyrant , and remembered her life in West Milton as an experience in purgatory . All but the climate ! The New England girl , used to fresh mountain air and frequent rains , pined and faded in the parching alkali Winds of Montana . Her pretty color left her and her springy step . She had frequent and terrible nervous headaches , grew listless , and sometimes peevish . Her husband was in an agony of apprehension and remorse , and devoted himself to her night and day , absenting himself from his business to wait on her and shield her from every care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morbid dread , and at the least cloud in the sky Jack would close his office , leap on his horse , always standing ready , and gallop madly to his house , to be there and comfort Susan . He tried in his rough and blundering way to keep the cares of housekeeping from her , and often tied an apron about his big square body and washed the dishes , taking great pains not to rattle them and disturb the restless and fretful woman in the next room . It was , indeed , in an effort to achieve the impossible ? to secure a servant in that frontier country ? that he undertook the expedition which proved fatal to him . He had heard of a Chinaman , forty  | miles away , who was said to know how to cook , and he had ridden furiously in that direction with the determination to " bring the Chink home if it took a gun . " No one ever knew what happened ? perhaps simply that accident incredible to Western horsemen , a fall from horseback ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , and the searching party found his body lying at the bottom of a gully . Susan was completely prostrated by the blow , and was scarcely conscious of what was done for her . Of the funeral , of the long drive to the railway station , of the interminable journey back to West Milton , she retained only the vaguest impression of misery . She did not even notice that when Peter met her at the station it was with the steady old farm-horses , or that the shutters throughout the house were thrown wide open to admit a flood of sunshine . Peter was shocked to see his sister so changed and broken . Living alone had done much to alter his ideas of things , and all the kindness and affection lying in the depths of his nature were stirred to life at the sight of the pale , languid woman , who had gone away from him a blooming girl . Indignation at the West in general , the arid , blighting West , and at Jack in particular for taking her there , glowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the despairing sorrow of the widow to try and stand in her husband 's place . And so it happened that Susan scarcely realized that Jack 's boundless devotion was no longer about her . She was very ill for a long time , when Peter nursed her incessantly , learning to know the absorbing interest of combating illness . Then during her convalescence she was so weak that he was obliged to do everything for her . It was quite as hard in the little New England hill town to get any " help " as it had been in Montana , and Peter put to good use the knowledge of housekeeping which his solitary life had given him . He took pride in showing Susan how well he could cook and wash dishes , and one day he brought in on her tray a dish of boiled onions ? an act which a white-winged angel could scarcely have surpassed in disinterested devotion . Susan was suffering from one of her " nervous spells " at the time , however , and only noticed them to remark , fretfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little scene came up before her with remorseless distinctness a few months later as she stood , haggard and anxious , with a crowd of village women waiting for the news from a wrecked train on which a number of West Milton men were returning from the county fair . " If only I 'd thanked him for the onions ! " she cried aloud again and again , straining her eyes down the track , ominously black in a starless night . No one noticed the grotesque exclamation , each one being absorbed in her dismay and woe . Indeed , when the station-master drew her on one side , and told her that he had just heard by telegraph that Peter 's dead body had been found , there was no one to support her or to go back with her to the desolate house . The whole village was desolate and filled with the sound of weeping . Not a person felt the impulse or had the strength to seek out the woman they had come to know as selfish and self-centered . Those who thought of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ceaseless selfabnegation he had led since his sister 's return from the West . No one said that more constantly or more severely than Susan herself as she sat in the silent rooms of the big house . Her isolation and the shock of her grief swept away all minor considerations , and she faced the facts of her life with a vision wonderfully purified and discerning . She went over to herself the history of her relations to Peter , and puzzled herself sick in the endeavor to see the true meaning of them . She remembered what he had been before her marriage ? the thoughtless and incredibly selfish recipient of another 's very life ; and she saw that she had made him so ; that in her way she had been as utterly selfish as he , fostering every evil quality in him to feed her own mistaken and self-righteous passion of devotion . She remembered what he had been since her return ; the boundless wealth of kindness and entire selfforgetfulness which her incessant and  | exacting demands had uncovered in him ; she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his , glowing for the first time in his life with the joy of self-sacrifice ? and she wondered at the meaning of human relationships . She realized that she had made both Peters what they had been . The first one she had shut into an intolerable prison of self-seeking while she reveled in her own debauch of selfabnegation . The second she had set free into the joyous world of forgetfulness of self , and she discovered to him the inestimable pleasure of service . But her own life ! What that had been in this second phase ! She thought of herself with horror . Drearily she went over and over the times when she had not thanked Peter , when she had taken his loving care , ungratefully , for granted . And yet , by that very means . . . She sat lost in a maze of speculations as to the astonishing ways of this world . A knock sounded on the door . After all these days of solitude , she was startled by a summons from the outside . Some one tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the key , opened the door , and confronted her brother Peter , pale , with a bandage about his head , but alive and in the flesh . He looked at her with the strange eyes of one who has gone to the gate of death . " Here I am , Susy , " he said , with a little smile that quavered off at the sight of her shocked and amazed face . " The doctors thought it was all up with me , but I guess I 'm a pretty tough nut to crack . " He swayed uncertainly , and put out his hand to the side of the door . Susan did not stir to help him , in spite of the wild burst of joy at seeing him which swept over her . A feeling deeper even than that held her motionless . Confusion and perplexity unutterable looked from her white face . " Oh ! oh ! " she cried , " what shall I do now ? " And she stood gazing at the man , with a problem centuries old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
