txt 6o THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES Saviour 's first recorded sermon ; ' and these meetinghouses were to be the starting-point for evangelisation in many cities of the Dispersion . The institutions of the synagogue left their mark , as we shall see , both upon the liturgy and upon the organisation of the Church . ' Face to face with foemen in some sense worthy of his steel , Stephen was not the man to hesitate or compromise . His triumphant logic , backed by miraculous signs , drove to exasperation opponents already humiliated by a large defection from the sacerdotal body . ' They did as the Master 's enemies had done in their determination to be rid of him at all costs . They " suborned men which said : We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God . " He was accused of speaking against the Temple and ( like Jeremiah ) predicting its destruction.4 If this accusation could win credence , their point was gained . The ruling Sadducean party had failed repeatedly to suppress the new teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sympathy of the Pharisees and the goodwill of the populace . Such a charge as this would alienate both . Before the Sanhedrin the accusation took a form interesting to us , because , however garbled , it represents obviously the substance of one side of Stephen 's teaching . " We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us . " Such a charge was not calculated to rally a Gamaliel to the side of the accused . // All parties in the Sanhedrin opposed a solid front to Stephen ; and , when he got in behind their guard with a stinging thrust , fell upon him in merciless fury . To hear themselves called " uncircumcised in heart and ears " was more than they could endure . They stopped their ears , they gnashed their teeth , they rushed upon him . As the vision of his ascended Lord lit up a face that even before had been " as the face of an angel , " the martyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged along the narrow streets to be stoned outside the city walls . With words of pardon on his lips that echo his Master 's dying prayer , and mark ( when compared with the dying words of Zechariah , son of Jehoiada ) the contrast between the old spirit and the new , 3 the protomartyr yields up his spirit to the Lord Jesus , and seals his testimony with that blood which was to be the " seed of the Church . " 4 This first taste of blood ? only possible because Judaea was for the moment without a Roman pro-curator 5 ? was the signal for a fierce assault upon the members of the Church . The Apostles themselves remained in Jerusalem , unmoved , as ever , by the blasts of persecu-tion : but the mass of the believers withdrew from the city and were scattered throughout Judaea and Samaria , carrying with them that very doctrine which the persecutors desired to extirpate . In Judaea the subsequent narrative incidentally // shews us bodies of believers at Lydda and Joppa , and a number of unnamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities of Gaza and Ashdod are mentioned in connexion with St. Philip ; 2 and in Samaria , besides the city of that name and the many Samaritan villages evangelised by St. Peter and St. John , 3 Caesarea on the sea-coast , 4 the residence of the Roman procurator . Beyond the limits of Samaria , on the northern frontier of Palestine , we also find groups of believers at Damascus in Phoenicia , and at Antioch on the Orontes , and even in the neighbouring island of Cyprus . The Jewish converts in the three last-named districts are expressly mentioned as among the fruits of this par-ticular persecution ; ' and the other groups may prob-ably have originated in the same way . The story of the evangelisation of Samaria is associated with the name of Stephen 's colleague Philip " the evangelist , " and from St. Luke 's narrative we gather all-important details with regard to the original organisation of the Church . Notable among these is the first mention of that rite known to us now as Con-firmation , supplementing by the laying on of apostolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ministers . St. Peter and St. John , despatched by the Apostolic College , journeyed from Jerusalem to Samaria for the express purpose of completing the sacramental work of St. Philip . Here also comes upon the scene the celebrated Simon Magus , with whose subsequent history tradition // has been very busy , making him the first of the heresiarch s.4 St. Philip 's activities were not , however , confined to Samaria . Called southward by a special revelation , he converted and baptized on the desert road between Jerusalem and Gaza a eunuch of Candace , Queen of Ethiopia , and thus flashed the good news to the upper waters of the Nile , beyond the regions represented even by the concourse of the " Dispersed " who had listened to Peter 's sermon on the Day of Pentecost . Finally from Ashdod he makes an evangelistic progress up the coast-line to-wards Caesarea , " preaching the Gospel to all the cities " on the way , " including , no doubt , Jamnia , Joppa , and Apollonia . At Caesarea he evidently settled for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his four prophetess daughters.3 After an unspecified interval , during which occurred the conversion of the arch-persecutor and the cessation of the storm of persecution , 4 we are told of St. Peter going in circuit through a number of Palestinian villages , including , doubtless , those evangelised by him and St. John on their return journey from Samaria . Wherever he goes he bears with him the power of his risen Master . To the group of " saints " at Lydda he comes and brings sudden healing to an eight-years bed-ridden paralytic with the words : " Aeneas , Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise and make thy bed ! " An immense impression is created in the neighbourhood , resulting , // it would seem , in the wholesale conversion of the pop-ulation of Lydda and Sharon . ' To Joppa , some ten miles off , whither St. Philip had preceded him , he passes at the earnest entreaty of the " disciples , " and works there a still greater wonder , raising to life the dead lady Tabitha whose charitable works had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carries on the work of his Master , whose words 2 he uses at Lydda , and whose gesture at the raising of Jairus ' daughter 3 he repeats at Joppa . But a new departure was soon to be made and a greater marvel performed at Caesarea in the conversion of the Roman centurion Cornelius and his household . In the incident of the Syro-Phoenician woman in the Gospel we see a foreshadowing of the " Gospel to the Gentiles , " but our Lord expressly speaks of it as exceptional in relation to His own ministry . ' Another of the Saviour 's miracles of mercy brings before us a centurion , ' like Cornelius , devout and munificent , loved and esteemed by the Jewish community of his city , whose faith astonished the Lord Himself , and was made the text of a universalistic prediction. ? But it is clear from the narrative of the Acts that the full significance of these precedents had not dawned as yet upon the Apostles , nor that of St. Philip 's baptism of the eunuch ( who may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter , certainly , was still unconscious of the wide range of the message , nor did he look for the inclusion of " many from the east and the west " // who were not by inheritance " sons of the kingdom " in the realm of " Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . " The prophecy of Joel , " all flesh , " still meant to him , apparently , all Jewry ? Jewry in its world-wide dis-persion , near and far , but Jewry still . He had been a party to the ordination of the proselyte Nicolas , but still held the traditional Jewish view that Gentiles , as such , were " unclean , " and effectually outside the Covenant . How deeply ingrained was this prejudice in him we may see from his subsequent momentary relapse at Antioch . ' But now he was to commit himself to the momentous principle that " to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life . " A vision at noonday as he meditated fasting on the roof of his host 's house at Joppa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down of timehonoured barriers : " What God hath cleansed , make not thou common ! " s A corresponding revelation instructed Cornelius to send for St. Peter and listen to his message . The Spirit bade the Apostle accede to the foreigner 's request . When he arrived at Caesarea mutual explana-tions brought about a cordial understanding , and during the delive.y of the Gospel-message , proclaiming Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah and Judge of all man-kind , the phenomena of Pentecost were repeated . The whole household of Cornelius became recipients of the Holy Ghost , Who manifested His presence by their ecstatic utterances and ascriptions of praise . Their baptism followed as a matter of course : and // thus there was added to the Church its first group of Gentile converts . Of Cornelius we are told that he was a centurion of the " Italian Cohort , " that is , of one of the auxiliary cohorts recruited from Italian volun-teers . The words used about his religious devotion and that of his household imply that ( perhaps like the centurion of the Gospel ) he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " devout " or " God-fearing " as they were called , ' who figure prominently in the Acts among the early converts to Christianity . He was , however , uncircumcised , and therefore techni-cally as far outside the Covenant as any among the large majority of his fellow Gentiles , to whom the Jews and their religion were matters of aversion and ridi-cule . St. Peter confirmed his fraternal relations with the new-made disciples by accepting of their hospitality . The lesson of his vision , corroborated by the descent of the Spirit upon his converts , emboldened him to take a step that would scandalise the stricter brethren at Jerusalem . On his return he found that the extremists laid stress upon this as though it were the most important ? and the most discreditable ? aspect of his doings at Caesarea : " Thou wentest in , " they exclaimed , " to men uncircum-cised and didst eat with them 1 " 2 St. Peter thereupon rehearsed the whole matter to the Apostles and brethren , and won from them a response of thanksgiving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Church of Jerusa-lem was , officially , convinced , and the precedent had a // powerful influence at a later date , though the example of Cornelius ' conversion was not to bear fruit at once . The jealousy of the more conservatively Judaistic members hid itself only for a season , remaining to wreak upon Paul the rancour of which Peter had only experienced a taste . Meanwhile the disciples who had been scattered abroad by the persecution were evangelising Jews even beyond the bounds of Palestine . Phoe-nicia ? the land of Tyre and Sidon ? and Coele-Syria , the strip of coast to the north of it , lying on the fringe of the area where Christ Himself had preached in the flesh , and Cyprus , Barnabas ' island home , were traversed by these mis-sionaries , who established themselves ultimately in the great Gentile city of Antioch , centre of government , commerce , and culture , which , by its position on the trade route to Assyria and its other natural advantages , had attained the position of one of the first cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyrene ( among the latter , probably , the Lucius men-tioned a little later ) took the initiative independently of St. Peter , and perhaps contemporaneously with , or earlier than , his admission of Cornelius , preached , we are told , to the . Greeks . " By " Greeks " ( the most strongly supported reading in this passage ) 2 Gentiles are obviously meant , and probably Gentiles of that " devout " and " God-fearing " class that frequented the Hellenist synagogues . Here the ground proved fertile ; and the number of the disciples increased so fast that , // the fame spreading to Jerusalem , the Church thought fit to send Barnabas , a special commissioner , to promote and organise , and perhaps to report upon the work . his genial influence , which may well have been responsible for the conversion of those nameless Cypriot missionaries who had preceded him in the city , attracted still greater numbers , impelling him to fetch his protege Saul from Tarsus , and they worked together for a whole year , with results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity as the " Apostle of the Gentiles " par excellence became thus associated with a Church which , even before his arrival , numbered a majority of uncircumcised Gentiles among its members . And here in Antioch , where the name " Christian " first arose ? cast as a term of ridicule , it would seem , upon the brethren by the witty Antiochenes , celebrated in antiquity as coiners of nicknames ? here the Christian Church first began to realise its independence of Judaism . Stephen had died , so Saul would have said a few years ago , for the fact that Jesus should " change the customs which Moses had delivered . " 1 There was more truth in that than they had suspected who carried the first martyr to his burial . Antioch was to be the champion of Christian freedom against Judaistic legalism , and at the same time the Mother Church of Gentile Christianity . CHAPTER IV THE CHURCH OF THE CIRCUMCISION BEFORE we follow out the splendid results of the work of Paul and Barnabas at Antioch on the Orontes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , the fortunes of the more conservative Christian community at Jerusalem . We shall find ourselves , so to speak , in a backwater . It is from Antioch that the stream flows onward , growing in breadth and depth and volume till it has fertilised with its living waters the whole of the Mediterranean world . The influence of the Jerusalem Church upon the world at large is henceforth , in , the main , of a nega tive character . It is by contrast with the ideals that prevail there that the Christian Church universal becomes conscious of its freedom , its independence , its capacity for immeasurable progress and develop ment . " While the young Church of Antioch , " says Dr. Shirley , " had . . . become the source of the apostle-ship of the Gentiles and the capital of Gentile Christendom , the mother church of Jerusalem con tinued to be centre of that severe and unbending Hebraism which seems , as a rule , to have marked the converted Pharisee . None indeed desired more 69 7o THE CHURCH OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they desired it upon condition of a close continuity with the religious past of their nation ; they desired that the Gospel should be a more glorious expansion of the Law , giving to its disciples a new strength to observe the divine precepts , a clearer and keener vision of the glory of the divine promises . They looked upon the Mosaic Law as something perfect and unchangeable ; upon circumcision as the perpetual rite of admission into covenant with God . " 1 The reason for this attitude is not far to seek . The original Apostles were , one and all , Jews of Palestine . Their minds , though uplifted uniquely by personal contact with the Saviour , and infused with ideas of an essentially universal scope , ' moved ever in a strictly Hebraic environment , at any rate so long as they abode still in the Holy City . The Temple overshadowed their lives : its daily and weekly routine of worship formed part of the texture of their devotional habit . If the unspeakable memories of Passiontide had left any touch of indignation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the populace , those feelings , as is clearly shown by the tone of St. Peter 's early speeches , ' had been transfigured by the glorious sequel , and transformed by the Pentecostal Gift into a passionate and yearning pity for those who had ignorantly " killed the Prince of Life . " So intimately // had the spirit of the Master 's dying intercession ' . penetrated the temper of Hi followers . Even the friction necessarily caused by the con-tinued hostility of the priestly authorities did not avail to embitter the disciples , nor to turn from them ( in the early days ) the goodwill of the populace . ' It is not surprising , then , that a Church breathing this intensely Hebraic atmosphere , and recruited largely from the Pharisaic school ' and the Aaronic priesthood , 4 should have lived on such friendly terms with its unconverted neighhours as to be scarcely conscious of the great gulf which separated the present from the past . The Master had , after all , declared that He was come not to destroy the Law but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity to ecclesiastical usage , both Levitical and later ; 5 and many of His say-ings were capable in this environment of an interpre-tation not unfavourable to Judaizing tendencies . It was only in the wider horizon of Gentile Christianity that the true relation of the Old Covenant to the New could be realised in its right proportion and perspec-tive . At Pentecost , it is true , many dialects and ten-dencies were represented by St. Peter 's pilgrim audi-ence : but their very presence there , with all it implied of preliminary trouble , danger , and expense , bespeaks in them a special devotion to the " religion of the fathers . " There were doubtless many bigots besides Saul of // Tarsus , among those who had been brought up amid the liberalising possibilities of Hellenic culture ; and pilgrims , if not invariably fanatical , are essentially votaries of the traditional . Preaching to them , St. Peter quotes words of Joel which admit of a universalistic application , but ( as we have already seen ) i there is no reason to suppose that either speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wider scope than that which would include proselytes of the Dispersion . The crisis which led to the appointment of the Seven , when a growing number of Hellenic Jews of the Dispersion attached themselves to the community , the preaching of Stephen , the evangelisation of Samaria after his martyrdom , and the train of events which led to admission of Cornelius and his household ? all these circumstances contributed towards the adoption of a wider outlook , and led up to the still greater venture of the Antiochene community , marked by the conver-sion of the educated pagan Sergius Paulus , ' and the momentous decision proclaimed at Antioch in Pisidia : " Lo we turn to the Gentiles ! " 3 But we can see all along how slowly and hesitatingly the Church of Jerusalem moved . It needed a special vision to convince 4 and to justify ' St. Peter in his action with regard to Cornelius ; and Cornelius after all , i f a Gentile by birth and uncircumcised , ' was already friendly with and highly esteemed by the Jewish com-munity at Caesarea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactor . ' We are the less astonished , there-fore , at the unfortunate relapse into which the Apostle momentarily fell on a subsequent visit to Antioch , when , under the stress of the stricter traditionalism of those " of the circumcision " who " came from James , " he belied the principles of his action at Caesarea and declined any longer to eat at the same table with Gentile Christians.2 But St. Peter and St. James , " the Lord 's Brother , " represent , on the whole , the liberal and progressive tendency in the Jerusalem Church , as we shall see when we come to describe the Apostolic Council of 49 A.D. The ultra-conservative tendency was apparently embodied rather in the rank and file ? in the emissaries of James rather than in James himself ? and expressed itself in a policy which meant for the Apostle of the Gentiles not a momentary conflict with the " Pillars " of the Church , resulting in a clearer understanding and improved relations , but in a life-long struggle against jealousy , misrepresentation , and antagonistic propa-ganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Paul , whose opposi-tion is recorded by St. Luke in the cities of Asia Minor , Macedonia , and Greece , 3 were in the first instances , no doubt , pure unconverted Jews , angry that their former champion should be spreading so successfully the faith he had previously persecuted ; and no wonder , when they saw // a Pharisee at work " dethroning the people and the religion of Israel , tearing the Gospel from its Jewish soil and rooting it in the soil of humanity . " ' But in the Epistles ( and conspicuously in the Epistle to the Galatians ) we see the Apostle in conflict with the false teaching of emissaries of the Judaistic party in the Christian Church of Jerusalem ? self-constituted apostles of a gospel that is no gospel at all . In the Epistle just named St. Paul mentions two visits to Jerusalem , three and fourteen years respectively after his conversion , in which he upheld his own position . The former occasion was that of a private stay of a fortnight 's duration with St. Peter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council ) was embittered by the presence of spies , suborned , it would seem , by the iutransiyca ? ts to seek evidence of unfaithfulness to tradition both in his conduct and in that of his companions Barnabas and Titus . A bold , uncompromising front was op-posed to these doubtful measures ; and the chief Apostles , James , Peter , and John ? perhaps the only ones then left in Jerusalem ? expressed themselves frankly ready to partition the mission-field and devote themselves primarily to the evangelisation of the " Circumcision , " recognising the Gentile Apostolate of Barnabas and Paul.2 But it is at a subsequent time that St. Paul writes the Epistle in question ? some four years afterwards , probably ( 53 A.D. ) and , as lie writes , he still complains of Judaizers who subvert his teaching and challenge his apostleship : in fact , the reactionary tendency re-mained strong in the Palestinian Church long after // St. James and St. Paul had passed away . This tendency marks , though it does not mar , most of the Catholic Epistles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such documents as the Didiache and the so-called Epistle of Barnabas , strongly anti-Judaic though the latter is in another sense . ' For us the most important expression of the ten-dency is that which led to the famous Council of Jerusalem , the first of the ecclesiastical Councils of Christendom . At that point we may now take up the history of the Palestinian Church , and briefly sketch its fortunes to the end of our period , pausing at the moment of the destruction of city and Temple to consider the lessons of that great catastrophe . When Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch after their first missionary circuits they doubtless set themselves with all zeal to evangelise their pagan neighbours in the great centre of Hellenic civilisation and international intercourse on the Orontes . The comparative proximity of Antioch to Jerusalem , and the constant intercourse between the two cities , brought members of the Jerusalem Church into frequent contact with a Christian community in which the Gentile element was daily assuming larger proportions . Thus problems were raised somewhat analogous to the racial questions which still perplex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : though in the modern case there is not the excuse of long-standing religious prejudice . The rigidly Hebraic Christians could not at once over76 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES come their traditional abhorrence of familiar inter course with Gentiles ? an abhorrence which amounted no doubt in many cases to a physical repulsion even though they accepted those Gentiles as " brethren " in Christ . Least of all was such a thing possible in the case of Gentiles who had not submitted to the rite of circumcision . " Uncircum cised " to a Hebrew vaguely suggested a long series of polluting possibilities . The very meals of the uncircumcised , if not directly contaminated by idolatrous associations , ' were apt to involve direct breaches of the Ceremonial Law , as the eating of things strangled and of blood : while carnal impurity was not unnaturally regarded as a characteristic feature of Gentile life . Tut undoubtedly the problem of circumcision itself was that of the greatest importance . If , as the emissaries of the reactionary party stoutly maintained , ' circumcision was an in dispensable condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to baptism so many uncircumcised converts , might well fear lest he should prove to " have run , or be running in vain . " It was decided to refer the question to the Apostles and Presbyters at Jerusalem . At this date ( e. 49 A.D. ) , if we are to trust a tradition preserved in various forms and consonant with the known facts , the Twelve had ceased to reside , as a body , in the Holy City . An express command of the Lord had detained them there ( so the tradition runs ) till the completion of the twelfth year after the Ascension . Tut now some eight or nine years would have passed since their dispersion to their various fields of missionary THE CHURCH OF THE CIRCUMCISION Try work . Only Peter and john ( as the Epistle to the Galatians implies ' ) , and with them James " the Lord 's Brother , " remained in the vicinity ; and John , apparently , took no prominent part in the Council . The representatives of each side went up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul . Their last visit to the city had been on the occasion of the great famine predicted by Agabus , - which reached its crisis towards the end of 46 A.v.3 When the illus-trious convert to Judaism , Queen Helena of Adiabene , was bringing succour to her suffering co-religionists , 4 the two Apostles of the Gentiles had brought alms also for their fellow Christians from the newly planted Gentile churches . Doubtless it was remembered in their favour . The decision of the Council was definite and clear-cut . On minor questions , concerned with the ritual of social intercourse , Jewish prejudices were respected : on the main issue the party of free-dom and progress was decisively victorious . Never again could circumcision with its attendant obligations be demanded as a necessary condition of entrance into the Church of Christ . But even apart from this all-important decision , the description of the first Apostolic Council is full of deep interest . If we would endeavour to picture the scene we can not do better than employ the words of a recent commentator . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or of some Christian synagogue , ' sat the apostles and presbyters facing the multitude . In the centre of the semicircle was the chair of St. James , the president of the Church of Jerusalem ; on his right were sitting St. Peter and St. John , on his left St. Barnabas and St. Paul , with the other delegates from Antioch . " The first point to be noticed is that it is not one of the Twelve ? St. Peter or St. John ? who presides in the assembly , but James . The narrative of the Acts at this point 2 is paralleled in the account , given in a later chapter , of St. Paul 's reception by the Church some eight years after . " The day following , " says St. Luke , " Paul went in with us unto James , and all the Presbyters were present . " 3 It is further corroborated by the phraseology which St. Paul uses in the passage of his letter to the Galatians already quoted ? a passage which may probably refer to the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John " is the order in which he there names the recognised " Pillars " of the Church . ' We can not but see in this presidency of St. James a remarkable instance of " the principle of local rank and authority in the hierarchy of the Christian Church , " such as is familiar to us a genera-tion later under the name of diocesan episcopacy . " Less than an apostle elsewhere , in Jerusalem St. James takes precedence of the very chief of the Twelve . " 4 As for the constitution of the Council , it seems to // have consisted of the Apostles and Presbyters , with whom the laity ( " the whole multitude " ) were associated as audience of the discussion . St. James presides and sums up . The decretal letter , based on his decision , is drawn up in the name of " the Apostles , Presbyters , and Brethren , " and the bearers of it chosen and commissioned by " the Apostles and Pres-byters with the whole Church . " Finally , the decision boldly claims the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to the Holy Ghost and to us . " ' In the light of this simple narrative we may notice how very " scriptural " in character were the subsequent Councils of the undivided Church , and may observe , for our comfort , that the highest possible claim may be made for decrees which have been hammered out on the anvil of dis-cussion , in the heated atmosphere of human passion and party spirit . We may notice also another parallel with the Councils of the following centuries in the mingling of temporary with permanent elements in the decrees , and the way in which these were subse-quently sifted by the instinct of the Church at large , whose acceptance has always been held essential to the ultimate validity of such decisions . As regards circumcision there was never any further doubt , though the irreconcilables in the Church of Jerusalem continued to behave as though the Council had never met . As to " meats offered to idols , " while St. John at the end of the century couples such with " fornication " as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul felt himself at liberty as early as 8o THE CHURCH OI ' THE APOSTLES 56 A.D. ? that is , according to the chronology here adopted , less than a decade after the Council ? to give special regulations to his Corinthian converts . ' " Strangled " and " blood " soon lost their literal sig nificance , and in the mouths of the Church 's theo logians came to be regarded as metaphors , the latter being sometimes interpreted as though it were a con demnation of homicide ! Once more , in view of the many shades of opinion held to-day on various subjects among those who claim to be loyal children of the Church , it is well worth while to note the part played in and after the Council by St. James , St. Peter , and St. Paul as show ing how " free play of individual character and even divergence of opinion " 2 may be consistent with even Apostolic loyalty to the common faith . St. Paul , the advocate of liberty in the Council , shows himself " all things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge each case on its merits , to circumcise Timothy , 4 and leave Titus uncircumcised.5 He throws back upon the conscience of the Corinthians the responsibility of deciding on each occasion their attitude towards idol-meats . Unflinching , where the future of Christianity is concerned , in his stand for a charter of liberty from the ceremonial law , he yields eight years later ? when the battle has been won ? to James ' persuasion and associates himself with Nazarite purification , with unfortunate results to himself . St. Peter , fresh from his private conversations with // St. Paul , utters in the Council language of more than Pauline vehemence : " Now therefore why tempt ye God that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , even as they . " ' It is the old Peter of the Gospels , at bottom impetuous , impressionable , swift to veer round repentantly from obstinacy to the oppo-site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generous one , of his cowardly attitude at Antioch , when through momentary lack of moral courage he had retired from the table of the uncircumcised brethren and belied his own principles learnt at Caesarea . Clearly St. Paul had brought home to him on that occasion ( the winter of 48 ? 9 A.D. , just before the Council is the most prob-able date of the incident at Antioch ) the full signifi-cance of his own conduct with regard to Cornelius ; and St. Peter here " employs to others the argument that had convinced himself . " 3 Nor can we fail to notice the " Pauline " tone of his later thought , as evinced in the Epistle written some fifteen years after the Council . St. James , who apparently formulated the Council 's decree , is thus in a special sense responsible for the omission of circumcision from its demands . Here , as in his Epistle , he is the Apostle of wisdom , practical and peaceable . Secure in the affections of all parties , he strikes a note of firmness yet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APOSTLES ment prophecy the argument which St. Peter had drawn from his own experience , and Barnabas and Paul corroborated from theirs . With a breadth of view and an insight of which many of his Hebraist brethren were incapable , he can see in Amos ' pro phecyl of a Messianic restoration of the glories of the Davidic empire a virtual prediction of the free calling of the Gentiles into the kingdom of David 's Lord , and in this calling a part of God 's eternal counsel . But he dwells characteristically on the advantage of a weekly promulgation of Mosaic doctrine in the syna gogues of the Dispersion , " and is careful to include in the terms of the decree a concession to some of the strongest prejudices of the Jew . So , too , when he next comes upon the scene it is to identify himself with those " myriads of Jews who believed " in Christ and yet were " zealous of the Law , " 3 and to urge on St. Paul a marked concession to their prejudices as a just return ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentiles at this Council.4 The sketch drawn for us by St. Luke , of the three chief actors at the Council , is not only life-like but consistent with the other hints which the New Testa ment furnishes : while that of St. James has not a few points of contact with the record left by Hegesippus , a Palestinian writer of the second century , of the illustrious Nazarite and ascetic , famous for his austeri ties and prayers , and loved even by the unbelieving Jews , who called him " the Just " and " the People 's Rampart . " But it is time to complete our sketch of the external history of the Palestinian Church . // It is noticeable that the Church 's periods of greatest trouble correspond with inter ) efJiin , or moments when the Roman rule in Palestine was temporarily slackened . The stoning of Stephen represents ( according to a probable chronology ) an arrogation of authority by the religious leaders of the Jews at a moment when Judaea was temporarily without a procurator , after the disgrace of Pontius Pilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. 35 . The accession of Herod Agrippa I , grandson of Herod the Great , brought with it a second temporary weakening of Roman influence . Agrippa was a favourite of the Emperor Caligula , who , in 37 A.D. , gave him the dominions beyond Jordan that had descended to his uncle , Herod Philip , on the first Herod 's death in B.c. 4 , but had relapsed after Philip 's decease ( A.D. 34 ) to the province of Syria . Two years later , in 39 A.D. , Agrippa inherited his uncle Antipas ' dominions of Galilee , Decapolis , and Peraea , and two years later again ( A.D. 41 ) received in addition from Claudius the Roman province of Judaea . His entrance upon the kingdom seems to have been the signal for the dis-persion of the Apostolic band , Peter and John alone of the Twelve remaining in the Holy City . ' The former kingdom of Herod the Great was for a few years reconstituted ; and its monarch , the grandson of him who had bathed Bethlehem in innocent blood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reign by the first recorded martyrdom of an // Apostle and the imprisonment of another , a sop to the passions of his Jewish subjects . ' After his death a swift retribution , graphically , and independently , described by both St. Luke and Josephus ' ? Judaea became again a Roman province ; and so it remained until the increasing turbulence and growing spirit of rebellion brought upon its people the national extinc tion which the Saviour had foretold . Herod Agrippa II , son of the King just named , though not permitted to inherit his father 's dominions , ' had more than one opportunity of reversing his policy and showing friendliness to the Christian community of Jerusalem . He was a favourite of Claudius , who gave him in the year 50 A.D. the little kingdom of Chalcis in Antilibanus , and conferred on him also a certain power of surveil-lance of the Temple in Jerusalem with the right of appointing and deposing the High Priest . It is this Agrippa who showed kindly feeling to-wards St. Paul when he was tried before the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sions he was enabled to display a similar attitude . The former is connected with the martyrdom of James the Just ( 61 A.D. ) , the latter with the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 . The narrative of St. Paul 's last visit to the city in the spring of 57 A.D.4 gives us a vivid picture of the state of feeling in Jerusalem at that period . The fanatical tendencies of the rank and file in the Church of the Circumcision are outrun by the more than fanatical spirit of the unTHE // converted Jews . We hear the first rumblings of that earthquake of turbulence which was , in little more than a decade , to reduce the city to ruins . Under the leadership of St. James , the Judaistic tendencies of the Church of the Circumcision had become intensified and consolidated . The events of recent years ? St. Paul 's second and third missionary circuits , in which he had penetrated as far as Macedonia and Greece , pursued everywhere by Judaizers ? and per haps still more the tone and teaching of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem , on the temper of the Mother Church and made it more conservative than ever . The language of the Epistles to the Thessalonians and Corinthians was calculated to scandalise the extremists , and still more that of the letter to the Galatian Churches , ' written probably in 53 A.D. And now , just recently , he had set forth with calm assurance , in an Epistle to the Church at Rome , the thoughts " presented tumultuously in the letter to the Galatians . " If we may suppose that rumours of the purport and argument of the Roman Epistle had preceded the Apostle to Jerusalem , and had been discussed in Jewish-Christian circles before his arrival , we can understand his apprehension and its justifica tion . The presentiment of coming misfortune which had lent so pathetic a tone to his farewell address to the Ephesian presbyters , ' and had been enforced by the subsequent words of Agabus at Caesarea , 4 were indeed fully justified by the event . St. Paul and his com86 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES panions had , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their report was received with thanksgiving by St. James and his synod of presbyters : though we may perhaps read , between the lines of the narrative , a certain suspicion of coldness and formality in the congratulations which obviously could not be withheld . The authorities of the Church were not a little nervous as to the effect which the appearance of St. Paul might produce in the city ; and their hasty congratulations are quickly merged in cautions and warnings . ' It was well known that St. Paul had fierce enemies outside the Church , while not a few of its members more than suspected him . To humour them St. James proposed and St. Paul ? perhaps half against his better judgment ? assented to a course which brought matters to a crisis . He made himself responsible for the expenses of four Jewish-Christian Nazarites and associated himself with them in the observances of the last seven days of their votive period , shaving his head and joining with them in the customary ritual of purification . ' Thus engaged , he was found and recog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies , " Jews of Asia , " hailing probably from Ephesus : who , by a slight effort of imagination , pictured him as having introduced his Gentile com panion Trophimus within the sacred enclosure.3 The story of the assault made upon him by the fanatical mob , of his protective arrest in the nick of time by the Roman garrison , of his spirited and eloquent speech to the crowd who listened patiently to the story of his conversion ? told as it was in their beloved // mother-tongue ? till the hated word " Gentile " fell from his lips , the account of his appearance before the Sanhedrin ( the Roman Tribune , Claudias Lysias presiding ) and his war-cry there , " A Pharisee ! " ? the story of his imprisonment in the Castle Antonia and the plot to assassinate him , the hurried night journey under escort to Caesarea , and the two years ' imprison ment there , ending with the appeal to Caesar and the voyage to Rome ? all this is described for us by St. Luke in his most graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , and pass on to the subse quent history of the Church in that city to which he had said so hurried a farewell . Just four years after that wild scene on the steps of the castle , the same vicinity witnessed a more tragic event in the martyrdom of James the Just , whose Judaistic tendencies , though combined with an austere saintliness that won general reverence and admiration , availed not to preserve him from the violence of a fanaticism upon which the restraint of Roman rule had once more been temporarily relaxed . Porcius Festus , the procurator of Judaea , at whose tribunal Paul had made his appeal to Caesar , died , it would seem , in the December of A.D. 60 . His successor , Albinus , appointed in the following January , travelled from Rome to his province by way of Alexandria , and did not reach Jerusalem till June , 61 A.D. The interval was , as usual , the enemy 's opportunity . The High Priest was Ananus or Annas II , son of the Annas of the Gospels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the High Priestly office . ' King Agrippa had set $8 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES him up in place of Joseph ben Cabi , apparently at the time of Festus ' death . Ananus had the truculent , overbearing character of his clan ; he seized the oppor-tunity to take the law into his own hands and institute a persecution of the hated " Nazarenes . " Many of them were stoned to death , says Josephus , ' by order of the Sanhedrin , and among them James ? to the great scandal of the more righteous-minded citizens . The more picturesque account of Hegesippus , preserved for us by Eusebius , ' speaks of St. James as having been cast from a pinnacle of the Temple , and then done to death with a club ; and speaks of his monument as still existing , near the site of the Temple , late in the second century . This happened in Passover-time , and precisely on March 25th of the year 61 . Protests were made to Albinus ? a deputa-tion being sent to meet him at Alexandria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offending High Priest . But the blood of the righteous was soon to be visited on the devoted city . Eusebius ( or his authorities ) with the dramatic foreshortening of a retrospect , makes the siege to follow immediately on the martyrdom ; and Origen 's copy of . Josephus apparently traced a causal connexion between the two.3 As a matter of fact Ananus was to have four successors ere the High Priesthood ceased , but these covered a space of but twice as many years . As the execution of the son of Zebedee was followed by the sudden death of Herod Agrippa 1 , so too after the death of this other James the doom // of his murderers came speedily . By 64 A.D. Judaea was in full rebellion . Among the first victims of the reign of terror was the former High Priest Ananias , son of Nebedaeus , whom St. Paul stigmatised as " Whited Wall . " His son Eleazar , by fanatical counsels , had been largely responsible for the final breach with Rome . ' Caught and butchered as he crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did he recall , one wonders , the prophetic retort of the unjustly smitten Apostle : " God shall smite thee " In the autumn of 66 the Roman garrison was massacred , and after an ineffectual attempt on the part of the Legate , Cestius Gallus , to recapture the city , Vespasian appeared in the field , by order of Nero . In 67 ? perhaps the year of St. Paul 's martyrdom at Rome ? the general recaptured Galilee . The following year Nero died ; and Vespasian returned to Rome , leaving the command in the hands of Titus . Meanwhile the city suffered those throes and pangs foretold by her Messiah , and described for us in the graphic pages of Josephus . The tyrannical Sadducean rulers got their deserts , and were massacred to a man : fanatics and brigands disputed possession of the Temple , and unnameable atrocities were committed within the city by a population maddened by despera-tion , fury , and famine while those whom they ejected were crucified in hundreds , by order of the Roman general , in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of King // Agrippa came into play . The Christian community , mindful of their Lord 's injunction , ' and warned ( says the tradition preserved by Eusebius2 ) " by a revelation vouchsafed to approved men there before the war , " retired from the city ere the last blows fell , and took refuge within the dominions of the friendly King in the Hellenic city of Pella in Decapolis . The spectacle of that great catastrophe ? the ruin of the Jewish State with its capital and sanctuary ? must have created an enormous impression on the Church of the Circumcision ; and , though the New Testament books have nothing to say of the event , except , as it were , prophetically , it has not failed to leave its mark on the Jewish-Christian literature of the first cen-tury.3 To the Circumcision-Christians it must have brought a real crisis ? a crisis for which the Epistle to the Hebrews was not improbably intended to prepare . The catastrophe was obviously a just punishment of the nation for having rejected and crucified the Messiah ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judaeo-Christians into the arms of their Gentile brethren.4 " After the martyrdom of James , " says Eusebius , " and the conquest of Jerusalem which immediately followed , it is said that those of the apostles and disciples of the Lord that were stil living came together from all directions , with those that were related to the Lord according to THE CHURCH OF THE CIRCUMCISION the flesh ( for the majority of them also were still alive ) , to take cotmsel as to who was worthy to succeed James . They all with one consent pro-nounced Symeon , the son of Clopas , of whom the Gos-pel also makes mention , to be worthy of the episcopal throne of that parish . He was a cousin , as they say , of the Saviour , for Hegesippus records that Clopas was a brother of Joseph . " ' That the story of the meeting itself comes from Hegesippus is not clear ; and , iF it be authentic , it must imply an interregnum of some two or three years in the Church of the Circumcision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fall of the city . But Symeon was certainly St. James ' suc-cessor , and presided over the flock till his own martyr-dom under Trajan ( c. 107 A.D. ) . A further interest , however , attaches to the circumstances of his election , for we have here , if the tradition is to be trusted , the mention of a second Apostolic Council : a council which must inevitably have taken the opportunity of deliberating on some of the many problems that had arisen since the date of the first council at Jerusalem , some twenty years before . Prominent among those problems would be that of the settled government of the Church . Christ 's prom-ised Advent had been in part fulfilled . He had come and visited with judgment the apostate nation : but the event had disentangled for the believer two hitherto intermingled strains of prediction , ' and it had become clearer than ever that the expectation of a complete and final Advent must not interfere with the establishment of the machinery of a settled organisation . None could know " the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Church must behave , at any rate , as though there lay before her an indefinitely long sojourn in this world . St. Clement of Rome , writing probably in 94 A.D. , some twenty years or more after the time of which we speak , after referring to the Christian ministry in terms of the levitical orders of high priest , priest , and levite , mentions the careful arrangements made by the Apostles for the continuous and peaceful succession of that ministry . ' It seems therefore not improbable that this second council of the Apostles in 70 or 71 A.D. ( if such there were ) , assembled , as it was , primarily for the purpose of appointing a successor to the chair of St. James , marks a definite point in the development of that threefold ministry which is traditionally connected more especially with the name of St. John , 2 and was certainly in full career before his death . Less convincing , perhaps , but yet not without some reasonable ground , is Dr. Shirley 's conjecture3 that this same council is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that " those who have followed the second ordinances of the Apostles know that the Lord has ordained a new offering in the New Covenant , according to the prophet Malachi . " What more natural than that some pronouncement should have been made upon the nature and meaning // of the Holy Eucharist , round which already in 56 A.D. grave abuses had arisen in the Achaian Churches ; 1 and that the leaders of the Church should have delivered a message of comfort to the Hebrew Chris-tians now deprived for ever of their Temple sacrifices , assuring them that in the Master 's ordinance they had at hand the fulfilment of all their spiritual needs ? The application of Malachi 's prophecy ' of a " pure offering in every place " to the Eucharist soon took its place among the commonplaces of Christian inter-pretation , and appears already in the Jewish-Christian literature of the end of the first century . ' However this may be , there can be little doubt that the catastrophe which befell the Holy City and the Temple had an important effect upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old landmarks were removed , and the absence of material associations lent itself to a reasonable idealisation of ancient ceremonial . Chris-tendom , walking now by faith and not by sight in these matters , was enabled , with the aid of the elaborate symbolism of the Epistle to the Hebrews , to overcome the repulsion resulting from the early Judaistic persecutions and to enter upon her full heritage of ritual and ceremonial worship , grafting upon the forms adopted in the first instance from the synagogue some-thing of the dignity of the Temple worship , caught up into the service of the Eternal High Priest in the pleading of His perfect and unending sacrifice . The Hellenic city of Pella , temporary refuge of the Church of the Circumcision , must have grown in // prestige through the presence of so august an assembly and have become endeared by holy memories to the refugees from Jerusalem . At any rate they seem to have made no attempt to return after the war . It was not till more than sixty years later that Jerusalem became again the seat of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gave its name to the see of later Christian bishops . After the destruction of the city in A.D. 70 the razed ruins became for some sixty years the camp of the Tenth Legion , and in c. 130 A.D. Hadrian decided to found upon its site a pagan town dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinns , and bearing the name of the Emperor 's own Aelian Gens . The consequent Jewish rising under Bar-Cochab ( 132 ? 5 ) led to the complete expulsion of the Jews from that vicinity , and the Church that grew up in the city of " Aelia Capitolina " had lost its distinctive Judaistic character . Its ruler was , as late as the Council of Nicaea ( 325 A.D. ) , styled bishop , not of Jerusalem , but of " Aelia , " and by the irony of history his see was for a long period dependent on the Metropolitan of Caesarea . Some communities , however scattered about in the various Palestinian cities and villages , appear to have retained for a couple of centuries the extreme tendencies which the transformed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal experience , tells of certain " Ebionites " in Palestine who , " desirous of being Jews and Christians at once , fail to be either . " 1 // With these communities must be associated , apparently , the Aramaic Gospel according to the , Ifcbcei , ' s mentioned by Eusebius , ' and also the Clcmcntio Homilies and Recognitions and other literature of an erratic and romantic type intended to glorify St. Peter and St. James at the expense of St. Paul . Thus the ultra-Judaistic churches of Palestine prepared material for the Tubingen critics of the nineteenth century , linger ing on themselves till in the sixth century they became absorbed ( it would seem ) in the kindred heresy of Islam.2 In Islam lives on the spirit of St. Paul 's Judaistic persecutors , the fanatics of the Circumcision . But the Hellenic environment of Pella , followed by that of Hadrian 's city , had an effect that no personal influence as such could have produced , and brought the Church in Jerusalem itself ultimately into line with its illustrious daughter of Antioch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the winter of 46 ? 7 A.D. The young Hellenist and Gentile body has already arrived at full consciousness of its corporate life and responsibility . It has collected and sent its alms , by its chosen delegates , to the famine-stricken brethren at Jerusalem . After the return of these delegates , Barnabas and Saul , bringing with them Barnabas ' cousin , John Mark , the historian makes a solemn fresh start in his narrative . He enumerates the five leaders of the Antiochene Church , even as in his opening chapter he had enumerated the eleven Apostles at Jerusalem ; and then , corresponding to the description of Pente-cost in the second chapter , follows a notice of the direct commissioning of Barnabas and Saul by the Holy Ghost . Barnabas heads the list of " prophets and teachers , " and Saul concludes it : the other three are Manaen , or Menahem , foster-brother of Herod Antipas , Lucius of Cyrene , not to be confounded with Lucas the historian , but possibly identical with the " kinsman " of St. Paul who sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of whom nothing is known , though he may be , // together with Lucius , among the " men of Cyprus and Cyrene " who first initiated the work among the " Greeks " in the city . In the spring-time of 47 ( or 46 ) A.D. , possibly in preparation for the Paschal Feast , the leaders of the Church were engaged in " liturgies and fasts " when a clear message came to them , re-cognised as that of the Holy Ghost : " Separate Me Parnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them . " 1 From this commission , when the two were " sent forth by the Holy Ghost , " elates the beginning of that series of conquests that shifted Christendom 's centre of gravity from Jerusalem and Antioch to Ephesus and Rome . The story of the missions round the Mediterranean is , in the main , the story of the life-work of St. Paul . Within a space of ten years ( 47 ? 57 A.D. ) he accomplishes that marvellous series of missionary circuits which ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sailing from Seleucia , the port of Antioch , in March , 47 , the Apostles land at Salamis in Cyprus , trav- St. Panes istjourney. erse the island , and at Paphos win the first educated Roman convert of whom we have record ? Sergius Paulus , the proconsul , whose name an extant inscription still records . After the brief voyage to the Pamphylian coast , they evangelise the Phrygian and Ly caonian districts of the Roman province of Galatia ? the Churches , probably , to whom the Epistle to the Galatians was written some six years later ? passing successively to Pisidian Antioch , Iconium , Lystra , and Derbe , and back in reverse order . The Jewish synagogue forms in each case their base of // operations : but Jewish jealousy constantly dogs their steps , rousing opposition and bitter persecution , yet failing to rob them of their work 's reward . At Antioch , in Pisidia , Jewish opposition leads to a bold step on the Apostles ' part , a definite breach with Judaism . " Seeing ye . .. judge yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gentiles ! " Returning to Syrian Antioch in- August , 49 , they are called to answer for their bold advance , and gain their point at the Apostolic Council . Henceforth Jew and Gentile , circumcised and uncircumcised , are equal in the Church of Christ . In the spring of the following year ( 50 A.D ) St. Paul starts off again with Silas , one of the two envoys of the Jerusalem Church who had accompanied Paul and Barnabas when they returned with the Conciliar Letter to Antioch . This time they set out by land , taking the great trade route along the Syrian coast to Cilicia , where St. Paul had spent ? and spent , no doubt , with good effect ? the four years or so ( ? 38 ? 43 ) which intervened between his first visit to Jerusalem and the day when Barnabas sought him out at Tarsus to come and help in the evangelisation of Antioch . Then crossing the Taurus range by the pass known as the Cilician Gates , he struck his old tracks again and revisited Derbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Antioch , delivering everywhere the decrees of the Council . From Antioch he seems to have pushed on direct 1 to the coast at Troas , a tramp of seventeen days . There , came to him that vision of the man of Macedonia , crying : " Come over // and help us , " which drew him to set foot in Europe . There , too , he seems to have met the " beloved physician , " who was to be his faithful companion and biographer and the first historian of the Apostolic Church.1 In Macedonia lie visited successively Neapolis , Philippi , Amphipolis , Apollonia , Thessalonica , and Beroea , with very import-ant results , as his Epistles testify . In Greece he visited only the intellectual capital , Athens , and Corinth , the political and commercial capital with its port of Cenehreae . At Corinth his work proved much more telling , and during his long stay there as guest first of Aquila the Jew , and then of Titus Justus , ( September , 51 , to February , 53 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return journey in the spring of 53 was made by sea direct to Caesarea , with but a single call , at Ephesus , where he was to spend two full years on his next missionary Paschal Feast , and he spent in the Holy City probably , journey . His object was to be at Jerusalem for the the week March 22-9 . April saw him at Antioch again , ready to start in the summer on a tour of four years ' duration ( 53 , summer , to 57 , spring ) , spent principally in " confirming the churches . " The chief fresh ground broken during the eventful two years'stay at Ephesus ( Decem-her , 53 , to March , 56 ) , when the whole province of Asia was more or less evangelised , including the cities of the Lycus Valley , Laodicea , Colossae , and Hierapolis . At this time also the First Epistle to the Corinthians ioo THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES was written : the Second following in the summer or autumn of 56 from Macedonia , whither the Apostle proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have spent the winter of that year , and to have despatched from thence his great Epistle to the Romans . In the spring of 57 he hastens back by sea to Tyre , calling at Miletus for a farewell inter-view with the Presbyters of Ephesus . From the Palestinian Churches at Ptolemais and Caesarea he received a warm and affectionate welcome , and sped on his way to Jerusalem , arriving in time for Pente-cost . The story of this last eventful visit to the Holy City has already been sketched elsewhere . Its final issue in the appeal to Caesar and consequent voyage to Rome alone concerns us here . The voyage to Rome , interesting enough from a bio-graphical point of view and as a study for the nautical expert , throwing fresh and valuable light on the versatile capacity of the narrator and of his hero , has little bearing , in its details , on the history of the Church . It is doubtful whether the " breaking of bread " with thanksgiving refers to an actual celebration of the Eucharist on board ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail to notice in the short account of the three months ' sojourn in Melita , St. Paul 's literal reliance on the Lord 's promise of special protection : " They shall take up serpents . . . " , 3 and the employment of his Apostolic powers of healing upon the sick in the island , which probably ( though the narrative does not expressly say so ) resulted in the founding of a church there . The voyage , with its delays and misadventures , seems to have occupied the six months from August 59 A.D. to February in the following year . Landing at last on Italian soil , the Apostle found a Christian community and a welcome at Puteoli , and was glad-dened and encouraged on his long tramp to Rome by the arrival of an escort of brethren from the capital at the busy market of Appius so vividly described by Horace . ' This deputation of the Roman Church had travelled southward forty miles to do him honour , and another group was ready to welcome him at the " Three Taverns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , no doubt , were representatives of that group whom he had greeted by letter three years before , and perhaps some familiar faces . The Church which the Apostle found on his arrival , though not strictly Judaistic , was probably composed , in the main , of Jews and proselytes . With St. Paul the Juda-istic controversy ? already foreshadowed in his Epistle ? comes to a head . If his dream of a Roman Empire subjected to Christ is to be accomplished , the Roman Church of all others must be free from the bondage of the Law . At an early stage of his two years ' honourable and not very strict imprisonment he felt it necessary to bring matters to a head . He made an appointment with the leaders of the Jewish community , and argued with them from morning till night on the basis of " Moses and the Prophets " ; and , failing to convince them , rounded on them as fourteen years before at // Antioch in Pisidia : " Know that this salvation is sent to the Gentiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves us ; and the rest of St. Paul 's career must be pieced together from scattered hints in his later writings . Four of the Epistles were written during the imprisonment of which St. Luke speaks . From these we can realise that " the prisoner of the Lord " kept up relations with his converts , and still felt the responsibility of " the care of all the churches . " From the Letter to the Philippians , to which the " saints of Caesar 's household " append their salutations , ' we can infer something as to the prospects of the Gospel in Rome . ' From that to Philemon we gather that he expected shortly to be set at liberty and visit the churches in the Lycus Valley . ' We may place his release , probably , in the year 62 , which leaves some five years of further work before his arrest and death in 67 A.D. His long-contemplated visit to Spain , 6 implied in Clement 's letter to the Corinthians , may perhaps have been the first care of the liberated Apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarraco ( a week 's voyage ) , 7 or by way of Southern Gaul , whither Crescenss departed at a later date . In Spain he would find a country intensely Romanised. ? The First Epistle to Timothy and that to Titus imply // that from the west he journeyed back to revisit his children in Asia Minor , Macedonia , and Greece : that he went to Crete where he set Titus in charge of the Church , ' and left Timothy in a similar position at Ephesus ; 2 and suggest a route for his last missionary journey  --  from Miletus and Ephesus to Troas and so to Macedonia , and thence westward to Nicopolis on the coast of Epirus , where he intended to spend the winter of 66 ? 7 A.D.3 Here he was arrested by Nero 's officers ? possibly on a belated charge of being implicated in the burning of Rome two years before . During a short second term of imprisonment he wrote his Second Epistle to Timothy . Before the words " I am now ready to be offered " reached Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ostian gate and had won the " Crown of Righteousness . " 4 When we pass beyond the range of St. Paul 's mis-sionary labours , as described by his companion or incidentally referred to by himself , and attempt to trace the journeys of the Twelve and of other evangelists of the first century , we plunge at once into the region of tradition and legend . In one or two cases we seem to be on firm ground . The evidence , for instance , which locates St. John in the neighbourhood of Ephesus and St. Peter at Rome is early and comparatively strong . In other cases , like those of the Apostles Matthew and Matthias , Philip the Apostle and Philip the Evan-gelist , the earliest evidence suffers , apparently , from an // almost inevitable confusion of the names , as is also the case with Thaddaeus , whom Eusebius is now thought to have confounded with a later missionary , Addai . Moreover , as the majority of the traditions are pre-served for the most part in heretical documents of a romantic tendency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude in default of more serious testimony . For Asia Minor we have perhaps the strongest evidence . The second-century Acts of Andrew place the sphere of that Apostle 's labour to the north of St. Paul ' s sphere , alike in Asia Minor and in the Balkan Peninsula . Amisus in Pontus and Sinope in Paphlagonia , both on the coast of the Black Sea , are among the cities which claim him as their Apostle ; and with them ? to the north , again , of St. Paul 's Church at Troas ? two cities facing one another on the Sea of Marmora , Nicomedia and By-zantium , both to be famous in the days of the first Christian emperor . St. Andrew is also said to have evangelised Thrace , to the north-east of St. Paul 's Macedonian missions . The labours of the first called of the Apostles would thus have formed , in those regions , a complement to those of him who had been the last to see the Lord . Origen , in the third century , attributes to St. Andrew missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Euxine , between the Danube and the Caspian . If so , he prob-ably passed northwards from Thrace through Moesia Inferior . His martyrdom among the " Acliaians " has been thought to refer not to Greece but to a tribe on the east coast of the Euxine . MISSIONS TO THE GENTILES soy Pontus and Bithynia on the flack Sea coast are mentioned , it will be remembered , in the Epistle of Andrew 's greater brother , together with Cappadocia ( a central district apparently untouched by St. Paul ) , Galatia , and Asia ( the Roman province of that name ) . It is to the churches of these provinces , " the elect who are sojourners of the Dispersion " ? perhaps Christians of the Circumcision ? that the letter is addressed . There is , however , no trustworthy tradition that St. Peter ever worked outside Palestine , save at Antioch in Syria and at Rome ( which is almost certainly the " Babylon " of the Epistle ) . ' Hence it has been suggested that Silvanus , " by " whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Apostle and the regions addressed . As-suming identity of this Silvanus with the " Silas " of the Acts and the Silvanus of St. Paul 's Epistles , we may picture him as pushing on in later years ? per-haps when his former companion was a prisoner at Caesarea or at Rome ? and evangelising districts to the north of those which they had traversed together in the " second missionary journey . " Tradition makes him end his days at Corinth , as bishop of the city , where he had joined St. Paul after the parting at Berea and ably seconded his preaching.2 There is some ground for crediting St. Bartholomew with work in Asia Minor . One legend assigns to him missions in Lycaonia , another in Bosporus and Armenia Magna . It is significant that these districts were all connected with the dynasty of King Polemon , and that the tradition which makes Bartholomew preach in India mentions a King Polemios there . ' When we pass to the Roman province of Asia we have more evidence to go upon . There is strong testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John at Ephesus after his release from Patmos on the death of Domitian , 96 A.D.2 And there and in the neighbourhood he seems to have spent the last years of his long life , ruling and organising the " Seven Churches " of Asia , to which he addresses the Epistles of the Apocalypse.3 It is noticeable that of these only two , Ephesus and Laodicea , are known to have any direct connexion with the missions of St. Paul : though the whole of the province is described as influenced by his two years ' sojourn in the capital ( December , 53-March , 56 A.D. ) , while Thyatira is the native town of his influential convert Lydia . At Ephesus , too , is probably to be located the activity of Aristion , " the disciple of the Lord , " and of a certain " Elder ( or Presbyter ) John , " both mentioned by Papias , 4 to the latter of whom rather than to the son of Zebedee some writers would assign the Johannine writings of the New Testament . Of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is by tradition the residence of the Apostle Philip 's later years ; and his namesake Philip // the Evangelist , though sometimes placed also at Hierapolis , is more probably to be located at Tralles on the great east road near Ephesus . We may presume that he and his family left Caesarea i on the outbreak of the war in 65 A.D. The Apostle Philip before settling in Hierapolis is said to have carried the Gospel to Lydia and Galatia and even to the Scythians . As regards missions in the Balkan Peninsula , we have already spoken of the supposed evangelisation of Thrace by St. Andrew . The tradition which places that Apostle 's martyrdom in Achaia may be regarded as somewhat doubtful , as also that which brings St. Philip the Apostle to Athens and Silas to Corinth . What is certain is that in founding flourishing churches at Philippi , Thessalonica , and Corinth , St. Paul had planted Christianity firmly in Grecian soil . It may well be , however , that further evangelisation was sorely needed in the intellectual capital of Hellas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , though the specific details are somewhat elusive . To Arabia , St. Paul says he betook himself immediately after his conversion ; and the context suggests that he preached there . ' Seed may have been sown by some of the " Arabian " pilgrims who had heard St. Peter 's Pentecostal sermon . ' No less than six of the Twelve are connected by earlier or later tradition with the evangelisation of the Orient , from Edessa , where the great eastern trade routes from Asia Minor and Syria unite , to 1o8 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES Parthia , Persia , and India . With the last-named country are associated , more or less hazardously , the names of St. Matthew , St. Bartholomew , and St. Thomas . The name of Thomas still persists in Malabar , though the identity of the Apostle of India with him of the New Testament is far from certain . With Persia is connected , by a very doubtful tradition , the name of James the son of Alphaeus ; with Parthia , Matthew , Philip , and Thomas ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have hinted , with the Syriac name Addai ) and , more probably , St. Thomas , who is said to have been buried there . It is certain that the tomb of an Apostolic missionary was early shown at Edessa , but whether it was the tomb of Thomas , Thaddaeus , or of Jude is not so clear . An Ethiopian mission is attributed both to St. Matthew and to St. Matthias , suggesting here also a confusion of names : yet , apart from a special visit of a member of the Apostolic College , we may feel sure that Christianity had reached the kingdom of Candaee 1 even before the Twelve had dispersed on their world-wide missions . Lower Egypt is by tradition associated with St. Mark ; and Alexandria was certainly in constant communica-tion alike with Cyprus where St. Luke 's narrative leaves St. Mark , and with Rome where his presence is assume that St. Paul journeying to Spain touched at some port of Southern Gaul , where there were certainly flourishing // churches , at Vienne and Lyons , by the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely Apostolic Christianity had spread her nets . Along the whole northern coast of the Mediterranean and half the south coast there were groups of those who named the name of Christ . At Ronie , Corinth , Ephesus , Antioch , and Alexandria , the great centres of govern-ment , of culture , and of commerce , the cross was firmly planted . Three parts of the Euxine coast and practi-cally the whole of Palestine , Syria , and Asia Minor had been penetrated ; while eastward beyond the con-fines of the Roman Empire the disciples of Him Who was " born King of the Jews " had reversed the journey of the pilgrim Magi , and carried their message of peace across the deserts towards the rising sun . CHAPTER VI GENTILE CHRISTIANITY : THE LEVANT THE first group of Gentile churches which we have to consider is one for which , unfortunately , no epistolary materials are left us . For the study of the Galatian churches we have the Epistle which bears their name ; for those of " Asia " we have those addressed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two Epistles to the Thessalonians and that to the Philippians throw light on the con-ditions of Christian life in Macedonia , and the two to the Corinthians are rich in material for the study of primitive Achaian Christianity ; while the Epistle to the Romans , though written before St. Paul had ever visited the city , furnishes interesting details as to the composition of the Christian community there in the year 56 A.D. But if for Syria , Cilicia , and Cyprus , such materials are lacking , we have the compensating advantage of a fullness of detail in the narrative about Antioch which goes far to corroborate the tradition connecting the historian of the Acts with that city . ' Cyprus and Cilicia are not , perhaps , so fully treated as we might have hoped in the case of the birthplaces of Barnabas and Paul . GENTILE CHRISTIANITY : THE LEVANT i 1 z Phoenicia and Coele-Syria ? the strip of coast extend ing from Mount Carmel northwards to Antioch ? are closely connected geographically , historically , and commercially with both Cyprus and Cilicia . Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at one time united in a single province by Augustus ( c. 27 A.D. ) . Cilicia is grouped with Syria by St. Luke , and quite rightly . Close relations between the two countries were rendered inevitable by their proximity , the racial affinity of their population , and the ease of access afforded by the trade route round the north-east bend of the Levantine coast . The pass called the " Syrian Gates , " between Syria and Cilicia , mounts to no more than 1980 feet : whereas Cilicia was cut off from its neighbours to the north and west by the lofty Taurus range , which offered no easier pass than the " Cilician Gates " at an altitude of 4300 feet . Antioch itself had long exercised a strong and steady influence upon Cilicia , so much so that at the end of the first century ( under Domitian or Trajan ) we have record that the Diet of Cilicia actually met in the Syrian capital . Similarly the island of Cyprus , lying upon the base of the triangle , of which the Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easy sailing distance alike of Seleucia the port of Antioch and of Tarsus the Cilician capital , belongs historically , geo graphically , and commercially to the same region : while the constant intercourse which she maintained by sea with Alexandria served to link this Levantine group of churches with those of Egypt , Africa , and the West . The missionary relations of Cyprus with the main112 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES land were reciprocal , as were those of Syria with Cili.eia . It was by Cypriot and Cyrenaic missionaries that the Greeks of A.ntioch were first evangelised , and the first great organiser of the Gentile Church on the Orontes was himself a Cypriot , Barnabas , who associated with himself the Cilician , Saul of Tarsus ; while the first district attacked by the two when sent forth by the Antiochene Church was Cyprus , the Cilician churches being " confirmed " by a subsequent mission from the same city . Phoenicia ? the region of Tyre and Sidon ? and Syria had both been prepared , to some extent , for the Gospel by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbourhood . Phoenicia is among the regions to which the Gospel spread earliest after Stephen 's martyrdom . A few years later we hear of a progress made through the country by St. Paul and St. Barnabas , on their way from Antioch to Jerusalem ( 49 A.D. ) , when the Phoe nician Christians listened with interest to the results of their recent success among the Gentiles in Cyprus , and in the Phrygian and Lycaonian districts of Asia Minor . Some eight and ten years later definite Christian communities are spoken of at Ptolemais , Tyre , and Sidon . Three other places in Phoenicia are named in the Clementine Homilies ( second century ) . Tyre , where the ancient trade in purple dye revived under the Empire , was far the most flourishing city of the region , and its church soon attained the first place in Phoenicia . Already in the Acts it is accorded a longer and more detailed notice than either Ptolemais or Sidon receives . The picturesque and pathetic narrative of St. Paul 's visit in 57 , draws for us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples " in which were numbered entire families , " with wives and children . " Though administratively attached to the province of Syria , Phoenicia seems in Church matters to have been , in later centuries , dependent on Pales-tine , and its ecclesiastical capital , Tyre , or Caesarea . Turning to Syria ; we have already had occasion to notice the significance of Antioch as the Mother-Church of Gentile Christendom . Materially Antioch was the greatest city of the East and the third city in the Empire : its importance in the history of Christianity is even greater still . Its population , preponderatingly Syrian , had yet a large Greek element intermixed ; and the Greek language prevailed within the city , except in the lowest strata of society where Syriac was spoken . Among the Greek-speaking population was a flourishing colony of Hellenist Jews . Seleucus , when he built the city in 300 B.C. , had made the Jews citizens of his capital . The Jewish com community had important privileges , including that of having their own governor or " ethnarch , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Josephus speaks of their synagogue as being magnificently adorned ; and that partly with spoils taken from the Temple by Antiochus Epiphanes and restored to the Jews by his successors . Hither were attracted ( he adds ) a large number of Greeks , and numerous proselytes were made and assimilated in a special way to their own body . Antioch was a place where Greek and Hebrew currents mingled with greater facility perhaps than even at Alexandria ; and this is the secret of its importance to Christen I14 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES dom . Thus it was the natural starting-point for the evangelising of the Gentile world , the nursery where the Church of the Uncircumcision first grew to consciousness and began to realise its independence . Here were fought out the first decisive battles of Gentile-Christian freedom : here , in the city famous three centuries later ( in the days of Julian the Apos-tate ) for its nicknames and its humorous literature , arose that name of " Christian " which was to be the glory of the human race . If applied originally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to a serious fact , namely , that the distinction between Jews and Christians , which official Rome took so long to draw , was already clear to the wags of Antioch some fifteen years after Pentecost . Antioch , too , has the distinc-tion of one of the first recorded church buildings . There was still standing , as St. Chrysostom testifies , in the fourth century a Christian Church whose con-tinuity could be traced back to Apostolic times . Of the organising work of St. Barnabas and St. Paul during the twelve months ( ? 45 ? 6 A.D. ) in which they laboured together at Antioch we have already spoken . There is some ground for supposing that here , as at Samaria , the mission of a humbler emissary of the Church ( for it must be remembered that Barnabas is not yet styled " Apostle " ) was followed by a con-firmatory visit by one of the Twelve . Eusebius in his chronicle records a tradition which , though involving in its present form several improbabilities , may perhaps be interpreted as meaning that St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty ( or , accordGENTILE // big to another version , twenty-five ) years before his martyrdom . The event is placed by Eusebius in the third year of Caligula ( 39 ? 40 A.D. ) . If we boldly transfer it to the third year of Claudius ( 43 ? 4 A.D. ) some at least of the difficulties are removed . The visit would then fall in the year 44 , shortly after the Apostle 's release from prison , when the narrative tells us , rather mysteriously , that he " departed " from Jerusalem " and went to another place " ; and possibly during the period when Earnabas , having initiated the forward movement , was absent in Cilicia , seeking for Saul . But in the light of St. Peter 's visit mentioned by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians ? a visit which we have placed in the winter of 48 ? 9 A.D. ? Eusebius ' expression would seem to need some modification : the " Founder " of the Church is there rebuked and treated rather as an intruder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Peter 's Antiochene episcopate , though early and widely spread , and dating ( it would appear ) from the second century , may be , like the story of a great Apostolic council held there , a mode of " expressing its Church conscious ness " adopted naively by a community that knew itself second to none in importance . That St. Peter figured there ( though not in a very glorious role ) , and that a matter of primary importance was discussed and decided there by Apostles ( though not in solemn council ) , we have St. Paul 's own testimony to assure us . ' Antioch retained for centuries its illustrious place in Christendom . Euodius ( whose appointment is in rib THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES various versions of Enscbius ' chronicle dated variously in 42 ? 3 and 44 ? 5 AD. ) r was probably placed as bishop of Antioch by Apostolic hands , since his successor was martyred only ten or eleven years after St. John 's death . Ignatius , " the second bishop of Antioch , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 2 enhanced the glory of his see by his writings and the witness of his blood . From his letters ( especially that to Smyrna ) we may gather something of the flourishing state of the Church in the first decade of the second century , even after a period of persecution . Its central and commanding position is indicated by the range of Ignatius ' corre-spondence , which implies intercourse not only with the whole of " Asia " but also with Rome.3 Through St. Ignatius , Antioch is traditionally responsible for a stimulus to the development of Church music : while in the literary and theological sphere the saint had many illustrious successors , from Lucian the biblical scholar to Chrysostom the exegete and preacher . In theology and exegesis the Antiochene school occupied a mediating position in the Catholic Church ; and Antioch mediated also between the Greek-speaking west and the Syriac-speaking east , even as in the first days it had played the role of mediator between Judaistic and Gentile Christianity . All through the early centuries her missionary originality gave Antioch a primary importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church life to all around , that it // became the unconscious scene of the development of the metropolitical and patriarchal system of Church government . The horizon and effective power of the Antiochene bishop soon extended as far as Mesopo-tamia and Persia , Armenia and Georgia ; and , in the third century , his alliance was courted on political grounds by Palmyra and by Rome . ' Outside the gates of Antioch one passed at once into an entirely different atmosphere ? as from the Italian-speaking cities of the old Venetian dominion that fringe the Dalmatian coast one passes at once into a Slav-speaking hinterland . Syria , apart from Hellenic Antioch , spoke Syriac . The Syrian churches are distinguished from Antioch already in 49 A.D3 And , as a matter of fact , the surrounding country was less directly influenced by Antioch than were more distant centres . Still , Ignatius in 110 A.D 3 speaks of neighbouring churches with bishops of their own ; and Syria sent to the Council of Nicaea twenty-two bishops , whose distribution shows ? what other contemporary evidence makes clear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris-tianity had acquired a strong and uniform hold over the whole of Syria , town and country alike . In Cyprus , as at Antioch , Jews abounded , and so the way was open for Christian propaganda . In politics the island was intimately connected with the fortunes of the mainland . Annexed successively by Egypt , Assyria , Persia , Macedonia , and Rome , it was erected into a separate province by Augustus , and governed at first // directly by a propraetor : but afterwards ( B.C. 22 ) he transferred it to the Senate , who appointed their pro-consul . Later still , in 117 A.D. , it was restored to the emperor . It is one of the many marks of St. Luke 's accuracy , and of the contemporary character of his record , that he rightly designates the governor in 47 A.D. " proconsul . " ' The island , whose natural features resemble those of Palestine , was rich in copper and in corn , and carried on a flourishing export trade with Syria , Asia Minor , and other districts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Famagusta ? the landing-place of Barnabas and Saul , was the largest town , though not the seat of government . It had an excellent harbour ( now silted up ) , and a constant exchange of commerce with Seleucia , the port of Antioch . A large Jewish population was settled there ? St. Luke incidentally mentions the fact that there was more than one synagogue2 ? attracted , no doubt , partly by the fact that the neighbouring copper mines were farmed by Herod the Great . ' After preaching in Salamis , the Apostles apparently took the inland road right through the island ( a four days ' journey ) to Paphos . No record is left of their preaching in the interior : but it is possible that they may have originated among other churches that of Trimithus , which was afterwards , with Paphos and Salamis , represented at Nicaea . The brief record of their visit to Paphos marks an important stage in the progress // of Christianity . Sergius Paulus , the proconsul whom they converted , is mentioned in an extant inscription , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it probable that he was there in 47 A.D. , a year in other respects likely for the Apostles ' visit . ' Paulus was evidently a man with some pretensions to culture ? he has a Magian in his entourage ? and it seems prob-able that he is to be identified with one whom Pliny quotes as an authority on natural history . Thus , in his person , Christendom recruited a representative of science and education and a Poman official of high rank . The distinction thus gained is likely to have reacted on Rome itself : on the local Church it was bound to have great influence . Nor did the Cypriot Church lose the advantage thus secured . The island was able quite early to maintain no fewer than thirteen bishoprics , and in the fourth century it was erected into an autonomous patriarchate , ' on the strength of the discovery of St. Matthew 's Gospel in the reputed tomb of St. Barnabas . Of Christianity in Cilicia , we have practically no detailed information for the first three centuries : though the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and material importance of its capital , Tarsus , make it certain that Cilicia will have played no mean part in the expansion of Christianity . St. Luke implies in more than one place that there were Cilician " churches " apart from Tarsus itself : 3 but on Tarsus the political capital , // and no doubt from the first the ecclesiastical capital of Cilicia ? though its metropolitan dignity is first clearly to be inferred in the middle of the third century 1 ? the little knowledge we have is focussed . This city achieved by force of its natural advantages an enormous influence on the surrounding districts : while its " university " rivalled , if it did not excel , in importance those of Athens and Alexan-dria . For us its supreme importance lies in the fact that it produced St. Paul.2 A good and safe harbour , formed by the widening of the Cydnus into a lagoon near its mouth , and a commanding position in a fertile plain on the great trade route between the important passes of the " Syrian " and " Cilician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Assyria , and between them and the world in general . Tarsus was essentially a Greek city , with a select tinlocratic franchise ; and , in St. Paul 's time , had been governed for two genera-tions by Stoic philosophers , first by Athenodorus , Augustus ' tutor and protege , and then by Nestor , to whom Saul may have listened in his boyhood . Yet all the time it retained a decidedly Oriental atmosphere , inherited from the days of its native kings and its Persian satraps and fostered by its proximity to Syria . ' The fact that , in 49 A.D. , " brethren " of Cilicia are coupled with those of Antioch and Syria in the superscription of the decretal letter from Jerusalem , ' // shows how early Christianity had obtained a footing ; and when , in the following spring , Paul and Silas passed through Cilicia , it was to " confirm " churches previously founded . St. Paul must have been active there in the years ( ? 38 ? 43 ) which followed his first visit to Jerusalem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , may have left the mark of his earnest and genial personality . ' Nor is it fanci ful to suppose that earlier still some tentative begin nings of evangelisation had been made among the Cilician Jews , in whose synagogue at Jerusalem Stephen 's preaching had made so great an impression . ' - CHAPTER VII GENTILE CHRISTIANITY : ASIA MINOR ASIA MINOR was , during the first three centuries , the Christian country par excellence , and is the true mother of Constantinopolitan Christianity . ' Here the Church subdued paganism by a slow and steady absorption , its successes assured partly by the nature of the soil , partly by the eminent character of its first representatives and founders . Besides Paul , Barnabas , and Silas , and Paul 's lieutenants , Timothy , Titus , Tychicus , Trophimus , and Epaphroditus , the Church in Asia Minor numbers among its first missionaries and organisers the Apostles John and Philip and , it may be , also St. Andrew , Philip the Evangelist , John " the Presbyter , " and Aristion , " disciple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially prepared for these sowers . On the one hand , Hellenism assumed here a form peculiarly susceptible to Christian influence ; and , even where it mingled in strange ways with paganism , produced a belief in the " Most High God " which opened the door for Christianity . The zealous Jews of Asia , who did their best to make St. Paul 's life a burden to him , had unconsciously done much to prepare an entrance for his teaching into many a pagan heart . On the other hand , some districts offered an absolutely virgin soil . And all through the great peninsula the general breakdown of local traditions under the Roman imperial rule , the absence of any one strong national sentiment or national religion , told in favour of the new teaching . Moreover , the pagan attempt to do what Christianity alone could accomplish , and bind together the con-geries of alien tribes and races with a common religious bond ? the highly organised institution of emperor-worship , which played no small part in the Roman pacification of Asia Minor , while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( is it for this that the Angel of the Church of Pergamos is said to " dwell " where Satan 's throne is ? 1 ) ? contributed also its share to the preparation of the soil . Some say it furnished a model for certain details of the Church 's organisation . At any rate , it is striking to find St. Paul , in his encyclical letter to the Asiatic churches , applying to the Redeemer the language of " imperial worship . " 2 It is in the province of Asia , 3 that large and flourishing province which held a westernmost place in the sub-continent , that the interest centres most intensely . Here , apart from early and trustworthy tradition , we have within the New Testament itself the threefold witness of St. Luke , St. Paul , and St. John . For no other district is the evidence so full and strong : though for the southern portion of the extensive province of Galatia ( according to the view which may // now be said to hold the field ) we are justified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as to St. Luke 's narrative of three successive missionary tours of St. Paul . ' Comparatively little first-century evidence has come down to us about the other provinces bordering upon Galatia ? Pamphylia on the south , Cappadocia on the east , Pontus and Bithynia on the north . With these we will deal briefly first , and then pass on to Galatia and to Asia . Pamphylia , where St. Paul and St. Barnabas landed after their tour through Cyprus , is an isolated strip of coastland , dominated and encircled on north , east , and west by the lofty ranges of Mount Taurus . A lowlying and fertile but enervating and somewhat lnalarious plain , it was not adapted to the support of a vigorous population . Taurus cut it off from easy communication with the rest of the world . Its native ports and chief towns , Perga or Perge to the west , and Side eastward on the Cilicia border , were simply points of export for home-grown products and for those of the more accessible Pisidian valleys to the north : though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a port of call for the larger coasting vessels . Thus climate and circumstances told unfavorably on the progress of Pamphylia , and the Graeco-Roman civilisation penetrated it very little . St. Paul and his companions had probably intended to evangelise Pamphylia before proceeding further : presumably it was their change of plan ? caused , it would seem , by a physical breakdown of St. Paul , 2 which // necessitated an immediate ascent into the more bracing uplands of Pisi.dia ? that lost them the co-operation of John Mark . ' Some two years later ( perhaps in June , 49 A.D. ) , on their return to take ship at Attaleia , we are told that Paul and Barnabas " spoke the word in Perga , " 2 but no results are claimed . Something may have been already accomplished in the province by Pamphylian converts on their return from Pentecost nearly twenty years before ; and some solid results must have accrued from the mission which St. Luke dismisses in a single sentence : for , besides Perga , Attaleia and Side , five other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicene Council , implying their existence at the end of the third century . For the rest , the early history of Christianity in Pamphylia is a blank , and the Pamphylian Churches were among the earliest to decay . Cappadocia , 3 Pontus , and Bithynia , outside the sphere of St. Paul 's labours , are among the churches addressed in St. Peter 's First Epistle , and the last two are assigned by tradition to St. Andrew . ' Cappadocia , a somewhat wild and mountainous inland tract north of the Taurus , with few cities and a comparatively sparse population , was but slowly penetrated by Graeco-Roman civilisation . The main trade route from Tarsus , by the Cilician Gates to Pontus and the Black Sea , passed through the midst of Cappadocia , which thus reaped advantage from the trade between Central Asia and the Euxine ports . This accounts for the presence of that Jewish population which sent its quota to Pente126 THE CHURCH OF THE APOSTLES cost in 29 A.D. , ' a population which had already 150 years earlier been an object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , that Christianity first found a footing , and it is to JudaeoChristian communities in the province  - -  evangelised , it may be , by Silas ? that the words of St. Peter 's First Epistle are addressed . The Cappadocian Church , Mother of Gothic and , in part , of Armenian Chris-tianity , and illustrious in its learned and saintly sons ? it produced in a single generation three of the Church 's greatest doctors , St. Basil and the two Gregorys  --  was destined to play a far more glorious part in Christen-dom than that of Pamphylia . But for the first century we are left to inference and conjecture . The statistics of the Nicene Council show that this was one of the provinces in which the chorepiscopate was strongest , implying a leavening of scattered groups and country populations ; and there are various indirect testi-monies to Cappadocian Christianity about the end of the second eentury , after which Cappadocian Chris-tians are frequently mentioned as resident in other provinces . " Pontus and Bithynia , since 65 A.D. , formed a single province . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts outside the province : P. Polemoniacus , the kingdom of Polemon II , whose mother and co-regent , Tryphaena , figures in the Acts of Paul and Tteekla , 4 P. Galaticus , and P. Cappadocicus : but it is to the Roman halfGENTILE // province that the name apparently refers as used in the New Testament . The united province of Pontus and Bithynia extended practically along the whole of the south coast of the Black Sea . It was a fertile and civilised tract , and one in which Christianity evidently made very speedy progress , especially along the sea-board . Pontus was represented among the pilgrims at Pentecost : and it is possible that among these was Aquila : though it is equally possible that in 29 A.D. he was already settled in Rome  --  whence Claudius ' edict banished him twenty-one years later ? and con-verted to Christianity there , if , indeed , ( as is perhaps less probable ) his conversion be not due to St. Paul , when they met at Corinth in 51 A.D. The province was forbidden to St. Paul when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 50 A.D. ; and it has been conjectured 2 that the Gospel may have reached it first by sea from Asia , or from Rome . Yet , apart from the possi-bility of evangelisation by Pentecostal pilgrims and the traditional mission of St. Andrew , we must not neglect the facilities afforded by the trade route through Cappadocia . When Silas bore , probably from Rome and by sea , the encyclical letter which bears St. Peter 's name , he was a messenger to churches already founded ; and the founding of some of these churches , whether by Andrew or Silas himself , or another , may well have been accomplished after work in Cappadocia , even if ? in the subsequent development of Christianity in the province ? sea communication played a preponderant p art . // Though actually contemporary evidence for the progress of the Faith in the first century is confined to the single reference in St. Peter 's Epistle , the letters of Pliny to Trajan have all the value of contemporary testimony . For , writ-ing in 112 A.D. , he mentions Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier : that is to say , we have official evidence that Christianity had reached the province at least as early as 92 or 87 A.D. ; and the general description Pliny gives strongly suggests a still earlier date . His well-known words must be quoted once more for the undying interest they have as showing the signal progress Christianity had already made , and what it looked like to a cultured , humane , and impartial pagan within a dozen years of the death of the last Apostle . He writes to Trajan for advice : because as governor of Bithynia and Pontus he is for the first time brought face to face with the " Christian question , " Christianity being by that time a religion definitely illicita , and Christians , when denounced , if obdurately refusing to burn incense to the Emperor 's statue , being liable to the extreme penalties of the law . After speaking with sympathy and discernment of their character and customs , he concludes by suggest ing that he should be permitted to deal with them in the mildest possible way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for many of all ages and of every rank , and even of both sexes , are brought into present or future danger . The contagion of that superstition has penetrated not the cities only , but the villages and country . . .. " And then he goes on to speak of pagan " temples almost deserted " and " long-disused // ceremonies of religion " and of the great fall there had been in the fodder-market , owing to the disuse of sacrificial victims . ' Pliny 's language is confirmed ? if it needed cor-roboration ? by a cynical remark of Lucian 's ( c. 170 A.D. ) to the effect that " the whole country " of Pontus " is filled full of Epicureans and Atheists and Chris= thins . " ' " When we turn to Galatia we are met by an ambiguity still more puzzling than that presented by the name of Pontus . Apart from the possible application of the name to Gaul , ' it may refer either to the Galatic kingdom in the level tableland of central Asia Minor which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to that province which included , besides the original kingdom of Galatia , Phrygian , Lycaonian , Pisidian , and Isaurian districts to the south of it , districts fertile , wooded , and hilly , through which passed the great road from Ephesus to Syrian Antioch . It is this southern part of the province which is the scene of St. Paul 's labours in his first two missionary journeys ; and was revisited in the third ; 4 and though controversy is not quite dead , we may take it as practically proven that he did not visit North Galatia , and that it is to these southern churches , Derbe , Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch , that the famous Epistle is addressed . // These populations had already shown their fickle-ness on St. Paul 's first appearance among them . ' Driven by illness up from the rnalarious Pamphylian plain , he was received by the " Galatians " with open arms . They had welcomed him " as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus , " and declared themselves ready " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : but anon they had fallen away . So , too , at Lystra , they were on the point of offering him divine honours ; 2 yet soon after stoned him within an inch of his life.3 And the change alike in St. Luke 's narrative and in St. Paul 's epistles is attributed to Judaizers . Galatia proper , the territory from which the whole province took its name ? a dreary tableland some two hundred miles long by one hundred miles broad ? was a sort of " reserve , " within the limits of which the Gauls who had invaded Asia Minor in 278 B.C. had been ultimately confined by Attalus I , King of Pergamus , fifty years later . Here , after a period of subjection to the Pontic kings , the Gauls were freed by Rome in 64 B.C. , and ruled by their own chieftains till 5 B.C. , when the province of Galatia was formed . The Gauls no doubt formed simply a dominant minority in the midst of a larger Phrygian and Greek population , to whom they left agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To these elements a Roman was added by the forward policy of Augustus and his successors . According to St. Jerome , the Gauls of Galatia were still bilingual in the fourth century , speaking , besides Greek , a dialect similar to that of the Treviri . A Lycaonian // dialect , evidently not understood by the Apostles , is mentioned by St. Luke ; and Phrygian was spoken in large tracts of both North and South Galatia , the native speech lingering on till , with the triumph of the Cross , the language of the New Testament superseded it . The attempts to fix upon the Gallic nature the special characteristics of those to whom the Epistle is addressed are unconvincing . At any rate the data are more applicable to the Phrygian character . This would not surprise us even if there were evidence that St. Paul had preached in the chief North Galatian centres , Pessinus , Ancyra , and Tavium ; for the Gallic element was comparatively weak in the towns . But there is no direct evidence that St. Paul ever visited those places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fact that till near the end of the second century there is no reference to Christianity in Northern Galatia , and then only in a single city , Ancyra ( 192 A.D. ) : while the evidence of the early councils goes to show that in that district the spread of Church organisation was immensely behind that of the Pisidian and Lycaonian regions of the province. , Augustus urged on the imperial policy with special vigour in Galatia , and particularly in the southern dis-trict , where he founded six colonies , a chain of outposts against the restless mountain tribes of the Taurus . Two of these were to become famous in the history of the Church ? Pisidian Antioch and Lystra ? the former a military centre of great importance , connected with the rest , to south-east and south-west of it , by a system of roads // and milestones . Claudius remodelled and Romanised other cities , including Iconium and Derbe . Through these cities passed a constant stream of intercourse to and fro between Rome and the East , and so , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek , and Jewish , with Roman superimposed ? made them ideal seed-plots for the " Catholic Religion , " they formed a fine strategic posi-tion for the Apostles ' campaign . At the same time that position was peculiarly vulnerable . Off the main route might have been found here and there syna-gogues of Jews to form a starting-point , and to rouse , in turn , the first opposition to the Apostles ' preach-ing . But the organised subversion of his converts by emissaries from Jerusalem , of which St. Paul com-plains in the Epistle , was facilitated by those same advantages of position which probably made him fix upon those cities as of primary importance for his task . The toilsome and dangerous mountain road that leads up from Perga to Pisidian Antioch ? a track strewn to-day with ancient inscriptions that speak of " perils of robbers " and " perils of waters " 1 ? brought the weary party of missionaries at the beginning of August , 47 A.D. , into an atmosphere both physically and spiritually bracing : nor was there lacking to St. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human welcome he so sorely needed , albeit the chief troubles that were to mark his course were those which he designates " perils by mine own countrymen . " Antioch stood upon a ridge 3600 feet above seaGENTILE // level . It was a Roman colony of some standing ? since before B.C. 6 ? and , like Lystra , proud of its Roman character . When St. Paul reached Antioch it was at the zenith of its importance , as the centre of that military activity which , under Claudius ( 41 ? 54 A.D. ) , resulted in the final pacification of the district . Its mixed population of Romans , Greeks , Jews , and Phrygians gave to it an intellectually stimulating duality ; and made it an ideal centre for one whose aim was to Christianise the world through the Empire of Rome . The story of this visit has an added interest to those who believe that it is to Pisidian Antioch ( and not her Syrian namesake ) that St. Luke really belongs , and that the fall and graphic account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of which we have a complete record ? is that of an eye-witness , one of his hearers , who is no other than the historian himself . ' The sermon is full of interest , especially when compared with the typical sermons of St. Peter and St. Stephen sketched by the same historian , and with St. Paul 's own later discourses , e.g. at Lystra and at Athens . Com-pared with the two first-named , with which it has striking resemblances in matter and method , it certainly shows a more clear and developed Chris tology ? Christ is the Son of God ' ? and exhibits the characteristic Pauline doctrine of justification by faith : compared with the latter , it indicates the Apostle 's versatility in dealing with different audiences . The effect of the sermon was momentous . It created // such a stir among the entire population that , on the following Sabbath , the synagogue was packed : not only Jews and " devout proselytes , " but Latins , Greeks , and Phrygians , who had no connexion with Judaism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy , burst out into violent opposition to the strange rabbis , whose teaching b threatened to crowd them out and fill their synagogue with those whom they regarded as " un-clean . " Whereupon " Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly , and said : It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you . Seeing ye thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles. " 1 The Rubicon was crossed . There followed a period of two or three months ' successful work among Gen-tiles during which the word of God was spread abroad throughout the whole region . " 2 And now comes in a touch of local colour . Throughout Asia Minor , and especially in Phrygia , women played a prominent part in civic and social life . " Under the Roman Empire , " says Ramsay , " we find women magis-trates , presidents of games , and loaded with honours . " 3 When the envious Jews wished to stem effectually the progress of the new teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synagogue that they set themselves to influence the chief magistrates . Paul , as a Jew , was subject to the synagogue 's jurisdiction ; and when convicted of tumultuous conduct was ( no doubt with the connivance of the civic authorities ) // beaten with " forty stripes save one , " and then cast out of the city . As the Apostles " shook off the dust of their feet " 2 against inhospitable Antioch , they left a church not depressed or discouraged by this taste of persecution but " filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost . " The journey from Antioch to Iconium by the road probably taken would occupy some twenty-seven hours , and on the third or fourth day the Apostles would reach the city in its bower of orchards . If the tradition embodied in the Acts of Paul and Thekla is to be trusted , St. Paul was met on the way , at the point where the imperial road from Antioch to Lystra diverged from the Iconium road , by his host Onesi-phorus . Iconium was early famous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though her Acts are no doubt , in their complete form , a " for-gery " ( as Tertullian says ) , and belong to the end of the second century , they seem to incorporate contem-porary and trustworthy documents . That , at least , is the opinion of Pamsay , 3 who is convinced by the description of the road . The prominence and free-dom of women ? quite " modern " in tone ? agree with the implication of the Acts of the Apostles and with what else we know ; and so too the facts alleged about Tryphaena , ex-queen of Pontus , Thekla 's protectress and convert , are consistent with what we know of the historical Tryphaena . Convincing also is the sugges-tion that the Christian preaching aroused hostility as interfering with family life and social institutions . // Nor is it fanciful , perhaps , to regard as authentic the vivid description of the Apostle 's personal appearance , as " a man of moderate height and scanty hair , bow-legged , with large eyes and meeting eyebrows and a longish nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole winter and spring ' ? but events took the same course as at Antioch , save that the civic magistrates do not appear . They preached in the synagogue , with immediate success among both Jews and Gentiles . Then followed Jewish opposition , which finally succeeded in dividing the entire city into two contending fac-tions . A conspiracy to organise a general assault upon the Apostolic group was discovered in time ; and the missionaries ? with the inner circle , probably , of their converts ? escaped southwards , across the Lycaonian border , to Lystra and Derbe . A short journey of some eighteen miles brought them , not indeed into a different jurisdiction ? they were still within the Roman province of Galatia , though close to the frontier of the independent King Antiochus of Commagene - but into an environment where the Jewish element was much weaker , where the atmo-sphere was almost purely pagan , and where the country population spoke a different dialect . Lystra was , like Antioch , a Roman colony , and an important military station . Its natural position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above sea-level , and is raised above its immediate surroundings on a bold hill some 100 to 150 feet high . Not on the main trade route , like Antioch and Iconium , it was less subject to Greek and to // Hebrew influences . No synagogue is mentioned here ; and the Jews who raise opposition are men who follow Paul from Antioch and Iconium . But that there were a few resident Jewish families here ? living in un-usually close intercourse with the Gentiles ? is clear from the record of St. Paul 's later visit in the year 50 A.D.1 With one of these families , in which Greek and Jewess had intermarried , we may suppose that the Apostle now found hospitality , the pious roof of Lois and Eunice , ' from which he subsequently took Timothy to be his companion . Lystra , with its pagan environment , brings out a new side of St. Paul 's versatile nature . A miracle of healing roused the population , who seem to have been preparing for some pagan festival , to intense excite-ment . Mindful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pious peasants Baucis and Philemon on the neighbouring Phrygian hills , they at once identified Barnabas and Paul with these divinities , shouting , as excited people will , in native dialect , " The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men I " The priest of Zeus Propoleos3 brought garlanded bulls to the temple gates , intending to sacrifice them , when the supposed gods , grasping at last the meaning of the excited cries , rushed in among the crowd , pro-testing . They appealed ? by Paul 's mouth , no doubt ? to the // pagan countryfolk not , as at Antioch , from the Hebrew Scriptures , nor , as at Athens , from the side of philosophy , but on the basis of natural religion , preaching God Almighty , the Creator of all , and the bountiful giver of harvest and vintage . Then followed a short period of active evangelisa-tion , ' which was suddenly cut short by Jewish enemies , who tracked St. Paul from the scenes of recent persecutions , and now roused another population against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suffered the pains of St. Stephen 's martyrdom , and was taken up for dead . But , divinely restored to strength , he passes on , after a night 's rest , to the frontier town of Derbe , some thirty miles away . Derbe was , like Lystra and Antioch , a Roman military outpost , though a smaller place . Among the converts here was Gains , one of St. Paul 's companions on his third circuit . ' At Derbe the Apostles were well on their road home . Tarsus was but one hundred and sixty miles away ? a shorter journey than that which they had traversed from the Pamphylian ccast ; and , if the season was now late to attempt the high pass of the Cilician Gates , they might well have lingered in the comparatively peaceful environment . But , in spite of the sufferings of the last months , never to be forgotten , as St. Paul 's later writings show , 4 they deliberately retraced their steps and revisited one by one the scenes of // their recent persecutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the new churches in their tribulation , and then , more important , to supply them with the elements of a stable constitu tion . They appointed with prayer and fasting , and doubtless with laying on of hands , presbyters in every place . The summary account of the next visit to these Gentile churches , in 50 A.D. , ' supplies us with few additional details : though there is a reference to the extraordinary progress made by the new faith.2 Paul and Silas , fresh from the Council of Jerusalem , delivered on this occasion to each of the Galatian churches the decrees originally addressed to the com munities of Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , but adapted , in principle , to all churches in which Gen-tiles were found . Further , to emphasise the " cor rectness " of his attitude , he circumcised Timothy , the son of a Gentile father , and not yet subjected to that rite . These things gave a handle to St. Paul 's Judaizing opponents , who , as we see from the Epistle to the Galatians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister and an emissary of the Twelve . Nor do we learn anything fresh from the brief allusion to the third systematic visitation of the " Phrygo-Gaiatic territory " in 53 A.D.3 Of the subse quent growth of Christianity in South Galatia during the first century , we have no direct knowledge . The earliest Galatian Christian known by name to us out-side the New Testament is Hierax , who , at the trial of
