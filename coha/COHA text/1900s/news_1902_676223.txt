txt Major Gen. Roe was expected at the headquarters of the National Guard in this city yesterday to take up the question of the expulsion of members of labor unions for belongings to the militia , but he did not reach his office up to the time of closing yesterday afternoon . The question of the right of members of labor unions to belong to the National Guard is expected to be taken up within the next week or two by the trades unions at their meetings . Marsden G. Scott , President of Typographical Union No. 6 , said yesterday , in talking of this subject : " I fail to see any good reason why a line should be drawn between the National Guard and labor organizations . Many members of Typographical Union No. 6 are at present members of local regiments , some are in the regular army , and others I served under the flag in Cuba and Porto Rico . It is an unfortunate fact that members of the National Guard have on several occasions become intoxicated by their brief authority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented . But because of these blunders the National Guard should not be condemned nor should trades unions be held responsible for the action of the Schenectady organization . " BOYCOTT WILL CONTINUE Schenectady Trades Assembly So Decides in a Stormy Session . Workmen Hiss When They Learn the Decision ? Disintegration of the Organization May Follow . SCHENECTADY , N. Y. , Nov . IS. ? The boycott against the Schenectady Railway Company will continue . The Trades Assembly held a long and stormy meeting tonight . at which a resolution was offered to reconsider the resolution ordering the boycott ; but a forgotten clause in the constitution to the effect that any action taken at a regular meeting could not be reconsidered at a special meeting was produced , and so no action whatever was taken . At the conclusion of the meeting , which lasted about two hours , the Press Committee , composed of President II . V. Jackson , Secretary Edward Utting , and William Martin , who are recognized as the leaders of the radical element , absolutely refused to give out any information whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire country were opposed to them in their fight . From individual members , however , it was learned that the meeting was almost a riot . When it was called to order , with 270 members present , a resolution was offered that the resolution ordering the boycott be reconsidered . Instantly the representatives of the Metal Polishers ' Union arose to their feet and yelled that if the boycott were declared off , the entire metal polishers ' body would withdraw from the Trades Assembly . Hardly were the words out of their mouths when the delegates from the Molders ' Union . one of the roost powerful bodies affiliated with the assembly , sprang up and announced that they would withdraw if the boycott were continued . The representatives of the machinists ' unions , which have a membership of several hundred and are especially conservative , announced that they would side with the molders end withdraw if the Trades Assembly did not rescind its action . It was evident that a large majority favored calling the boycott off , but any attempt at argument was met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cries of " traitor " and " scab " greeted every conservative speech , while the advocates of continuance drowned each others ' voices in their efforts to be heard . Finally It was proposed to take a vote . Then the leaders of the boycott produced a clause in the constitution that no action taken at a regular meeting could be reconsidered at any but a subsequent regular meeting , and President Jackson declared the resolution to reconsider out of order . Some one moved to adjourn , and , amid tumult , it was declared carried . The next regular meeting will be held Wednesday , Nov. 26 . A crowd of : WO or 400 workingmen many with dinner pails in their hands , was standing outside the hall , waiting for the decision . When the delegates came out and told what was done the crowd hissed and groaned . Prominent members of the Trades Assembly said after the meeting that the disintegration of the Trades Assembly is inevitable . The radical element openly announces that if the boycott is declared off it will form a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to their stand that they will withdraw if it is not declared off . Except the Carpenters ' Union . these two bodies are the largest-affiliated. with the Trades Assembly , and it is confidently believed that the masons , boilermakers , blacksmiths. hammersmiths , and others will follow their example . Their leaders say that they knew organized labor is not in sympathy with the expulsion of Potter or the boycott , and it is necessary to form a new hotly to rid themselves of the leaders who have put them into this position . The typographical and other unions say that they will denounce the boycott at their next meeting . The boycott is only nominally in effect . Union men , especially those whose representatives opposed the boycott , rode on the cars to-day as freely as ever , and there was no attempt made to spot or warn them , while the failure has encouraged the business men to disregard it . The cars were crowded with workmen when the shops closed to-night , and there was no appreciable falling off in traffic .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
