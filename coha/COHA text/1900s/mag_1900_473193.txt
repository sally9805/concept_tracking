TO understand the present uprising in China , which has startled the whole civilized world by its suddenness and atrocities , it is necessary to recall the history of foreign intercourse with China . This sudden ebullition of hatred and opposition is not of recent growth . The fact is that while necessity has compelled acquiescence in the presence of foreigners in their country , they have never been welcomed or understood by the Chinese . Suspicion of the motives of foreigners has been present from the beginning . To call this Boxer movement simply opposition to the missionary and his work is no more true than to say it was an expression of hatred to the merchant or the diplomat as such . For a century the Westerner has been to the thought of the Chinese , openly expressed or not , a " foreign devil , " whether missionary , merchant , or ambassador . In. general terms , therefore , the grounds of this opposition and hatred must be sought in the prevailing opinion of all classes of Chinese that foreigners desire to eventually seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by recent events ? in the opium trade , and in missionaries especially as the suspected emissaries of foreigners in their designs upon the country . In this connection the pride , conceit , and ignorance of the Chinese themselves must not be overlooked as important elements in the problem . China occupies a unique position among the great nations of the world . In ancient times she was almost perfectly isolated from the Western world by natural and artificial barriers . On the western border are almost impassable mountain ranges effectually cutting off intercourse from that direction ; and , before the days of steam and electricity , the long and perilous journey by sea was almost as effective a barrier from the east . Here , practically walled in from the remainder of the world , rose the Chinese Empire , with a country so well endowed by nature as to be capable of supplying everything needed for the development of a great nation . In her seclusion all the knowledge either her rulers or people possessed of the outside world was derived from occasional conflicts with the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged or extensive to give any correct information of the great western world , nor to develop anything like a warlike spirit in her people . So insignificant seemed the surrounding nations when compared with their own vast empire that the Chinese very naturally thought of themselves as , and called themselves , the " Middle Kingdolii . " With no entanglements with foreign nations , the local rebellions , though frequent , did not greatly hinder the ordinary progress of affairs , and the mass of the people were not seriously disturbed in their pursuit of the peacef ul arts , of literature , and the development of their system of government . In the whole history of the world no other nation ever had such a wide and productive territory so completely separated from external influences , with so long and uninterrupted opportunity for the development of her peculiar institutions and civilization . Under these circumstances the Chinese people became perfectly satisfied with themselves and their attainments , and the conditions in which they lived . The result was the growth and cultivation , through a long succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been a greater barrier to their progress than the ocean and mountains were to intercourse with the ancient world . After centuries of this almost uninterrupted seclusion the time of transition came . A small cloud may sometimes be seen rising out of a serene sky in the west . At first it attracts but little attention because of its seeming insignificance , but it may be the messenger that precedes the refreshing shower that brings vegetation out of the parched ground and fills the land with plenty ; or it may indicate the gathering of the storm that sweeps over the country with irresistible fury . So it was when years ago a little company of traders established themselves in Canton . Their presence was a matter of comparative indifference . They were considered representatives of the outer barbarians seeking to better their condition out of the wealth of China , and so long as they conformed to the laws of the country they were suffered to remain . The self-sufficiency , pride , and arrogance of the literati and rulers blinded them to the fact that possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own people . Instead of being welcomed , and an effort being made to profit by the new methods and energy of these strangers , they were regarded with suspicion ; and every occasion was taken to interfere with their freedom of activity and the development of commercial and political relations which might have been mutually advantageous . The result of the adoption at that time of a more enlightened and liberal policy would have been that China to-day would be among the most powerful and prosperous of the nations ? although it must be admitted that the selfish and illiberal conduct of the Fast India Company was not such as to allay the fears and inspire the confidence of the Chinese . Ignorant opposition finally brought on the storm , and war for the first time revealed the mighty power that lay concealed somewhere among the far-distant nations whence these foreigners came . When the clouds cleared away , Canton , Amoy , Foochow , Ningpo , and Shanghai were declared open ports , where foreigners could enter with certain privileges of residence and trade secured by treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession ? the beginning of the alienation of Chinese territory . The energy of the Occident had come into collision with the inertia of the Orient , and a new relationship and adjustment was to be the inevitable result , though , because of the vastness of the materials affected , the movement must be slow in the beginning . In less than twenty years the storm again swept over the empire , and Peking was taken by the allied armies . New treaties were made , and thirteen more cities were thrown /men to foreign trade , extending along the coast from Canton to Tientsin , and up the Yangtze as far as Hankow . Gradually these places were occupied by foreigners from the various nations of the West , and by better acquaintance and more extensive intercourse friendly relations increased , and the contact of Western nations became recognized as a permanent factor of the empire ; and whether this factor was welcomed or not , some of the wisest of the Chinese statesmen thought it the proper policy to seek whatever advantage the situation offered to China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with France resulted in the loss to China of Tonkin . Later came the Japanese war , and additional loss of territory . Japan secured Formosa , but , owing to the combined action of three great European powers , had to relinquish her claim upon Manchuria , while China had to increase her indemnity to Japan by thirty million tads for the recession , only to see the province , including the fortress of Port Arthur , seized by Russia . China 's weakness was revealed , and loss of valuable territory became alarmingly frequent . The Germans seized Kiaochow , the English Wei - hai - wei , and later extensive concessions on the mainland opposite Hongkong . The French occupied Lungchow in the south , and frequent demands have been made since . Besides this seizure of strategic portions of Chinese territory by foreign governments , the Periodicals of the West have constantly published articles seriously outlining schemes for the complete dismemberment of the empire . Russia is to have the north , Germany the province of Shantung , England the rich and populous valley of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they allege , is to acquire Fukien , and other nations whatever might be left . All of this discussion is translated , and finds its way to the rulers of China , and only serves to augment the long-cherished hatred against the nations who deliberately plan to take their country away from them . Nor can the foreign merchant escape the responsibility of a full share of the opposition that has always existed in China . It should be remembered that sometimes trade becomes only another name for greed , which ignores every moral consideration and high principle of civilization , except the one controlling item of " Profit and Loss . " Hence it sometimes becomes necessary for nations , in the exercise of their sovereign rights , to enact prohibitory laws for the protection of their people . The advance of civilization often brings in its train evils that counterbalance its benefits . For instance , the advance of our civilization into the Philippines , which has carried with it the American saloon with all its attendant drunkenness and crime , has not been a blessing unmixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior races must disappear before the advance of the superior , " but it always appears that those nations which have the power to advance consider themselves the superior race . And yet may we not believe that the highest type of civilization possesses no inherent right to oppress and exterminate weaker nations with which it comes in contact ? Neither for the selfish purpose of making money should trade ? which is said to be the forerunner of civilization ? be allowed to debauch and destroy the people of a nation where it is introduced , whether by force or by voluntary treaty , simply became they belong to what is termed an alien race . Lord Kitchener announced that in the Soudan he would advance civilization , but would rigorously prohibit . two of the great evils that have accompanied civilization into Africa , namely the slave trade and the rum traffic . But what . of foreign trade in China ; has it always been a blessing to the people ? In the main it has been honorable and beneficial both to foreigner and Chinese , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notwithstanding the repeated . protests from the rulers in China , the trade is upheld and sustained because it brings large profits to the merchants dealing in it , and because it is a source of large revenue to the richest colony of one of the highest civilized nations in the world . Chang Chi-tung , one of the ablest viceroys of China , recently wrote as follows : " Assuredly , it is not foreign intercourse that is ruining China , but this dreadful poison . Oh , the grief and desolation it has wrought to our people ! A hundred years ago the curse came upon us more blasting and deadly in its effects than the great Flood , or the scourge of the Fierce Beasts , for the waters , after nine years , and the ravages of the man-eaters were confined to one place . Opium has spread with frightful rapidity and heartrending results through the provinces . Millions upon millions have been struck down by the plague . To-day it is running like wild-fire . In its swift , deadly course it is spreading devastation everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealth of its victims . The ruin of the mind is the most woful of its many deleterious effects . The poison enfeebles the will , saps the strength of the body , renders the consumer incapable of performing his regular duties , and unfit for travel from one place to another . It consumes his substance , and reduces the miserable wretch to poverty , barrenness , and senility . Unless something is soon done to arrest this awful scourge in its devastating march , the Chinese people will be transformed into satyrs and devils ! This is the present condition of our country . The Chinese government formerly prohibited the use and importation of opium under penalty of death , but the prohibition was of no avail , In all her history China has never been placed in such frightful circumstances . " The intense feeling that has called forth this terrific arraignment , by one of the most enlightened and progressive statesmen in China , of one of the leading articles of trade legalized and enforced by treaty , is shared by multitudes of Chinese , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese estimate of foreigners . That is a condition that Lord Salisbury might take into consideration when exhorting missionaries " to temper their enthusiasm with Christian prudence . " Nor can we deny the fact . that part of the prejudice and opposition of the Chinese comes from the presence of missionaries in their country . But this is infinitesimally less on account of their religious teaching , and educational and benevolent work , than because of the suspicion that they are advance agents preparing the people for eventual foreign occupation . It seems impossible for an ordinary Chinese to understand a purely benevolent act , or to interpret the foreigner as inspired by a genuinely altruistic motive . In the early years of the introduction of Christianity by the Roman Catholics , churches were formed and large numbers of converts were received . The priests were in high favor at the court , having gained great influence largely through their astronomical and mathematical knowledge . It was only after they appealed to the Pope in Rome to settle some of their religious controversies that determined official opposition was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor and his advisers concluded that if there was a rule outside of China who had more authority than the rulers of China , in deciding questions affecting the welfare of their own people , they had better prevent the spread of such a heresy by expelling the missionaries . The interference of the priests in cases of litigation between native Christians and the heathen has been a constant source of irritation to the Chinese officials , and has tended to confirm them in their opinion that missionaries are actuated by political considerations . To say that Protestant missionaries have sometimes been unwise in their dealings with the Chinese , and in their attitude toward native prejudices and religions , is to say they are not more infallible than other people . They have , however , always encountered more prejudice and opposition from the literati and official classes than among the common people . With rare exceptions the village population and farmers have been very friendly to missionaries , and from these classes the largest number of converts have been gained . On the other hand , the educational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest terms by official proclamations and imperial edicts . The English Premier spoke literal truth when he said , " Christians are not being attacked in China because of their religion , but because it and other nations had got the idea that missionary work was a mere instrument of the secular government in order to achieve the objects it had in view . " The present uprising , though the legitimate product of past prejudices , had its immediate origin in more recent events . it is a sort of culmination of the reaction against the reform movement which gained considerable influence soon after the close of the Japanese war . This reform movement was started by patriotic and progressive young men who had intelligence and sense enough to perceive that China was far behind the other nations of the world in all that makes a nation great . They were humiliated that the little island empire of Japan , whose people they had been accustomed to despise as " Dwarfs , " should so easily conquer their own great and proud nation , and they desired to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the equal in intelligence and power of Western nations . Unfortunately , the chief of these reformers , Kang Yu-wei , was very unwise in the precipitancy with which he persuaded the young Emperor to introduce his radical measures . The people were not prepared for them . The conservative mandarins , who had reached their exalted positions of power and affluence by means of the systems of education and examinations which had been in existence for many centuries , became alarmed . It was not long before they persuaded the Empress Dowager that her own power , if not her life , was in danger of being entirely lost through the introduction of so many foreign innovations . Then came the coup d'gtat of 1.8K the dethronement of the Emperor , the escape of Kang Yu-wei , and the summary decapitation without trial of six of the young reformers . Repressive measures were enacted , and the impression became prevalent that an anti-foreign policy had been inaugurated by the government . Foreigners were attacked on the streets of Peking . General Tung Fu-siang , his army flushed with victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encamped in the Southern Park . The soldiers believed they had come to aid in expelling the foreigners , for almost immediately they attacked the foreign engineers on the railroad , and exhibited their insolence whenever they met a foreigner . Soon after this the work of the Boxers began in the provinces of Shantung and southern Chili . Undoubtedly they were at first incensed against the Catholics , because of their political tendencies and interference in lawsuits . This is the testimony of many missionaries who were witnesses of the first outrages . But the feeling of hatred was intensified by the action of the Germans in pushing their railway and mining interests in Shantung . Having previously seized the port of Kiaochow , they depended more upon the " mailed fist " than patience and conciliation in extending their influence and control in the province . Conflicts with the natives resulted , an armed force was sent to protect the engineers and workmen , and two entire villages were destroyed and several people killed . Whether or not this was all unavoidable , and whether the Germans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese a lesson , " is not now under discussion . It is referred to in this connection only to show one of the irritating causes that confirm the Chinese in their opinion of the selfish , grasping nature of all foreigners . The disturbances first appeared as persecution of native Christians . Appeals to the local officials were of no avail . The mandarins in most instances evidently were in sympathy with the rioters . Representations to Peking failed to bring any adequate protection . When Mr. Brooks fell a victim to the murderous attacks , the foreign ambassadors became convinced of the gravity of the situation . Mr. Campbell , of the British consular service , was sent from Shanghai to be present at the trial of the murderers at Chinan-foo . The Governor of Shantung , at the demand of the British minister , had been relieved from office , but on arrival in Peking was honored by repeated audiences with the Empress Dowager , and decorated for meritorious conduct and appointed Governor of Shansi ! General Yuan Shi-kai with his foreign-drilled troops was sent to restore order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously execute his commission , but was evidently repressed by secret orders from the throne . A semblance of activity on the part of the officials was made to put down the secret societies , and for a time there was a lull in their depredations , but it proved only temporary . Drilling was continued even in public places , and additions to the societies were rapidly made in hundreds of villages . Suddenly even the walls of Peking flamed with threatening placards , calling upon the people to rise and exterminate the foreigners and native Christians as the cause of all China 's woes , and before the outside world could realize what was happening , the foreign ambassadors and other residents were shut up within the city walls , their lives placed in imminent peril , and much of their property destroyed , while hundreds of native converts were brutally massacred . What degree of responsibility eventually can be fixed upon the Chinese government for this disgraceful state of affairs remains for future investigation and decision by the diplomatic body ; but there seems no doubt that vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the allied forces in the attempt to rescue the legations and beleaguered foreigners in . Peking . It is equally certain that an attempt will be made to throw the blame for this attack upon the allied forces themselves , because they demanded the surrender of the Taku forts , and because of the menace implied by the presence of so many marines in Peking . Neither can there be any doubt that the anti-foreign sentiment in the Chinese government has been growing rapidly ever since the reaction against the reform movement two years ago . The Empress Dowager has succeeded in surrounding herself with the most noted foreign-haters in the empire . Prominent among these may be mentioned the following : Kang Yi , who was made one of the members of the Grand Council , and became the most influential and confidential adviser of the Empress Dowager . It should be borne in mind that the Grand Council is a much more influential and authoritative body than the Tsung-li-Yamen , or Foreign Office . Kang Y1 ' 3 animus was displayed during his tour of the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions of trade . He insisted on closing all government schools founded on Western models , the abandoning of foreign drill for the Chinese army as tending to destroy the bravery of the troops , and advocated a reTHE CHINESE RESENTMENT . turn to all the ancient methods of China , literary , military , and financial , including the wholesale mulcting , of merchants to increase the revenues of the empire . Hsu Tung , who was appointed tutor to the heir-apparent . He has for years been known in Peking for his bitter antiforeign feeling , which he carried to the absurdity of protesting against the paving of Legation Street in front of his residence ; as a deflection in the road before his gate is in evidence . Li Ping-hung , who at the command of the Germans some time ago was cashiered because of his opposition to their occupation , was restored to favor and given a lucrative office . It is reported that he was sent to Nanking to persuade the viceroy there to join the rebellion against foreigners . Prince Tuan , father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has suddenly come into prominence as the leader of the opposing forces . General lung Fu-siang has already been referred to in this article . If one is to be known by the company he keeps , the Empress Dowager will certainly have difficulty in proving her friendliness to foreigners while surrounding herself with chief counsellors of such known antecedents and bitter anti-foreign sentiments . The attitude of the government may be further inferred from the fact that high officials suspected of friendliness to foreigners lost their positions on some fictitious charge . Chang Yin-huan , one of the most enlightened and liberal-minded members of the Tsung-li-Yamen , was banished . Hu Chi-fen , the Director of Railways , and an advocate of employing foreign capital in their development , was degraded . Only a few months ago five prominent Hanlins were arrested and banished without trial , one of whom was the Chinese director of the English syndicate operating the valuable coalmines in Shansi . The protest of the British minister was of no avail .. The effect was praptically a blow aimed at foreigners , and it became very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position in connection with foreign companies . But the day of reckoning is near , and it will be well for humanity if the final VOL . CL ? No- en . ? 83settlement is on the basis of wise statesmanship , rather than upon the illiberal and unworthy motives of jealousy , revenge , and selfishness . The Great Powers will have an opportunity that has seldom occurred in. the history of the world to exhibit the superiority of Christian civilization , in loftiness of moral purpose and an exalted spirit of unselfishness , starting China upon an era of reform and progress that will be a blessing to all nations , and cause future generations of Chinese to remember with gratitude the benefactors who , even through the terrible ordeal of war and bloodshed , broke the shackles that bound them to the dead past , and gave them a new existence inspired with the energy and life of the coming century . Prejudice against the Chinese as a race , or vengeance aroused by the savagery and heathenish barbarities of the present rebellion , should be subordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the greatest good to all . Our estimate of Chinese character should not be biassed by the outrages of the fanatical Boxers and lawless soldiery , but rather should seek for the possibilities of development on the higher lines of morality and achievement of the masses of the population . Thus we shall find that the Chinese people and the country they occupy are sufficiently vast and promising to enlist the patient consideration of the most experienced diplomatists and statesmen of the world . It is the calm judgment of those best acquainted with the Chinese that physically and mentally they are capable of accomplishing anything demanded of them . The Chinese can not point to many public Works as monuments of their genius and powers , but they are not entirely without evidence of possibilities of achievement under enlightened conditions . The Great Wall and Grand Canal , considering the circumstances and the age in which the work was done , are indications of engineering possibilities that may enrich mankind when modern scientific ideas enter into their mental equipment . Many of the useful inventions which have served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of future demands , may make the world their debtor . In diplomacy the Chinese have seldom appeared at a disadvantage when dealing with the best-trained men of the West . Their literature is vast in extent , though not specially valuable from the stand - point of Occidental requirements . Their histories are written with the most laborious and exhaustive minuteness . In commercial integrity their merchants stand among the highest in the world . The laboring-people are patient , industrious , economical , and capable of great endurance in any climate . A people who have accomplished what the Chinese have under the oppressive and unyielding systems of the past , must possess qualities capable of greater development under the inspiration of Christian civilization . These are important elements in forming an estimate of China 's future in the world 's activities . In assuming our part in shaping the future of this great empire we should bear in mind the richness and extent of China 's undeveloped resources , especially as they may affect the commercial relations of the world . China is not a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries of exploitation , but of vast dimensions , and with wonderful resources . Her coal deposits are immense in extent , but have scarcely been touched ; iron and other minerals of great value remain buried in the earth ; her great population , and the consequent cheapness of labor , would make manufacturing on large scale possible and profitable ; but notwithstanding all these sources of wealth China remains practically one of the . poorest of the nations . All history and precedent would indicate that the opening of her rich mines , the building of railways , and the starting of manufactories would rapidly increase the wealth , and hence the power , of China . Multitudes of her people would secure employment with increased remuneration for their toil ; the government would be able to equip an army and a navy sufficient to protect her territory against encroachment of other nations ; and the country would enter upon an era of prosperity never dreamed of by her most progressive statesmen . While this is evident we should not forget that Western nations insist on the opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chinese themselves . Money is the great power that moves the wheels of commerce , and to a large extent the machinery of governments . It is in the interests of trade that the question of the open door is so vigorously agitated . Foreigners are not simply seeking the good of China when they demand a greater market for the products of their manufactories and farms . It is not that the benefits of civilization should accrue to the Chinese that additional guarantees and safeguards are demanded from the government for the investment of capital in railways , manufactories , and large commercial establishments . It is neither a question of sentiment nor of religion , but of dollars and cents . Nevertheless , the money-making and money-producing capabilities of the empire can not be ignored in the councils that are to determine China 's future policy . The highest commercial advantages , to say nothing of the cause of civilization and humanity , demand that the policy of an open door , and the integrity of the empire ? as already outlined by the United States government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy the Pacific Ocean is destined to become the greatest commercial highway , and the United States the greatest commercial nation of the world . In the heated discussions that must follow the present outbreak it is difficult to foretell how dismemberment can be avoided and the integrity of China be maintained ; but that question does not come within the scope of this article , although certainly it is within the possibilities of negotiation by an international congress , if the allied powers are unselfish enough to sacrifice personal advantages to the good of all . It can , however , be safely affirmed , without fear of gainsaying , that permanent peace and an impartial field for the commerce of the world will demand that the Chinese government shall be held absolutely responsible for the protection of the lives and financial interests of foreigners of every class lawfully pursuing their vocation under treaty stipulations . This will necessitate a remedy , so far as now possible , for the grave mistake made when this colossal and partially civilized empire , whose rulers had not the faintest conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comity of nations . Some sort of international control in the central government will be an imperative necessity for at least one generation , and if this is sufficiently strong and consistent it will remove any necessity for policing the country with foreign troops . China , though hoary with age , is only a child among civilized nations , and the enforced discipline and restraints of childhood will be necessary for the attainment of honorable manhood . Preliminary to the inauguration of such a policy must needs be the summary and public execution of the leaders in the present outrages , no matter what their rank . The publicity of the punishment of those in high position who are guilty can nowhere have such immediate and wholesome effect as in China . There should be no yielding because of the specious pleas that will be advanced by viceroys and privy councillors in order ro shift responsibility . The Chinese sentimentality in regard to the sacredness of the persons of the imperial clan , even though it should include the Empress Dowager herself , or the highest mandarins in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no nation in the world where the degrees of official responsibility are more perfectly graded than in China ; and there is no place in the world where personal responsibility can be so easily eluded by the officials as in China . When the provincial and prefectural officials are made to understand that they will be held accountable , and with unfailing certainty punished , for any destruction of lives or property of foreigners within the limits of their jurisdiction , we shall hear no more reports of outrages and massacres of innocent persons . The weakness of the central government is not apparent when it has thought it necessary to cashier a viceroy or decapitate a general in the most remote province : it is only when some foreigner is involved that the supposed weakness is put forward as an excuse for inaction . Another self-evident requirement for permanent peace in China is that the nations should once and forever abandon the thought of dismemberment , and thus cause the political agitators to cease their discussion of the question through the publications of the West . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , or the discussion continues with the certainty of its translation into Chinese , there will be unrest and constant irritation . The conspicuous failures of the experiments already made of seizing Chinese terreLory should satisfy the world that permanent peace can not be secured in that way . Dismemberment is wrong in equity , mischievous in operation , and in the end can only result in friction and misrule . Lasting political and commercial prosperity can only be secured by the moral uplift of China 's millions , by the cultivation of honesty , integrity , and patriotism ; and for this purpose the missionary should have the opportunity of preaching the gospel . This is his work , and neither diplomacy nor commerce can accomplish it . Christianity has done more for the civilization and elevation of men than any other force ever known in the world . Follow the progress of Christianity and note the nations that have most fully accepted its teachings , and you will note the nations where civilization is most advanced , where the arts and sciences are most fully developed , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most powerful nations of all history . Christianity is no longer en experiment in the world ; its renovating power has been fully demonstrated . The defects in our Western civilization are illustrations that Christianity has only gained partial control , and that the selfishness of human nature refuses to allow Christianity to work out its legitimate results . Whatever superiority Occidental civilization possesses over Oriental is due almost entirely to the inspiration and impetus given to it by Christianity . At the door of China stands ' Christianity , but , unlike commerce , it seeks first and above all else the good of the people , and in return asks nothing for itself . It will not force itself upon an unwilling people any more than it will upon an individual , but if welcomed it will gladly pour its wealth of new life , energy , and moral power into the heart of the nation , and future generations will reap a bountiful harvest of blessing and prosperity .                   @ @
