Seven weeks ago Senator Hoar was rebuking the Evening Post for attacking the President 's Panama policy without full information . On Thursday he was rebuked by Senator Foraker for doing the same thing . The Evening Post , said the Massachusetts Senator in November , had " gone off half-cock . " Yet he himself , going off full-cock in December , takes exactly the same position that that journal held from the first . But these are only amusing trifles . We know how galling it is to Senator Hoar to agree with the Evening Post , or to be supported by it , but agreement with him is sometimes inevitable  --  when he is right ; and he has now - performed a great public service , far beyond the power of any newspaper . He has , from his position in the Senate , gained the ear of the country with his plea for law and morals . Objection to the President 's course can no longer be put by as the work of chronic snarlers and cantankerous sentimentalists who are Democrats in disguise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not abandon his party though it were to slay him  --  an able lawyer , chairman of the Judiciary Committee  --  who rises to inform the Senate and the nation that the President 's action has been both brutal and illegal . Of course , Mr. Hoar puts the case hypothetically . He virtuously ( or slyly ) assumes that Mr. Roosevelt could justify his ways to man if he would only tell the whole truth It is simply on the face of the official dispatches thus far made public that Senator Hoar condemns him . Yet this is plainly nothing but an empty formality  --  the Mark Antony way of saying " honorable man . " How can any Executive explanation do away with the orders actually given our naval commanders before this wonderful revolution ? Those orders , , declares Senator Hoar , were an act of war against a friendly country . Such they undoubtedly were , tried by any test , legal or moral ; and the President 's pretence of a solemn obligation to " keep the peace " on the Isthmus , translated as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant of law , Mr. Hoar aptly characterizes . Mr. Roosevelt 's attitude , asserts this survivor of the Puritans , was that of a " mighty policeman " who " manacled the arms of the attacked , leaving the assailant free , and then instantly proceeded to secure from the assailant the pocketbook of the victim , on the ground that he was the de-facto owner . " That will do , coming from the President of the Harvard Alumni , and addressed to Harvard 's strenuous son . Senator Foraker 's protest against Mr. Hoar 's sensational-speech was , in effect , a declaration that the people are not capable of passing judgment on such high matters . He was appalled at the thought of all this being " given to the country . " Why could not indiscreet Senator Hoar have cleansed his bosom of all that perilous stuff in secret session ? Senators , of course , were fitted to discuss these complex questions of law and morality , but Foraker was aghast at the idea of uninstructed editors and clergymen and professors all over the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is done . Senator Hoar has fired a shot that will be heard round the world . Horrible as it may seem to Senator Foraker and to the Administration , the whole question is up and the whole question is open . Americans are actually wanting to know whether their rulers have had a proper regard for law and right , and whether they have been careless of the country 's good name , making us appear to the world in the light of sharpers and filibusters . Washington dispatches friendly to the President variously represent him as " amazed , " " pained , " and " indignant " at Senator Hoar 's speech . Such a portent is it for a leading Republican to lift up his voice for justice and the law ! Mr. Roosevelt is said to be particularly apprehensive about the effect of the speech " abroad . " He seems to fear that foreigners will for the first time find out that his Panama alacrity was highly suspicious . As if they had not all the while spoken of it with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tear lest the expression of a moral sentiment in this country should compel the President to kill somebody in another . Those ignorant and credulous Colombians might take it into their heads that Americans in general care as much about the proprieties and the legalities as Senator Hoar does , and then , of course , by the severe logic of Imperialism , President Roosevelt would have to invade their territory and shoot a lot of them . All this fluttering simply shows how hard the Administration has been hit . Moral reproaches it could smile at , but apparently it is even going to lose its treaty . The danger is , of course , that in this state of alarm and anger the President may seek to escape the consequences of one rash act by assaying another . But we earnestly hope that he will have the good sense to reject desperate counsels to get up a little war , or to build the canal anyway , or to annex Panama , and will see his path of safety and of honor in careful observance of ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Americans should recall to their minds the elementary rules of ihternational propriety . They have been violated , in all this business , with the utmost effrontery . Not the least indecent disregard of what is fit and obligatory has been shown by the mushroom Minister of a mushroom republic , M. Bunau-Varilla . He made a speech in Philadelphia on Thursday , and submitted to a newspaper interview afterwards , in which he most offensively interfered . in what is purely a domestic matter . He denounced those who spoke up for justice ' to Colombia or were against the Panama treaty , and acted in all ways as if his quality of foreigner and diplomat laid no embargo whatever on his utterance . We must tell him that Washington sent Genet out of the country for just such impertinent meddling . This stockholder in the Panama Canal Company : who got himself made Minister and then negotiated a treaty to buy his own property , ought to get a civil but decided intimation from the State Department that we will not allow him to lobby , or loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . M. Bunau-Varilla might perhaps plead that all rules were being set aside by this stirring Administration , and that no impropriety really mattered . But Senator Hoar 's speech is one sign that the period of happy-go-lucky , go-as-youplease conduct in international affairs of the greatest moment is about ended , and that we are going sharply to revert to the old questions , " What does precedent demand ? What does the law require ? " THE INJURY TO MR . HAY . One of the most unfortunate results of our Panama diplomacy is the dam-age it has done to the reputation of Sec-retary Hay . His prestige has been a matter of legitimate national pride . Not only by skill and address , but by pur-suing policies at once humane and hon-orable , had he won fame abroad as well as admiration at home . His exemplary patience when the first Hay-Pauncefote treaty was defeated by American Jin-goes , headed by Mr Roosevelt , implied that he had that first of diplomatic vir-tues , the ability to say , " I can wait . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hay 's ad-vice or , at least , consent , has adopted in the Isthmian canal affair operates grave-. ly to his injury . The fundamental vice of our Colombian diplomacy is revealed afresh In the correspondence made public on Saturday . Apparently , neither President Roosevelt nor Secretary Hay thought Colombia entitled to her rights under international law . They never dreamed of treating her as an equal . They addressed demands to her which , if made to us by any other Power , we should have rightly regarded as a deep insult . Read the offensive dispatch which Mr. Hay sent on June 9 . It stated that the rejection of the treaty would " seriously compromise the friendly understanding between the two countries , " and might lead to action by Congress " which every friend of Colombia would regret . " What right had the Secretary to say that ? How could it be maintained that the Constitutional action of the Colombian Senate in rejecting one of Mr. Hay 's treaties was any more unfriendly than the similar action of the United States Senate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have thought of making so - thinly veiled a threat to France . He would not have endured it for an instant coming from England . Lord Lansdowne might , with as good warrant , have insisted that our Senate confirm the Hay-Pauncefote treaty . That was sought by us as directly as the canal treaty was by Colombia . Mr. Hay makes much of the fact , that " negotiations were instituted Eby Colombia . " The Hay-Pauncefote treaty was instituted by us . Indeed , it was publicly stated that Mr. Hay was allowed to write it just as he pleased . Yet the British Foreign Office never thought of reproaching or threatening our Government on that account . We demand the treatment of an equal , but do not accord 1L to Colombia , though by law and treaty it should be hers . We can easily conceive that the case was badly botched by Minister Beaupre . He appears to have passed on Secretary Hay 's instructions in the baldest form , and telegraphed that they made a " sensation " in the Colombian Senate , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Probably Mr. Hay did not intend the thing to be done thus crudely ; but his own original position is untenable If the rejection of a treaty by the duly constituted authorities is an unfriendly act , th-d United States would be the chief of sinners . Look at the Hay-Bond treaty respecting Newfoundland Senator Lodge not only has it contumeliously set aside in one Senate and pigeon-holed in the next ; he puts his son-in-law , Representative Gardner , to railing at it in the House and to accusing its negotiator ? Secretary Hay himself  --  of having been cheated into accepting a " gold-brick " treaty . But can Newfoundland allege that the insult is directed at her , and not merely at Mr. Hay ? The latest correspondence only makes the Panama case appear worse It shows that the Administration was prepared to ignore Colombian sentiment and to trample upon Colombian rights . And as for what this Governinent actually did in connection with the Panama revolution , the dispatches now published are either irrelevant or further inculpatory To show that we were long aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for acting with gross impropriety when it came : It doe 's not leave us even the pretext of having been taken by surprise . Nothing that has yet seen the light can explain or defend the orders to our naval commanders , two days before the revolution , to prevent Colombia from suppressing it . That , as Senator Hoar maintained from his place in the Senate , was nothing less than an act of war , authority for which the . President possesses neither in sound policy nor in the Constitution and laws which he is sworn to uphold . Besides being a diplomatic blunder , it was an open usurpation of power . All this , we say , came with a shock to the best friends of Secretary Hay , and must prove a detriment to his fair fame . Nowhere has his sagacious and humane statesmanship been held in higher esteem than in England But what are Englishmen saying now of the policy in which he has made himself partieeps ? The influential organs of English opinion express that verdict of posterity which is proverbially to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Speaker , the Liberal weekly , says that the Administration was guilty of " an act of brigandage " in Panama , and adds that " the United States has shaken the confidence of the civilized world in her honesty . " It is the opinion of the Scotsman that Colombia has been " at the same time plundered and mocked . " Says the Glasgow Herald , " Expediency has been stronger than morality . " In the Manchester Guardian we read : " The United States Government , coveting the canal territory and unable to control it by treaty , has torn it off from-Colombia by force . " Our Panama diplomacy is called by the Daily Graphic " a very disagreeable page of American history . " The Globe speaks of the " underground manoeuvring of President Roosevelt and Mr. Hay . " Our course at Panama ' was , says the Daily News , in " complete disregard for the opinion of the civilized - world . " We could make many more citations to the same effect from representative and powerful English newspapers . Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombian diplomacy for which Secretary Hay has made himself responsible incurs the condemnation of our well-wishers abroad . The result is , unhappily , not only a diminution of his own repute , but a tarnishing of his country 's good name . A. SOCIAL , PROBLEM IN BALTIMORE . It is in the nature of race prejudice to give rise to incidents that intensify and sometimes appear to justify it . An illustration of this is to be found in some recent incidents in Baltimore . In some sections of that city the white residents and property holders are much irritated at the gradual spread of the negro population into sections in which , a few years ago , none of them resided . In 1880 there were 53,716 negroes in Baltimore City . Twenty years later there were 79,258 ? an increase of 25,542 , or at the rate of something more than 47 per cent . It is true that in the same time the white population increased 150,634. or at the rate of 54 per cent. , so that the proportion of negroes to the total population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years ago . Nevertheless , there has been an absolute in crease of upwards of 25,000 in the negro population . This means that perhaps 3,500 more dwellings in Baltimore are now occupied by the negroes than was the case in 1880 . In Baltimore , negroes are seldom the first occupants of new houses . The small houses of the kind which they would be most likely to buy or rent are usually put up in long rows or blocks . It rarely happens that enough negroes can be found able and willing to buy or rent all the houses of one of these rows . The builder would not dare to sell some of them to - or for negroes unless he were sure that he would be able to sell all for the same purpose , because he could escape having the remaining houses left on his hands only by selling them far below the cost of erection . In large part the increased housing needed by the largely augmented negro population of the city has been supplied by turning over to them residences once occupied by whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecuniary loss . It has annoyed and irritated a still greater number of persons who , perhaps , did not lose any money by it For thirty years now the real-estate market in Baltimore , and especially that portion of it which concerns itself with moderate-sized houses , has been in an unsatisfactory state . No matter with what judgment one might buy such property , if he held it for a few years he was almost certain to lose money . It follows that it has been exceedingly difficult , when one was forced to sell such property , to part with it except at a very heavy loss . The increase in the standard of comfort among a portion , at least , of the negro population resulting from the in-creased education and culture of some of them , has made them wish for their children and themselves better surroundings , physical and moral , than can usually be found in the typical negro quarter . These persons are on the lookout for residences which they can afford , and which will , if not give them the surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some very objectionable associations . In a neighborhood in which values are declining , as in most parts of Baltimore they are , it is easy for such persons to obtain by purchase or rent from the necessity or cupidity of a property owner who finds his property tenantless on his hands , the kind of house they want ; because , wanting it , they will frequently pay more than a reliable white tenant will . The very moment the new occupant moves in , there is a commotion in the neighborhood . His coming means at once a large money loss to all the other property owners in the immediate vicinity . He and his family may be quite well-behaved people who give their neighbors no trouble of any kind ; perhaps the first negroes to come into a white community are usually of this class . Nevertheless , many of the white neighbors feel themselves insulted and more or less outraged by his advent . If they are tenants , they at once begin preparations for moving , and they do move at the first reasonable opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell it . ' As an inevitable consequence , the value of houses rapidly declines . As the whites move out , more and more negroes come in , because no one else who will pay any reasonable rent will take a house in a block in which there are negro residents . 8very - white man who moves , and every white ran whose property has become less valuable , ascribes all his inconvenience and all his loss to the negroes , although it often happens that they have been only partly responsible ; the decline in value having made large progress before any negroes appeared in the neighborhood . Such an experience is likely to create prejudice where little of it existed , and to fan to a higher heat that which had been previously entertained . Men are never disposed to view kindly or judge justly the acts of others which they believe to have caused them to lose money . Thirty years ago , outside of a few alleys , there were scarcely any negroes in the section of Baltimore city bounded on the south by Biddle Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east by Druid Hill Avenue , and on the north by North Avenue . This region extends about a quarter of a mile from east to west and a mile north and south . Now the negro population is very possibly in the majority in the entire district . It is still gaining upon the whites very rapidly . There can be but little question that this spread of the negro population into what had been previously white neighborhoods has had an-appreciable political as well as social effect . The pity of it all is that , starting with the existence of a dislike among a considerable proportion of the whites to living in a neighborhood in which any negroes dwell , all the other consequences follow automatically , so to speak ; and follow without anybody , black or white , being to blame for them . All sorts of difficult and irritating problems are created by these changes in the character of the population . For example : some twenty-five years ago a public-school building was erected for white children in what was then practically an exclusively white neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that time had been erected in Baltimore , perhaps because the class of white children then attending it were used in their homes to a higher degree of comfort than was the case in most other sections of the city . In the last ten years the negroes have gradually moved into the vicinity of this school , and now very nearly surround it . The attendance at the school , which used to be large , has fallen off greatly and steadily . As a consequence , it can now accommodate many more pupils than desire to attend it . On the other hand , there is a shortage in the accommodations for colored children in the neighborhood . The School Board last spring accordingly announced that it would close the school as a white school and open it in the fall for colored children . This seemed to be a commonsense decision , and I o be all the more wise because part of the falling off in the enrolment and attendance of white pupils was unquestionably due to the dislike of parentS to send their children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moment the decision of the School Board was announced , however , there was a bitter protest . The negro population had , as already stated , almost surrounded the school building ; they had not quite done so . Some of the white property owners still occupied their houses . Some white churches and institutions still remained in the vicinity . They have been struggling against what may be called the inroads of the black sea for years , and that their struggles thus far have been unsuccessful only made it to them the harder that the School Board should take sides with the invaders . So much feeling was aroused on the question that the School Board reconsidered its action and announced that the white school would be continued . It gave notice , however , that the proposed action had been only postponed unless experience should demonstrate that there were enough white children to attend the school to make it worth while to cohtinue it . Confident assertions were made by the white neighbors that there would be no trouble on this score , circulars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to this school . Nevertheless , the attendance this year is smaller than it was last . A NEW INTRUSION OF PEDANTRY . It needs a strong hand now and then to smite those Philistines of the schools whom we call pedants , and such a hand Mr Trevelyan , the eminent biographer and historian , has raised in defence of the finer aspects of his art . In an inaugural address , delivered just a year ago at Cambridge University , Professor Bury asserted roundly that history is a science , not an art , and that the imagination and the emotions have no concern in its writing . If he relented at all in this austere rejection of the graces , it was only in favor of " generations very remote " : " The gathering of materials , he declares , bearing upon minute local events , the collation of MSS and the registry of their small variations , the patient drudgery in archives of states and municipalities , all the microscopic research that is carried on by armies of toiling students  --  it may seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building which has hardily been begun , of whose plan the laborers know but little . This work , the hewing of wood and the drawing of water , has to be done in faith  --  in the faith that a complete assemblage of the smallest facts of human history will tell in the end . The labor is performed for posterity . " Against this promulgation of the new school , Mr. Trevelyan has protested vigorously in the Independent Review , showing with admirable persuasiveness that the labor of sifting evidence and establishing facts is only the beginning of the student 's task , and that no generation can safely forego the real objects of history  --  which are , as he thinks , to teach political wisdom , to restore our heritage in the ideals of the past and the lives of the noble dead , and to awaken a feeling far the poetry of time . We could wish that Some champion of the finer scholarship , as Mr. Trevelyan sees it , might arise in this country and smite hip and thigh the pedants who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among men of the world as that into which the classical languages have long since fallen at the hands of our learned philologians The root of the disease lies in a misapprehension of the term science  --  in a sort of hypnotic spell which this word has cast over the minds of all who practise in the profession of knowledge and wisdom . To suppose there can be a science of history in any sense corresponding to the science of material phenomena , is merely to bow down before the many-tongued idols of the marketplace . Truth is the aim of the historian , as it is of the scientist  --  as it is of the poet even ; but it has not yet appeared that the only road to historic truth is by the " town-pump " method of instruction , as the cynical have denominated the pedantry of our schools . Unless history recreates the life of a past age , with all the passions and aspirations of that bygone world at play , it is not easy to perceive what profit arises from its pursuit . Accurate sifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop there , as Professor Bury demands and as too many of our college men do in practice , is to harrow the Soil without planting the seed , more than that , it is to waive the one instrument at our service for controlling the traditions and documents that descend to us . Human passion was the source and formal cause of that life , and only by passion can its meaning be brought back to us of the present . " Men act from passion , " Hazlitt wrote , " and we can only judge of passion from sympathy . Persons of the dry and husky class above spoken of often seem to think even nature itself an interloper on their flimsy theories " And again : " Passion , in short , is the essence , the chief ingredient in moral truth , and the warmth of passion is sure to kindle the light of imagination on the objects around it . " There may seem something startling in this setting up of passion as the discoverer of historic truth ; and yet , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historian whose works endure and whose portrayal of a certain period has gained the common approval of readers , has almost invariably written , not coldly and pedantically , but with strong forejudgment . His absorbing feeling kindles the imagination ; by it he is able to comprehend the other human impulses at work as no cold registrar of documents can conceive them ; and in reading his works it is perfectly easy to bear in mind that " personal equation " which is easily discounted since it is unconcealed . In this Way , Carlyle discovered and gave to the world the character of Cromwell ? by passion . In this way , to name no other instance , Tacitus presented a ? icture of the Roman Empire ' , whose fundamental truth no mere maker of themes can shake , and whose exaggerations the reader can readily account for ; he has made the age forever alive and forever a lesson to the world . Now , it is needless to say that passion in the writer of history does not mean any deliberate coloring of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no place at all in the pursuit of science The error of Professor Bury and of the growing school he represents is the same error that vitiates so much that comes from pulpit and desk  --  the failure to perceive distinctions . True science has her own glory , from which no caviller may detract . This science falsely so called is no better than a parody and a stale imitation . Even if historic truth were to be found within the limitations set by Professor Bury , where were the profit ? It still holds good of such pedantry " That truth itself is in her head as dull And useless as a candle in a skull " The peril of allowing restrictions of this sort to creep into any field of university Work is too serious to be ignored by those who have the really higher education at heart . THE HEARING IN THE NORTHERN SE-CURITIES CASE . WASHINGTON , December 19 , 1903 . It has been current talk among lawyers and public men in Washington for the past few days that no case has come before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott decision fraught with graver consequences than that of the appeal of-the Northern Securities Company against the United States , which was argued on Monday and Tuesday last The present generation has not witnessed a deeper interest evinced at a hearing before this tribunal . True , there was intense concern manifested at the argument of the Income Tax cases The bar upon that occasion was crowded , and every available seat and standing-place outside of the bar was occupied , when Mr. Choate delivered his great argument , and Attorney-General Olney , with consummate ability , presented the views of the Government . Most of the audience then in attendance were well-to-do people , to whom the prospect of a tax upon income rendered the hearing of critical import to the individual pocket . But the Income Tax question , though coming home to a considerable fraction of the people , did not begin to embody so large a principle as that now at stake in the Northern Securities case . It was a burning political question , to be sure , but it lay within limits comparatively narrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the very foundation of our business prosperity , and reach the home of every workingman no less than that of every investor of capital . The case had been set for Monday , December 14 All the Justices were in their seats , with the exception of Mr. Justice Brown , unfortunately kept at home by an affection of the eyes . Although thus disabled from listening to the argument , it was agreed by the parties that he should sit in the case . The briefs of counsel and the oral arguments in printed form will be submitted to him . By noon , when the justices came in , the courtroom was crowded to its utmost capacity Several Senators were present , among them Nelson of Minnesota , Burrows of Michigan , and Fairbanks of Indiana , and a few Representatives , conspicuous among whom was Littlefield of Maine Judge Morrow , of the United States Circuit Court for the California District , sat within the bar . At the north table in front sat Attorney-General Knox , .. clean-cut , smooth-faced , and looking as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his full duty The Solicitor-General was present during the entire hearing , but took no part . Next to the Attorney-General sat William A Day , an **25;275;TOOLONG appointed specially to prepare the Trust cases Day was formerly an Auditor of the Treasury under Cleveland , and lately has practised almost exclusively before the Interstate Commission . Mr Russell , another Assistant from the Department of Justice , was on hand . That brilliant young attorney , James M. Beck , who , while **26;302;TOOLONG , argued the cause before the Circuit Court of St. Louis , was in attendance . To-day , in a Wall Street law firm , he sees something of business operations from the capitalist 's point of view . The counsel for the Northern Securities Company were grouped at the other table . Mr. John Johnson of Philadelphia , justly esteemed the leader of the bar , is a tall , finely built , powerful man , with a strong yet kindly face . Next to him sat George B. Young of St. Paul Years ago for a brief period he was a judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the Northwest as a student and lawyer of the highest rank He has an intellectual cast of countenance Next to him sat C. W Bunn , also of St Paul , an able and experienced railway lawyer . Mr. M. D. Grover , counsel for the Great Northern , and John W. Griggs , ex-Attorney-General of the United States , were also in line . Francis L Stetson of New York , George R. Peck of Chicago , and William P. Clough were seated near the counsel for the companies . These gentlemen , together with one or two others well known in the profession , presented a firm front of experienced and able corporation counsel . In truth , Mr John Johnson might well have been considered a host in himself . His generous stature , as contrasted with the trim , dapper figure of the Attorney-General , must have suggested to the mind of more than one spectator that the gamy champion of the Government was going forth like David to battle . The " plain people " had well discerned the meaning of the contest , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid mass behind the bar . A fair number of ladies were also to be seen . Mrs. Roosevelt , with Mrs- Knox , Mrs. Justice Holmes , Mrs Senator Lodge , and others well known in Washington society , paid undivided attention to what was going on . A large proportion of the members of the bar , it was evident , had come from points beyond Washington The Chief Justice announced that double the usual time would be allowed to each side . That meant four hours for either party . Mr Johnson proceeded to open the case in a plain , business-like manner . He had not spoken five minutes before everybody who heard him was convinced that here was no ordinary man Void of affectation , and to all appearance unconscious of self , Mr. Johnson talked to the Justices in a tone not exactly conversational , and yet only a little above it It was the conveying of information through a perfectly easy , untroubled channel . His wonderful ability consists in the perfection of his power of statement . In this respect older members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Benjamin R Curtis . Judge Curtis was cold , he used no gestures , but held the attention of the court by his remarkable clearness and conciseness . On the other hand , Mr Johnson ' adds to these qualities a gentle warmth and a vein of humor which render it a delight to listen to him .
