WHEN one takes a bird's-eye view of the fisheries of the world he quickly perceives that there is no family of fishes and no group of aquatic animals that contributes so largely to the support of the human race as the herrings . The family has 200 members , nearly all of which exist in great abundance . In nearly every country having extensive fisheries some kind of herring is of importance , and in many countries representatives of the family are among the most valuable of the water products . Some of the herrings live exclusively in salt water , some exclusively in fresh water , and some alternately in the sea and streams . Characters by which the herrings may readily be recognized are the presence of a single dorsal fin , which , like all the other fins , is composed only of soft or non-spinous rays ; the absence of an adipose dorsal fin , such as occurs in the salmons and trouts ; a swim-bladder , which communicates with the esophagus by a pneumatic duct ; four gills ; a forked tail ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully scaled body but naked head ; the absence of a series of " lateral line " organs , and a generally silvery coloration . The structure of the mouth parts determines the food , which usually consists of minute animals and plants , strained from the water by the numerous gill-rakers.  |p701  On the east coast of North America we have such well-known and important members of the family as the seaherring , the shad , the river herrings or alewives , the West Indian sardine , and the menhaden , the last doubtless the most abundant fish on our shores . On the Pacific coast of North America are the California sardine and the sea-herring . On the shores of Europe are the Allice shad and the Twaite shad ; the pilchard , which when young is canned under the name of sardine and sent to the outermost confines of civilization ; the sprat , and the sea-herring . In the Caspian and Black Seas and in the Volga herrings occur in great abundance and are the principal fish of those regions . The seas that wash the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Japan , teem with a number of kinds of herrings and sardines . In the waters of the Philippine and East Indian archipelagoes small and large members of the family abound . In the rivers of India runs the hilsa , which is similar to the American shad , and on the coast of India occur schools of the oil sardine . Herrings likewise exist in Australia and New Zealand ; in the rivers and coastal waters of Africa , and at the southern extremity of the Western Hemisphere , where the Chili sardine abounds . THE SEA-HERRING HAS DETERMINED THE DESTINY OF NATIONS But the herring par excellence is the sea-herring of the North Atlantic and the scarcely distinguishable sea-herring of the North Pacific . This fish ? biologically two species , commercially one species ? is the most abundant and most valuable in the world , and is therefore entitled to be called king . The sea-herrings are cold-water fish and reach their greatest abundance in far northern latitudes . The herring of the Atlantic , called Clupea harengus by Linnaeus , has a remarkably wide distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Strait of Gibraltar , whence it ranges to the White Sea and the Arctic Ocean as far north as Spitzbergen , occurring in enormous numbers in the Bay of Biscay , North Sea , Baltic Sea , and Norwegian Sea . It is thus found on the coasts of Spain , Portugal , France , Belgium , Holland , England , Wales , Scotland , Ireland , Denmark , Germany , Russia , Finland , Sweden , and Norway . With Iceland as an intermediate station , the fish crosses to the shores of Greenland , and extends its range southward and westward to Labrador , Newfoundland , Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and the New England shores , going in winter occasionally to New York and exceptionally as far south as the Virginia capes . The North Pacific herring , first called C/upea pallasi by Cuvier and Valenciennes , exists in the same extraordinary abundance as the Atlantic fish and has also a very extensive range , being found from California to Alaska and from Siberia to Korea and Japan . A tale as stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the seaherring in the history of some of the principal countries . " Its spawning and feeding grounds have determined the location of cities , " and in several instances the actual destiny of nations and the fate of monarchs appear to have been involved in the herring fishery . Countries in which the quest of the herring is an important industry are the United States ; the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Quebec , and British Columbia ; Newfoundland ; England , Scotland , Wales , and Ireland ; Norway , Sweden , and Denmark ; Russia ; Germany ; Holland ; Belgium ; France ; Japan , and Siberia . THE HERRING FORMS THE PRINCIPAL FOOD OF THE COD , HADDOCK , AND HOSTS OF OTHER FISH The chief purpose the herring subserves in nature is to be the food of a host of other creatures , some of which are of great economic value . The most important of the fishes that subsist regularly on herring are the cod , haddock . hake , and pollock , all of which consume immense quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and various other high-sea fishes prey largely on herring at times , and numerous species of little or no value to man ? like the sharks , dogfishes , sculpins , and flounders ? often gorge themselves with herring and their recently deposited eggs . Among the marine mammalia , whales , porpoises , dolphins , and seals prey on the herring and sometimes subsist *almost entirely on this fish . On parts of our northeast coast probably the worst enemy of the young herring is the squid , which frequents the inshore waters in immense numbers and is most adept and insatiable in capturing the unlucky herring , both in open waters and in the weirs of the fishermen . Small fishes , birds , and a perfect host of other minor creatures find a large part of their sustenance in the eggs and young of the herring , and in the aggregate are doubtless much more destructive than any of the major enemies mentioned . As the herring is probably more extensively preyed on than any other fish , and as it is entirely lacking in offensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its abundance and its prolificacy . THE WONDERFUI , FECUNDITY OF THE HERRING The average number of eggs deposited annually by a full-grown herring is 30,000 . This is not a particularly large number by comparison with the egg-laying capacity of many other marine foodfishes , but it is noteworthy in view of the small size of the fish and its remarkable abundance . If all the progeny of a single pair of herring were to reach maturity and spawn , and if all of their progeny were to survive and spawn , and if this were to go on for a few generations , the resulting volume of fish would be beyond comprehension . In fact , if such unrestricted multiplication were to continue for a period as short as ten years , all of the seas of the earth would be filled solid with herring , all land would be submerged , and all other creatures in the world would be crowded out of existence . USES OF THE HERRING The extraordinary- value attained by the sea-herring as a fishery product has depended in no small degree on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous ways in which it is susceptible of preservation . As a fish for consumption in a fresh condition , the sea-herring does not rank high by comparison with various other marine food-fishes inhabiting the same waters ; nevertheless , a perfectly fresh herring , when broiled , fried , or baked , is excellent . An important use for fresh herring is as bait in the line fisheries for bottom species like halibut , cod , and haddock , Immense quantities are thus consumed , particularly in New England and the British provinces . The herring for this purpose are taken mostly in winter and are frozen in bulk for preservation . The simplest method of preservation is that of drying without salt . This is a favorite method for small herring in Japan , and such fish , strung on straws or sticks , are seen exposed for sale in all parts of that country and are extensively eaten . -1 favorite and simple way of preparing herring for food in America and Europe is by smoking , which is usually preceded by a short immersion in brine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the herring that enter most largely into the commerce of the world are preserved by various degrees of salting . On the coast of Maine small herrings in bulk , preserved in pickle and seasoned with spices , are known as Russian sardines . One of the principal uses made of the sea-herring in New England is for canning as " sardines . " In the same region the fish are also canned under the name of herring , and before the enactment of the present beneficent pure-food law were sometimes sold to the unsuspecting consumer as " brook trout " and " mackerel . " In Great Britain a favorite canned preparation is kippered herring . The waste parts of herring at the sardine and salting establishments are convertible into an excellent fertilizer , called  |p703  " pomace " in Maine ; and in Japan , owing to lack of markets for the fish , immense numbers are caught for the special purpose of being converted into guano . Another product , usually made in connection with fertilizer , is oil , which has a wide use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STATES The herring fishery of the United States has always held subordinate rank . Although prosecuted from Puritan times and attaining great value , it has always been exceeded in importance by other fisheries in the states where the herring abounds . Owing to the distribution of the fish , Maine and Massachusetts have the most extensive fisheries , and the quantity of herring taken in the other New England states and in New York and New Jersey is very small . At no point south of Block Island does the fish occur in sufficient numbers or with sufficient regularity to support an established industry . Owing to the great abundance of herring in the shore waters of Maine and Massachusetts , and of the British provinces , there has been no occasion as yet to seek the herring offshore , and hence the American fishery differs markedly in methods from the European . The oldest , and for a long time the most common , manner of fishing for herring is torching ? a method learned from the aborigines . Up to about 1820 herring were caught in no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-known instinct of herring and other fishes to seek and follow a light , and is carried on with very simple apparatus . Projecting over the bow of a boat propelled by oars is a small iron basket , in which a fire of birch bark or other highly combustible material is kept burning while the fishing is going on . As soon as darkness comes on , the boat is rowed to the fishing grounds , one man steering , one man standing in the bow with a large dip-net . As the herring gather in little bunches in front of the light , they are readily caught with the dip-net , and sometimes fifteen to twenty barrels may thus be taken in a few hours . This method is followed chiefly in Passamaquoddy and Ipswich bays . THE HERRING ARE CAUGHT PRINCIPALLY IN WEIRS Gill nets , haul seines , and purse seines are more or less extensively employed for herring on various parts of our coast , but the characteristic apparatus in the region of most important fishing is the brush weir , which came into use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of taking herring in Maine , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia , being particularly important in Passamaquoddy Bay and its tributaries . The brush weir is an aboriginal fishing device in all parts of the world , and variations in structure are numerous ; but its essential feature is an inclosure made of brush , located on the shore , on a bar , between the mainland and an island or between two islands , into which the fish wander and from which they are prevented from escaping by their inability to find the exit , by the fall of tide , by the closing of the entrance , or by peculiarities of construction . The herring brush weirs of the northeast coast are very substantially built and some are of large capacity and of considerable value . The stout stakes or posts are driven into the bottom at close intervals , or , in case the bottom is rocky , are attached to large stones , and this framework is strengthened by heavy horizontal stringers . The portion below low-water line is closely woven with branches of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of a forked stick . The upper part of the weir is of loosely woven brush extending vertically two or three feet above high water . As the average tidal movement is twenty feet , and in spring nearly thirty feet , the amount of material required is considerable . Some weirs are mere semicircular inclosures , while others are provided with leaders or wings or both . The weirs are always fished at low  |p704  tide , as then the herring are concentrated and may be more readily secured . The fishermen enter the weirs in boats , set a seine and haul its ends together , and then take out the fish with huge dip-nets . In some places the fish are left dry by the receding tide , and may be gathered by hand or with pitchforks . From 200 to 400 brush weirs are operated in waters adjacent to the international boundary between Maine and New Brunswick . They supply herring for bait , smoking , salting , and canning , and often yield very large profits to their owners . The unit of measure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many hundreds of hogsheads ? sometimes several thousand ? may be taken in a single weir in the course of a season . $20,000 WORTH OF HERRING CAPTURED BY ONE WEIR Upward of $20,000 has been received for the herring taken in one fortunately located weir , and there is a record of a weir on the Canadian side of Passamaquoddy Bay which was leased by Americans at an annual rental of $2,000 , with a bonus of $3 for each hogshead of fish caught ; yet , notwithstanding this seemingly exorbitant price , the lessees , before the close of the first season , were able to pay three years ' rental in advance , owing to the large catch and high prices of small herring . The prosperity , if not the very existence , of the herring weir fishery on the northeast coast depends on the presence of a large number of canneries at Eastport , Lubec , and other places on or near the Maine border , where herring are converted into " sardines . " Weirs have also been constructed along the central and western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canneries and smoke-houses , and large catches are often made at points remote from the center of the herring industry . It is recorded that in October and November , 1908 , a brush weir in the Bagaduce River near Castine took 20,000,000 small herring ? a quantity so large that no local market could be found and the catch had to be sent to places as far eastward as Lubec . THE AMERICAN " SARDINE " The most valuable branch of the American herring industry is the canning of small herring under the name of " sardines . " The business began in 1875 , preceded by six or seven years of experimental work , and has continued up to the present time . The factories are located at suitable points along the entire Maine coast , but are most numerous on or near the eastern boundary , for reasons elsewhere stated . These factories give employment to many thousand men , women , and children ; utilize immense quantities of herring that would otherwise find little market , and produce a wholesome food that for many years was marketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its proper name and on its own merits , with a resulting improvement in quality . The most valuable herrings for canning are the young , from three to five inches long , suitable for packing in " quarter " cans . The demand for these has at times been so active that fabulous prices ? far beyond the real worth of the fish ? have been paid . As much as $loo per hogshead was given one season , and a price of $30 per hogshead has not infrequently prevailed ; but , on the other hand , the price has often fallen to $2 and has not averaged more than from $5 to $8 . Herring of larger size are put up in oil , mustard , and tomato sauce in " half " and " three-quarter " tins , but the chief use made of the larger fish is for smoking . The Maine coast is dotted with herring smoke-houses , some independent , others in connection with canneries , and several million boxes of delicious smoked herring are there placed on the market each season . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herring obtainable from home waters , but have for many years engaged in a herring fishery and trade on the shores of the Canadian maritime provinces and of Newfound/ land . This business has been conducted mostly in winter , when the fishing vessels were otherwise idle , when the fish were schooling in the waters of the neighboring provinces , when there was a scarcity on our own shores , and when there was a good demand for herring for use as bait in the line fisheries . For this purpose our vessel fishermen resorted to various regions and engaged in the business in various ways , depending on local conditions , sometimes catching the herring themselves , sometimes hiring the provincials to fish for them , sometimes buying outright the herring already caught and awaiting a purchaser . The principal localities thus visited by our vessels were Passamaquoddy Bay and other waters near the mouth of the Bay of Fundy , the Magdalene Islands , and the treaty shores of Newfoundland . At present only the last-named region is concerned in this trade . TROUBLES WITH NEWFOUNDLAND AND GREAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious international questions that have arisen in American history have been due to the operation of our herring fishermen in the waters of Canada and Newfoundland . The difficulties grew out of ambiguities in the Treaty of 1818 between the United States and Great Britain , and have continued , with violent exacerbations , up to the present moment ; for the Treaty of 1818 has remained the chief instrument defining the rights of the American fishermen in British North American waters , and it has never been construed in a way satisfactory to both governments . It is very likely that had the controversy been between the mother country and her principal daughter it would have been amicably settled many years ago ; but each of the maritime provinces as well as Newfoundland sought to have a hand in construing the treaty and in making modifications thereof to suit local conditions , and the result has been what would naturally have been expected . Fortunately the fishery question is now quiescent over a large part of His Britannic Majesty 's North American coasts , and it is only in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a bone of contention . The recent history of this dispute is well known . For a number of years the United States government has had a representative on the ground in the person of an expert of the Bureau of Fisheries , who has remained there during the entire season for the threefold purpose of keeping our State Department informed of the condition of affairs , of advising our fishermen of their treaty rights , and of dissuading them from any attempt to violate the proper local regulations . Being in a staunch naval tug or revenue cutter , this representative has also been of material assistance to our fishermen in pulling out of the ice herring schooners that have stayed too late and been frozen in ? a courtesy that has been extended also to vessels from the Canadian provinces . The efforts of the Newfoundland government to restrict and modify the rights enjoyed by our fishermen under the Treaty of 1818 have been the subject of diplomatic correspondence between the United States and Great Britain , with the result that pending the settlement of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viveudi which permits greater freedom of fishery than the colonial authorities were willing to accord . Happily the entire controversy will soon be adjudicated by arbitration at The Hague . VALUABLE HERRING FISHERIES ON PACIFIC COAST AS YET UNDEVELOPED The herring fishery of the west coast of the United States is of comparatively minor importance but of great prospective value . The herring abounds , but the demand is limited in the regions of greatest abundance . The largest fishery is at Killisnoo , Alaska , where , in 1908 , about 2,000 barrels of herring were converted into oil and guano . The manufacture of these secondary products began many years ago and for a long time was  |p709  the only use to which the Alaskan herring was put . At other points in southeast and central Alaska the herring is utilized in fresh and salted conditions for human food and for bait in the halibut fisheries . In all the coast states there is a limited herring fishery , the most important interests centering at San Francisco . The herring fishery of the United States at the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive $870,000 . Of this quantity about 10,000,000 pounds are obtained in Pacific waters . The manufactured herring products ? oils , fertilizers , sardines , etc. ? are worth several million dollars . CANADA 'S EXTENSIVE HERRING FISHERIES The Dominion of Canada has the most extensive herring fisheries of the Western Hemisphere . All of the maritime provinces of Canada have an abundance of herring , and in all of them large quantities of this fish are placed on the market in various forms . Among all the foodfishes of Canada , the herring is exceeded in value only by the salmon and the cod . As the most abundant of the shore fishes of the eastern provinces , the herring played an important part in their colonization and has continued to be a large factor in their growth and prosperity . It is in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick that the herring fisheries have attained their greatest development . As early as the eighteenth century large quantities of smoked herring in boxes were exported from Nova Scotia , and Lorenzo Sabine in his report to the Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 1853 ) said of the herring of Annapolis Basin : This fish , well smoked and of approved color , is a great luxury for the forenoon lunch and for the tea-table , and the time has been when a herring box branded Digby ' or with the name of a well-known curer there , passed as current in our markets , without examination , as coin received at the mint . The beautiful town of Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , remains true to its name and has for years sent to the market " bloaters " that for quality would reflect no discredit on the fish so called that originated at Yarmouth , the great herring center on the North Sea . On the shores of New Brunswick large quantities of small herring are caught , and some of these are canned locally ; a very large percentage , however , are sent to the sardine factories at Eastport and Lubec . Lying in the middle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is a group of small , picturesque islands known as the Magdalenes , which have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely entwined . Their value consists almost exclusively in their fishery resources , chief among which is the herring ; this fish resorts to the shores in immense shoals at times , and for at least 250 years has been a source of livelihood to the hardy inhabitants . Many of the fishermen are lineal descendants of those Acadians who , under De Monts and Champlain , made the first permanent settlement in New France ; and up to a comparatively recent time , and doubtless to some extent even down to the present , they preserved the dress , language , and customs of their ancestors . The tenure of these islands and their rich fishing privileges was once granted by the British crown to Richard Gridley , of Massachusetts , who in 1775 constructed the defensive works on Bunker Hill and became chief of the engineer department of the Revolutionary army . Under the Treaty of 1818 American fishermen enjoy the same fishing rights at the Magdalenes as the resident Canadians , and in former years many New England vessels resorted to these islands to participate in the herring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large size , and 25,000,000 pounds have been taken some seasons . In the middle of the nineteenth century as many as 15o fishing vessels from Maine and Massachusetts have sometimes been observed catching herring here at one time , but of late years the value of the islands to our fishermen has become insignificant .  |p711  A REMARKABLE VISITATION OF HERRING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA The abundance of herring on the coasts of British Columbia has been known for many years . .1 herring fisherman from Yarmouth , England , has expressed the opinion that the herring fishing grounds of the North Sea can not compare with those off the shores of British Columbia , and he reported a remarkable visitation of herring near Nanaimo recently , when the shore for two miles was knee deep with these fish , that had been crowded ashore by millions more while on their way to the spawning grounds . The provincial fishery authorities , who are well aware of the conditions of the herring fishery in England and Scotland , are convinced that the British Columbia herring can be put on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the transatlantic fish , and they see no reason why an industry worth from $5,000,000 to $6,000,000 yearly may not be established . The herring catch of the Canadian provinces in the fiscal year 1907-8 was about 155,600,000 pounds , of which the first value was $2,225,000 . Taking into consideration the immature fish utilized in the preparation of sardines , considerably more than 1,000,000,000 herring are taken annually in Canada . NEWFOUNDLAND The herring fishery of Newfoundland is important to that colony , but adds comparatively little to the world 's supply of fish . It is chiefly noteworthy for the international complications to which it has given rise from a very early date . The principal fishery is carried on in winter at the Bay of Islands , on the " treaty shores , " and owes its success , if not its existence , to the American schooners from Gloucester which resort there every season and leave among the local fishermen a large amount of money , expended for labor and fish . In 1907 , out of a total catch of 154,709 barrels of fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American vessels or vessels chartered by Americans took to Gloucester 113,326 barrels , which were used for bait in the line fisheries of Massachusetts . The friction that has frequently arisen over the herring fishery in Newfoundland has been due in part to ambiguity in the phraseology of the Treaty of 1818 and in part to the action of the colonial authorities in making the broad provisions of the treaty subordinate to local regulations . The effort to negative the treaty rights of American fishermen became more pronounced after the failure of Newfoundland to secure reciprocity with this country , and recently necessitated the interference of , the mother country . THE HERRING WAS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHARLES IS TROUBLES For many centuries the herring has been the object of extensive fisheries in England and Scotland , and in recent years has attained greater importance than ever before . In both England and Scotland the fish has figured in history more than any other water creature , and has not only been of ' inestimable economic importance , but has had noteworthy influence on national affairs . The prosecution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dignity of nobility and royalty . Fitz-Greene Halleck tells us that Lord Stafford mines for coal and salt , The Duke of Norfolk deals in malt , The Douglas in red herrings . In 1677 the Duke of York and other personages of rank formed a corporation , called " The Company of the Royal Fishery of England , " for the purpose of carrying on the herring fishery in the North Sea . They built a fleet of Dutch " busses " and manned them with Dutch fishermen , and then were bankrupted by the capture of their vessels during a war with France . In 1720 some two thousand of " the principal gentlemen of Scotland " formed a company for herring fishing , but were quickly disrupted , leaving a mournful lot of stockholders . In 1750 the Prince of Wales became president or  |p712  governor of a herring fishery company with a capital of 500,000 , whose members " were among the first men in the kingdom , " one of the promoters being General James Oglethorpe , founder of the State of Georgia . Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efforts were made to learn the secrets of the Dutch methods of curing herring ; but the company soon suspended and its failure cast on the English herring fishery an odium that continued for a long time . It is a matter of great historical interest that the herring fisheries should have been a prime , and perhaps the most important , factor in the overthrow of Charles I , whose attitude toward the development of home and colonial fisheries was most unreasonable and unfortunate . At a time when the Dutch herring fishery had attained such magnitude and importance that it was regarded as the " right arm of Holland , " and when the sturdy Dutch fishermen were pursuing their lucrative calling under the encouragement of their government , the English people were chafing under the grievous restrictions imposed , by royal approval , on all who desired to engage in fishing anywhere off the American coast between the fortieth and forty-eighth degrees of north latitude . This effort on the part of the crown to interfere with the cherished privilege of " free fishing " had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the first in the series of far-reaching differences that sprung up relative to the prerogatives of the crown as against the rights of the subject . At the same time there was another restriction placed on the fishermen at home . When James ascended the throne of England his navy consisted of but thirteen vessels , and Charles succeeded to a war fleet but little stronger and utterly inadequate to cope with the navy of the Dutch or French . After Charles had been successfully opposed by the Commons in his plan to have no fishing conducted on the American shores except by permission of the company of " noblemen , knights. and gentlemen , " known as the Council of Plymouth , he levied " ship money " on the fishing and mercantile vessels at home  |p713  in order to build up his navy , with the distinct object of breaking tip the Dutch herring fishery on the shores of England and driving the Dutch from " the four narrow seas " over which England claimed jurisdiction . At the expense of the fisheries and navigation , Charles finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and succeeded in his purpose so far as the Dutch were concerned , but the levying of " ship money " stirred up civil war at home and Charles paid the extreme penalty . THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A FAILURE IN THE HERRING FISHERY OE YARMOUTH Grimsby , Lowestoft , North Shields , and Yarmouth , the important English fishing centers on the North Sea , have great interests in the herring fishery . At Grimsby , the world 's greatest fishing port , and North Shields the herring is overshadowed by the bottom fish caught with beam-trawls , but at Lowestoft and Yarmouth the herring predominates . The fishery at Yarmouth , which may be taken as a type , is carried on with steam and sail vessels called luggers , having a crew of eleven men and carrying , as means of capture , 200 gill-nets costing $10 each . These nets are 30 yards long and 20 yards deep , the average size of the mesh , bar measure , being equal to a shilling piece . when fishing begins the nets are tied together and the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thick for fifteen or twenty miles off Yarmouth , fishing may be done at any hour of the day or night , but the best times are about sunrise and sunset . Fish are not left long in the nets unless storms prevent hauling . Some vessels land their fish fresh , others drysalt their catch at sea and store it in compartments in the hold . A vessel may leave port , set nets , make a catch , and be back home the same day , or it may remain out for two weeks . There has never been a failure in the herring fishery of Yarmouth , and the thousands of persons in this quaint town who are dependent on the herring have few of those apprehensions that come to most people whose welfare is contingent on the uncertain harvest of the seas . FIGURES SHOWING THE MAGNITUDE OE THE HERRING FISHERY OE SCOTLAND At the present time the herring fishery of Scotland exceeds in magnitude that of any other country , being about 50 per cent more extensive than that of England , which ranks second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the catch exceeded 630,000,000 pounds , and the fish , if placed end to end , would have extended more than 8,000 miles . The chief centers of the industry are the Shetland Islands , Fraserborough , Peterhead , and Aberdeen . The Scotch fishery , like the English , is undergoing a radical change , consisting in the elimination of sailing vessels and the more extensive use of steamers , which are yielding a much larger proportion of the catch this year . In 1907 the number of steam vessels was about 500 ( an increase of 85 per cent over 1906 ) , valued , with their gear , at $6,000,000 . The quantity of gill-netting set for herring in the waters adjacent to the Scotch coasts is almost incredible , and it is difficult to understand how , with the fishing going on day after day for months , any considerable number of fish escape . The fact that the fishery has continued so many years without impairment indicates the wcnderful prodigality and remarkable recuperative powers of nature . The gill-nets used by the Scotch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach three and a half times around the earth and their actual area exceeded 48 square miles . The fishery is divided into three sections in the official reports , but these are . not sharply defined as at present conducted , although doubtless quite distinct originally ; thus the " great summer fishery " extends from July 1 to December 31 , the " early summer fishery " continues from April to June 30 , and the " winter fishery " is conducted in January , February , and March . The run of herring on the coasts of Scotland attracts fishermen from all over  |p715  western Europe and often results in the most heterogeneous aggregations imaginable . Local authorities of the ports adjacent to the fishing grounds have their hands full in order to provide for the proper housing , feeding , sanitation , etc. , of a tenfold increase in population ( luring the short period of a " run . " I may cite from the report of the Scotch Fishery Board for 1907 the case of a sudden influx of population at Balta Sound , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than 500 , but at the beginning of June , during a fairly successful season , this will have increased to about 10,000 persons , and , in addition to the purely Shetland element in this population , there will probably be a fleet of fishing vessels from the east and west coasts of Scotland , steam drifters from England , sailing craft from the Isle of Man and the north of Ireland , and booms , ' luggers , and steam drifters from France , Belgium , Holland , Germany , Denmark , Sweden , and Norway the number and variety of the various craft , the picturesque and characteristic garb of the fishermen of different nationalities , and the babel of various tongues forming a scene probably unparalleled at any other fishing port in the world except Lerwick . Notwithstanding this large addition to the population , it speaks volumes for the law-abiding nature of those engaged in the industry that it has never been necessary to augment the staff of police usually employed . When a herring vessel arrives in port the fish are lifted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are counted into baskets by hand , too fish to a basket . These baskets are then passed over the rail to the dock and emptied into large , peculiarly shaped baskets holding Soo fish , arranged on the dock in lines or tiers of 20 baskets each . The fish are heaped in 10 piles over the edges of adjoining baskets to facilitate counting . A line of the large baskets constitutes a last , which is the unit of measure in the herring trade . A last represents about 1y2 tons of herring , or theoretically 10,000 fish , but as a matter of fact 13,200 fish of any size . as 132 fish are called 10O in counting . Herring are sold at public auction by lasts . The buyer puts his card or tag on the first basket of the tier , and his drayman comes shortly afterwards and takes the fish to the picklinghouse or smoke-house .

THE " YARMOUTH BLOATER " Considerable quantities of herring are consumed in a fresh condition , and the celebrated " whitebait " of England consists almost exclusively of young herring ; but the herring fishery and trade owe their importance to the herring that are preserved in various ways . Household names in Great Britain applied to the different kinds of cured fish are " bloater , " " kippered herring , " " white-cured herring , " and " red herring . " The " bloater , " especially the " Yarmouth bloater , " has a world-wide reputation , either in its original form or as now prepared in America and Canada , and it is the favorite herring for local consumption . In the United States a bloater is a large , lightly smoked herring ; but in Great Britain a fish of any size may be a bloater , which may be defined as an unsplit , lightly salted , lightly smoked herring intended for immediate consumption . Among the varieties of preserved herring none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential characteristic of which is that before being salted and smoked they are split and eviscerated . " White-cured herring " give to the English and Scotch herring trade the great extent it has attained , as such fish , after being gutted through the gill cavity and heavily salted , are packed in barrels and sent all over the world . A very elaborate set of regulations for preparing " white-cured herring " has been drawn up by the Scotch fishery board , and each barrel of salt fish is officially guaranteed by a mark or brand showing size , quality , spawning condition , etc. , of the fish . " Red herring " are a special grade of heavily salted fish that are smoked for a long time , to give them a rich brown color , and are intended chiefly for the Italian , Grecian , and general  |p716  Mediterranean trade . There are few kinds of preserved fish which have greater thirst-producing properties ; and they became favorites at home at a very early date , and are frequently referred to in the poetic literature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many people that they were " neither fish , nor flesh , nor good red herring . " The handling , smoking , curing , packing , and shipping of herring give employment to a veritable army , a large proportion of which are women . In the Scotch herring industry the shoresmen are drawn mostly from the Highlands and the Hebrides and number fully 50,000 , and the curing business of both England and Ireland is dominated by Scotchmen . The herring fishery of England and Wales in 1906 yielded about 328,000,000 pounds of fish , for which the catchers were paid $6,595930 , the largest price ever received in the history of the fishery . As showing the preponderating importance of the North Sea as a fishing ground , it may be noted that while the south and west coasts of England produced 25,000,000 pounds of herring , the east coast is credited with 303,000,000 pounds . The best year in the history of the Scotch fishery was 1907 , when over 631,000,000 pounds of herring , valued at $9,081,300 , were taken by 25,000 fishermen in 5,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 2,578,268 barrels , which brought the packers $13,148,385 . Of the foregoing 627,100 barrels were exported to Russia and 1,186,100 barrels to Germany , about fifty per cent of the latter quantity being reexported to Russia . The herring represents more to the Irish fishermen than any other product of the waters , and its value is nearly onethird of the entire yield of the fishing industry of the country . The fish is taken with drift-nets around the entire coast , but the largest catch is made on the east and north shores . In 1907 the output was nearly 31,000,000 pounds , for which the fishermen received over $500,000 . The principal centers of the fishery are Downings Bay , Ardglass , Howth , and Donegal . FRANCE France is one of the great fishing nations of the world , and herring is her principal water product . It is true that the value of the French cod fishery somewhat exceeds that of the sea-herring , but nearly all of the cod are caught off Iceland and Newfoundland , leaving the herring easily the leading fish of home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in the North Sea by Dieppe and Rouen fishermen as early as the eleventh century . It had attained great importance by the eighteenth century , but declined during and after the Napoleonic wars . The French herring fishery is now in a very flourishing condition and is more extensive than ever before , so that in continental Europe France is surpassed only by Holland as a producer of herring . The fishery is naturally divisible into two sections , one conducted in the North Sea and the other along the shores of the north and west coasts of France . The leading center is Boulogne , with Fecamp a close second . Other important points are Calais , Staples , Saint-Valery-surSomme , Dieppe , Honfleur , Trouville , Villerville , and Etretat . The year 1905 was the most successful recorded up to that time , and for it detailed official statistics are available . It appears that 10,880 fishermen then set their nets for the herring hosts , and that more than 163,000,000 pounds of these fish were marketed . Two-thirds of the product came from the coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds , the North Sea . The substantial sum of 18,260,000 francs inured to the French herring fishermen in 1905 . One of the most interesting and farreaching episodes in French history happened in the year 1428 and was directly connected with the herring . The English , who were then besieging Orleans , which was held by the French , sought to  |p719  provide a fish diet during Lent for the investing army . The French , however , made a sortie and endeavored to intercept the supply train bringing in the coveted salted herrings . Then was fought the celebrated " Battle of the Herrings . " The French were defeated and were ready to surrender the city , but at this critical point the Maid of Orleans made her initial appearance on the horizon of history and accomplished , as her first chosen task , the raising of the siege . " THE FOUNDATIONS OF AMSTERDAM WERE LAID ON HERRING BONES " The herring fishery is inextricably entwined with the history of Holland , and in no other country has the herring been relatively so important . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries ago was due directly to their herring fishery : the Dutch navy , for years the most formidable , was manned by herring fishermen , and the  |p720  tremendous foreign trade of Holland depended largely on the herring . The old saying that " the foundations of Amsterdam were laid on herring bones " might have been literally true of that place and various other Dutch ports . In the Middle Ages , when all continental Europe ate no animal food save fish ( luring Lent , the consumption of cured fish was enormous and the demand was supplied chiefly by the Dutch . Only a few figures have been preserved to show how extensive the herring fishery was in medieval times . It is known , however . that at one period in the fifteenth century there were 50,000 Dutch herring fishermen , and between 200,000 and 300,000 people engaged on shore in building vessels , making nets , constructing barrels , and handling the catch : there were also many thousand men on the vessels that transported the  |p721  salt herring to ports on the Mediterranean and Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her continental neighbors , but in recent times has been surpassed by England and Scotland . Vlaardingen , situated on the Maas a few miles below Rotterdam , is the center of the herring trade . There the herring boats fit out , there they land their catch , and there are the substantial houses in which the fish are prepared for shipment . Both steam and sail vessels are employed in the fishery , the former chiefly in the offshore operations in the North Sea . The cotton gill-nets used are 36o meshes deep and 720 meshes long , and are so arranged with corks and leads that they sink six feet below the surface . As from 8o to 15o nets are set at one time , it appears that the total length of netting used by each vessel is from 1 1/2 to nearly 3 miles . In 1905 the Dutch herring fishery yielded $4,447,470 . This sum represented 114,492,000 herring caught in the Zuyder Zee and 608 , o81 barrels of salted herring caught in the North Sea . The aggregate weight of the product was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , has given to the Dutch herring their well-merited reputation for quality is the dressing and salting of the fish immediately after the nets are hauled on board the vessels . Provided with a short knife , tied to the third and fourth fingers of the right hand by a string attached to the handle , the fishermen thrust the knife through the gill cavities of the herring , and in withdrawing it cut and bear away the gills , heart . esophagus , and pectoral fins . The opening of the large blood-vessels leads to free bleeding , and as a result the flesh becomes pale , whereas in the Scotch fishery the cutting is done after the blood has clotted , and the flesh remains dark reddish . The Dutch fishermen become very expert in cutting . and some of them can cut 1,200 fish an hour . As soon as the herring are thus dressed they are salted in barrels and stored on board until the end of the trip . It is a matter of some local interest to know that many of the barrels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world are made from oak staves imported from New York , Baltimore , and Newport News . The hoops are made from willow trees grown on the dikes . Some very ancient customs connected with the herring fishery are still observed in more or less modified form . The landing of the first haul of herring in a town was the occasion for a general holiday and merrymaking . The fish dealers in some places used to offer a ducat apiece for the first fish caught , and the first herring of the season was placed in a decorated car at The Hague and taken in pomp to the king , who presented 500 florins to the fortunate fishermen . NORWAY While the cod overshadows all other fishes of Norway , the herring ranks sec , and in importance , being taken in larger quantities and having greater value than all the remaining water products combined . The fish is found along the entire coast , and is caught for market from , the Skager Rak to North Cape , but theprincipal fishing is in the districts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordland . Herring fishing on the Norwegian coast has a very romantic aspect . The fjords and bays where the fish are found are picturesque in the extreme , and most of the boats are the old Viking type . The Norwegians classify their herring as spring herring or spawn herring , summer herring or fat herring , and brisling or small herring , the aggregate catch and value of these being in the order named . In capturing herring set gill-nets , drift gill-nets , and sweep-seines are used . The usual apparatus for the North Sea and other open waters is the drift-net . Sweep-seines and chains of set-nets are often employed to barricade schools of herring that have wandered or been scared into a cove or an arm of a fjord . The most interesting type of net in the Norwegian herring fishery , however , is the " synkenot , " a piece of netting about  |p725  250 feet square which is lowered to the bottom while each corner is connected with a boat . Large catches , particularly of fat summer herring , are made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to year , but show no striking changes in the past decade . Some seasons the fishermen have numbered less than 20,000 and others as many as 50,000 . The catch in 1905 was 291,293,000 pounds , for which the fishermen received $2,473,300 . SWEDEN The herring resorts to all the coasts of Sweden , but is most abundant on the western seaboard , in the Skager Rak and Kattegat , becoming less numerous in the Baltic , and still less so in the Gulf of Bothnia . The periodicity in abundance to which the fish is liable in Scandinavian waters has been particularly noteworthy in Sweden , and has meant a great deal to - the coastwise districts of that country , where fishing is the leading industry and the herring the principal fish . In the archipelago forming a part of the districts of Goteborg and Bohus a herring fishery of great importance sprang up at a very early date . Prior to the sixteenth century no records were kept , but as both church and state derived an income from herring tithes and taxation , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the beginning of the eleventh century . It has likewise been established that even at that time , when fishing could not have had any possible influence , there were long series of years when the herring were practically absent from the region , and such times of scarcity have alternated with years of abundance up to the present day . The periods of abundance have lasted from 20 to 80 years , and the periods of scarcity from 6o to 70 years , during the past four centuries . From 1747 to 1808 the herring was present on this coast , and the great prosperity enjoyed by Goteborg in the latter part of the eighteenth century was directly dependent on the herring fishery ; but during the next 68 years the herring failed to appear and distress and financial loss resulted . A Swedish clergyman has given some idea of the extent of this calamity , when the herring had been absent less than 25 years . Writing in 1831 , he said : He who knew the coast of Bohuslan twentyfive years ago and now sees it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it presented an imposing appearance . From the sea itself rose massive walls and pillars supporting immense salting houses and oil refineries . Farther inland rich warehouses and busy workshops might be seen , as well as palatial residences of the merchants and neat cottages of the fishermen and workingmen . The coast was crowded with a busy throng and the sea studded with sails . Every night it looked as if there were a grand illumination , many thousand lights shining from the windows and from the numerous lamps along the quays , and being reflected in the waves . Everything was life and bustle , and tons of gold exchanged hands . Now nothing is seen but ruins , only here and there a dilapidated fisherman 's cottage , awakening melancholy thoughts in the visitor . Would that those glorious times for which thousands are sighing might return . In 1877 the herring returned , and immediately there sprang up a great fishery which has continued to the present time . The period of maximum production was 1890 to 1895 , since which years there has been a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herring from this coast . It has been possible only in recent years to offer a rational and adequate explanation of the periodical abundance of the herring on the Swedish shores , although for centuries all kinds of theories have been advanced . As the result of careful studies of the physical and biological conditions prevailing in the North Sea and its tributaries , Scandinavian scientists have reached the conclusion that the cause of the wonderful fluctuations in the herring is to be found in the presence or absence of coastal bank-water coming in from the North Sea and giving to the shore waters of Bohuslan certain peculiarities . When , under the influence of winds or currents , or both , this new mass of water containing food and having the proper density sweeps to the east/ ern side of Kattegat , the herring go with it and a fishery follows . Various forms of gill-nets and seines are employed , the most productive apparatus being drift gill-nets . About 1895 fully 10,000 fishermen were engaged in the Swedish herring fishery , and fish to the value of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were much less abundant , and the catch fell to $475,000 . OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES Russia has a fishery for the seaherring in the White and Baltic seas , but no reliable information relative to the extent of the industry is available . The principal catch of herring is made in the Caspian and Black seas , the species sought being large and similar to our shad . Belgium 's interest in the herring fishery at the present day is comparatively trivial ; but in ancient times a large part of the coastwise population made a living by catching and salting herrings . As early as the twelfth century the Flemish herrings were renowned , and the Flemish fishermen visited the coasts of England , Scotland , Norway , and Denmark , to take herring in their drift-nets when for any reason the fish failed to visit the home shores . So valuable was the herring that the fishermen sometimes cruised as far as Iceland when the fish were scarce in nearer waters . The Flemish herring fishermen became particularly prosperous when Edward III of England permitted them to sell their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is restricted to the towns of La Panne and Coxyde , from which about too small sloops operate . Their catch in 1906 was worth only $53,950 . Denmark has herring fishing in the North Sea , Skager Rak , Kattegat , Lim Fjord , and Baltic Sea : but by far the most extensive industry is in the waters east of the Skaw , chief of which is the Kattegat . Between too and 200 million herring are taken annually , and in a recent year the value of the catch was $619,000 . The herring fishery of Germany is of ancient origin . While there are minor interests in the Baltic Sea , the industry has always centered at Emden , at the mouth of the Ems , and been supported by the shoals of fish in the North Sea . After wears of cessation , the fishery sprang up again at Emden in 1872 , owing to the advent of a Dutch firm from Vlaardingen , and the growth of the business there has been steady . At present upward of 15o German vessels , including a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea fishery , and the annual catch is from 40 to 50 million pounds , worth about $1,000,000 . JAPAN In this country , whose fisheries are comparatively more important than in any other and actually more valuable than in any except the United States and Great Britain , the herring is easily the most valuable product of the waters . The fish occurs in immense shoals on the northern coasts of Japan , from Sakhalin to the northern parts of Honshu , being particularly abundant and caught in largest quantities in Hokkaido . The fishery is conducted in spring , and is prosecuted with gill-nets , seines , and pound-nets . In Hokkaido , where 16,000 fishermen engage in this branch , most of the herring caught are made into guano , owing to the immense quantities caught in a very short time and to the lack of facilities for curing or preserving in any other way . The average quantity of herring marketed in japan annually of late years has been over 325,000,000 pounds , valued at $4,250,000 , and has occasionally reached 430,000,000 pounds . In the fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,400 , - 000 , are prepared each year . The acquisition of part of Sakhalin , together with the fishing privileges on the Siberian coasts secured by , salmon , and herring , and the development of the new grounds that is now in progress will add  |p730  much to the value of the herring fisheries . TEN BILLION HERRING CAUGHT ANNUALLY From official statistics of all of the - principal and most of the minor fishing - countries and from careful estimates for all of the remaining countries , it is quite - evident that the sea-herrings of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans are easily the most important fishes in the world today , being taken in greater numbers , constituting a larger food supply , supporting more people , and yielding larger money returns than any other product of the seas . The world 's annual production of herring at the present time is about 2,495 , - 000,000 pounds , having a value of $36 , - 895,000 at first hands . The value of the herring as placed on the markets , in the form of salted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guano , is not less than $6o , - 000,000 . Many years ago Professor Huxley estimated that three billion herring were taken annually in the North Atlantic Ocean and its arms . These figures were doubtless ultra-conservative , as they were based on an allowance of only two fish to a pound , and did not take into consideration the hundreds of millions of pounds of immature and small fish caught in all countries . From an estimate based on the present extent of the fisheries , and on the actual weight of the herring in different countries and industries , varying from less than one-tenth of a pound in the " sardine " fishery of Maine and New Brunswick to nearly a pound in the case of the largest " bloaters " in America and Europe . I have reached the conclusion that the annual destruction of herring by man at the present time exceeds 10,900,000,000 fish , or seven fish to every person in the world . Some pains have been taken to ascertain the approximate number of people who are engaged in the herring fisheries and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packers , curers , canners , smokers , coopers , net-makers and menders , wharfin- gers shippers , vessel and boat builders , and many other trades . From the best information obtainable it seems that not less than 375,000 persons are directly suppbrted by the herring . If to these are added their families , fully 1,250,000 men , women , and children would appear to be dependent upon this fish . WILL THE HERRING SUPPLY LAST ? The question of the perpetuity or maintenance of a species which is caught in such immense quantities has engaged the attention of governments , scientists , publicists , and fishermen for many years . One of the most philosophical minds ever enlisted in the service of fishes and fisheries was that of Thomas H. Huxley , whose well-known investigations of the herring in behalf of the British government have afforded the best basis for judging of the stability of pelagic fishes like the herring with reference to the possible effects of man 's influence thereon . Huxley 's researches more than those of any other person have determined the attitude of governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of the free-swimming marine fishes . Huxley concluded that the entire annual take of herring in Europe does not represent more fish than would be contained in any one of scores of shoals existing at one and the same time . The fact that , with a few peculiar local exceptions , the abundance of herring has remained unimpaired for centuries affords ground for Huxley 's recommendation that in the case of the herring , and inferentially of other species of similar habits , the best thing for the governments to do regarding the fisheries therefor is to do nothing , letting the " people fish how they like , as they like , and when they like . " The destruction wrought by man is , in fact , insignificant when compared with that which must regularly occur independently of him ; and , as an average thing , it is doubtful if human agencies are responsible for more than  |p732  five per cent of the annual losses to which the herring schools are necessarily liable , from whales , porpoises , seals , and other mammals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fishes ; from gulls , gannets , and other birds , and from the thousands of other natural enemies that begin to prey on the herring while it is still in the egg and continue their attacks throughout its entire existence . As Huxley has shown , the basis on which the permanency of the herring schools depends is not so much the preservation of a certain percentage of the fish as the destruction of nearly the entire progeny of each female herring each year . If every mature female herring lays 20,000 eggs . a very conservative estimate , and if the numbers of herring are to remain approximately the same from year to year , then 19,998 of the progeny of every mature female must be destroyed before they reach the spawning period ; for if more than two out of the 20,000 escape destruction and spawn , then more fish will be produced than are necessary for maintaining the schools . ' Thus many thousand times the number of herring contained in the schools of a given region must be destroyed each year if the average size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huxley has summed up the case in this lucid language : Man , in fact , is but one of a vast cooperative society of herring-catchers , and the larger the share he takes , the less there is for the rest of the company . If man took none , the other shareholders would have a larger dividend and would thrive and multiply in proportion , but it would come to pretty much the , same thing to , the herrings .  |p735
