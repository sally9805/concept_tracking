txt Reformer Resents the Rev. Dr. Slicer 's Charge That the Cassidy Bill Originated with Poolroom Men . While persons allied with the race track interests were endeavoring to shut off any further discussion of the CassidyLansing Anti-racing bill and the agreement entered into between the Rev Dr. Thomas R. Slicer and the Stewards of the Jockey Club to " sterilize " betting , at the race tracks , word came yesterday from Albany that Gov . Higgins was in favor of the Cassidy bill . The Governor 's attitude was stated by the Rev , Dr. A. S. Gregg , Field Secretary of the International Reform Bureau , which organization was chiefly instrumental in having the anti-race track measure introduced in the Legislature . Dr. Gregg said that a great deal of feeling had been aroused among ministers all through the State over the change of front of Bishop Doane , who at first favored the Cassidy bill , but after receiving a letter from the Rev. Dr. Slicer withdrew his support . Dr. Gregg said that the action of Bishop Doane would come up for discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. C. A. Building at Albany . Dr. Gregg expressed keen resentment at the statements , attributed to Dr. Slicer , to the effect that the Cassidy bill originated with the poolrooms . " We have nothing whatever to conceal in connection with the origin or introduction of the Cassidy bill or the use of Bishop Doane 's name . " declared Dr. Gregg . " Early in January I had a hint from our headquarters in Washington that a plan for attacking race track gambling in New York State was being formulated . After sending out a lot of literature urging the people of the State to petition the Governor to recommend legislation touching gambling on race tracks , the President of the Reform Bureau , the Rev. Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts , had an interview with Gov , Higgins . in which the latter declared himself in favor of the Cassidy-Lansing Dr. Gregg added that careful consideration was given to the form of the bill , and that after the amendments had been drafted they were submitted to Anthony Comstock for criticism . Mr. Comstock changed the bill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who handed copies of the measure to Senator Cassidy and Assemblyman Lansing , who introduced them . The bill was introduced in the Assembly on Feb. 16 and in the Senate on Feb. - 19. - " As soon as the date for the joint committee hearing had been agreed upon , " said Dr. Gregg , " plans were made for the mass meeting held in the Calvary Baptist Church in Albany on March 6 . As the active manager of the forces that supported the bill . I had charge of the arrangements for the mass meeting . I asked an Albany pastor to suggest a good man for chairman . He named Bishop Doane . I asked one of the Bishop 's personal friends to extend the invitation . This was done on March 1 . The answer was that the Bishop would preside at the mass meeting if his health permitted , and that he would also speak at the hearing In support of the bill . " On the following Monday , however , I was informed that the Bishop denied hav- I lag promised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his physician had ordered him not to leave the house . I called and asked him to write a letter which I could read to the meeting . He did so . and I received the letter on the following morning , A little after noon the same day I received a note from the Bishop asking for the return of his letter of indorsement . I think he said in this letter that he did not consider himself well enough informed on the subject to commit himself . " Bishop Doane changed his mind very suddenly . He wrote his letter of approval on March 5 , and withdrew it on the next day . In a letter to an Albany clergyman the Bishop quotes extensively from the letter written to him by Dr. Slicer , in which the origin of the bill is attributed to the New York poolrooms . This statement had great influence with the Bishop , and seems to have been the principal cause of his change of attitude . This charge on the part of Dr. Slicer is so serious that I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special privileges are sanctioned all law enforcement is weakened . Poolrooms exist because the exception made in the case of race-track gambling has practically destroyed respect for all the gambling laws . " The only way to regulate a rattlesnake is to cut off its head . The only sensible way to regulate gambling is to make all the gambling laws uniform , so that all who gamble are felons , with no diserimination between the well-to-do turfman and the common gambler . " Edward Lauterbach , who made the principal argument before the Constitutional Convention in 1894 in favor of the amendment making gambling and poolselling a felony everywhere within are State . declared that the members of the convention had never contemplated that ary exception should be made in favor of poolselling on the race tracks . " I am heartily in favor of horse racing , - said Mr. Lauterbach . I think it is noble and elevating as a sport . But racing and gambling should be absolutely divorced . If racing is made a vehicle for gambling then a very proper thing has been subordinated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taint on racing . " Mr. Lauterbach said he had little doubt that the men w ho are conducting the affairs of The Jockey Club were of that opinion , too , and that their action last year in cutting loose from the bookmakers had indicated their desire to make the betting ring a less conspicuous and injurious feature of the race tracks . " If they succeed in putting an end to gambling at their tracks well and good , " said Mr. Lauterbach . " If not , it should be brought about by the State withdrawing its support from race-track gambling . If gambling is a felony outside of a race track it should be made a felony inside as well . I think the race tracks could w , 2.11 exist without the bookmakers . " Mr. Lauterbach gravely expressed the ' opinion that comparatively few racegoers go into the betting ring . Joseph S. Auerbach , counsel of The Jockey Club , said he could not discuss the situation that has arisen over the Cassidy bill or the agreement with Dr. Slicer . Dr. Slicer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all interested in the agreement have decided to do no further talking in hope that interest in the controversy may die out .
