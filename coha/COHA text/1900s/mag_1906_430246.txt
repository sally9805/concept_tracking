HE railways assert that to adopt the policy of regulation advocated by President Roosevelt would paralyze or at least seriously interfere with the industrial and commercial operations of this country . I am asked by the Editor of THE CENTURY to discuss that phase of the railway problem . No discussion can be intelligent that does not begin with a clear understanding of the matter under debate ; and this is specially true here , where most of the honest doubt as to the wisdom of the President 's recommendation arises from a misconception of what that is . Let us begin with a statement of the exact proposition . A railroad is a public highway . In many countries railroads are built and operated by the government itself ; in ours they are , almost without exception , owned by private capital : but this makes them none the less public in their character . These two facts ? first , that the railroad is private property ; second , that the function discharged is of a public nature ? must be kept thoroughly in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private capital invested in a railway should be left as free and untrammeled  |p644  as that invested in any other enterprise ; but , like all other property , it must observe the law . In its organization and construction a railroad is given certain extraordinary privileges . It can appropriate to its own use the property of a private individual against his most earnest protest . In operation it is a practical monopoly . The individual must use it and must pay for the service whatever is demanded . These extraordinary privileges are given to the railway because it discharges a public duty ; and in consideration of these privileges the railway assumes certain Habilities in the discharge of that duty . It must treat all members of the public alike , and it must render its services to the public for a reasonable compensation . If a railway imposes upon me an unjust charge for the transportation of my person or my property , it violates the law , precisely as I should if I declined to pay a reasonable charge for that transportation . A SUIT AT LAW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violation of law , his remedy is by suit in court and a judgment for damages . This is not universally true . When that does not afford an adequate remedy , the law provides another . Injunction is used , and the specific execution of contracts is decreed . In the business of transportation itself the railway is not obliged to sue for the amount due , but may retain possession of the property transported until payment has been made . Now it is generally understood that a suit at law and a judgment in damages is no remedy in most instances for the imposition of an unjust railway rate . The Commission recently heard testimony in a case where the complainant alleged that he had been compelled to pay too high a passenger fare . The amount in issue was $1.08 , but the passenger agent of the defendant railroad testified that to put in effect the rate upon which the complainant insisted would reduce its revenues $40,000 annually . The coal-dealer who pays the freight on the anthracite coal which we consume in New England has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the price of the coal to the consumer . The person who is ultiLXX1. 71 mately affected neither can nor would maintain a suit . For these and other reasons , the only remedy which can afford much practical relief from the imposition of an unjust or a discriminative railway rate is the correction of the rate itself . THE PRESIDENT 'S PROPOSITION THE proposition of President Roosevelt is just this : Whenever an individual , in behalf of himself and others similarly affected , whenever a community through some local organization , whenever a State by its railroad commission , in the interest of its citizens , questions the lawfulness of a railway rate , a government tribunal shall be provided which has power to hear that complaint and , if it finds the railway in violation of law , to stop the wrong by compelling it to put in effect a rate which is lawful . He would simply force the railway specifically to execute its contract with the public to impose just and reasonable charges . This is not a proposition to " make " the railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate has been fixed by the railway , complained of , and declared to be unlawful , that it can be corrected . This is no attempt to manage our railways by government commission . The railroad is perfectly free to manage its own business until it impinges upon the rights of others ; then it should be restrained . What the President proposes is to use a remedy which every court has declared to be legal to redress a wrong which can be redressed in no other way . Just how will it injure the commerce and industry of our land if its railways are thus obliged to treat their patrons with fairness and with justice ? " THE CLAIM OF THE RAILWAYS THE first claim of the railways seems to be that rate-making is an extremely delicate process requiring ability of a high and peculiar order which is possessed by only a few persons and can be exercised by them only after long experience . As well attempt to remodel a statue of Phidias or retouch a play of Shakspere by government commission as to revise the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates and the rate adjustments which these gentlemen have  |p645  fixed will disarrange the operations of the entire country and bring down commercial disaster . If an impious person had penetrated into the sanctuary where the ancient priestess of Delphi delivered her inspired prophecies , he would probably have found a female of ordinary proportions sitting on a tripod which any good carpenter could make . It was the mystery which gave weight to her oracular utterances . So here , if we can get by the railroad lawyers and railroad presidents who stand without the temple warning off the profane with wild gesticulation , and into the edifice itself , we can form a much clearer notion of the exact situation . There is no fairer way than to present to the reader two or three actual cases illustrative of the questions which arise , and let him say whether they ought to be dealt with by the government at all , and whether an attempt to deal with them in this manner will result in the dread consequences which are foretold . As the first illustration , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railway rate upon which the Interstate Commerce Commission has made a report . ADVANCES IN CATTLE RATES ON February 1 , 1899 , rates on cattle from Texas to the various markets of consumption were advanced two and a half cents per hundred pounds ; on December 15 of the same year they were again advanced three cents per hundred pounds ; and on March 5 , 1903 , there was a third advance of three cents per hundred pounds . Advances were also made at various times from other regions west of the Missouri River and from the Texas breeding-pastures to the Northern ranges , aggregating from two to eight cents per hundred pounds . The Cattle Raisers ' Association of Texas filed with the Commission a complaint attacking all these advances , and that complaint was made the subject of extended investigation . Let the reader clearly apprehend , the significance of the question at issue . Eight and one half cents per hundred pounds is about one twelfth of one cent per pound . If this increase in the transportation charge were borne entirely by the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his table only the fraction of a cent to the meal . As applied to the carload , its effect is more manifest . The ordinary loading of cattle is 22,000 pounds , so that the total advance from Texas points would amount to about eighteen dollars per car . This , while considerable , is not a large sum . It is only by turning to the aggregate result that the true importance of these advances is appreciated . The exact amount can not be stated , but it can be affirmed with confidence that the advances put in issue by this complaint would yield to the carriers . from three to five millions of dollars per annum . But even this does not convey a correct idea of the real meaning of the increase . The value of a railroad depends upon the net result of its operations . An increase in rate , other conditions remaining equal , adds so much to net revenue . Railway securities at the present time sell , perhaps , upon a four-per-cent. basis . A permanent addition of four millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one hundred millions of dollars to the value of the properties themselves . ADVANCES MADE BY AGREEMENT THE manner of making the advances should also be noted . While there are several independent lines which transport cattle from Texas to the Northern markets , it appeared that these advances had been made as the result of concerted action . The traffic officials of these railways had imposed this additional charge without consultation with the shippers and against their protest . This is an actual , not a supposititious , case , and , in view of it , what says the President ? That there shall be a tribunal which can hear these parties and determine their rights . That tribunal shall be fair ; but it must have power to administer an adequate remedy . If it finds the present rate too high , it shall determine what would be reasonable and compel the carriers to change their tariffs accordingly . No , declares the railway ; there shall he no tribunal with power to change this rate , no matter how unjust it is . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be . No government tribunal can justly hear and determine that question .  |p646  But why ? What is there in this question which can not be understood ? What were the reasons alleged by the railways for these advances ? The first was that the old rate was not sufficient to cover the cost of moving the business . That is an operating , not a traffic , question . Certainly it involves nothing which an intelligent man , familiar with railroad operations and constantly engaged in hearing similar cases , can not fully understand and appreciate . It was alleged , secondly , that cost of operation had increased , and that therefore the rate might properly be increased . The complainants admitted that most of the items which went into the cost of operation had advanced in price , but insisted that this was more than offset by the great increase in traffic , so that the actual expense to the railway of moving a ton of freight to-day was less than formerly , while the number of tons moved was much greater . This is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary mind . The railways said , in the third place , that the country was prosperous , and that they were entitled to share in this general prosperity , to which the complainants made answer : Whatever may be the condition of the country , the cattle industry is prostrate ; while your profits have enormously increased , ours have shrunk to nothing . This issue , again , is one about which the traffic men had no exclusive knowledge , and upon which the shipper was entitled to be heard . . I have stated these issues at some length so that the reader may judge for himself . The reasonableness of railway rates presents a most perplexing problem , but the difficulty arises rather from the absence of a standard of comparison than from inability to understand and apply the considerations which should govern . NO ATTACK ON RAILWAY REVENUES IT is said that if this law were enacted every rate in the country might be complained of and reduced , and that this would so diminish the revenues of the railways as to cripple their operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked and , if found excessive , reduced . There is no probability that this would be done . Nothing could be more foolish than to impair unjustly the revenues of our railroads , and what warrant is there for assuming that a government tribunal would , in defiance of law , be guilty of such folly ? It ill becomes the representatives of our railways to put forth this suggestion . What manner of man is that who asserts in one breath that he is fair enough to determine without restraint what the public shall pay him , and in the next , that a branch of the government sworn to judge fairly between him and the public will confiscate his property ? But even if this tribunal were foolish enough and wicked enough to make the attempt , it could not succeed . The Federal Constitution , as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States , declares that no legislature and no commission can impose upon any railway a schedule of rates which does not yield a fair return upon its investment . This protection is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exercised . ARE THERE NO " UNREASONABLE RATES " ? THE railways assert that this right to reduce a rate which has been found unreasonable is of little consequence , since there are to-day in this country no unreasonable rates . Numerous witnesses testified before the Senate Committee that there was no complaint of unreasonable rates . This is a matter of fact which I wish to deny in the most emphatic manner possible . The most serious complaints which have come to the Commission in recent years have been directed against the inherent unreasonableness of rates . I have said elsewhere , and I repeat here , with full knowledge of the meaning of the statement , that within the last three years the Interstate Commerce Commission has investigated complaints against the unreasonableness of the rate , ? complaints attacking generally an advance and sometimes a second or a third advance , ? in which the amounts fairly in issue would build and equip every railroad in my native New England . A SUBTLE AND ALL-PERVADING TAX No other tax is so subtle and alb-pervading as the railroad rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lays trib/ ute upon every activity of life ; and yet s unobtrusive is its action that he who finall pays it is hardly aware of that fact In no other manner can the fruits o monopoly be so safely gathered . One mil per mile added to the passenger fare o all the passengers carried by our railroad for the year ending June 30 , 1904 , would add to the revenues of these railroad $21,923,213 ; an increase of one cent pe hundred pounds in the freight rate for th same year would have increased thei revenues by $128,336,109 . It is the righ to impose this tax without legal restraint with all the tremendous financial , social political power which that right carries for which the railways are expending mil lions in this contest . But while this is in fact the vital thing it is kept as much as possible in the background . The white-sheeted specter which stalks through the editorial columns of railway newspapers , and enters the deliberations of commercial organizations , is not the absolute , but the relative , rate Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community shall enjoy in comparison with some other community ? This is the feature which is most dwelt upon in these discussions and which gives rise to most doubt . Here again it is important to understand at the outset just what the proposition is . I can best illustrate this by a simple diagram . A and B are points of production , either communities or individual plants ; C is a point of consumption . So long as the railroad leading from A to C is independent of the railroad leading from B to C , the government has nothing to say as to the relative rate ; but if both lines are owned and operated by the same company , the relative rate from A to C as compared with the rate from B to C is subject to adjustment . So long as there can be competition , each community and each industry must take its chances in the competitive struggle ; but when competition has ceased , when some single will dominates that situation , then the government may interfere to prevent injustice . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse of monopoly . FREE TO MEET LOCAL CONDITIONS THE railways urge thaf their traffic officials are better acquainted with the conditions of the communities they serve , that they better understand their needs , better appreciate their commercial conditions , and are therefore better fitted . to name the rates for these communities than any government tribunal . All this is certainly true . A railroad can manage its own business much more intelligently , and understands the territory which it serves vastly better , than any government official can . For these reasons , as well as for the further reason that the private capital invested should be given a free hand as far as may be , the railways should be allowed to name their own rates , to develop their business , to meet the wants of their patrons . President Roosevelt has expressly said that , in his opinion , these rates should be first made by the railways themselves . But if , after they have been fixed , a community conceives that it is unjustly dealt with , if a particular shipper asserts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the self-interest of the railway , what then ? Must he submit without appeal , or shall there be some tribunal where he can be heard and his rights adjudicated ? I can best illustrate this by another actual case , and will select once more the last complaint of this character upon which the Commission has reported . A RECENT CASE IN ILLUSTRATION THE State of Texas consumes more corn than it raises , and it obtains this surplus from the corn-bearing regions of the Middle West . Large quantities of this corn are ground before being consumed . It is evident that if the freight rate on corn and corn-meal is the same from the point of production on the Missouri River to Texas , the grinding may be done at either place ; but if the rate on corn-meal is materially higher than the rate on corn , then the corn will of necessity be taken to Texas and ground there . In other words , the relation between these rates determines whether the mill shall be located on the Missouri River or in the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on corn and the products of corn are the  |p648  same , so that the process of manufacture is possible at almost any point where natural conditions permit ; but for some reason there has obtained for a long time a differential of three cents per hundred pounds from the Missouri River to Texas points in favor of corn , ? that is , the rate on meal has been three cents higher than the rate on the raw article . Under this adjustment of rates , corn has been freely ground both in Texas and in Kansas . In the early spring of 1905 this difference was made nine cents instead of three cents . Since the profit in grinding corn does not exceed from one to three cents per hundred pounds , this change in rates absolutely prohibited the manufacture of meal at the Northern mills . Complaint was made to the Commission , the matter was investigated , and the following facts appeared : Texas has a railroad commission which establishes the rates applicable within the borders of that State . That commission had given notice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposition of reducing rates on corn and the products of corn . The railways of Texas felt that the millers were likely to appear and insist upon this reduction , and that unless they did appear , no one else probably would . Thereupon they approached these Texas millers , saying to them : You desire a wider differential between , corn and corn-meal ; we wish to prevent the reduction of Texas rates ; now if you millers will agree not to appear before the Texas Commission and demand this reduction , we upon our part will increase the differential from three cents to nine cents . This bargain was struck . The Texas millers did not appear , and the rail roads did increase the differential . It has been intimated that this particular injustice will be corrected by re storing the original differential . But the question is not whether this particular wrong has been righted by grace of those who committed it , but whether similar wrongs can be , and should be , corrected by law . Many recommendations of the Interstate Commerce Commission are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion , would receive scant attention . I ask the reader whether ther is anything in the nature of this case which can not be intelligently understood and passed upon by a body of men chosen for that purpose and dealing continually with these questions , even though their souls have never been attuned to the harmonies of rate-making in a railroad freight office ? Shall the miller of the Missouri River be heard before his property is confiscated in the self-interest of the railways , and will it afflict this country with commercial paresis if the government lays its hand on performances of that character ? The fixing of a differential is a question which , in the very nature of things , admits of no exact solution . So long as it can be left to the determination of competitive conditions , that should be done ; but when it has come to pass that there is no competition , when it must and does rest in the breast of some one man to say where business shall be done and by whom it shall be done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer and better that this power should be lodged in a disinterested representative of the government than that it should be left solely to the interested determination of the railway . ANOTHER CASE To this proposition that the traffic official can alone be safely trusted to protect the business interests in his territory , and that any interference with his decree means business disaster , let me cite one more case , ? this again the last one of its kind which the Commission has considered . The Fairmont coal district in the State of West Virginia extends some twentyfive miles north and south by sixteen miles east and west , and contains at the present time seventy or eighty coal operations . The Red Rock Coal Company has recently purchased and owns four thousand acres of coal-bearing lands which it desires to work . For that purpose it has begun the construction of a tipple and has opened to some extent its mine . It applied to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company for a switch connection such as are allowed to the other mines in that district , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many mines in operation . It appeared , upon investigation , that it is the policy of that railroad company not to permit the opening of other mines , and that several applications previous to that of this company  |p649  have been declined in obedience to that policy . It further appeared that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was itself , directly or indirectly , the owner of a majority in capacity of the coal operations in that district . In the year 1904 seventy per cent . of all the coal produced and shipped out was by mines owned or directly controlled by that railroad company . What this company does , therefore , is to say that neither the four thousand acres of the Red Rock Company nor the lands of any other company shall be put upon the market as a coal proposition in competition with its own mines . When it is insisted that this Red Rock Company shall have some tribunal before which its rights can be determined and enforced , the railway makes this answer : The feelings of those gentlemen are not , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual situation . These traffic problems can be dealt with only by traffic experts . We have in our employ one hundred clerks whose entire time is devoted to the making of rates . Many of them have grown old in that service . Some of them are paid large salaries , ? why , sevoral traffic officials in this country receive as much as $50,000 per year ! If you permit a government commission to lay its rude hand upon this delicate piece of mechanism , a universal crash must follow . MONOPOLY OF BITUMINOUS COAL IT requires no expert to foretell what will happen in this case unless some restraining influence is imposed upon the operations of this traffic machinery . The Baltimore and Ohio already owns three fourths of the mines in operation in the Pairmont district . If that company can decline such applications as that of the Red Rock Coal Company , it can presently own at its own price all the coal-bearing lands of that district ; and when that happens , the social problem is one degree more difficult than it is now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Central , the transportation of most of the bituminous coal which reaches tide-water at Norfolk and north upon the Atlantic seaboard . It will , if this process continues , control not only the transportation , but the coal itself . ANTHRACITE COAL MONOPOLY THE same result is being worked out with bituminous coal which in the last few years has been effected in the case of an thracite coal . Three or four railroad com panies now have a practical monopoly of all the anthracite in the eastern part of the united States , and they have acquired and are maintaining that monopoly through their ability to regulate the sup ply . Note the financial result of these operations in the anthracite field . The company most interested and most affected is the Reading , a control of whose stock is now owned by the Penn sylvania and the New York Central . This is written October 13 , 1905 . Seven years ago , October 13 , 1898 , the stocks of the Reading Company were worth at the market price on that day , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day those same stocks are worth one hun dred and fifty-three millions of dollars , an increase of one hundred and twenty two millions of dollars in amount ? almost four hundred per cent . There are three other railroad com panies with which anthracite coal may be said to be of the essence of things , and these are the Delaware and Hudson , the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western , and the Lehigh Valley . The comparative mar ket value of the stocks of those companies upon the dates above named on the basis of $100 shares was as follows : It would appear that while these astute traffic gentlemen are looking after the in terests of the country , they are not entirely oblivious of their own . The railways assert that the adoption of the President 's policy would dry up the fountains of industry . The industry which our famous cap tains of industry have most assiduously cultivated in the last eight years has been the creation and exploitation of monopoly , and in no field have these operations been so extensive or so profitable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as the President recommends might  |p650  perhaps somewhat diminish the fountains of that industry ; no legitimate industry could be affected . RAILWAY RATES NOT A COMMODITY IT is earnestly urged against the proposed policy that railway rates are the product of commercial forces and competitive conditions ; that you can no more fix the price of transportation than you can fix the price of other commodities , and that to do so would be as disastrous in the transportation world as the artificial fixing of prices would be in the business world . Having conclusively shown that railway rates can be made only by ability of the highest order , these gentlemen now proceed to show with equal conclusiveness that railway rates are not made at all . My space is exhausted , and I can only indicate the answer to this proposition . A railway is a business enterprise . Its revenues come from its traffic . Without traffic it has no revenue and yields no return . Its transportation charges must , therefore , be so adjusted as to develop its business , ? such that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mines its iron from its furnaces . The selfinterest of the railway often compels it to establish rates , in order that its traffic may move , which are lower than would be fixed by any government tribunal invested with that authority . Laying hold on this undoubted truth , the opponents of railway regulation insist that the self-interest of the railway is ample protection to the shipper , since the rate will not be so advanced as to interfere with the movement of the traffic . It is certainly true that this principle is an important one in its application to railway operation , and that it has exercised a highly salutary influence upon the development of the resources of our country . It is a most substantial reason why railways should be given the initiative in the making of their rates ; but it does not afford adequate protection against the imposition of unjust rates , for the reason that the rate may be too high and the traffic still move . Consider once more our cattle case . Here was an advance of twenty-five per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars annually to the revenues of those railroads and a hundred millions to the value of their properties . And yet the testimony in that case shows that its effect upon the movement of the traffic was comparatively slight . The amount of loss through reduction in tonnage was as nothing compared with the gain through increase in the net revenues . Will the astute traffic manager kill the hen which lays the golden egg ? No ; but if the animal is confided to his exclusive custody , he may appropriate all the eggs , and he certainly will appropriate more than his share . MARKET COMPETITION DISAPPEARING MARKET competition is much in evidence in these discussions , and the relative rate on cotton piece-goods from New England mills as compared with that from Southern mills has often been referred to as an illustration . Until a comparatively recent period cotton cloth was mostly manufactured in New England , but in later years cottonmills have sprung up in the South . This cloth , whether woven in New England or in the South , is largely consumed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a type . The Southern mill in its infancy said to the railroads which connected it with Chicago : We must have a low rate to help us against our established competitors in New England . As the Southern mill waxed strong , the New England mill appealed to its railroads , saying : Our rate must be reduced to protect us against the competition of the Southern mill , whose raw material , whose power , whose labor , is cheaper than ours . Thus the railroads from New England to Chicago were placed in competition with those from the South to the same point . This seems to be what is meant by market competition , and there is not the slightest doubt that this form of competition did force down the rate on cotton piece-goods , and that in numberless other instances it has exercised a marked effect in the reduction of rates . Under present conditions , however , this kind of competition is rapidly diminishing , and bids fair well-nigh to cease , as the following considerations will show : The present rate on cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New England and fifty-five cents from the Carolinas . The rougher kinds of this material run from two to six yards to the pound . A variation of five or ten cents in the freight rate produces a very slight difference in the price . No reduction in rates can reduce the selling price of this commodity sufficiently to affect materially the amount sold . In other words , a lowering of the freight rate does not increase the total tonnage , but simply determines whether that tonnage shall pass over the rails from New England or from the South . This creates a highly competitive condition so long as the lines of railroad are independent ; but when the same man owns both , it is a ' matter of cornparative indifference to him whether the tonnage moves via one route or the other , and the competition which formerly tended to reduce the rate no longer exists . This is exactly what has happened and is happening in all parts of the country . Where there is not absolute identity of ownership in the railways serving different markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for the owners of different properties to sit down in conference and determine that " suicidal competition " shall no longer prevail . With notable exceptions , market competition can no longer be relied upon either to reduce rates or to prevent their advance . It is urged that the system of rate-making now in vogue has in the past developed our resources to an unprecedented degree , and has brought about an extremely low average of rates ; and it is asked why the same results may not be expected in the future , and whether it is not folly to substitute a different system . The answer is twofold . First . It is not proposed to substitute a different system . The railways will make their rates in exactly the same manner that they have , and will have precisely the same inducement to make low rates . Railways develop the resources of a country by reducing , not by advancing , their transportation charges , and they will still be as free to make those reductions for that purpose as they ever have been . RAILWAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed , and this makes more imperative the need of supervision . No longer ago than 1896 , when I came to have a practical knowledge of these matters , there was the most active competition of all kinds in railway rates , and these competitive conditions continually tended to force down transportation charges . This is no longer true , owing mainly to the concentration of railway ownership and management . Last winter I caused to be compiled , mostly from the returns of railways to the Interstate Commerce Commission , a statement showing certain facts as to six of our great railway systems , from which it appeared that these six systems embraced fifty-five per cent . of the total railroad mileage , sixty per cent . of the railroad capital , and sixty-six per cent . of the railway gross receipts of the United States . If the six systems next in importance had been added to these , the twelve would have included all the important railway mileage in our country . The competition of nine years ago has almost gone , and what is left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon almost every staple article ? upon hay , upon grain and the products of grain , upon coal , upon lumber , upon live stock ? have within the last five years been materially advanced . They are not being advanced now . They will not be advanced so long as this agitation continues . On the contrary , they are quite likely to be reduced as an object lesson . But this concentration of control carries with it the ability to increase enormously the transportation charge , and that ability is certain to be exercised in the end . Human nature is not yet so good that it may be trusted to take just what belongs to it if it has the power to take more . It is this concentration of control which stands out above everything else . In the face of it , the most conservative must reconsider his opinions . Whether these combinations are lawful or unlawful , they are here , and they can not be dissolved . However desirable , competition in the railway rate is impossible . We have attempted to secure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to regulate the railway rate is by laying hold on the . rate itself . Some administrative body must be clothed with the power to determine and prescribe  |p652  for the future . That method of regulation is absolutely fair if the tribunal which exercises it is intelligent and just . Is it not the wise thing for all parties to recognize the conditions which exist , and to join with the President in his attempt to provide a tribunal which can and will do justice between all parties ? If the Interstate Commerce Commission is not such a body , let us have one that is.  |p653
