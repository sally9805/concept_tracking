S nations can not be turned out of clubs , or put in state 's prison , or sent to the guillotine or gallows or electric chair , they contrive to keep a degree of complacency which would be difficult for individuals guilty of their habitual offences . They even manage to look down upon one another , at moments , when they each seem , quite honestly , to suppose that the others find something so enviable or desirable in them that these others being , say , Trench , Dutch , or Spanish , would like to be , say , German , English , or American . They all take credit to themselves nationally for virtues which belong rather sparingly to the whole of humanity ; they speak of English fairness , and German honesty , and American independence , and they really make themselves believe that other peoples are destitute of the qualities which they severally arrogate to themselves . In the mean time the other nations affect to smile at a vanity which they could not imaginably indulge ; but in fact they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate themselves with the same savage sincerity . These reflections , which may be in themselves of no great novelty or value , have of course been prompted by that flattering dream of Lord Rosebery 's in which lately he retroforecast , as it were , the destiny of a British Empire founded upon an uninterrupted union of the thirteen American colonies with the mother-country . Nothing could have been more innocent of intentional offence to us Americans , and yet the thing was in itself so offensively unthinkable for us that we fancy few Americans read his speech at the Glasgow University without some wish to take up arms again and fight the Revolution to its historical close . Not even to have the capital of the British Empire in the heart of the West would we again be part of the British Empire . Not to be rid of all our national sins and shames would we again be Englishmen , for we prefer them to the national sins and shames of England , bad as ours are . They are at least ours , and that is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen can ever understand , possibly because they can never understand that we are not still a sort of Englishmen-in-error , who would be willingly set right if we could without too great publicity . Whenever we say anything of this sort Englishmen evidently can not believe that we are serious ; if they do not regard it as an instance of the American humor which they have so cordially tried to like , they suspect a bluff . If we go farther and say that simply to have thrown down and cast out their felich of personal loyalty , denied their grotesque idolatry of sovereign - worship , not to mention getting rid of a titled aristocracy and a state church , is worth all that our seven years ' struggle for independence cost us , they feel that the affair has passed a joke , and become serious , though they may not think we are so . It seems a little ungracious not to take Lord Rosebery 's fancy in his own amiable mood , and it is with a certain pang that we insist upon the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Englishman to declare his nation historically wrong and ours historically right , and one wishes one could meet him at least half-way in dreaming of what the two nations might have been if they had re- ' mained one . But that is not possible to Americans except upon the condition of supposing the Anglo-Saxon world all republican , whether with its capital in England , or in New Zealand , or in New Mexico ; and this would not be possible to Englishmen . Lord Rosehery seems to have rather a gift for finding his nation historically wrong , and he has used it more acceptably in his study of Napoleon , the Last Phase , than in his vision of an undismembered British Empire . Yet even here we are not in entire sympathy with him , for no foreigner can be quite so ashamed of the English treatment of Napoleon at St. Helena as a generous Englishman deleted material lowed him into captivity from motives wholly or mainly unselfish , but he could not spare to wring from them this pitiful proof of his past imperial state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal , and his ignominy in what he inflicted through his miserable vanity was meaner than any he suffered from Lowe 's ingenuous brutality . Why should not this littleness be as true a measure of his spirit as any other quality of his ? He failed of grandeur by so much as he failed to accept the truth of his fate , and to put away from him the toys of a state no longer his : toys fit only for born kings at any time , and not for a born chief of men . He was capable of some horse-play at all periods of his life , and in those majestic moments at St. Helena his behavior seems to have authorized a romp of a girl to box his ears ( a freedom somewhat resented by the faithful few not suffered to sit down before him ) ; but he never apparently liked humor ; he continued to the end the inamusable that Talleyrand called him ; he bored himself and he must have bored others . He was not fully representative of either his race or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there has been but one who was fully representative of his people . It is proof of how perfectly he was this that the wish for Lincoln is recurrent , if not constant , in the American mind , as the wish for Napoleon could not imaginably be in the French mind . One feels that if Lincoln were only here now he would be reminded of a story by Lord Rosebery 's dream of an undismembered British Empire , which would satisfyingly summarize our whole mind concerning it . But we must , without him , try to habituate ourselves to a kindness which we are likely to have heaped upon us more and more if we keep friends with the English , and they must bear with us if we can not always take it kindly . Republics are as ungracious as they are ungrateful when it comes to favors which touch their being even by so much as a conjecture or a peradventure . This will not be understood by our newly conscious friends across the water , and it may not be understood , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Americans enlarged to an imperial magnanimity by distance from home . The republic , which is the strongest state , is always in the greatest danger through any variation from the singleness of ideal in which democracies are founded . Whatever tends to distinguish Americans from one another , and separate them into classes , threatens the perpetuity of the commonwealth by making its citizens unknown to one another . Its safety is mainly in that unity of tradition which as yet is of such integrity with us that no word of national import needs translation , in all the length and breadth of the Union , from the original accent in which it was uttered . No part of what we feel to be the American joke is lost upon any American not alienated from the great American family , the notion of which expresses beyond any other a national interdomestication unexampled in history . Without it , or without the tolerant sense of humor which it fosters in us , our vulgarities might sometimes be too much for us ; but as it is we patiently accept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not expect to get rid of them very soon , and yet we are able to bear them , because in the light of the great American joke they are not so significant as they may seem to the outsider . Lord Rosebery , for instance , might be tempted almost to recant his dream of an undismembered empire , with the capital of Anglo-Saxon civilization on these shores , if he could read of a " Trilby Social " lately held in New Jersey for the benefit of one of the churches . At this certain young ladies of the congregation hid themselves behind a curtain , and showed their feet below it , to be auctioned off by members of the church , who bid various sums for the different pairs . The proceeds were devoted to paying the church debt , and the incident seems to have ended there . It was less characteristic of our civilization than of the actors , but it can not be trusted to the knowledge of mankind at large without a shiver of apprehension . Will others understand the intensely domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an example of the sort of thing that goes on with us much as with a very large , very good-natured family ? We ourselves know perfectly how it was , and that it was not even a proof of especial silliness and vulgarity in those who took part in it . We can imagine a sufficient simplicity of heart and confusion of mind in them without disabling their good sense or their good taste in any sweeping way . They did it because they were of a condition more at home and at ease with itself than any other in the world , and were in that security from consequences which is one of the most amiable traits of the American nature . IV It is altogether a very curious and interesting phenomenon , that security from consequences . In the political way it tempts us to take chances of trouble about which other nations would think twice before incurring them , and in the economical way it accounts for a very wide belief among us that if Americans subtract fifty from a hundred it will leave a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve impossibilities and to become the envy of those who criticise them . It accounts more than anything else for the American girl , who is not perhaps so dominant a figure in imaginative literature as she once was , but who probably prevails as much as ever in real life . It has been noted before how intense and pervasive the process of feminization has been with us , and the process is still going on , not in leas but in greater degree . Our women have long been much wiser than our men , and now they are growing much larger . There are few daughters of the present day who are not taller than their fathers ; they are taller than their mothers themselves ; and if this exaggeration of the type continues , it must have results even beyond the scope of the present daring inquiry . Short of such results , however , we can all perceive how much it must tell for our development as a family on the national scale . Hitherto we have known each other in a solidarity of joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become still more intimate through a solidarity of sex in the governing class . Yet if the Republic ultimated in a political gynoeracy , it might not be so well . Any fulfilment of our domestic ideal which resulted in an actual silence of mankind would affect that perfect poise of the feminine character , so characteristic of our womenkind , by annulling the national sense of something droll in their loveliness , their aspiration , their divinity , which , in its poor way , may now be their greatest safeguard . It is this which has given them that charm as heroines which they have long had in our fiction ; for a very little observation of the field will convince the critic that few if any American novelists of importance have taken the American woman quite seriously when they have taken her for a heroine . In the midst of their tenderness for her , their reverence , their adoration , they have had a sense of her as a part of our joke , the better part , perhaps the greater part . But we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in the work of alien novelists , and possibly the thing most satisfactory to us in Mrs. Hurnphry Ward 's treatment of Lucy Foster , the fine type of American girl in her recent novel Eleanor , is its entire seriousness . We feel , at least , that this character , by its unfailingly respectful handling , as well as by its admirable nature , is the highest tribute yet paid by , outland literature to American girlhood , and we can therefore the more easily own it wonderfully like . That it is perfectly like , one can not honestly say . The Vermont from which Lucy Foster is derived is a Vermont of the mind , very well imagined , indeed , but more fitly the home of the more Massaehusettsi an type of Puritanic character expressed in the girl than the real Vermont of unfailing Republican majorities , summer-boarding , and comparative easy-goingnesa which we all know . She is , howevensurprisingly divined , and the truth of the conception is not impugned by the fact that the severity of the ideal which she lives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the generation before this . If it is not still in the New England life , it is in the New England air , and is what people there breathe in , if it is not what they breathe out . Such a girl as Lucy Foster is still potential if not still actual in New England . The elderly observer , looking , say , from his Easy Chair through the trolley-ear window , would still expect to see her , but he would be less apt to be disappointed in the suburbs of Boston than in the hill country of Vermont . When we have said this , we have emptied the sack ? of the worst reserve in it , and for the rest we can only hear witness to the beauty and fidelity of the character . But it interests us , we own , rather on its universal side , and through its suggestion that Lucy Foster is of English source as well as American . Through such as she , and through all that is just and pure and high in English nature. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the English , though we find it so hard to join in the dream of Lord Rosebery . We hope English people will be saying Lucy is quite like an English girl , and for our pert we are inclined to claim Eleanor Burgoyne an American woman . She is at least like a great many American women whom the English in their anxiety for something very distinctive from us ignore to their loss . Her subtler and complexer character cheapens even the conscience of Lucy , which , indeed , leaves us with a taste of something harsh and unripe in the girl 's nature . This is very likely as it should be ; at any rate the taste is not removed by the perception of greater truth in the part she is called to play in the delicate drama . The situation is that one , not unfamiliar in fiction , in which two women vie in giving up to each other the man they both love . If it is not so familiar in life , that is certainly not the fault of fiction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for that shall come , we hope life will take a leaf from Mrs. Ward 's book , for it could hardly find the situation studied more convincingly elsewhere . We do not say convincingly , for in spite of all her skill we remain in the belief , shamefaced and unworthy though it may be , that Eleanor never would have given Manisty up to Lucy , no matter how truly and strongly she meant it , in. mind , heart , and spirit . Love has made many mistakes , poor thing , and is answerable at all times for much evil in the world , but it has never made this mistake . It is sucha divinely honest and selfish thing , it is so heaven meant and heaven sent to inspire the will solely to win and to keep , that it could not be false enough to itself ever to part willingly , or even wilfully , with its own . It can be said in this case that Manisty was not Eleanor 's to keep ; and yet if she loved him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hope of love only when she must abandon her hope of life . It is through Lucy 's superiority in renouncing her share of the self-sacrifice that she becomes the truer character ; and when she decides to take the man she loves , though the woman she loves loves him , womanhood triumphs in her obedience to a divine law . The fact that Manisty is not worthy of her , or of Eleanor either , has nothing to do with the moral . Poseur in the things of politics and religion , he is of an entire and exalted simplicity in his passion . He wishes to have the woman he loves and her only , and it matters nothing to him , if it ever occurs to him , that another woman far fitter for him , if not worthier of him , wishes to have him . If love means anything at all it can not mean less than this for a man ; but possibly in their subtleties it may mean something different for women . We shall doubtless be clearer on this point when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be content at present to recognize the art with which two such women as Eleanor Burgoyne and Lucy- Foster are realized to us in Mrs. Ward 's admirable novel . The wurld in which they meet each other and learn to value each other is that European world of political and religious interests , which Mrs. Ward invests with such grandeur and importance that our poor cisatlantic world seems almost of the insignificance it has in Manisty 's neither very profound nor luminous nor sincere , mind . An Englishman of statesmanlike potentialities if not proportions , turning from his great chances in the London political and literary world , and playing at Rome with the fires which once lighted the fagots at the autos-da-fe : what an immense opportunity for a novelist ! It is Mrs. Ward 's praise that she has not come short of her opportunity .
