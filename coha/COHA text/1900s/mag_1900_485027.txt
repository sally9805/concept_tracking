From Krasnoyarsk onthe Yenisei to Omsk on the Irtish River is 738 miles , but nearly the whole of - this distance is within and directly across the drainage basin of the Obi River . The Tchuhm River , one of the principal eastern tributaries of the Obi , is crossed at Atchensk , only , forty miles west of Krasnoyarsk . Indeed , in one place where the streams are still navigable , they are within six miles of each other It is a singular fact of physical geography that all the long branches of the Yenisei are on the east side , while most of those of the Obi are on the western side But really the proper continuation of the Obi is its middle branch , the Irtish , which is in itself a river 1,800 miles in length , whose source is far up on the Mongolian plateau . The garden of western Siberia lies in the valley of the Obi for a distance of three hundred miles south of the fifty-sixth degree of latitude . Here there are 100,000 square miles of well-watered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important cereals , and in every way as well adapted to cultivation as are the plains of Minnesota . Already there is in this belt a population of nearly 3,000,000 . Much of the territory is also underlaid by coal-bearing deposits . Although these are mostly of Jurassic age , and carry a coal that is light  --  almost lignite  --  still it promises to supply the want of fuel fairly well , and is being mined extensively Throughout most of Siberia , wood is still so plentiful that the locomotives ordinarily use it for fuel ; but here they use domestic coal At all the important places in Siberia touched by the railroad , new cities are growing up about the stations . The old cities are built almost entirely of wood . Even most of the best houses are of logs . But the new cities are growing up like magic out of brick . In due time all will have to follow suit and build of brick , for the wood is rapidly disappearing Logs are , however , the easiest material from which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberia Brick houses here have to be of double walls with air spaces enclosed But the making of brick is already serving a good purpose in diversifying the home industries . It is now one of the most prominent of the manufacturing interests . The name of the station where the railroad crosses the Obi River is Ob , which until lately has not appeared on the maps . The old city on the river was called Krivostchekova , and was an important place of 10,000 inhabitants . Connected with this Place by steamer up the river are the flourishing cities of Barnaul and Disk , with populations respectively of 29,000 and 18 , - 000 , while a short distance below is Tomsk , with a population of 55,000 , and a university of wide renown One finds , therefore , that in coming to this part of Siberia , he is not out of the world . The mass of the people look and appear much as they do in any European city . The teachers in the schools are highly educated men . More than once , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been asked if I could converse in Latin . But Omsk , on the Irtish , is 332 miles west of Ob Here we find a city , 184 years old , of 42,000 inhabitants , which reminds us more of America than anything else we have seen Not that the architecture is like ours , for it is not The houses are nearly all of logs , and the schools and other public buildings of brick in plain style , painted white The churches , too , are typically Russian , with lofty domes and cupolas . But there is a brisk commercial air about the ulace , which reminds one of the towns on the Ohio River . Steamboats are coming and going , and the barges they have brought in are busy unloading their cargoes . Numerous rafts have also come dawn the river lOaded with waterMelas . In the stores the display of fruit is remarkable , But it is all imported . Our plan led us here to leave the railway and go up the river about 600 miles to Semipalatinsk , and thence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam connection the rest of the way home . But we found , when already on the steamer , that the water in the Irtish was so low that they would ticket us only to Pavlodar , about half way . We should then have to take our risk about finding boats the rest of the distance . But as we could get a tarantass there as well as anywhere we did not change our plans . The ride for the first 300 miles up the Irtish is in most respects monotonous . The banks are low . There is not a mountain or hill in sight , and there are no forests But there are other things of great interest . We are in a region inhabited by Kirghiz Tartars , and both they and their houses and habits are strange Their houses are circular , dome-shaped tents , covered with skins of animals or felt . They raise thousands of cattle , sheep , and horses , which we frequently encounter as they are brought down to the river to drink The men ride not only horses , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the market in Omsk , to see a camel hitched to a wagon and driven like a horse . We did not expect to see camels in latitude 55 degrees . Here , only two degrees further south , we saw many . In one case two were hitched to a familiar American mowing-machine , and walking along with it through the grass at a rapid rate . At Pavlodar we were compelled to abandon the boat , and go the remaining 200 miles by land . This brought us still nearer to the people , and did not delay us any , for the windings of the river are so many , and the Russians drive so fast , that we did not lose any time . We found ourselves , also , to be but one of several parties which were going nearly to our destination-4 , e. , several hundred miles  --  in tarantasses . One thing makes it easy to drive up the banks of the Irtish , namely , the fact that for several hundred miles the river has no tributaries . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes were drying up within a half-mile of the bank . There are no trees except along the river bank . Cattle and horses are herded by the Tartars back from the river , and hay is gathered in common meadow-land on the wide river bottoms . At this season of the year the trees were rapidly putting on their autumn colors ; the first frosts were wilting the weeds , and hundreds of parties of quaint natives were stacking the hay , or hauling small loads of it near their houses . The entire distance was a scene of rare pastoral beauty and animation . The Irtish valley has played an important part in history from the fact that it is one of the two or three natural gateways to Central Asia , rising by imperceptible gradients to the plains of Mongolia . Lake Zeizan , about half way up the plateau , is an enlargement of the river well nigh as large as Lake Erie More than once the hordes of Central Asia , goaded on by the failing crops of that rapidly desiccating region , have poured down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached in two days and a half . This is a city of 35,000 inhabitants , at the head of navigation of the Irtish . But an immense amount of timber and of other coarse products is brought down from the upper portion of the river basin on rafts Indeed , all the logs for the Russian houses are rafted dawn from far up the stream . The city is situated in a vast plain , with only a few mountains in the west in sight . About 150 miles to the southeast are the lofty peaks of the Altai Mountains , some of them rising 11,000 feet and supporting large glaciers . These mountains are also full of profitable gold-mines , and contain many fertile valleys watered by mountain streams . The city was founded in 1718 , when a fort was built here by the Russians as a defence against the lawless and disaffected Kirghiz Tartars . But these have long since become good and loyal subjects of the Tsar , and mosques and churches now stand side by side , as if they were products of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several hundred thousand , and is so full of resources as to insure the permanence dnd , indeed , continued growth of the place It has several large mills and manufacturing establishments , a museum and library , and numerous schools , both public and private . Of the private schools , mne are Mohammedan The view of the city from a distance was enchanting . Some of the enchantment , but none of the interest , was dissipated upon close acquaintance . With its predominant population of native but thoroughly Russified Mohammedans , it was an appetizing foretaste of the long ride we were to take through the Steppes of Tartary , in front of the border of the great plateau of Central Asia to the historic city of Tashkend .

Hanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanna says that Lord Roberts " has descended to barbarities more worthy of a Tilly in the seventeenth century than of a British general in the nineteenth .

EQUIT Y. November 10 , 1900 SLIPS OF THE PEN . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATIddi SIR : How does so goOd a scholar and so excellent a writer as Prof. Mark 11 . Liddell come to assign the ' Anabasis ' of Xenophon to the sixth century B. e. and the Georgics of Virgil to the lint century A. D , as he does in his very thoughtful article in the opening number of the World 's Work ? I hope it is not a sign that one 's culture rests on a wrong basis to look fur a little more accuracy in regard to the leading dates of classical literature from ' writers who undertake to discuss the proper place of that literature in education. ? Yours very truly , BACK NUMBER . OTTAWA , CANADA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save time , submitted this criticism to Professor Liddell , whose comment we append. ? Eo . NATION . SIR : I am very sorry that I overlooked the two blunders in chronology which your correspondent points out . He is quite right in expecting accuracy in such elementary matters from writers who undertake to discuss the proper place of classical literature in education . But it was rather the proper place of English literature in education that I undertook to discuss in my paper . lay unfamiliarity with classical scholarship , if your correspondent will argue it from these slips , is not so vital to my contention , therefore , as would be the evidence of an ignorance of English . But I feel sure that he will give me the benefit of the doubt and accept a plea , " Culpam in facto non seelua ease meo " I am especially prone to agraphia , and have bitter cause to deplore the fact every time proof-sheets come home to me from the printers . In the present instance it was the dread of being victimized by it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of ' verification the century of Cyrus the Great slipped in for that of Cyrus the Younger , while the original offender " A. D. " for " B. C. " was allowed to remain with the added countenance of a particeps crinanis . The readers , trusting to my accuracy , overlooked the errors , hint tiles lachrimcs . This not by way of excuse or palliation , but in-explanation , as I haVe'ffeciii5ently had school-boyeliurge on me in like circumstances . " Back Number " is not such an out-of-date reader of the Nation as he would have you suppose , for he has seen , I think , the drift of my paper , which is not a reckless attack upon classical training , but an attempt to bring educated men to see the necessity of better English teaching as a preliminary step to gaining an appreciation of the value of English study as a means of culture , and to giving English Literature its rightful place in our educational system . Nor ( if I may be allowed one word more ) have I failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faulty magazine articles , ? rich. - a few year 's ' campaign of spasmodic enthusiasms , can bring about this end . It will come slowly if it comes at all  --  and I hope and pray that it may  --  after the careful and sober consideration of many intelligent men who not only know the proved benefit of classical culture , but have enough knowledge of our own language and literature , and sufficient confidence in the intellectual life of the English mind , to appre'clate the true values of English culture . And that is the work ' of time  --  perhaps of a longer time than I myself should like to admit . Yours contritely , MARIC H. LIDDELL . Eess , Onuewn , N J , November 3 , 1900 PHI BETA KAPPA CATALOGUE . To TEE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sin : I wish to call attention to the shortcomings of the Hand-book and General-Address Catalogue of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa , just issued by the Secretary of the United Chapters . I have examined carefully the list of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 491 living members of the Chapter , not including the class of 1900 , the names of only 375 appear in the list . There appear here also the names of two men who are not members of the Chapter . I think it no exaggeration to say that in 30 per cent of the names published for this chapter there is an error of some kind , either in the name itself , the degree , the title , the profession assigned , or the address . The book , moreover , presents a poor appearance typographically . There is no running title , no indication as to the order in which the chapters appear , and , worse than all , no general index . It seems to me something of a disgrace that a fraternity which comprises the best-educated men and women of the country should be represented before the public by such a slipshod publication . N. HISTORY AND LITERATURE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION ; SIR : Your discussion of the relation between History and Literature ( No 1843 , p. 325 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education in their mutual relations . In order to redeem the cause of education , our universities must be organized as for erudition . The chief obstacle in the way of the humanities is offered by perverted and unsound methods of early instruction , especially the clouding and contaminating of the liberal arts by pseudoscientific Procedure . The intellectual inertia that ever tends to such abuse is protected " aml fostered through the potailar pressure for a preferred academic distinction ; prescriptive " regulations , presumably designed to promote liberal culture , aggravate a malady which ought rather to be repressed by some sort of negative interference . The only way to a cure lies through academic freedom The evil becomes graver as the higher education takes on more and more of a popular character . Everyyear there is a larger proportion of university students who can be further instructed , but have practically reached their limit of culture before entering college . Nevertheless , real instruction always carries somewhat of education with it . The former is the indispensable prerequisite of the latter ; and the organization must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in so-called " general courses , " along with a departmental system in which the members of the teaching force are not all strictly coordinate and independent , there will regularly be found not only a monstrous numerical misadjustment ( in itself a formidable source of difficulty ) , but also , on the artistic or liberal side at any rate , all the unrealities bred by gratuitous prescription  --  cram examinations instead of tests of power , the qualitative replaced by a quantitative standard , formal instead of organic grammar , everything bouffe . Pericles , while attributing to Athens an educating force for all Hellas , and presenting the typical Athenian as an example of the highest versatility and grace , points out that a true democracy enables individuals to obtain preferment through a free public recognition of their special abilities , c45 . Z./ma-roe ev 1-4 ; eLSoaf.f.a . Preferred degrees are undemocratic as well as visionary , creating as they do a hierarchy of studies , and at the same time assuming , within certain lines , a factitious equality of capacities  --  a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But few teachers , and only a small minority of students , will impart or grasp the idea of any subject ; the majority must deal mainly with facts , or , at the best , with scientific generalizations . Both classes , however , stand equally in need of academic freedom  --  if the facts are to be real , as far as they go , or if lovers of ideas are to have their opportunity . There is no room under any scheme of paternalism for the Wahlve , rwandtschaften , upward and downward , without which true learning can never thrive . ISAAC FLAGG . BERKELEY , CALIFORNIA , November 1 , 1000 . FORGED TERRACOTTAS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Will you allow me to warn your readers that a dangerous class of forgeries of Greek terracottas is now being extensively circulated in this country , and that the vendors  --  of whom there seem to be a number  --  have apparently found many victims ? It is difficult to point out in words the differences which distinguish these from genuine Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for fear of making myself misunderstood . A family resemblance runs through all that I have seen , showing them to be probably the product of one workshop ; and I am inclined to think that this is in Greece itself , so that the figures may be honestly called Greek , if not ancient . The favorite subjects seem to be , girls seated either on rocks or chairs , in sentimental poses , sometimes with a Cupid clinging to them ; and flying Cupids , frequently hearing objects such as musical instruments and the like ; but these by no means exhaust the range . The girls have what may be called " Empire " figures , that is , high and rather narrow breasts , and long , slim waists ; their heads are frequently more Japanese than Greek , with puffy cheeks and over-elaborated coiffures The statuettes are baked , and the colors on them are as firm as they would be on genuine terracottas , so that the usual tests for unbaked or " made-up " figures give no results , and even the incrustation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as could be desired ( harder , in fact ) . Those that I have seen are in an excellent state of " preservation , " and , when broken , the breaks are always new and sharp . I have come across none yet in which an important piece is missing . Faces and forms alike are without blemish , though the colors are not so brilliant as to excite suspicion Having been deceived myself by the first of these I saw , I should be glad to have others profit by my experience . The ready sale they have had in America during the last five or sus months has already brought others in their train , and in the interest of all collectors , public and private , it is Important that a stop should be put to this traffic as soon as may be . Let me therefore urge amateurs not to buy any Greek terracottas , however pretty and attractive they may appear , without the advice of a competent expert in such matters There is no class of forgeries more successful , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has not been victimized by them EDWARD ROBINSON , MUSEITNI OF FINE ARTS , Boszoss November 9 , 1900 SACK SHIP .
