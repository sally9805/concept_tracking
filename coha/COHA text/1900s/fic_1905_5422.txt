Beginning with June 9 , 1904 , there was a column of verse and prose published in " The Stillwater Advance " under the caption " Oklahoma Sunshine .

" ( A POEM READ ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION . ) O , ye who frame the sovereign law , And heal the hurts of ocean isles Till hid are savage tooth and claw And Peace above the battle smiles ,  --  If Justice reigns and Mercy clings , What think ye , Masters , of these things ? The Father of the Waters greets Imperial sisters proud and great , And nation mighty nation meets At festal boards of lordly state : But one  --  one only ,  --  maketh moan : Denied the Star , she weeps alone ! The cycles fly on eagled wings : A hundred years have run their quest Since he who bought and sold with kings An empire added to the West : And all his regions rulers are Save her alone who mourns the Star . The wildness in a moment died ; A garden bloomed and fruited full Across the plains and valleys wide At touch of hands invincible ; But mute she stands where deserts were : The banner holds no Star for her ! The race heaps high its conquered spoil ; The braggart heirs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns for review ; And she , the Starless , at your call Brings trophies that surpass them all ! Are not her laurels rich and rare ? Her apt attainments great with grace ? You crown her here and everywhere Save where she pleads for power and place ; The world amazed her praises rings : What think ye , Masters , of these things ? She wonders wrought with wondrous hands : Her cities crowd the teeming plains , And church and school exalt the lands With all of mankind 's greater gains ;  --  The last of all the waste , she brings The triumphs of her million kings ! A million white and black and red Whose treble toils misunderstood Build happy homes and fondly wed The desert place with joyous good , And at your feet , uncrowned , unblest Kneel for the knighthood of their quest ! Thralled in her chains , this fairest one Of all the realms that greatly found Rich largess on the barrens dun Pleads from her fetters , vassal-bound ; And still the Star before her swings : What think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreams . I. Day-dreams and play-dreams ! From the rosy morn Till the ashy eventide and the stars new-born , Ever bringing life and heart aweary with their load Promises of hope and cheer while tramping down the road . II . Night dreams and bright dreams ! In the house of sleep With their happy faces full and their gazes deep , World on world so beautiful there they brightly bring , Till the heart is happy in the songs they sing . III . Day-dreams and Night-dreams ,  --  all the dreams you will ,  --  Beckon up the rocky slope and summon o'er the hill ,  --  Summon us to do and dare all the deeds of yore Till the battle ceases , and we strive no more ! My Philosophy . I 've made up my mind In spite of the cranks , ' T is a pretty good world And we ought to give thanks ; And whether it came From the God or the grime , The fellow that runs it Do n't lose any time . I 've made up my mind In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roll of the years ; And whether it gropes Or is led on and on , It will come by and by To the meadows of dawn . In spite of the sin And the folly around , ' T is a much better place Than the fore-fathers found ; And in spite of the fools And the devils that grieve I 'm sure in no hurry To pull up and leave . So shut up your mouth And do n't grumble nor croak ; Go put your poor head And your poor heart in soak ; Lay all of your sorrows And sins on the shelf , For the world is all right If you 're all right yourself ! Caught on the Fly . If the girl with a white muslin dress and a picture hat has any troubles in this world she has a wonderful skill in hiding her real feelings . Somehow , those men who are all the time telling how well money talks , never get well enough acquainted with it to speak with authority . " De worst objection to de wortersmillion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is de fact dat it gits ripe too late fer de wheat harvest an ' too yarly fer de cotton-pickin . " The average man grieves more when he runs out of chewing tobacco and the nearest neighbor who uses the filthy weed is three miles away , than he does when the mortgage takes the farm . Upon what little things doth happiness depend ! A Busy Family . Mam 's at a function where you hold your breath ; Liz has got a feller , an ' she 's talkin ' him to death ; Andy has the measles , Susie 's nussin ' Bill , Pap is out fer office an ' he 's runnin ' fit to kill ; Pont an ' me are fishin ' , all the signs are right , Fer the crick is up a-boomin ' an ' the big fish bite ! The Kingbolt Philosopher . " Ive heerd tell , " said Uncle Ezra Mudge , " thet every dog has his day . But I 'm jest as sartin thet he do n't know he 's a havin ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bill Smith . Bill was a high-up chap , made money , had a rubber-tired buggy , four girls , and chawed terbacker thet cost a dollar a pound . But he never knowed he was a havin ' of his day ontell he went busted on the Board of Trade . But now Bill knows it , and has knowed it ever sence he went busted . " Do n't Grumble . What 's the use to grumble , what 's the use to fret , ' Cause the cotton 's weedy and the days go wet ? ' T is the Lord that sorts the weather and the sun and rain to you , And you need n't kick and holler ' cause he do n't explain to you ! When it rains , do n't get to mopin ! There 's more sunny skies than clouds , And if sorrows drop in singly , why , the pleasures come in crowds ; Black day or bright day , do n't you fume and fret , When the cotton 's weedy and the days go wet ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome set , " said a Guthrie coon . " We hab a great majority ob de city , but on ' lection day we nebber git ober half the city council an ' de school board , and four drinks apiece . We am a-talkin ' of sendin ' ' em back to Englan ' whar dey belong ef dey do n't do better ! " A Little of Love . I. With a little of Love , Dear , and something of Song , There 's a glorified courage that conquers each wrong , And the years fly as swift as the bird on the wing Through the snow days of winter and rose days of spring . II . With a little of Love , Dear , and something of Song , There 's no hour that is heavy , no day that is long ; And the soldier of hope scales the mountains that meet , Till they lay all their trophies and gifts at his feet . III . With a little of Love , Dear , and something of Song , All the mighty exalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravely bares to the breast of the foe , And , forever full armored , gives blow for his blow ! IV . Then a little of Love , Dear , and something of Song ! What shall matter the struggle with error and wrong ? For the lilies and roses of gladness shall bloom Till we sleep the long slumber as dust in the tomb ! Caught on the Fly . It 's no use to try to trot in a race where you are out-classed . Better be a good weed-puller at so much per pull , than a member of the legislature without any pull at all . If a woman 's hair is smoothed up , her hat on straight and her belt all right behind , the other cares and responsibilities of this life sink at once and forever into insignificant nothingness . This thing of " hitching your wagon to a star " may be all right for a steady occupation , but the fellow who plants garden truck in his back-yard nights and mornings will have more on the table at meal-times . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's market place , For a scowl there 's no price , And a long , gloomy face Never cuts any ice ! Look pleasant , look pleased , Or as pleased as you can ;  --  With a smile can be seized All the great things of man ! Do n't frown ! Do n't frown ! With a smile on your lips You can reach to the end Of the world 's last eclipse Or the heart of a friend ; And the things the gods throw Over life 's weary mile , Are the gifts they bestow In return for a smile . Do n't frown ! Do n't frown ! As you walk down the way Where the world scatters chaff , Light your labors with play And your griefs with a laugh ! And when it 's all o'er And you reach heaven 's stile , You will get through the door If you carry a smile ! Do n't frown ! Jog Along . Jog along , my brother , Jog along , I say ; There 's no cozy corner For one that wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whistle good and strong , But be careful that you always Jog along . Jog along , my brother , Jog along , I say ; Keep yourself in motion ,  --  You need n't stop or stay ; Someone will hear you And will help your song , If you do your part and always Jog along . Jog along , my brother , Jog along I say , Doing God good service Till the final day ; For He will crown you After all the wrong , With his choicest blessings , if you Jog along . The Kingbolt Philosopher . " There be some things , " says Uncle Ezra Mudge , " that it is best to take on faith . I do n't know for certain that the devil has split hoofs and a forked tail and carries a four-tined fork along with him in the hope of finding a hay-field handy ; but rather than make a private appointment with him to find out , I am willing to take the word of the picture books on the subject . " Whatever weaknesses he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go on about his regular business and pay no attention to the little distractions of this life , has a great advantage in the world . The rhinoceros would not look well in a beauty show , but it can always sleep well , even if hundreds of mosquitoes are buzzing around hunting for a full meal . Spring is that season of the year when the new plow-boy and the old plow-mule patiently learn again the world-wide difference between " haw " and " gee . " The Harvest Time . I. The harvest time is over ! And across the fertile plain Stand the winrows of the meadows and the stocks of golden grain ; And the aching limbs of labor take the rest of happy ease From the scorching suns of noon-day in the shadows of the trees . The harvest time is over ! And the husbandman receives For the days of hard endeavor all the wealth of garnered sheaves ; ' And the land of hill and valley smiles exalt with joys untold Heaping high above the stubbles in the piles of ripened gold ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told ; Hill and valley both rejoice With their wealth of gold ! II . The harvest time is over ! After all the years of strife There 's a joy for every sorrow and a crown for every life ; And the songs of Heaven 's angels on the straining soul arise As the weary foot-steps falter on the walks of Paradise . The harvest time is over ! All the struggle has surcease ! After life , the stars above us ! After battle , love and peace ! And the glories of achievement that atone for sin and strife Are the sheaves of good we garner as we reap the fields of life ! Harvest time ! harvest time ! Years of struggle gone , Joy shall crown the soul with light In eternal Dawn ! The Kingbolt Philosopher . " Fer accumulatin ' much experience in a short while and in a rapid manner , " said Uncle Ezra Mudge , " thar is nothin ' under the sun beats a-goin ' to law . With only a toler'ble fair case and a good lively lawyer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one single law-suit suitably appealed , to decently equip a whole neighborhood fer at least three generations . " Mister Cantaloupe . Hello , Mister Canteloupe , When did you arrive ? Glad to see you , and I hope That you 're all alive ! How-dy do and how-dy do ! Hope your folks are well , And are coming after you For to stay a spell ! Hello , Mister Cantaloupe ! Please excuse my smile , But I 'm just so glad , and hope You will stay awhile ; Put ' er here and put ' er there ! If you 've traveled far , Come with me and take a chair In the dining car ! Life is neither comedy nor tragedy , but sometimes it pushes up so close to both that it keeps a fellow on the dodge between smiles and tears . Rainy Weather . Our Mud Creek correspondent sends us the following items , having to do with the recent wet weather : " Bill Hughes cut his wheat last week . He rigged up a header attachment to a row-boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . " It rained so fast last Saturday night at Tad Wilson 's that the water could n't all run off the roof of his new house . The water stood four inches deep on top of the comb for over half an hour . Then Tad took an ax and sharpened the comb so it would split the drops better , and the water soon ran down . " Jem Bilkins ' incubator hatched last Wednesday during the heavy rain . Jem set only Plymouth Rock eggs ; but , when they hatched , over half of his chickens were ducks . They were given web feet by an accommodating providence . " Get in the Game . Get in the game of life , my boy , Get in the mighty game ; There 'll be something of care and somewhat of strife And something of sin and shame ! But after the years and the toils they bring , There 'll be a time of joy , If the heart stays sweet and the soul can sing , So get in the game , by boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  That is the game for all ; For the hazards are sweet and the days are rife With the fortunes that rise and fall ; But after the losses the triumphs stand Enemies ca n't destroy ; So get in the game with a full , clean hand , So get in the game , by boy . Get in the game of life , by boy ! That is the game men play , And whether it 's gladness or whether it 's strife , It lasts to the One Great Day ; The crowns and the stars and the laughs of love Beckon with hands of joy , Till the soul grows vast in the home above ,  --  So get in the game , my boy ! Caught on the Fly . My son , this world has so much work to do that it has not even room for a lazy man to sit down and rest .

It is n't every dude that wears patent leathers and parts his hair in the middle , who has n't sense enough to flag the bread-wagon when it comes tearing down the pike . Dreaming . Let those who prefer it Keep hatching their schemes , But all through life 's summer I 'll cherish my dreams ! Go on with your struggles , Your worries and wrongs ; I 'll camp with the lillies And list to their songs . I 'll dream with the daisies That sweeten the sod ; I 'll dream with the roses That whisper of God ; I 'll dream with the wild birds That sing of the right , And out of the shadows Dream garlands of light . I 'll dream through the darkness Of sorrow and strife , Till love brings the morning And laurels the life ; And over the meadows My happy feet roam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me home ! A Jolly Good Game . I. You may talk as you please about Life 's necromancy ;  --  ' T is a journey of smiles or of tears as you fancy  --  For I always have found ,  --  and I 'm happy to say it ,  --  ' T is a jolly good game if one knows how to play it ! II . The Dealer sits yonder ,  --  the hands that he serves us  --  The brains and the beauty and courage that nerves us ,  --  And strength for the struggle ; and then he gives warning , To play to the ceiling till dawn of the morning ! III . And mighty the stakes that he sets us to try for ! Fame , Fortune and Honor , and Love , that men die for ! The Sword , or the Crown , or the Star , or the Garter , And all the high winnings men bargain and barter ! IV . He deals us the hand ,  --  and no one may discard it ! The game must go on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good one or bad one , He asks of us only to play it a glad one . V. Then let people talk about life as they see it ; You can make it for you what your heart may decree it ; For I always have found  --  and I 'm happy to say it ,  --  ' T is a jolly good game if you know how to play it ! A Contented Farmer . Wheat-crop heapin ' in de shock , Corn jes ' keeps a-bumpin ' ; Oats a-yallerin ' in de sun ,  --  Cotton des a-jumpin ' ! Millet , Kafir-corn an ' cane Bust their selves a-growin ' ; Oklahoma 's home for me Till Gabriel goes to blowin ' ! Hell and Heaven . " Doa n't tell me dat hell am away off yander , " said an old darkey as he stood before the display window of the vegetable market where a dozen water-melons , the first of the season , reposed in unconscious temptation . " Dem millyuns cost a dollar apiece , an ' I hai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Go ' way , man ! I tell you hell am right hyar , an ' hebben only sebenty cents away ! " Caught on the Fly . Of course , it is all right to aim high , but it 's the fellow that never shoots at all that fails to bring down the game . After all , the alleged failures of life are not of much importance . It is what one does with his failures that tells the story of his despair or hope . When a man is always dressed and has his boots on ready for the journey , Opportunity comes along in her automobile and invites him to get in and ride with her . June Time . Pleasures fond are singing , Love , for you and me , And the moments bringing Joys of land and sea ! June-time is tune-time ! Do n't you hear the song ?

Good-bye , Dear Heart ! I go my own sad way , And you go yours , and Life is agony ; And yet I must not weakly beg you stay , In spite of all your absence means to me . II . Though distance part , though sky and sea divide , To you I must not reach detaining hands ; The years are many and the world is wide , And Love 's fair roses bloom in many lands . III . With all the joys and all the wishes fond My soul sends after you , we ca n't regret ; The raptures wait us in the sweet Beyond , And we shall teach our memories to forget . IV . We meet no more ! The hand-clasp and embrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lips , The melt of eye and tender flush of face ,  --  These all for us have passed to last eclipse . V. So , good-bye , Dear ! Good-bye for evermore ! Adown the years our halting feet shall press , Our lone hearts wander , till the quest is o'er , And Love shall lead us back to happiness ! The Kingbolt Philosopher . " I 've knowed some mighty fine scholars in figgers , " said Uncle Ezra Mudge , " that never could calkilate the problem of human life . Purty near every feller when he gets to figgerin ' on it , tries to git the Almighty Dollar fer the answer , and it wo n't figger out . I 've seen lots of men in my time an ' I never seed one yit that money made happy . An ' if happiness ai n't the answer to all this here figgerin ' an ' foolin ' an ' fightin ' , then I give it up .

Toss a kiss to Care , and say , " You are only for a day " ; You with all your woes and tears Never linger through the years . Toss a kiss to Care , and be Happy in your ecstasy ; Bid your grief begone , and smile With the pleasures for awhile ! Caught on the Fly . The bass-drum is all right at the head of the procession , but the still-hunt cuts the most ice in politics . The up-to-date dude , a-sport with patent-leathers and a Panama hat , puts on lots of style , but he began life as a bald headed and bare-foot boy along with the common herd . Whenever you see an old maid who giddily shies off from the croup when the little folks grow wheezy , you can put it down as a sure sign that she is trying to conceal her age . The Glorious Fourth . Sister got her new hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a cannon-crack ' Sploded in her hair ; Pap got powder in his face Shootin ' anville thayre ; Billy got an ' ear tore off , Sammy lost an eye ; Got two fingers broke myself , Fourth o ' ole July ! When the Bills Come Due .

Love 's Dream . I.

Do n't you weary As you go along ; Climb the path-ways to the hill-tops , And you 'll hear the Song ! III .

O , my children ! Do n't you murmur , As you go along ; Look above to God 's Anointed , And you 'll hear the Song ! Caught on the Fly . When Love leaves life , Laughter packs up her things and gets ready to move . When Hope dies in the heart , all its poor relations refuse to remain for the funeral services . The people who are all the time trying to manage other people should remember that though Providence created Man in His own image , it has been unable to manage him ever since .

" The Lord is good to me ! " she prayed Above her sleeping babe at rest , While smiles of exaltation played Across her features , care oppressed ; And from the crib of anguish where The fever-wasted baby slept She happy slipped away from care And all the anxious tears she wept .

Some people do all they can to make others uncomfortable , and call it their religion . The love which is so superfine that it ca n't find a place for its home in this world is entirely too good for a hearty welcome in the next one . The reason why the preachers do n't have larger congregations must be on account of their not wanting to call the sinners but the righteous to repentance , and there is always plenty of room .

Little Sermons . The thankfulness of some people stops in saying grace at the table before meals . It is n't always the front seats that are occupied by His humblest children , when the collection plate gets busy . The religion that is so brief as to last only a few hours on Sunday can be at home in a place too warm to cut ice in the great hereafter . The Sunshine Song . I.

The Lights of Home . I. Heave ho the anchor , laddies !

While the red fire and the rockets Fill the skies with rosy glare , There 's a kind of inspiration In the shouts and music there ; But we pass it up with gladness And contentment on us sits , When the ballots all are counted And the campaign liar quits ! He is trained in facts and figures , He 's a prodigy , in sooth ; He can tell the smoothest story , But he shies away from truth ; So we gladly lose the glory , ( It was never worth two bits ! ) When the ballots all are counted And the campaign liar quits !

And his look is a heavenly joy ; And however he does it , whatever his plan , We know he 's the Santa Claus boy ! He jumps out of bed in the morning himself , And he never lies still for the rest ; He dresses in haste with the skill of an elf , And he washes and combs with the best ; He does up the chores while his small sister snores , And his whistle no longer annoys ; He 's the pride of the house and the king of out-doors ,  --  This wonderful Santa Claus boy !

When the Sabbath day comes with its Sunday School hours , He is never once absent or late ; And the verses he speaks beat the memory powers Of the sages exalted and great ; But he dreams of a Tree , full of presents to be , And with treasures that know not alloy ; And the vision he sees fills his bosom with glee For the Sunday School Santa Claus boy ! Ah , well , this old codger laid up on the shelf , In the rubbish piled high on life 's ways , Knows how it all is ,  --  he has been there himself ,  --  He has romped through the Santa Claus days ; Whatever appears , whether laughter or tears , Let a song every moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years To the glad-hearted Santa Claus boy !

" A Blazing Future . What 's the use of getting blue When the joys are so amazing ? This life 's sunshine through and through And the other life is blazing !

I 'm a Legislative Pass : I 'm the master of the state , While the people think , alas ! They are something wise and great ; Treat me kindly every day , As I summon dear delight Down the legislative way Till adjournment is in sight . I 'm a Legislative Pass : Fly with me ,  --  there 's no expense ,  --  From the weary ways of gas And the halls of eloquence ; Let us travel far and fast ! Soon we 'll journey nevermore !

It was all right for the Christ to say , " Get thee behind me , Satan , " but I 'd rather keep him on in front where I can watch his tricks . The man of most exemplary habits never finds congenial spirits to herd with . The marvel is not that Christ was crucified , but that he was allowed to live till he was thirty-three years old . At Rest . Fold the hands and let him rest ! He shall sorrow nevermore ; Grief has done her worst and best , But his grief is o'er ! What to him the dangers dark ,  --  Terrors of the waveless stream ? God shall guide the helpless barque Through the shadowed dream ! He has fought with storm and strife , He has conquered , all alone ; He has plucked the rose of life For his very own . Farewell to the world of sighs !

No matter what the weeping , No matter what the wrong , Just toss a kiss to trouble And soothe him with a song .

If he 'd listen to our troubles and his haughtiness relax , Then the bill we love and cherish would escape the butcher 's ax But with him across the pathway , it as plain as day appears That our hopes are only rainbows and we chase them down the years ; Oh , we wish him every gladness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll quit his meanness to the Statehood bill !

It 's no diff'rence what the weather , What the flow of wind or tide ; There 's the holy joy of living And God keeps a sunny side ! Keep Busy . Do n't sit down so lonesome Through the speeding years ; Drink the wines of gladness And forget the tears . Life goes down the distance Swift as eagle 's flight ; Stop to say " Good-morning .

A man 's conscience preaches more eloquent sermons than the Savior on the Mount . If men were less evil , it would be much easier for their fellows to walk the narrow way . If the Bible reduced virtue to a mathematical demonstration of its cheapness over Vice , the mourner 's bench would break down with the repentant sinners . At the End . At the end of the day What reward shall we gain For the pleasures of play And the presence of pain ? When the sun shall have set What reward shall we get ? As we sing and we sigh Through the years ' tangled ways , Through the winter 's wild cry , Through the blooms of the Mays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward shall we get ?

We knew when we entered the strange , new land there were labors of might to do ; We knew that Want with his deadly sword stood guard at the desert gate , But far to the swarded prairies and valleys that no one knew , We spurred our steeds on the holy quest for the stars of a mighty state ! The Drouth came out of the sere south-west and the corn died low in a day ; The copper sun looked out of a sky that burned with a molten fire ; While Hope sank deep in the bravest heart , and over the barren way The dumb feet trailed in the steps of Want and dead was the old desire . And Famine came with her sunken eyes from the dust of the parching fields And tapped the door with her bony hands and her fingers gaunt and thin ; Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the master yields When all the world is a heap of dust that its creatures wriggle in ! But Plenty heard of our want and woe , and gave with a lavish hand , And Love loaned ever her cruise of oil that never of fullness fails ; The God of the rains heard all our cries and He watered the thirsty land And sent us a patch of turnips instead of a flock of quails ! O , years of the strife and struggle ! O , years of the wrath and wrong ! The hands of toil smote the sleeping fields and they woke with the blooms of light ; The homes we wrought are the homes of peace , where life is a tender song , And the pleasures romp through the laughing days and the dreams go down the night ! Between the seas of the big , round world there never was such a land ! A land that walks in the paths of peace where the stars in their plenty shine ; And the fields are fair with the harvests there and the gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red in the orchard trees and the grapes on the purple vine ! It is sixteen years since we ran the race , it is sixteen mighty years , And the days have come and gone again , with the gifts that the strong men claim ; And after the days of the struggle , the grief and toil and tears , The wilderness smiles in its beauty ' neath the stars of a wondrous fame .

When Easter Sunday comes along I hunt and hunt so hard , And find a nest of rabbit eggs Out yonder in the yard ; They 're red and yellow , blue and green , All colored every way , And when the rabbits lay their eggs I know it 's Easter day . My Mamma cooks a lot of eggs For little Bud and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can be ; And then we go to dress ourselves , And find in every shoe , The rabbits left a pile of eggs As Easter rabbits do . And Mamma tells us of the Christ Who came to earth and died , And was so good in all he did He soon got crucified ; But when they took him from the Cross And buried him away , He came to life and rose again And started Easter day . And Mamma has some lilies , too , And glad flowers of the spring , And tells us how the world wakes up , And tells the birds to sing : And I like Easter mighty well , But what is best , I say , Is when you find the rabbit eggs And know it 's Easter day !

Happy the man who understands the story and walks with unerring feet the divine lanes of life and light until the shadows fall again ! The Blossom Ways . With one true heart and a hand that stays , This world rolls ever the blossom ways , And there as it roams the sweet paths over , The honey bees and the laughing clover !

III . We travel the rim of the circle ! The peoples that struggled and wrought Are the dust of the ways that we wander , with truths they discovered and taught ; And back to the morning we hasten ,  --  the morning when nations were new ,  --  For the Voice of the Master is calling , and still there is labor to do .

Playing the Game . When Willie first began the game , He saw but little in it , And often wondered how he came To let himself begin it ; But soon he learned the ball to hit A mighty blow elastic , And shouted at the rise of it With yells enthusiastic .

Still Onward . What if the paths be dark and shadowed still The summit roads and hope hides in eclipse ! Beyond the tangled ways that murmur ill The touch of tender lips ! Forth on the dark ways though still darker grow The paths before the groping finger-tips ! Beyond the shadow years our visions know The touch of tender lips ! Finis . A sigh and a song , And a song and a sigh ; But the song helps along To the sky bye and bye !       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
