txt The Central Railroad of New Jersey ferryboat Lakewood last night at 0 o'clock crashed into her slip at the foot of Liberty Street , wrecked the northern side of the ferry station , tore up the street outside the station for a distance of several feet , injured one man and scared nearly out of their wits several score of people who were either on the boat or in the ferry station or on the street . It was the last trip of the boat . She was on time , and no one on board had the least idea of what was about to take place . Suddenly the boat shook from end to end , the ferryhouse creaked , and the people on the Lakewood were thrown into a panic by the terrific impact of the boat against the slip . The crash could be heard for blocks , and for a few seconds everybody in the vicinity of the ferry felt certain the house was about to collapse . The pillars of the shed were broken or splintered , the gates through which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving blocks and stone and iron foundations of the structure proper were piled on the street for a distance of several yards . A big crowd hurried to the scene , and everybody seemed to think that there had been an explosion in one of the gas mains under the shed . When told that it was all due to the contact of a ferryboat with the structure they could hardly be made to believe that such a craft could do so much damage . Their wonder was still greater when they were informed that the boat had not been damaged . Capt . Griffin was in command of the Lakewood , and as soon as the boat recovered herself he backed her out into the stream , made the slip on the southern side of the shed , and landed his passengers . The only person injured was Herbert H. Griffin of Bayonne , who was on the street just outside the slip when the accident occurred . He was thrown violently to the , ground by the shock , but received only slight injuries , the most painful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused medical attention , and went to his home . Late last night the railroad company ordered out its carpenters , and preparations v , ere soon under way to repair the damage . 1 Policeman Healey of the Steamboat Squad , who was on duty when the crash occurred , reported the matter to the police . He said the most remarkable thing about the whole affair was the fact that none of the horses near the slip were at all frightened by the noise and upheaval that followed the collision . They were all cab horses , he said , a fact that probably ac-counted for it . STEAMSHIP HITS A DERRICK . The Belvernon 's Pilot Arrested on Charge of Malicious Mischief . David L.
