txt The decision of the Alaska Commission may have an important effect on the sentiment of the people of Canada as to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN 'S campaign for protection . The chief plea made by Mr CHAMBERLAIN for the return of Great Britain to the policy of tariff taxation in the interest of special industries in the colonies was that that was the only way in which the colonies could be kept in the empire . The Alaska decision has impelled Sir WiLriun LAURIER , the Canadian Premier , to suggest that Canada would be glad to have what amounts to virtual - independence from the empire . He has declared that it would be better if the Dominion had the right of making its own treaties . That is a long step away from the imperialism of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN , and one which , if taken , could hardly be retraced and must almost of necessity be followed by others in the direction of independence . ' Obviously , if Canada had the treaty- making power it would include the power to regulate its own commercial relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Laurier Government would make of such ft power would be to negotiate , if possible , a treaty of reciprocity with the United States , and this with little or no reference to the interests or the desires of England . The object considered would be the promotion of trade across the long American border , and in pursuit of that object the preference heretofore given to English goods imported into the Dominion might readily be ignored . Reciprocity on the broadest possible lines has long been the ideal of Sir " WiLrlun LAURIER , and though it would be interfered with to some extent by the growth of protected industries under the tariff of 1897 , it would still be much more feasible through direct negotiation with the United States than it would be through negotiation by the agency of the British Government . In any . case , the mere suggestion of such a radical and essential change in the status of the Dominion is the most serious indication of a sentiment in favor of practical independence that has occurred in Canada for at least forty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
