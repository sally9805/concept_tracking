txt Zn his earnest plea for the impirovemeat of the waterways of the valleys of the Mississippi and its tributaries , which the President made at Memphis Yesterday , he set forth in terse and eloque'nt language the enormous needless waste constantly going on throughout these vast regions , mainly due to the wanton destruction of the forests . " The National forest policy , " he said , " inaugurated primarily to avert or mitigate the timber famine which is now beginning to be felt , has been effective also in securing partial control of floods by retarding the run-off and checking the erosion of the higher slopes within theNational forests . Still the loss from soil wash is enormous . It is computed that one-fifth of a cubic mile in volume , or one billion tons in weight of the richest soil matter of the United States is annually gathered in storm rivulets , washed into the rivers , and borne into the sea . The loss to the farmer is in effect a tax greater than all other land taxes combined and one yielding absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are consuming our forests three times faster than - they are produced . Some of the richest timber lands of this continent have already been destroyed and not replaced , and other vast areas are on the verge of destruction . It is clear beyond peradventure that our natural resources have been and are still being abused ; that continued abuse will destroy them , and that we have at last reached the forks of the road . We are face to face with the great fact that the whole future of the Nation is directly at stake in the momentous decision which is forced upon us . Shall we continue the waste and deStruction of our natural resources , or shall we conserve them ? There Is no other question of equal gravity now before the Nation . Mr. ROOSEVELT does not in the least exaggerate the rate at which we are destroying our supplies of wood for all purposes or the consequences we shall have to suffer if we do not stop the ruinous process . For it is not the wood alone that we are wasting . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power that the ' water can be made to produce , the incalculably valuable transportation to be secured from developed and maintained waterways . But while Mr. ROOSEVELT shows bow immense is the interest involved , and while he advocates the use of Federal powers to establish reforestation and to regulate the flow and use of the Waterways , he is silent , absolutely silent , as to the taxes by which the supply of wood is shut out and the destruction of our own resources is encouraged . ' yet the blighting effect of these taxes Is plain on the face of the facts . They are called protective taxes . There was a time when the termewas at least not absurd . When our forests were apparently inexhaustible the cutting of them was stimulated by taxes on forest products imported across our northern border . The industry was not at first extremely profitable . The demand was irregular , the forests were remote , transportation was defective and costly , labor was scarce , capital was not abundant , and the tax on competition had an effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reduced or repealed as the situation changed , as its authors promised and probably expected that it would be , no serious harm would have been done . But to maintain it now in the light of the striking facts ao iespressively stated by Mr. Rooss'arta 4s simply to invite and reward the - " waste and destruction of our natural resources . " His own words may be applied to the repeal of this wholly bad body of taxes : " There is no other question of equal gravity now before the Nation . " But the taxes stand unchanged in all . the ingenious thoroughness of their original conception , reaching over every product of the forest from hewn timber to toothpicks . Every thousand feet of Snood , in whatever shape it may be . that is guilty of originating outside the territory of the United States is taxed $1 , $1.50 , $2 , according to its condition . If it be made into fence posts , or railroad ties , or telegraph or telephone poles , or shingles , or clapboards , or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful , it must pay its epecial tribute to the lumbermen of our own country . A careful study of the Ilse and abuse of wood in. the United States shows that more than 50,000 square miles of area are stripped every year . About one-third of this denudation is due to fires . The most extensive demand is for fuel , which takes 21,000 square miles . The other 13,000 square miles are stripped for wood of the sorts that the tax reaches . Here is a plain , simple question of common sense . We have at work a number of - forces tending toward the swift destruction of forests , the disturbance and drying up of water courses , the waste of the soil . It is our clear duty to check the operation of these forces in every way we can . We can check it materially by the use of imported lumber , vast stores of which lie across our northern.frontier . This form of relief we'punish by fine . Was there ever anything more criminally foolish than this ? And the President has not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
