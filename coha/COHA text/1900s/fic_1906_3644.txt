Copyright , 1906 BY STITT PUBLISHING COMPANY Randy of the River . PREFACE The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country , or possibly on the ocean , and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations . In the present tale we have a youth of sturdy qualities who elects to follow the calling of a deckhand on a Hudson River steamboat , doing his duty faithfully day by day , and trying to help others as well as himself . Like all other boys he is at times tempted to do wrong , but he has a heart of gold even though it is hidden by a somewhat ragged outer garment , and in the end proves the truth of that old saying that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others but also regarding one 's self . Life on a river steamboat is not so romantic as some young people may imagine . There is hard work and plenty of it , and the remuneration is not of the best . But Randy Thompson wanted work and took what was offered . His success in the end was well deserved , and perhaps the lesson his doings teach will not be lost upon those who peruse these pages . It is better to do what one finds to do than to fold your hands and remain idle , and the idle boy is sure , sooner or later , to get into serious mischief . CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE I.

BROUGHT TO TERMS -- CONCLUSION 265 RANDY OF THE RIVER CHAPTER I SOMETHING ABOUT RANDY " I am going fishing , Randy . Do you want to go along ? " " With pleasure , Jack , " answered Randy Thompson , a bright , manly youth of fourteen . " Are you going on foot or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well take the boat , " returned Jack Bartlett , a boy who was but a few months older than Randy . " Have you your lines handy ? " " No , but I can get them in less than ten minutes . " " All right . Meet me at the dock in quarter of an hour . I was thinking of going up the river to Landy 's Hole . That 's a good spot , is n't it ? " " I think so . Last season I was up there and caught fourteen good-sized fish . " " They tell me you are one of the best fishermen in Riverport , Randy , " went on Jack Bartlett , admiringly . " What is the secret of your success ? " " I do n't know unless it is patience , " answered Randy , with a broad smile . " To catch fish you must be patient . Now when I caught my mess of fourteen two other boys were up to the Hole . But just because the fish did not bite right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by doing that they got only about half as many as myself . " " Well , I am willing to be patient if I know I am going to catch something . " At this Randy laughed outright . " You ca n't be sure of anything -- in fishing . But I always reckon it 's a good thing to hold on and give a thing a fair trial . " " I reckon you 're right , Randy , and I 'll give the fishing a fair trial to-day , " answered Jack Bartlett . " Remember , the dock in quarter of an hour , " he added , as he moved away . " I 'll be on hand -- unless mother wants me to do something for her before I go away , " returned Randy . Randy , or rather Randolph , Thompson , to use his right name , was the only son of Louis Thompson , a carpenter of Riverport , a thriving town in one of our eastern states . Randy had no brothers or sisters , and lived with his father and mother in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hills back of the town . Randy was a scholar in the local school , standing close to the head of his class . It was now summer time and the institution of learning was closed , so the boy had most of his time to himself . He had wanted to go to work , to help his father , who had some heavy doctors ' bills to pay , but his parents had told him to take at least two weeks ' vacation before looking for employment . " He needs it , " Mrs. Thompson had said to her husband . " He has applied himself very closely to his studies ever since last fall . " " Well , let him take the vacation and welcome , " answered Louis Thompson . " I know when I was a boy I loved a vacation . " He was a kind-hearted man and thought a good deal of his offspring and also of his wife , who was devoted to him . The cottage stood back in the center of a well-kept garden , where Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she was passionately fond . It was a two-story affair , containing but five rooms , yet it was large enough for the family , and Randy , who had never known anything better , considered it a very good home . There was a small white fence in front , with a gate , and the path to the front stoop was lined with geraniums . Over the porch was trained a honeysuckle which filled the air with its delicate fragrance . " Mother , I 'm going fishing with Jack Bartlett ! " cried Randy , running around to the kitchen , where his mother was busy finishing up the week 's ironing . " Very well , Randy , " she answered , setting down her flatiron and giving him a smile . " I suppose you wo n't be back until supper time . " " It 's not likely . Can I do anything for you before I go ? " " You might get a bucket of water and another armful of wood . " " I 'll do that , " answered Randy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? " " No . Take care of yourself while you are on the river . " " Do n't worry about me , mother . Remember , I can swim like a fish . " " Yes , I know . But you must be careful anyway , " answered Mrs. Thompson , fondly . The water and wood were quickly brought into the cottage , Randy whistling merrily while he performed these chores . Then the youth ran for his fishing outfit , after which he took the spade , went down to the end of the garden , and turned up some worms , which he placed in a pasteboard box . " Now I am off , mother ! " he called out . " Good-by , Randy , " she said , and waved him a pleasant adieu from the open kitchen window . " She 's the best mother a boy ever had , " thought Randy , as he walked away to join Jack at the dock . " What a good boy ! " murmured Mrs. Thompson . " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Randy arrived at the dock he found himself alone . He brought out the boat and cleaned it up and got the oars . He was all ready for the start when a boy somewhat older than himself slouched up . The newcomer was loudly dressed in a checked suit and wore a heavy watchchain , a big seal ring , and a diamond shirt stud . He might have been good-looking had it not been for the supercilious scowl of independence upon his face . " Hullo there , Randy Thompson ! " he called out . " What are you doing in Jack Bartlett 's boat ? " His manner was decidedly offensive and did not suit Randy at all . " I do n't know as that is any of your business , Bob Bangs , " he answered coldly . " Humph ! Jack wo n't thank you for getting out his boat , " went on Bob Bangs . " If you want a boat why do n't you hire one ? " " I do n't have to hire one , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , " continued Bob , who was known as the town bully . His father was rich and for that reason he thought he could ride over all the other boys . " I should n't care to touch it , " said Randy . " Do n't you know you have n't any right to touch Jack 's boat without his permission ? " went on the big youth . " Bob Bangs , this is none of your business . " " Humph ! I 'll make it my business . " " If you do , you may get into trouble . " " I 'll risk that . If you do n't get out of that boat I 'll tell Jack . " " I am not going to get out of the boat . " " Maybe I 'll make you get out , " and Bob Bangs came a step closer , and put his hand on the gunwale of the rowboat . " You leave me and the boat alone , " said Randy , sharply . " You get out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangs looked ugly . He was on the point of catching Randy by the collar when an interruption came from behind . " So you got here ahead of me , eh ? " came in Jack 's voice , as he approached on a swift walk . " I had to do an errand for father and that kept me . " As Jack came up Bob Bangs fell back in disgust . " Humph ! Why did n't you say you were waiting for Jack ? " he said to Randy , with a sour look on his face . " You did n't ask me , that 's why , " returned Randy . " What 's the trouble ? " questioned Jack , quickly . " Bob wanted me to leave the boat alone . " " I thought he was trying to sneak it on the sly , " explained the big boy . " I did n't know you cared to go out with him , " he added , to Jack , with a toss of his head . " Why should n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , I should n't care to go out with the son of a poor carpenter . " " See here , Bob Bangs , I consider myself as good as you , " said Randy , quickly . " Humph ! " " Randy is all right , even if his father is a carpenter , " said Jack . " It 's mean of you , Bob , to talk that way . " " Choose your own company and I 'll choose mine , " answered Bob Bangs , loftily , and stalked away , his nose tilted high in the air . Angry words arose to Randy 's lips but he repressed them and said nothing . In a moment more some goods on the dock hid the big boy from view . " Do n't you care for what he says , " said Jack , quickly . " He thinks a few dollars are everything in this world . " " I did n't mind him -- much , Jack . " " Wanted you to get out of my boat , did n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting for you . " " That was a good joke on him . " " I ca n't understand why he is so disagreeable . " " It was born in him , " said Jack , as he leaped into the rowboat and stowed away his fishing outfit . " His father is the same way and so is his mother . They think that just because they have money everybody else , especially a poor person , is dirt under their feet . " " Why , Jack , I guess your father is as rich as Mr. Bangs . " " Maybe he is . " " And you do n't put on such airs . " " And I do n't intend to . Money is a good thing to have , but it is n't everything -- that is what my father and mother say . " " Bob would n't want me out in his boat with him . " " Maybe you would n't like to go out with him either . " " You are right there . I am getting so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am getting that way , too . Every time we meet he tries to impress it upon me that he is a superior person ,  - -  and I do n't see it . " " Your father and his father have some business dealings , have n't they ? " " Yes , they are interested in the same iron company ,  - -  and from what father says , I think they are going to have trouble before long . " " I hope your father comes out ahead . " " It is this way : Father has a controlling interest and Mr. Bangs is doing his best to get it away from him . If Mr. Bangs can get control he will , so father says , join the company of a larger concern , and then father will be about wiped out and he wo n't get more than half of what is really coming to him . " " But would n't that be fraud ? " " Yes , morally , but not legally -- so father says , " answered Jack , and heaved a sigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so do I -- for your sake as well as for your folks , " added Randy , heartily . CHAPTER II AT THE FISHING HOLE The fishing hole for which the two boys were bound was on the river about a mile and a half above the town . At this point the stream was thirty to forty feet wide and ten to fifteen feet deep . It was lined on one side with sharp rocks and on the other by thick trees and bushes . At the foot of some of the rocks , where the river made a bend , there was a deep hole , and this some of the lads , including Randy and Jack , considered an ideal place for fishing . The boys did not row directly for the hole , being afraid they might scare the fish away . Instead they landed below the spot , tied fast to a tree root between the stones , and then crawled over the big rocks until they reached a point from which they could cast into the hole with ease . They soon baited up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to make the initial cast . Scarcely had Jack 's hook touched the water when there came a jerk and the line was almost pulled from the boy 's hands . " You 've got him ! " cried Randy , excitedly . " Good for you ! " " If I do n't lose him before I get him on the rocks ! " answered Jack . But his fears were groundless , for a few seconds later the catch lay at his feet -- a fish weighing at least a pound and a half . " That 's the way to do it , " said Randy . " You might have had him -- if you had cast in first , " answered his companion , modestly . " I 'll try my luck now , " and Randy cast in without delay . Then Jack also tried it again , and both boys began to fish in earnest . Soon Randy got a bite and brought in a fish weighing as much as the first catch . " Now we are even , " said Jack . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack had an equal number . Then Jack 's luck fell away and Randy got three more while his companion got nothing . " There is no use of talking , you are a better fisherman than I , " said Jack . " I think you drop down too deep , " answered Randy . " Try it this way , " and he showed his friend what he meant . After that Jack 's success was a trifle better , but still Randy kept ahead of him . When the boys had caught twenty fish between them they decided to give up the sport . Randy knew where they could find some blackberries , and leaving their fish in a hole among the rocks , where there was a small pool of water , they tramped away from the river to where the blackberry bushes were located . " These are fine , " said Jack , eating a handful with a relish . " Randy , we ought to come berrying here some day . " " I am willing . " " These berries would make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And if there is anything I love it is a good , juicy blackberry pie . " " If we had a kettle we might take some home with us now . " " I am afraid it is too late . What time is it ? " Jack carried a neat silver watch which he consulted . " Why , it 's half-past five already ! I thought it might be four . Yes , we 'll have to get back . " " Let us go down to the boat first and then row up and get the fish . " This suited the two boys , and soon they were making their way back over the rocks to where Jack 's craft had been left . As they came out from among the trees and bushes they saw another boat on the river , headed for Riverport . " There is Bob Bangs again ! " exclaimed Randy . " Hullo ! " yelled Jack . " Have you been fishing , too ? " " Yes , " answered the big boy , and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " went on Jack . " Fine , " was the short answer , and then Bob Bangs ' craft drew out of hearing . " He was in a tremendous hurry , " mused Jack . " Perhaps he did n't want us to see what he had caught , " answered Randy . " That 's likely it , Randy . I do n't believe he knows as much about fishing as I do -- and that is little enough . " Having secured the rowboat , Randy and Jack rowed up to the fishing hole , and Randy scrambled up the rocks to secure their two strings of fish . He soon reached the shallow pool among the rocks in which they had been placed and drew up the two strings . " Well , I declare ! " he ejaculated , as he looked the fish over . Then he counted them carefully . " What can this mean ? " His string had held twelve fish and Jack 's eight fish . Now three of the largest fish from each string were gone . He looked around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hullo ! What 's keeping you ? " shouted Jack , from the boat . " Come up here ! " called back Randy . " Anything wrong ? " " Yes . " " Landy ! I hope the fish are n't gone ! " burst out Jack , as he scrambled up the rocks and ran to where Randy was continuing the search . The situation was soon explained and both boys hunted around in the neighborhood of the pool , thinking the fish might have gotten away in some manner . Then of a sudden Jack uttered a cry : " Look at this , Randy ! " " What is it ? " " A key ring , with two keys on it . " " Where did you find it ? " " Here , right beside the pool . " " Then somebody has been here and taken our fish ! " " Exactly what I believe . " Jack began to examine the key ring and then he uttered another exclamation : " Here are some initials on the ring . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out very well -- they are so worn . I think the first is R. " " Let me see . " Jack passed the find over and Randy examined it . " I can make it out , " said Randy . " R. A. B. " " Robert A. Bangs ! " shouted Jack . " Bob Bangs ! " murmured Randy . " Could he have been mean enough to come here and take some of our fish ? " " It certainly looks that way . " " Let us go after him and find out . " " All right . Anyway , we can make him explain how his key ring got here . " Taking what was left of the fish , the two boys hurried back to the rowboat and soon each was seated at an oar and pulling a good stroke in the direction of the town . " He must have been watching us fish , " observed Jack . " And he must have seen us place our catch in the pool . " " And took our best fish because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded Randy . " Well , if he has my fish he has got to give them up , " he added , with determination . Rowing at a good rate of speed , it did not take the boys long to reach the town . As they moved past one dock after another they looked for Bob Bangs , but the big youth was nowhere in sight . " I reckon he was afraid of being followed , " said Jack . " There is his boat , " answered Randy , and pointed to the craft , which was tied up near an old boathouse and not at the regular Bangs dock . While the two boys rested on their oars an old man who was lame , and who rented out boats for a living , came from the old boathouse . " Hullo , Isaac ! " called out Jack . " Have you seen Bob Bangs around here ? " " Why , yes ; he just went ashore , " answered Isaac Martin . " Did he have any fish ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How many ? " " Seven or eight . " " Which way did he go ? " " Up Samson Street . " " That 's the back way to his house , " cried Randy . " Come on ! " " What shall we do with our fish and the boat ? " " Let Isaac take care of them . " " Want me to take care of things , eh ? " said the lame boatman . " Very well , I 'll do it . " The two boys were soon on the way , on a run . They knew about the route Bob Bangs would take to get home and came in sight of the big boy just as he was entering his father 's garden by a rear gate . " Stop , Bob ! " called out Randy . The big boy looked around hastily and was much chagrined to see the others so close at hand . He held his string of fish behind him . " What do you want ? " he demanded , as they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " returned Jack . " We want our fish . " " Your fish ? Who has got your fish ? " blustered Bob . " You 've got them , " retorted Randy , and made a snatch at the string . The big boy held fast and a regular tug of war ensued . " Let go ! " " I wo n't ! " " You shall ! " " See here , Bob , " interposed Jack . " It wo n't do you any good to hang on . Those are our fish and we want them . " " Bah ! How do you know they are your fish ? " " Because you took them from the pool in which we placed them . " " I did not . " " You did . " " You ca n't prove it . " " Yes , we can . " " How ? " " By this , " said Jack , triumphantly , and exhibited the key ring and keys . CHAPTER III EXPOSING BOB BANGS When Bob Bangs saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get that ? " he demanded . " Got it where you dropped it -- at the pool where we left our fish . " " How do you know it is mine ? " " By the initials on it . " " Humph ! " " If you do n't want the key ring we 'll keep it , " put in Randy , quickly . " No , you wo n't keep it . Give it to me . " " Then give us our fish , " said Randy , quietly but firmly . " They are not all your fish . I caught two of them . " " The two smallest , I suppose . " " No , the two largest . " " We lost six big fish and these belong to us , " said Randy , and took the best fish from the string . " Bob Bangs , it was a contemptible thing to do , " he added , with spirit . " I would n't do such a dirty thing for a thousand dollars . " " Bah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hurt , " growled the large youth , savagely . " I am not afraid of you , even if you are bigger than I am , " said Randy , undaunted by the fighting attitude the bully had assumed . " It certainly was a mean piece of business , " came from Jack . " If you wanted some fish why did n't you ask us for them ? " " Humph ! I can buy my fish if I want to . " " Then why did you take ours ? " demanded Randy . " I -- er -- I did n't know they belonged to you . I just saw the strings in the pool and took a few , " answered the boy , lamely . " Give me my key ring . " The ring with the keys was passed over , and Randy and Jack restrung their fish . In the meantime Bob Bangs entered his father 's garden , slamming the gate after him . " You just wait -- I 'll get square with you ! " he shouted back , and shook his fist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into trouble ! " shouted back Randy , and then he and Jack walked away with their fish . " What 's the matter , Master Robert ? " asked the man-of-all-work around the Bangs place , as he approached Bob from the barn . " Oh , some fellows are getting fresh , " grumbled the big youth . " But I 'll fix them for it ! " " I see they took some of your fish . " " We had a dispute about the fish . Rather than take them from such a poor chap as Randy Thompson I let him keep them , " said Bob , glibly . " But I am going to get square with him for his impudence , " he added . After a long hard row and fishing for over an hour , Bob Bangs had caught only two small fish and he was thoroughly disgusted with everything and everybody . He walked into the kitchen and threw the fish on the sink board . " There , Mamie , you can clean those and fry them for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , land sakes , Master Bob , they are very small , " cried the girl . " They wo n't go around nohow ! " " I said you could fry them for my supper , " answered Bob , coldly . " They are hardly worth bothering with , " murmured the servant girl , but the boy did not hear her , for he had passed to the next room . He went upstairs and washed up and then walked into the sitting room , where his mother reclined on a sofa , reading the latest novel of society life . " Where is father ? " he asked , abruptly . " I do not know , Robert , " answered Mrs. Bangs , without looking up from her book . " Will he be home to supper ? " To this there was no reply . " I say , will he be home to supper ? " and the boy shoved the book aside . " Robert , do n't be rude ! " cried Mrs. Bangs , in irritation . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her novel reading . " I want some money . " To this there was no reply . Mrs. Bangs was on the last chapter of the novel and wanted to finish it before supper was served . She did little in life but read novels , dress , and attend parties , and she took but small interest in Bob and his doings . " I say , I want some money , " repeated the boy , in a louder key . " Robert , will you be still ? Every time I try to read you come and interrupt me . " " And you never want to listen to me . You read all the time . " " No , I do not -- I really read very little , I have so many things to attend to . What did you say you wanted ? " " I want some money . I have n't had a cent this week . " " Then you must ask your father . I have n't anything to give you , " and again Mrs. Bangs turned to her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again there was no answer . " I say , ca n't you give me a dollar ? " " I can not . Now go away and be quiet until supper time . " " Then give me fifty cents . " " I have n't a penny . Ask your father . " " Oh , you 're a mean thing ! " growled the wayward son , and stalked out of the sitting room , slamming the door after him . " What a boy ! " sighed the lady of the house . " He never considers my comfort -- and after all I have done for him ! " And then she turned once more to her precious novel . It wanted half an hour to supper time and Bob , not caring to do anything else , took himself back to his room . Like his mother , he , too , loved to read . Stowed away in a trunk , he had a score or more of cheap paper-covered novels , of daring adventures among the Indians , and of alluring detective tales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One was called " Bowery Bob , the Boy Detective of the Docks ; or , Winning a Cool Million , " and he wanted to finish this , to see how Bob got the million dollars . The absurdity of the stories was never noticed by him , and he thought them the finest tales ever penned . He was deep in a chapter where the hero in rags was holding three men with pistols at bay when he heard a noise below and saw his father leaping from the family carriage . Mr. Bangs ' face wore a look of great satisfaction , showing plainly that his day 's business had agreed with him . " How do you do , dad ? " he said , running down to greet his parent . " First-rate , Bob , " said Mr. Bangs , with a smile . " How have things gone with you to-day ? " " Not very well . " " What 's the matter ? " " You forgot to give me my spending money this week . " " I thought I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . " " I think you are mistaken , Bob . However , it does n't matter much , " went on Mr. Bangs , as he entered the house . " Phew ! He 's in a fine humor to-night , " thought Bob . " I 'll have to strike him for more than a dollar . " " Where 's your mother ? " went on the gentleman . " In the sitting room , reading . But I say , dad , what about that money ? " " Oh , do you want it right away ? " " I 'd like to have it after supper . " " Very well . " " Can I have three dollars ? I want to buy something extra this week -- some things I really need . " " Ahem ! Three dollars is quite a sum . I do n't know of any other boy in Riverport who gets as much as three dollars in one week to spend . " " Well , but they have n't as rich a father as I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangs , with satisfaction . " I think I can safely lay claim to being the richest man in this district . " " Then I can have the three dollars ? " went on Bob , anxiously . " Yes . Here you are , " and his parent brought forth a well-filled wallet and handed over three new one-dollar bills . Bob was stowing the money away in his pocket and congratulating himself on his luck when a door opened and Mrs. Bangs appeared . " So you are back , Amos , " she said , sweetly . " It has been such a long , lonesome day without you . " " And a busy day for me , " answered Amos Bangs , as he passed into the sitting room and dropped into an easy chair . " Did you go to Springfield ? " " I did , and met Tuller and the rest . We 've got that thing in our grip now . " " Yes , " she said , vaguely . In reality she took no interest whatever in her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired . " Yes , sir -- we 've got the thing just where we want it , " continued Amos Bangs . " You mean --  --  ? " his wife hesitated . " I mean that iron works affair of course , Viola . Ca n't you understand at all ? " " Oh -- er -- yes , of course . Let me see , you were trying to get control so you said . " " Exactly , and I 've got it . " " Was not that the works in which Mr. Bartlett is interested ? " " The same . " " Did not he have the control ? " " Yes , but I have it now , and I am going to keep it , " answered Amos Bangs , with evident satisfaction . " Do you mean Jack Bartlett 's father , dad ? " questioned Bob , eagerly . " I do . " " Have you got the best of him ? " " Well , I have -- ahem -- carried my point and the iron works will be absorbed by the concern in Springfield . " " And Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . In fact , I am afraid he will fight it . But he can do nothing , absolutely nothing , " went on Amos Bangs . " I hold the whip hand -- and I shall continue to hold it . " " I hate the Bartletts and I hope you do get the best of them . " " This will make Mrs. Bartlett take a back seat , " said Mrs. Bangs , maliciously . " Maybe you mean that seat in church , " said Bob , slyly . " Not that particularly , although it is time they went to the rear -- they have had a front seat so long . Amos , we must take a front seat now . " " As you please , Viola . " " And I must have some new dresses . " " You shall have them , my dear . " " You dear , good man ! " cried the fashionable wife ; and then the whole family went in to supper . Bob felt particularly elated . He had gotten three dollars for spending money and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to suffer . " I wish dad could do something to injure the Thompsons , " he said to himself . " But Mr. Thompson is only a carpenter . I must watch my chance and get square with Randy on my own account . " CHAPTER IV RANDY AT HOME All unmindful of the trouble that had already come to the Bartletts , and of the trouble Bob Bangs was hatching out for him , Randy divided the mess of fish with Jack and hurried home . " See what a fine mess I 've got , mother ! " he cried , as he entered the kitchen , where his mother had just started to prepare the evening meal . " Are n't they real beauties ? " " They are , Randy , " answered Mrs. Thompson , and smiled brightly . " Did Jack do as well ? " " Almost as well as I did , and we divided evenly , because , you see , he furnished the boat . And , mother , I 've found out where we can get a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go for them to-morrow . " " I wish you would , Randy . Your father loves blackberry pie and blackberry pudding . " " And so do I. " " I 've got time to fry some of these fish for supper , " went on Mrs. Thompson . " And we can have some more to-morrow , too . But I do n't think we can use them all . " " I was thinking we might give Mrs. Gilligan a couple . " " That will be very nice . If you will , take them over at once . " Mrs. Gilligan was a poor Irishwoman who took in washing and ironing for a living . She was alone in the world and often had a struggle to make both ends meet . " Just to look at that now ! " she cried , as Randy held up the fish . " Sure an ' ye air a great fisher b'y , Randy , so ye air ! " " I got so many I thought I 'd bring you a couple , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ye , " answered Mrs. Gilligan , as she dried her hands and took the fish . " Just loike my Pat used to catch afore he was kilt on the railroad . " " I caught them this afternoon , so you can be sure they are fresh . " " I 'm much obliged to ye , I am indade , " said Mrs. Gilligan . She drew a long breath . " Sure an ' the Lord is good to us after all . I was just afther thinkin ' I had nothin ' but throuble , whin in comes these iligant fish . " " Is something wrong ? " asked Randy , curiously . " It 's not a great dale , yet it 's enough fer a poor woman loike me . It 's Mrs. Bangs ' wash , so it is . Nothin ' suits that lady , an ' she always wants to pay less than she agreed . " " You mean Bob Bangs ' mother ? " " Th ' same , Randy . Oh , they are a hard-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And yet Mr. Bangs is rich . " " It 's little enough I see of his money , " sighed Mrs. Gilligan . " Although I do me besht wid the washin ' an ' ironin ' , so I do ! " " It 's a wonder Mrs. Bangs do n't make the servant do the washing and ironing . " " She did make the other wan do that same . But the new one ca n't iron an ' wo n't try , so I have the work , an ' the girrul gits less wages , " answered the Irishwoman . When Randy returned home he found supper almost ready . The appetizing odor of frying fish filled the air . A few minutes later Mr. Thompson came in . Louis Thompson was a man a little past middle age , tall and thin and not unlike Randy in the general appearance of his face . He was not a strong man , and the winter before had been laid up with a severe attack of rheumatism . " That smells good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . " I like fish . " " Randy just caught them . " " Good enough . " " You look tired , Louis , " went on Mrs. Thompson . " Was the work extra hard ? " " Not much harder than usual , Lucy , but I was working on a cellar partition and it was very damp . It brought back a bit of the rheumatism . " " That is too bad . " " Ca n't the boss give you something else to do -- something where it is n't damp ? " questioned Randy . " I have asked him about it , " answered his father . " But just at present there is nothing else in sight . " " You must take care , Louis , " said Mrs. Thompson . " It will not do to risk having the rheumatism come back . " " I wish I could get something to do , " said Randy , while the evening meal was in progress . " I might earn some money and it would help . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Riverport . " " Times are rather dull , " answered Mr. Thompson . " And I am afraid they will be worse before they are better . " On the following day Randy went out after blackberries . Jack went with him and the boys went up the stream in the latter 's boat . " If I can get a good mess mother is going to preserve some , " said Randy . " I like blackberry jam , " answered his friend . The two boys had brought their lunch with them , intending to remain out all day . By noon they had picked twelve quarts of berries and then sat down by the river side to eat their lunch . " What do you say to a swim ? " remarked Jack , after the meal was over . " Just the thing ! " cried our hero . " But we must n't remain in longer than half an hour . I want to pick more berries . " They were soon in the water , which was deliciously cool and refreshing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced from one bank to the other and back . Randy won the race by several seconds . " I declare , Randy , you are a regular water rat ! " declared Jack . " I never saw a better swimmer . " " Well , I do love the water , that is certain , " answered Randy . " And you row such a good stroke , too . " " That 's because I love boats . " The half-hour at an end , our hero leaped ashore and began to don his garments , and Jack did the same . They were just finishing their toilet when a rowboat came into view , containing Bob Bangs and several other of the loud boys of Riverport . " There is Bob Bangs again , " whispered Randy . " We 'll have to watch out that he does n't try to rob us of our berries , " whispered Jack , significantly . " Humph ! Up here again , eh ? " remarked the big youth , resting on his oars . " We are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we please . " " Certainly -- for all I care , " growled Bob . " We are picking berries , and we intend to watch them , too , " put in Randy , loudly . At this pointed remark Bob Bangs colored slightly . " I should think you 'd pick your company , Jack Bartlett , " he said , coarsely . " I do . That is why I am not with you . " " Humph ! " " I consider myself just as good as you , Bob Bangs , " said Randy , warmly . " I may not be as rich , but I never tried to steal a mess of fish from anybody . " " You shut up ! " roared the big boy . And then he started to row away . " You 'll not get a chance to rob us of these berries , " called out Jack after him . " What do they mean about robbing somebody of fish ? " asked one of Bob 's companions . " Oh , that was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait -- I 'll fix them for it ! " As soon as Bangs and his cronies had disappeared Randy and Jack went back to their berry picking . They worked steadily until five o'clock in the afternoon , and by that time had a great number of quarts to their credit . " The folks at home will be pleased , " said Jack . " My mother loves fresh berries . She says they are much better than those which are several days in the market . " " And she is right . " The boys had brought along several large and small kettles , and had left three of these down near the boat , filled with the fruit . Each walked to the shore with a kettle full of berries in his hand . " Well , I never ! " cried Jack , in dismay . " Bob Bangs again ! " murmured Randy . " Oh , do n't I just wish I had him here . I 'd pummel him good ! " There was good cause for our hero 's anger . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all directions and many of them crushed under foot . " And look at the boat ! " gasped Jack , turning to inspect the craft . The rowboat was partly filled with water and on the seats and in the bottom a quantity of mud had been thrown . The oars were sticking in a mud bank close by . " Does she leak ? " asked our hero , with concern . " I 'll have to find out . " It was soon discovered that the craft was intact , and then they set to work to clean up the muss . This was no easy job , and the boys perspired freely , for the day was a warm one . Then Randy looked over the scattered berries . " About one-third of them are fit to take along , " he said . " The others are crushed and dirty . " " I 'll tell you what I am going to do , " said Jack , stoutly . " I am going to make Bob Bangs pay for dirtying my boat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But how can we prove he is guilty ? " " We 'll make him own up to it . Nobody else would play such a mean trick . " The two boys were in no happy frame of mind as they rowed back to Riverport . They suspected that Bob Bangs would keep out of their sight , but just as they were landing they caught sight of him peering at them from behind a dock building . " There he is ! " cried Jack . " After him , Randy ! " " Right you are ! " answered our hero , and ran after Bob Bangs with might and main . Randy was a good sprinter and although the rich youth tried to get away he was soon brought to a halt . " Let go of me ! " he roared , as Randy caught him by the collar . " Not just yet , Bob Bangs ! " returned Randy . " A fine trick you played this afternoon . " " I did n't play any trick ! " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go ! " And now Bob Bangs did his best to get away . He saw that Randy and Jack were thoroughly angry and was afraid he was in for a drubbing -- or worse . He gave a jerk and then started to run . Randy put out his foot and the big youth went sprawling full length , his face violently striking the ground . CHAPTER V THE RESULT OF A QUARREL If any boy was ever humiliated it was Bob Bangs . His face and hands were covered with dust and so was his elegant suit of clothing , while the skin was cut on the side of his nose . " Now , see what you have done ! " he spluttered , gazing ruefully at himself . " My suit is just about ruined ! " " And it serves you right , Bob Bangs , " came warmly from Jack . " That is what you get for trying to run away , " added our hero . " I 'll have the law on you , Randy Thompson ! " " Maybe I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had no right to throw me down in that fashion . " " Then why did you start to run away ? " " Because I did n't want to stay here -- and you had no right to stop me . " " We wanted to know about this berry affair , " said Jack . " And about the dirty boat . " " I do n't know what you are talking about , " answered the big boy , but his face showed his concern . " You put mud in my boat and spilled our berries . " " Who says I did that ? " " We know you did . " " Did you see us ? " " No , but we know you did it and nobody else . " " You ca n't prove it , " answered Bob , and now his face showed a sign of relief . He had been afraid that there had been a witness of his evil-doing . " Perhaps we can , " said Randy . " Bob Bangs , I think you are the meanest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't care what you think , Randy Thompson . Who are you , anyway ? The son of a poor carpenter . Why , you have n't got a decent suit of clothing to your back ! " " For shame , Bob ! " broke in Jack . " Randy is a good fellow , even if he is poor . " " Well , if you think he is so good you can go with him . But I do n't want to associate with such a low fellow , " went on the big youth , as he started to brush himself off with a silk handkerchief . " So I am a low fellow , am I ? " said Randy , in a steady voice , and coming up close to Bob , who promptly began to back away . " Ye -- as , you -- you are , " stammered the rich youth . " I 've a good mind to knock you down for saying it , Bob Bangs . I am not as low as you . " " Humph ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . It was a mean , contemptible trick that you played on Jack and me . By right you ought to be made to scrub out the boat and pay for the berries you spoiled . " " Bah ! I wo n't touch the boat , and I wo n't pay a cent . " " Then you admit that you are guilty ? " " I admit that I had some fun , at your expense , yes , " answered Bob Bangs . " You ca n't do anything to me , though , for you ca n't prove it against me . " " That means , if you were brought up into court , you would lie about it , " said Randy . " Humph ! You need n't get so personal , Randy Thompson . " " For two pins , do you know what I would do , Bob Bangs ? " " What ? " " I 'd give you a good thrashing , " and Randy pulled up his sleeves , as if he meant to begin operations at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch me ! " gasped the rich boy , in alarm . " If you do , I'll -- I 'll have the law on you ! " " And we 'll have the law on you . " Bob Bangs was more alarmed than ever . He saw that Randy was ready to pitch into him on the instant . He looked around , saw an opening , and darted away at his best speed . " Let him go -- the big coward , " called out Jack , for Randy had started after the rich boy . " We can settle with him another time . " " What a mean chap ! " cried Randy . " I never saw his equal , never ! " Bob Bangs ran a distance of several rods . Then , seeing a clod of dirt lying in the road , he picked it up and hurled it at the boys . He was not a good thrower , but as luck would have it the clod struck Randy on the shoulder , some of the dirt spattering up into his ear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " sang out the rich boy , gleefully . " And this is the time you are going to get it , " returned Randy , and made a dash after him . Seeing this , Jack followed after the pair . Illustration : RANDY CAUGHT BOB BANGS BY THE ARM AND THREW HIM OVER . Bob Bangs could run and fear lent speed to his flying feet . But he was no match for Randy , who had on more than one occasion won a running match amongst his schoolfellows . Bob started for home , several blocks away , but just before he reached his gate Randy came near to him , caught him by the arm and flung him over on his side . Then , to hold him down , our hero seated himself on top of the rich boy , who began to bellow lustily . " Get off of me ! " " I will not ! " " You are squeezing the wind out of me ! " " What right had you to throw that chunk of dirt at me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am only fooling , too . " " You are breaking my ribs ! Oh , let up , I say ! " " Are you sorry for what you did ? " demanded Randy . To this Bob Bangs made no reply . " I see you 've got him , " said Jack , running up at that instant . " Yes , and I am going to give it to him good , " answered Randy . " Let up ! Help , somebody ! Help ! " roared Bob , badly frightened . He began to kick and struggle , but Randy held him down and as a consequence he was covered with dust and dirt from head to foot . In the midst of the melee a carriage came along the roadway . It contained Mrs. Bangs and the man-of-all-work , who was driving . " Mercy on us ! What does this mean ? " burst from the fashionable lady 's lips . " Can that be Robert ? " " Help ! help ! " roared the rich youth , more lustily than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mrs. Bangs . " John , stop the carriage . You rude boy , let my son alone ! " she went on , in her shrill , hard voice . " Hullo , here is Mrs. Bangs , " remarked Jack , looking around and discovering the new arrival . For the instant Randy did not see the rich woman and continued to hold down Bob , who struggled violently , sending up a cloud of dust in the road . Then he noticed the carriage and looked up , and his face fell . " You scamp ! Leave my boy alone ! " screamed Mrs. Bangs . " Oh , John , perhaps you had better run for a policeman ! " she added , as Randy let go his hold and arose . " You had better not , Mrs. Bangs , " said Jack . " Bob deserves what he is getting . " " I do not believe it ! It is disgraceful to throw him down in the road like this , " stormed the fashionable lady . " He hit Randy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing ! " howled Bob , as he got up . He was too ruffled to think of his bad grammar . " And that elegant suit is about ruined , " went on Mrs. Bangs . " I never heard of such doings before . Boy , " she went on , looking at Randy , " you ought to be locked up ! " " It is Bob ought to be locked up , " retorted Randy . " He started this trouble ; I did n't . " " I do not believe it . My son is a gentleman . " " I did n't do a thing , " put in the rich boy , feeling safe , now that his mother and the hired man were on the scene . " They pitched into me for nothing at all . " " Bob knows better than that , " said Jack . " Yesterday he tried to steal some fish we caught , and to-day he mussed up Jack 's boat and ruined some berries that both of us had picked , " explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he threw the mud at me . Then I chased him and caught him , as you saw . " " Preposterous ! My boy would not steal ! " said Mrs. Bangs , tartly . She looked meaningly at Jack . " I presume you and your family are very bitter against us now , " she added , significantly . " Bitter against you ? " said Jack , puzzled . " Yes -- because of that iron works affair . " " I do n't know anything about that , Mrs. Bangs . " " Oh , then you have n't heard yet . " The fashionable woman was nonplussed . " Never mind . You must leave Robert alone . " " Ai n't you going to get that policeman and lock them up ? " asked the son , anxiously . " If I am locked up , you 'll be locked up , too , " said Randy . " And the charge against you will be stealing as well as malicious mischief . " " Yes , and we 'll prove our case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses we have . " At this announcement Bob Bangs ' face grew pale . " Yo -- you ca n't prove anything , " he faltered . " You do n't know about that , " said Randy , taking his cue from Jack . " I will look into this affair later -- just now I have no time , " said Mrs. Bangs , after an awkward pause . " Robert , you had better go into the house and clean yourself up . John , you can drive on . " And then , while the fashionable woman was driven into her grounds , her son lost no time in sneaking off into the house . As he entered the door he turned and shook his fist at our hero and Jack . " Jack , I do n't think we have heard the last of this , " remarked Randy , as he and his companion started away . " Perhaps not , but I think we have the best of it , " answered Jack . " I do n't know about that . Mrs. Bangs is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'd like to know what she meant about the iron works matter , " went on Jack , with a troubled look on his face . " I hope Mr. Bangs has n't got the best of father in that deal . " " You had better ask your father when you get home . " " I will . " The two lads hurried back to the boat and placed the craft where it belonged . Then the berries were divided , and each started for his home little dreaming of the trouble that was in store for both of them . CHAPTER VI THE IRON WORKS AFFAIR When Jack arrived at home he took the berries around to the kitchen and then hurried upstairs to the bathroom , to wash and fix up for supper . He was in the midst of his ablutions when he heard his father come in and go to the library . An animated talk between his two parents followed . " Something unusual is up , " thought Jack , and went below as soon as he was fixed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head resting on his hand . His face looked careworn . Mrs. Bartlett sat by an open window clasping her hands tightly . Their earnest talk came to a sudden end as Jack entered . " Good-evening , father and mother , " said the boy and then halted . " Maybe I was interrupting you , " he added . " Jack may as well know , " said Mrs. Bartlett , looking meaningly at her husband . " I suppose so , " answered Mr. Bartlett , and gave a long sigh . " Know what ? " asked Jack . " Your father has had trouble at the iron works , " answered his mother . " What kind of trouble ? " " It is the Bangs affair , " answered Mr. Bartlett . " You know a little about that already . Well , Amos Bangs has forced me into a corner . " " What do you mean by that , father ? " " He has gained control of the company and is going to consolidate with the Springfield concern . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal , I am afraid , Jack . In the past I have known all that was going on . Now I will have to rely on Amos Bangs -- and I do not care to do that . " " Do n't you think he is honest ? " " Privately , I do not , although I should not care to say so in public . He and his friends at Springfield are sharpers . They will squeeze what they can out of the new concern , and I am afraid I shall be left out in the cold . " " Well , I should n't trust Mr. Bangs myself . He and his son are of a stripe , and I know only too well now what Bob is . " " Have you had trouble with Bob ? " questioned Mrs. Bartlett , quickly . " Yes , " answered Jack , and gave the particulars . " How Bob will crow over me now ! " he went on , ruefully . " This will make Bangs harder on me than ever , " remarked Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " cried Jack . " I am sure you have trouble enough already ! " " The Bangses are a hard family to get along with , " said Mrs. Bartlett . " I have heard that from several who work for them . " " The men at the office are sorry to see Amos Bangs in control , " said Mr. Bartlett . " They know he will drive them more than I have ever driven them , and he will never raise their wages . " " Are you going to leave the company 's office , father ? " " Yes . I am no longer an officer , only a stockholder . " " The company ought to give you a position . " " Bangs said I could be a timekeeper , at fifteen dollars per week . " " How mean ! And what will his salary be ? " " I do n't know yet -- probably a hundred and fifty per week -- seven or eight thousand per year . " " And you 've been getting sixty dollars per week , have n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go elsewhere . " " That is what I shall do -- if I can find any opening . What I am worried about mostly is the capital I have in the iron works , fifteen thousand dollars . I am afraid Bangs will , sooner or later , wipe me out , and do it in such a way that I can not sue him to advantage . " " It 's an outrage ! " " The trouble is , I trusted him too much from the start . He has proved to be a snake in the grass . " " And Bob is exactly like him , " said Jack . The family talked the matter over all during the supper hour and for some time later . The prospect ahead was a dark one and Mrs. Bartlett sighed deeply . " If you can not get an opening elsewhere I do not know what we are to do , " said she to her husband . " I 'll get something , " he replied , bravely . " And remember , I have a thousand dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't last long , Philip , after once you begin to use it up . " " That is true . " " Have you anything definite in view ? " " Not exactly . I am going to write to my friend Mason , in Albany . He may be able to get me something to do at the iron works there . He is in charge . " " Well , I hope it is better than the place Amos Bangs offered you . " " There is only one trouble , " went on Mr. Bartlett . " If I get work at Albany we will have to move to that city . " " Well , we can do that . " " Yes , but I hate to go away from Riverport . I wanted to watch Bangs . " " You might go to Albany every Monday and come home Saturday night , at least for a time . " " Yes , I might do that , " answered Philip Bartlett . On the following morning he went down to the iron works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos Bangs ahead of him , and sorting out some papers at one of the desks . " Morning , " said Amos Bangs , curtly . " Good-morning , " answered Mr. Bartlett . " Mr. Bangs , what are you doing at this desk ? " " Sorting out things . " " Do you not know that this is my private desk ? " " Is it ? I thought it belonged to the iron company , " answered Amos Bangs with a sneer . " The desk does belong to the company , but at present it contains my private papers as well as some papers of the company . " " Well , it is going to be my desk after this , I 'll thank you to take your personal things away . " " You seem to be in a hurry to get me out . " " I want to get to work here . Things have dragged long enough . I am going to make them hum . " " I am glad to hear it , " answered Philip Bartlett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends on our stock next year . " " Well -- er -- I do n't know about that . We have got to make improvements and they will cost money . " " You did n't want any improvements when I was in charge . " " That was a different thing . The old concern was a small-fry affair . We are going to make the new concern something worth while , " answered Amos Bangs , loftily . " I hope you do -- for my sake as well as for the sake of the other stockholders . But what salaries are the new officers to have ? " " That is to be decided later . " " I trust all the profits are not eaten up by the salaries . " " You can not expect talented men -- like myself , for instance -- to work for low salaries . " " You used to be willing to work for fifty dollars a week . " " Those days are past . But I can not waste time talking now . Clean out the desk and turn it over to me , " concluded Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Bartlett set about the task before him . He was much attached to the iron works and hated to leave it . Presently his brow grew troubled . " Mr. Bangs ! " he called . " What do you want now ? " " Did you see anything of some papers with a broad rubber band around them ? " " Did n't see anything but what is there . " " I had some private papers . They seem to be gone . " " I did n't take them , " answered Amos Bangs , coldly . " It is queer where they can be , " went on Philip Bartlett . " Well , I have n't got them . " Philip Bartlett hunted high and low for the missing documents , but without success . Then he cleaned out the desk , put his personal things in a package , said good-by to his former employees , and quit the office . " I am well rid of him , " said Amos Bangs , to himself . " And I am glad I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal with Shaster and turn the work over to the Springfield concern -- and make some money ! " CHAPTER VII MORE TROUBLES FOR RANDY Two days passed quietly , and Randy did not see or hear anything more of Bob Bangs . Then he learned through Jack that Mrs. Bangs had gone off on a summer trip , taking her son with her . " I hear there are great changes at the iron works , " said Randy , to his friend . " Mr. Bangs , they say , is in charge . " " He is , and father is out of it , " answered Jack , bitterly . " That is what Mrs. Bangs meant when she said I must be bitter against the family . " " Is your father out of it entirely , Jack ? " " Yes , so far as holding a position is concerned . He still has his stock . But he is afraid that wo n't be worth much , if Amos Bangs runs the concern . " " What is your father going to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect with some other iron works . " " I hope he strikes something good . " " So do I , Randy . " " I wish I could get something to do , too , " went on Randy . " You mean during the summer ? " " Yes , and maybe later , too . " " Why , is n't your father working ? " " Not to-day . He has been working in a damp cellar and that brought on his old complaint , rheumatism . He suffers something awful with it . He ought to have a long rest . " " He certainly ought not to work in a cellar . " " He has already told his boss he could n't go at it again , " answered Randy . " Have you had a doctor ? " " Yes , Doctor Case came this morning . " " What does he say ? " " He says rheumatism is hard to cure and that my father will have to take care of himself , " answered Randy . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must get some things for mother at the store . " What Randy said about his father was true . Louis Thompson was suffering very much . He rested on a couch in the sitting room of the cottage , and his wife did what she could to relieve his pain . Several days passed and the rheumatism , instead of growing better , became worse , so that neither Mrs. Thompson nor Randy knew what to do for the sufferer . Then Mr. Thompson 's side began to draw up , and in haste a specialist from the city was called in . He gave some relief , but said it would be a long time before the sufferer would be able to go to work again . " You must keep off your left leg , " said the specialist . A few days after that Louis Thompson tried to walk . But the pain was so great he could not stand on the rheumatic limb . He sank on his couch with a groan . " I can not do it , " he gasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I must get to work , Lucy . I can not afford to be idle . " " Never mind , Louis ; we will get along somehow . " " How much did that specialist charge ? " " Fifty dollars ? " " And what was Doctor Case 's bill ? " " Ten dollars . " " Sixty dollars ! And we had only ninety dollars in the bank ! That leaves us only thirty dollars . " To this Mrs. Thompson did not answer . She had used up nearly ten dollars for medicines , but did not wish to worry her suffering husband by mentioning it . " If I do n't go to work we 'll all starve to death ! " continued Louis Thompson . " We 'll manage somehow , " answered the wife , bravely . Nevertheless , she was much discouraged , and that evening , when her husband was asleep , she and Randy talked the matter over as they sat on the porch in the darkness . " Mother , " said Randy , earnestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have labored so long for me that it is now my turn . I only want something to do . " " My dear child , " said the mother , " I do not need to be assured of your willingness . But I am sorry that you should be compelled to give up your vacation and maybe your schooling . " " Giving up schooling will not be necessary . I can study in the evenings . I am wondering what I can find to do . " " I know so little about such things , Randy , that we must consult someone who is better qualified to give advice in the matter -- your Uncle Peter , for instance . " At this Randy gave a sigh . " I do n't know Uncle Peter . He never comes here . " " That is true , " answered Mrs. Thompson , with some hesitation . " But you know he is a business man and has a great deal to attend to . Besides , he has married a lady who is exceedingly fashionable , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such unfashionable folks as we are . " " Then , " said Randy , indignantly , " I do n't want to trouble him with any of my applications . If he does n't think us good enough to visit we wo n't force ourselves upon him . " " My dear boy , you are too excitable . It may be that it is only his business engagements that have kept him away from us . Besides , you can go to him only for advice ; it is quite different from asking assistance . " Mother and son discussed the situation for fully an hour and at last , in the absence of other plans , it was decided that Randy should go to his uncle the next day and make known his wants . Mr. Thompson was told , early in the morning , and said Randy could do as he thought best . " But do n't expect too much from your Uncle Peter , " said the sick man . Peter Thompson was an elder brother to Randy 's father . Early in life he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in mercantile pursuits . At the age of twenty-eight he had married a dashing lady , who was more noted for her fashionable pretensions than for any attractive qualities of the heart . She was now at the head of a very showy establishment , far more pretentious than that over which Mrs. Bangs presided . She knew little about her husband 's relations and cared still less . The town of Riverport was twenty miles distant from Deep Haven , where Peter Thompson resided with his family . A boat ran daily between these places and several others , but Randy did not wish to spend the necessary fare , and so borrowed a bicycle from Jack and made the trip by way of the river road , a safe if not very comfortable highway . Randy had been to Deep Haven several times in years gone by , but , strange as it may seem , had never gone near his uncle 's residence . But he knew where the house was located -- a fine brick affair , with a swell front -- and leaning his bicycle against a tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's wanted ? " demanded the servant who answered the summons , and she looked Randy over in a supercilious manner , not at all impressed by the modest manner in which he was attired . " Is Uncle Peter at home ? " asked Randy , politely . " Who 's Uncle Peter ? " " Mr. Peter Thompson ? " " No , he is n't . " " Where is he ? " " At his store , I expect . " " Is Mrs. Thompson at home ? " " I do n't know . I 'll see . Who shall I say wants to see her ? " " Randy Thompson . " Randy was left standing in the elegantly furnished hallway while the servant departed . He could not help but contrast such elegance with his own modest home . " Come into the drawing room , " said the servant , briefly , on returning , and ushered him into the finest apartment he had ever entered . Here he was kept waiting for fully quarter of an hour . Then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and fixed a cold stare upon our hero . " Are you my aunt ? " he asked , somewhat disconcerted by his chilling reception . " Really , I could n't say -- not having seen you before , " she answered . " My name is Randy Thompson . I am the son of Louis Thompson , of Riverport . " " Ah , I see . " The woman said no more , but seemed to await developments . Randy was greatly embarrassed . His aunt 's coldness repelled him , and he easily saw that he was not a welcome visitor . A touch of pride came to him and he resolved that he would be as unsociable as his relative . " What can he want of me ? " thought the woman . As Randy said nothing more she grew tired of the stillness and drew herself up once more . " You must excuse me this morning , " she said . " I am particularly engaged . I suppose you know where your uncle 's store is . You will probably find him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show our hero to the door . He was glad to get out into the open air once more . " So that is Aunt Grace , " he mused . " Well , I do n't know as I shall ever wish to call upon her again . She is as bad as an iceberg for freezing a fellow . No wonder she and mother have never become friends . " CHAPTER VIII RANDY AND HIS UNCLE PETER From his uncle 's home Randy rode on his bicycle to Peter Thompson 's store -- a fairly large concern , the largest , in fact , in Deep Haven . He found his uncle behind a desk in the rear , busy over some accounts . For several minutes he paid no attention to his visitor . Then he stuck his pen behind his ear and gave Randy a sharp look . " How do you do , Uncle Peter ? " said the youth . " Why -- er -- who is this ? " stammered Peter Thompson . " I do n't seem to quite know you . " " I am Randy Thompson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger brother Louis ' son , I believe . " " Yes , sir . " " I remember you now . " Peter Thompson held out a flabby and cold hand . " Come to town on business , I suppose . " " In a way , yes , sir . Father is down with rheumatism . " " Hum ! Did n't take proper care of himself , I suppose . " " He had to work in a cellar and that put him in bed . " " And you have come to ask help , I suppose . " Peter Thompson 's face dropped quickly . " I am sorry , but my family expenses are very large , and trade is dull . If I were able --  --  " " You are mistaken , " said Randy , a flush mounting to his brow . " I do not come for assistance . I am old enough to work , if I only knew what to do . Mother told me to come to you for advice . " Peter Thompson looked relieved when he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he regarded the youth more favorably than he had done . " Ah , that 's well , " he said , rubbing his flabby hands together . " I like your independence . Now , let me see . " He scratched his head . " Do you know anything about horses ? " " No , sir ; but perhaps I could learn . " " The livery-stable keeper wants a boy , but he must know all about horses . " " How much would he pay a week ? " " Two dollars at the start . " " That would not be enough for me . " " I might get you in some store in the city , " continued Peter Thompson . " Would you like that ? " " If it paid , yes . " " It would pay but little the first year . But you would gain a valuable experience . " " I can not afford that , Uncle Peter . I must earn something at once , to support our family . " " Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storekeeper , with a shrug of his shoulders . " There are very few things that boys of your age can do , and it is so easy to obtain boys that people are not willing to pay much in wages . " Randy looked crestfallen and his uncle embarrassed . The merchant feared that he might be compelled by the world 's opinion to aid his brother and his family . But suddenly an idea struck him . " Do you know anything about farming ? " he inquired . " Yes , sir , " said Randy ; " a little . " " I ask for this reason , " pursued Mr. Thompson . " When your grandfather died he left to me a small farm in Riverport . It is not very good and has been used mostly as a pasture . I have been so occupied with other things that I could not look after it . Perhaps you may know something of it . " " Yes , sir , I do . It is about half a mile from our house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it belonged to you . " " It does . What I was going to say is that , although I am unable to give you such assistance as I should like , I will , if you wish it , give you the use of that lot , and the little cottage on it , rent-free so long as you care to use it . Perhaps you can put it to some use . Anyway , you can use the cottage . " Randy 's face lighted up , much to his uncle 's satisfaction . The land was not extra good and the cottage all but tumbled down , yet it was better than nothing . They could move out of the cottage in which they were now located , and thus save the monthly rent , which was eight dollars . Besides that , Randy felt that he could do something with the garden , even though it was rather late in the season . Where they now lived there was little room to grow vegetables . " You are sure you do n't want to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not at all . You can use it as long as you please . " " Maybe you would like to sell it . " " Ahem ! If you wish to buy it you can make an offer after you are on the place . I once offered it to a man for two hundred dollars , but he would not take me up . " " Then you will sell it for two hundred dollars ? " " I will sell it to you , or rather your father , for a hundred and fifty dollars . " " I 'll remember that , sir . It may be that we will like the place so much we shall want to buy -- if we can raise the money . " " You can pay off the amount at the rate of fifty dollars per year if you wish . " " Thank you . You are kind and I appreciate it , " and Randy meant what he said . Peter Thompson looked at the clock . " I must go to dinner now . Will you dine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accepted the offer , but he remembered the reception his aunt had given him and so declined . " I think I had better get back to Riverport , " he said . " I will tell mother and father about the twelve-acre lot and see what they have to say about it . " " Very well . " " Would you mind giving me a slip of paper so that we can prove we have a right to occupy the place ? " pursued Randy . " Some folks may try to dispute our right . I know one man who pastures cows there . " " He has no right to do so . Here , I will give you a paper in due form . " Whatever his other shortcomings , Peter Thompson was not a slipshod business man . He drew up a paper in due form , stating that his brother could occupy the little farm for five years , rent-free , and if he wished to do so could at any time in said five years buy the little farm for one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars per year , without interest . " And now good-by and good luck to you , " said he as he handed the paper to Randy . " Some day , if I can get the time , I may call upon you . But I rarely go away from home . " Randy shook hands and left , and in a minute more was riding home on the bicycle . " Well , I think I 've gained something , " he thought , as he sped along . " Anyway , we will have a roof over our heads and that is something . To be sure , the cottage is a poor one , but poor folks ca n't have everything as they want it . " When the boy arrived home he found his father had had another bad turn but was now resting easier . Without delay he told of what had happened at Deep Haven . " Your aunt is a Tartar , " said Louis Thompson . " I never liked her , and that is why I and your Uncle Peter have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to Jerry Borden , who pastures his cows there . " " Jerry Borden will have to get out -- that is , if we take possession , " said Randy . " Mother , what do you think of it ? " " Is the cottage usable ? I have not seen it for a year or more . " " It will have to be fixed up some . But I am sure I can do the work , with father 's tools . " " It will save the rent money . " " And I can plant a garden , even if it is late . And we can keep some chickens , and then , after everything is in shape , I can again look for outside work . " " Randy 's idea is a good one , " answered the boy 's father . " Our month will be up here next week . I 'll notify the owner at once about leaving . " The next morning Randy went over to the twelve-acre farm , a corner of which sloped down to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was with an entirely different feeling that he surveyed it now . It was pasture land , naturally good , but much neglected . A great many stones needed to be removed and the fences wanted propping up and here and there a new rail . The house , which faced a little side road , was a story and a half in height , with two rooms below and two chambers above . There was a well that needed fixing and also a cistern . Around the cottage the weeds grew high , and one of the windows was out and a door was missing . " I can fix this place up , I am sure of it , " said the boy to himself . He was making a mental note of what was to be done when he heard a noise on the road and saw a farmer approaching , driving a dozen cows before him . It was Jerry Borden , the man who had been using the pasture lot without paying for it . " Hullo ! What air you a-doin ' here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surprise . " We are going to move over here , Mr. Borden , " answered Randy , calmly . " Move over here ! " ejaculated the farmer . " Yes . " " In this air tumble-down cottage ? " " I am going to fix it up some . " " Well , I vow ! It ai n't fit to live in ! " " It will be . " " An ' the land ai n't wuth shucks . " " It seems to be good enough for the cows . " At this Jerry Borden 's face fell a little . " If you air a-goin ' to move in , I guess thet means I 'm to move out , " he ventured . " It does , unless --  --  " Randy paused , struck by a sudden idea . " Unless what ? " asked the farmer , eagerly . He wanted to use the lot very much , for he was short of pasturing on his own farm . " Unless we can come to some sort of an agreement for milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the whole lot , but you might use part of it . " " Did the owner say you could use the place ? " " Yes , we have it down in writing . We are to use it for five years and then we can buy it if we wish . " " I see . " The farmer scratched his head . " Well , I du n no . Maybe we could let ye have butter an ' milk . One thing is certain , I 've got to have pasturin ' . " " We could fence off part of the lot in some way and you could use that . " " Thet 's so . " " Besides that , I 'll want some plowing done . I may have to hire you for that , " pursued Randy . " I must say I like your spunk , Randy . I sha n't charge ye a cent fer plowin ' . " After that the farmer and our hero talked matters over for half an hour , and the farmer told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the season . Then Randy went home , feeling that the family was going to make a good move . CHAPTER IX THE NEW HOME The next few days were busy ones for Mrs. Thompson and for Randy . The landlord of the cottage in which they lived was notified that they were going to move , and then the woman set to work to get ready to vacate , while Randy went over to the other place to put the house in condition for occupancy . While Randy was at work Jack came to see him , and insisted upon lending a helping hand . Randy had brought over some of his father 's tools and also some nails , and he purchased at the lumber yard a few boards and other pieces he thought he needed . When he once got at it , it was astonishing how well our hero used the tools , making several repairs that would have done credit to a regular carpenter . The broken window was replaced , and the missing door found and rehung , and several clapboards nailed fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shingles on the roof . This done , the chimney was cleaned out and also the cistern , and the well was also overhauled . In the meantime Jack pulled out a lot of weeds and trained a wild honeysuckle over the porch . At the end of four days the place looked quite well . " It 's a hundred per cent . better than it was , " declared Jack . " It did n't look like anything before . " " I 'll get a can of paint to-morrow and paint the door and the window frames , " said Randy , and this was done . He also whitewashed the kitchen , and kalsomined the other rooms , so that the interior of the cottage was sweet and clean . When Mrs. Thompson saw the change which had been wrought she was delighted . " I declare , it looks as well , if not better , than the cottage we are in , " she cried . " And the outlook toward the river is ever so much nicer . " " Just wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You wo n't know the spot . " " What a pity we did not know of this place before . " " Mother , I think we ought to buy it if we can . " " Perhaps we shall , Randy , before the five years are up . " At length came the day to move . A local truckman who knew Mr. Thompson well moved them for nothing . " You can do some odd jobs for me some time , " said the truckman to Louis Thompson . " Thank you , I will -- when I am able , " answered the sufferer . A good deal of the pain had left Mr. Thompson , but he was weak , and to start to regular work was out of the question . Another friend took him to his new cottage in a carriage . He gazed at the old place in wonder . " Well , it certainly is improved ! " he ejaculated . " We shall get along here very well . " The moving was done early in the morning and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . The stove was set up and found to draw good , and the water from the well tasted fine . " Now there is one thing certain , " said Randy , " Mother , come what may , we shall have a roof over our heads . " " Yes , my son , and I am grateful for it , " answered Mrs. Thompson . " Uncle Peter may be a hard man to get along with , but he has certainly helped us . " The next two weeks were busy ones for Randy . Jerry Borden was true to his promise and not only did some plowing for the Thompsons but also helped Randy to put up a new fence , partly of stone and partly of rails . It was agreed that Borden should have the use of part of the little farm for pasturing , and in return was to give the Thompsons two quarts of milk a day and two pounds of butter per week , and also a dozen fresh eggs a week while the hens were laying . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson . " Butter , eggs , and milk are quite an item of expense . " " And that is not all , " said Randy . " I am going to help Mr. Borden with his haying soon and he is going to pay us in early vegetables . " The haying time was already at hand , and Randy soon pitched in with a will , much to his neighbor 's satisfaction . One day Jack came to bring good news . His father had secured a position with an iron works at Albany , on the Hudson River . " It will pay him a fair salary , " said Jack . " I am glad to hear it , " answered Randy . " What will your family do , remain here or move to Albany ? " " We are going to remain here for the present , but , if the place suits father after he has been there a while , then we 'll move . " " Have you learned anything more about the Bangses ? " " Mrs. Bangs and Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that . I meant Mr. Bangs . " " He is in full charge at the iron works here and drawing a salary of eight thousand dollars a year . Father says he will run the works into the ground so that the stock wo n't be worth a cent . " " Ca n't your father do anything ? " " Not yet . But he is going to watch things . There was some trouble over a contract and he is trying to get to the bottom of that , " continued Jack . When Randy went to work for Farmer Borden he came into contact with the farmer 's son Sammy , a tall , overgrown lad of fourteen , with a freckled face and a shock of red hair . Sammy hated to work , and his father and mother had to fairly drive him to get anything out of him . " City folks do n't work like farmers , " remarked Sammy to Randy . " They jest lay off an ' take it easy . " " How do you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Cos I once read a paper of the sports in the city . " " Some rich folks do n't work , Sammy . But all the others work as hard as we do . " " I do n't believe it , " said Sammy , stoutly . " Wish I was a city lad . Oh , would n't I jest have the bang-up time , though ! " " Sammy Borden ! " cried his mother , shrilly . " You get to work , an ' be quick about it . " " I 'm tired , " answered the freckled-faced lad . " Tired ? Lazy , you mean ! Git to work , or I 'll have your paw give you a dressin ' down ! " " Drat the luck ! " muttered Sammy , as he took up his pitchfork . " I wish I was born in the city ! " " Come on , Sammy , " said Randy . " The work has got to be done , so do n't think about it , but do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Randy Thompson ! But it comes hard on me ! " And Sammy heaved a ponderous sigh . The haying was in full blast early in July and Randy worked early and late . He wanted to get through , so that he might go at his own garden . Sammy dragged worse than ever , and finally confided to our hero that he wanted to go to the city over the Fourth . " Have you asked your folks yet ? " asked Randy . " No , but I 'm a-goin ' to , " answered Sammy . " Well , if you go , I hope you have a good time , " said our hero . " I 'd like to see a Fourth of July in the city myself . I 've heard they make a good deal of noise , but I should n't mind that . " " Gosh ! I love shootin ' , " said Sammy . " Are n't you afraid you might get lost ? " pursued Randy . " Lost ! " snorted Sammy . " Not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , much less in the city . " " The city and the woods are two different places . " " I do n't care . I 'd know what I was doin ' . " " It costs money to go to the city . " " I want to go to Springfield . " " Have you any money saved up ? " To this Sammy did not answer . Then Mr. Borden came along . " Sammy , get to work ! " he called out . " Do n't let Randy do everything . " " I was workin ' , " grumbled the son , as he started in again . " You ca n't expect a feller like me to pitch hay all day long . " " I have to work all day , " retorted his father . " It ai n't fair nohow . " " If you want to eat you 'll have to work . " Sammy pitched in , but grumbled a good deal to himself . Soon his mother called him and he went off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " said Jerry Borden . " I declare , I do n't know what to do with him . " " Maybe he needs a vacation , " suggested our hero . " Well , he ca n't have one until the hayin ' is done , " declared the farmer . CHAPTER X SAMMY 'S FOURTH OF JULY The next day Sammy sat on a bench on the cottage stoop , apparently very intent on a perusal of the Farmer 's Almanac , but it was evident his thoughts were somewhere else . " What in nater is the boy a-doin ' ? " asked his mother , looking up from a pile of stockings she was mending . " If he ai n't twisting up thet Almanac as if ' twas n't any more than a piece of brown paper . What are you thinking about , Sammy ? " " Thursday is Fourth o ' July , " answered her son . " Well , what if it is ? I 'm sure I 'm willing . " " They are going to have great doings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so ? I hope they enjoy themselves . But it ai n't anything to me as I know on . " " I want to go down an ' see the celebration , " said Sammy , mustering up his courage to give utterance to so daring a proposition . " Want to see the Fourth o ' July in Springfield ? " ejaculated his mother . " Is the boy crazy ? Ai n't it the Fourth o ' July here as well as there , I 'd like to know ? " " Well , I suppose it is , but I never was in Springfield , an ' I want to go . They 've got a lot o ' shows there , an ' I 'm bound to see some of ' em . " " Sammy , " said his mother , solemnly , " it would be the ruination of you ; you 'd git shot , or something wuss . You ai n't nuthin ' but a boy , an ' could n't be trusted nohow . " " Ai n't I fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ? " answered back Sammy , defiantly . " An ' did n't Dick Slade , who is only thirteen , go down last Fourth an ' have a smashin ' good time an ' not git hurt ? " " But you ai n't got no experience , Sammy . " " I 've got enough to go to Springfield . " " No , you had better give up the notion . " " Now , mother , do n't say that ! " pleaded the son . " But I do say it . " " Well , then I 'm going to -- to run away ! I 'll go to sea an ' be a sailor , or sumthin ' ! " burst out Sammy , recklessly . " I 'm sick o ' workin ' every single day ! " " Stop talking in that dreadful way , Sammy ! " said Mrs. Borden , anxiously . " Then you ask paw to let me go . " " ' Two n't do no good . " " Yes , it will . You ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last Mrs. Borden consented and spoke to her husband about it during the dinner hour . Jerry Borden shook his head . " He ca n't go -- it 's sheer foolishness , " he said . " If you do n't let him go I 'm afraid he will run away , " said the wife . " He has his heart set on going . " Sammy was out of the room at the time , so he could not hear the talk . At first Mr. Borden would not listen , but at last he gave in , although he added grimly that he thought running away would do Sammy a world of good . " He 'd be mighty glad to sneak back afore a week was up , " he said . When Sammy realized that he was really to go to the city he was wild with delight , and rushed down into the hayfield to tell Randy of his plans . " I 'm a-goin ' to have a highfalutin ' time , " he said . " Just you wait until I come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do have a good time , " answered our hero , " and do n't get hurt . " " There wo n't nothin ' happen to me , " answered Sammy , confidently . Early on the morning of Independence Day Sammy stood at the door of the farmhouse arrayed in his Sunday best . His folks were there to see him off . " My son , " said Mr. Borden , " do n't ye be wasteful o ' your money , an ' do n't git in no scrapes . " " An ' remember , Sammy , to keep all the Commandments , " added his mother , as she kissed him tenderly . Soon he was off , down the side road towards the highway , where the stage passed that ran to the railroad station . His walk took him by the Thompson cottage . Randy was at home and fixing up the garden . " I 'm off ! " yelled Sammy , waving his hand . " Good luck ! " cried Randy , pleasantly . " Do n't get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head without having it shot off , " remarked Mr. Thompson , who sat on the porch , with his rheumatic side in the sunshine . " I do not think it very wise to let him go to the city alone , " put in Mrs. Thompson from the kitchen . Sammy tramped on until he came to the main highway and there waited impatiently for the stage to appear . He got a seat by the driver , and in less than an hour reached the railroad station . He had been on the cars before , yet the ride was much of a novelty . At last the country boy found himself on the streets of Springfield . There was an extra celebration of some sort going on and great crowds flocked on every side . Poor Sammy was completely bewildered , as he was jostled first one way and then another . " Well , by gosh ! If this do n't beat anything I ever see ! " he ejaculated . " Where in thunder did all the folks come from , anyway ? " Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two street urchins who were standing close by . " There 's a greeny , I 'll bet a hat ! " said one of them , nudging his companion . " A regular one and no mistake , " answered the second urchin . " Let 's have a little fun out of him . " " How ? " " Just look and you 'll see how I fix him . " So speaking , he took a bunch of firecrackers from his pocket and , with a pin , attached it to the tail of Sammy 's coat . Then he set the bunch on fire and slipped back into the crowd . Crack ! Crack ! Bang ! The plot took effect . Sammy was aroused from his reverie by explosion after explosion in his immediate rear . He started and leaped into the air in wild amazement . " By thunder ! " he gasped . " Is thet a cannon bustin ' ? " The crackers continued to go off , and poor Sammy leaped around worse than ever . " Say , mister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was laughing loudly . " Look behind you , " answered the man . Sammy did so . One look was enough . He began to bellow like a bull and started off on a run , knocking down several people who happened to be in his way . At last a police officer stopped him . " What do you mean by making such a disturbance ? " demanded the officer . " I 'm burning up ! I 'm exploding ! Do n't you hear me ? " gasped poor Sammy . " Pooh ! It 's only fire-crackers , " and the policeman smiled faintly . " Take ' em off , mister , please do ! " pleaded Sammy . " I 'll give you ten cents for the job ! " " They are about burned out , " answered the officer , as the last firecracker went off with an extra loud bang . " You are safe . Go along with you . " And he waved his stick . Sammy lost no time in sneaking off . The boy who had played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion . Soon Sammy heard a band and saw some " Milingtary , " as he called them , approaching . The sight of the soldiers with their guns awed him , yet he followed the procession to a grove , where there was more music and also speechmaking . He listened to the orations with wide-open mouth , until he suddenly lost interest when a bit of banana skin was thrown at him , landing directly in the opening . " Wah ! " he spluttered . " Who threw thet skin at me ? " He could not find the offender and so roamed around the grove , presently halting before a temporary stand filled with things to eat . He now discovered that he was tremendously hungry . " Snathers take the expense , " he muttered to himself . " I 'm a-goin ' to have something to eat if it breaks me . " He had brought along a lunch from home , but had forgotten it on the train . He approached the stand and looked the stock of eatables over . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " Two cents each . " " Well , I suppose if I take two you 'll let me have ' em fer three cents . " " Could n't do it . " " Well , who cares , anyway ? It 's only four cents . Let me have two . " The bananas were handed over and Sammy looked for his change . But he only had two cents and a one-dollar bill . " Can you change that ? " he asked , holding out the bill . " Certainly , " answered the standkeeper , and promptly gave the youth a fifty-cent piece and a lot of small change . With his bananas in one hand and his money in another Sammy retired to a distance , to count his change and make sure it was right . While he was buying the fruit a boy in tatters watched him eagerly . Now the boy came up to the country lad . " Please , mister , wo n't you give me some money to buy bread with ? " he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Sammy , in astonishment . " Yes , please -- I 'm awful hungry . " " Ai n't you had nuthin ' to eat to-day ? " " Not a mouthful . " Sammy 's compassion was aroused and he began to look over his change . " Look out for that ! " cried the tattered boy , looking upward suddenly . Sammy 's gaze traveled in the same direction . As his eyes went up the boy in rags grabbed the money in his hand and in an instant was making off through the crowd . The movement was so quick , and the surprise so great , that for the moment Sammy was bereft of speech . At length he recovered sufficiently to shout the single word at the top of his lungs : " Constable ! " " What 's the matter ? " asked a policeman , running up . " Thief ! Robbery ! " " Where is the thief ? " " He ran off . " " Where ? In what direction ? " " I -- er -- I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Took all my money . " " How much ? " " Ninety-six cents . It ai n't all -- I 've got two cents left . " " Well , if you can point out the thief I 'll arrest him , " said the policeman . " Come , we 'll take a look around . " This was done , but the boy in rags could not be found . " Drat the luck ! I suppose the money is gone fer good ! " groaned Sammy , and he was right . For he never saw either the boy or his cash again . Sammy had expected to remain in the evening and see the fire-works , but now his interest in the celebration was gone . " Hai n't got but two cents left ! " he groaned . " Thet wo n't buy no supper nor nuthin ! It 's lucky I 've got a train ticket back . But I 'll have to walk to hum from the station , unless they 'll tick me fer the stage ride . " He walked around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His perambulations presently brought him to a spot where there was a pond of water , in which some gold-fish were swimming . The gold-fish caught his eye and he paused to watch them as they darted about . He was leaning over , looking into the pond , when some boys came along on a run . One boy shoved another and he fell up against Sammy . As a consequence the country lad lost his balance and went into the pond with a loud splash . " Save me ! " he spluttered . " I ca n't swim ! " " Wade out ; it 's only up to your middle ! " sang out a man , and arising , Sammy did as directed . He was covered with mud and slime and presented anything but a nice appearance . " This is the wust yet ! " he muttered , and felt half like crying . " I ai n't going to stay here no more -- I 'm goin ' straight fer hum ! " CHAPTER XI RANDY TO THE RESCUE The next day Randy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . To his astonishment Sammy was on hand and apparently eager to go to work . " Well , how was the celebration , Sammy ? " asked our hero . " No good . " " That 's too bad . " " After this I 'm a-goin ' to stay to hum on the Fourth , " went on Sammy , as he began to fork over the hay vigorously . " I ai n't goin ' to no city to be skinned . " " Did they skin you ? " " Jest about . A feller robbed me an ' I was pushed into a duck pond . " " That 's too bad . " " If I had n't a-had my train ticket I 'd had to walk home , " went on Sammy . " As it was , I had to borrow fifteen cents on the stage , to pay fer thet ride . No more city celebrations fer me . I kin have all I want right here at Riverport . " And then Sammy related his adventures in detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over at the Thompson place the ground had been plowed up in part , and as soon as he left Jerry Borden Randy set to work in earnest to plant late vegetables . For what our hero had done for the Bordens he was paid in vegetables , and also received a rooster and four hens . This gave the Thompsons their own eggs , for which the lady of the cottage was thankful . Randy was at work early one morning , when Jack appeared . " Hullo , at it already ? " sang out Jack . " I thought I 'd find you still in bed . " " I prefer to work when the sun is not so hot , " answered Randy . " But what brings you out at such an hour as this ? " " I 've got news . " " What is it ? " " We are going to move to Albany . " " When ? " " The first of next week . " " I 'll be sorry to miss you , Jack . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I came over for something more than to tell the news . I want you to go fishing with me . They say the sport is extra fine just now . " " I do n't know if I can go , " answered our hero , doubtfully . " There is still enough to do here . " " It will be a change for you . You have worked very hard lately . " " I admit that . " " Go by all means , if you care to , Randy , " called out Mrs. Thompson . " You have earned a holiday , and the fish will be acceptable . " " All right , mother ; if you say so , I 'll go . " It did not take Randy long to prepare for the outing . Jack had with him a basket of lunch for two , so all he had to get was his line and hooks and some extra bait . " I hope we catch a good mess to-day , " said Randy , as they started off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can let us have some bacon that we need . " " I suppose it is rather hard scratching for you just now , " said Jack . " It is , and I am going to look for outside work before long . " " Well , I hope you find something to do . Ben Bash was looking for work all over this district but he could n't find a thing . " " Oh , I know there is small chance in Riverport . I think I may try elsewhere , " answered our hero . It did not take the two boys long to reach the river , at a point where Jack had left his boat . Both rowed to their favorite fishing spot . " Oh , is n't that too bad ! " cried Jack , in disappointment . Strangers were fishing at the spot and they soon saw that there was no room for them to throw in . " How is fishing ? " called out Randy . " Very good , " answered one of those present . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question is , where ? " " I know another spot about quarter of a mile from here , " answered Randy . " It may be just as good . " They rowed on and reached the new place , to find nobody there . Soon they had their boat tied fast to an overhanging tree and then they got out on some flat rocks and baited up . It did not take long to prove that the new fishing place was as good as the old . Randy drew in a small fish almost immediately and Jack did the same . Then both got hauls of good size . " Maybe we 'll do better than if we went to the old Fishing Hole , " observed Jack . At noon time they knocked off for lunch and a rest and then took a good swim . " I can tell you , I enjoy this ! " cried Randy . " I have n't had a chance to go in for so long . " The swim at an end , the boys donned their garments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock . Then all their luck seemed to suddenly desert them . " Never mind , " said Randy . " We certainly have a prime haul , even as it is , " and he looked the fish over with much pride . They wound up their lines and were soon on the way down the river . It was rather a hot day , so they took their time in getting back . " What are you going to do with your boat ? " asked Randy . " Sell it to Mr. Stanwood for ten dollars . " " You are lucky to get a customer , Jack . " " I know it . I 'd turn the boat over to you only -- well -- we need the money now , you know , " and Jack 's eyes dropped . " Thank you , Jack , but I would n't have much time to use it . I must put in the most of my time at work . " " I suppose that is true . At the same time I 'd rather you had the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming around a bend of the river when they heard a peculiar noise in the distance . " What do you make that out to be ? " asked Jack , as the noise continued . " I think I know , " answered our hero . " It is the new tugboat from the bay . I saw it once , several weeks ago . It makes a very odd sound , for the engine is not like the ordinary ones . " The noise kept coming closer and presently the tugboat came into view . It was stuck in the mud and those on board were doing what they could to get the craft afloat again . " They seem to be having a hard time of it , " remarked Jack , as he stopped rowing to watch the proceedings . " The mud is very sticky here , if you 'll remember , " answered Randy . " Do n't you remember how we were stuck here last year ? " " Yes , and how I lost an oar overboard and nearly went overboard myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heigh-ho ! Randy , I 'll be sorry in a way to lose it all . " " We must write to each other . " " Of course . " The tug was puffing and snorting viciously to get out of the mud . On board were four people who were evidently passengers , including a lady with a little girl . Suddenly there came something which sounded like an explosion . This was followed by a cloud of steam that seemed to completely envelop the tugboat . " Something is wrong ! " shouted Randy . " Oh , mamma , I do n't like this ! " screamed the little girl , as she ran to the stern of the tug . " We 'll be burned up ! " She had scarcely spoken when there came another explosion and the cloud of steam increased . The four passengers crowded to the stern in a body , and a moment later the two men leaped overboard and called on the lady and her child to do likewise . " I can not swim ! " shrieked the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The tug may blow up ! " The little girl heard this and with a scream she ran from her mother straight for the bow of the tug . The next moment she lost her balance and went overboard . " She 's over ! " cried Randy , and his heart leaped into his throat . " Save my child ! Save Helen ! " shrieked the lady and rushed after her offspring . Soon she was in the water also . The situation was certainly a thrilling one . The two men in the water were fifty feet away and those left on the tug were in no position to render assistance . The child had disappeared completely , while the mother was thrashing around wildly , in water just up to her neck . " Quick , Jack , turn the boat around ! " ejaculated Randy . " We must get them on board . " The craft was turned around and headed for the lady . Then Randy threw off his cap -- he was already in his shirt sleeves -- and stood up in the bow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the little girl 's white dress . " My child ! My child ! " the mother continued to scream . Illustration " I 'll bring her up , " said Randy , and made a leap overboard , just as the gunwale of the rowboat came within reaching distance of the lady 's hands . The little girl had been caught by the current and was being carried down the stream . Randy made a quick grab but missed her , and then she disappeared from view . But in a few seconds more he saw her again , and this time secured hold of her arm . The next moment he raised her to the surface of the river . She was too far gone to do anything but splutter . She clutched him with a deathlike grip -- a thing every person in danger of drowning will do -- and he had his hands full to keep both himself and his burden afloat . Shallow water was not far off and he struck out for this and waded ashore . In the meantime Jack was having no easy time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious danger of the craft overturning , and he had to caution her to be careful . " My child ! My Helen ! " she moaned , when she was at last safe . " My friend will save her , " answered Jack . " You are sure ? " " Yes . " CHAPTER XII A STEAMBOAT MAN Having saved the lady from her uncomfortable if not dangerous position , Jack lost no time in rowing for the shore . Soon he was at the river bank and the lady leaped out of the rowboat and ran to where Randy had placed his dripping burden on the grass . " My Helen ! Is she safe ? " asked the lady , anxiously . " I think so , " answered our hero . " But I guess she swallowed some river water . " " Oh , how thankful I am that you went after her . " " It was the only thing to do . I saw she could n't swim . " The little girl was still gasping for breath . The mother threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Soon the little girl gave a cry : " Mamma ! " " Yes , darling , I am here ! " " Oh , dear ! I am all wet ! " " Be thankful that your life has been spared . " " That boy brought me out of the water . " " Yes , dear -- and he was brave to do it , " answered the mother and beamed on Randy to such an extent that he had to blush . By this time the two men had also come ashore . The steam was still blowing off on the tug but the danger appeared to be over . Later the engineer announced that a valve and a connection had broken , and the craft would have to remain where she was until towed off . " I am glad to see you are all safe , " said the man who ran the tug . " There was n't very much danger on board . " " It looked bad enough , " said one of the men who had leaped overboard . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither did I , " added the other . It appeared that neither of the men knew the lady excepting by name . She was , however , fairly well known to the tug captain , and had gone up the river on the craft to please her little girl . " I am sorry for this , Mrs. Shalley , " said the tug owner . " I must say , I do n't know what to do . " " I must get dry clothing on Helen pretty soon . " " The tug is wet from end to end from the escaped steam . " " If I was down at Riverport I could go to the hotel , " went on Mrs. Shalley . " We can take you down in our rowboat , " said Jack . " It wo n't take very long . " " Can I trust myself in the boat ? " " Certainly , if you 'll only sit still . " The matter was talked over , and it was decided that the lady and her little girl should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was soon on the way . " My name is Mrs. Andrew Shalley , " said the lady . " My husband is a steamboat owner . May I ask your names ? " " Mine is Jack Bartlett . I live in Riverport , but I am going to move to Albany . " " And my name is Randy Thompson , " added our hero . " I live over there -- in the little cottage by that clump of trees . " " I am pleased to know you , " said the lady . " It was more than kind of both of you to come to the assistance of myself and my daughter . " " It was n't so much to do , " answered Randy . " We were close by . " " You are soaking wet . " " It 's an old working suit and I do n't mind the water , " laughed our hero . " What a nice lot of fish , " said little Helen , who had now completely recovered . " I feel I should reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want anything , " said Jack , promptly . " And neither do I , " added our hero . The hotel at which the lady was stopping was built close to the river bank . Mother and child landed at the dock and Randy and Jack bade them good-by . " I shall try to see you again , " said Mrs. Shalley , as she started for the hotel . " Evidently a very nice lady , " remarked Jack , as he and Randy rowed away . " Yes . " " I think she wanted to reward us , Randy . " " I think so myself , but I do n't want any reward . " " Neither do I , although I should n't mind , say ten thousand dollars , " went on Jack , by way of a joke . " Or the Presidency of the United States , " added Randy , in an equally light tone . The boys had caught so many fish Randy decided to sell some from his share . He found a purchaser on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty cents . " If I ca n't get anything else to do , I can do some fishing later on , " he mused . " I can get at least two or three dollars ' worth of fish a week , and that would be better than nothing -- and I could keep right on with the farm , too . " When Randy returned home he had quite a story to tell , to which both his father and his mother listened with interest . " Randy , you must be careful in the water , " said Mrs. Thompson , with an anxious look in her eyes . " Supposing that girl had dragged you down ? " " I was on my guard , mother . " " Randy is a good swimmer , " said his father . " I was a good swimmer myself , in my younger days . " The fish proved acceptable , and Randy readily got Jerry Borden to trade him some bacon for a mess , and also give him some fresh vegetables . " Gosh ! Wish I 'd gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch big fish . " " Well , I am not going to stop you , " said our hero . " Sammy never has no luck , " put in Mrs. Borden . " Once he went fishing all day and all he got was three little fish . " " Did n't nuther ! " cried Sammy . " I got twelve big bites , but they got away . " " It 's the big fish that always get away , " said Randy , with a smile . " Never mind , Sammy , maybe we can go together some day . " " I 'd like that , " answered the overgrown country boy . " Did that Bartlett boy get any fish ? " asked Mrs. Borden . " Just as many as I did . " " I understand they are going to move away . " " Yes , to Albany . " " They say down to the iron works that Mr. Bangs is glad to have Mr. Bartlett out of the place . " " I guess that is true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men liked Mr. Bartlett . " " Do n't they like Mr. Bangs ? " " Not a bit -- so Mr. Reilly was telling my husband . They say Mr. Bangs is mean to everybody . " Two days slipped by , and Randy was at work in the garden one afternoon when he saw a buggy stop at the front of the cottage and a portly man alighted . Knowing his mother was busy , our hero went to meet the newcomer . " Is this where Randy Thompson lives ? " asked the portly gentleman . " Yes , sir , I am Randy Thompson . " " Oh ! " The gentleman held out his hand . " I am glad to know you . My name is Andrew Shalley . You did my wife and little girl a great service the other day . " " I only did what seemed necessary , " answered Randy , modestly . " Will you come into the house , Mr. Shalley ? " " Thanks , I 'll sit down on your porch . " The gentleman did so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little . We got this place so late this season I can not do a great deal . Next year I hope to have the farm in much better shape . " " Do you like it ? " " I try to like it . " " Then you are not naturally a farmer ? " " No , sir . " " Is your father living ? " " Yes , sir ; but he is laid up with rheumatism , so he can not work at present . He is a carpenter . " " Indeed ! I was a carpenter when I was a young man . " " I thought Mrs. Shalley said you were a steamboat owner . " " I am , now . I gave up carpentering to go into the freight business . I made money , and then bought a small freight boat . Then I branched out , and now own a steamboat running up and down the Hudson River , and I also own several steam tugs . " " Do you own the one that got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine owns that -- that is how my wife and little girl happened to be on board . I am --  --  " Mr. Shalley stopped short as a form appeared in the doorway behind him . " This is my mother . Mother , this is Mr. Shalley , the steamboat owner . " " I am glad to meet you , " said Mrs. Thompson , politely . " Will you come in ? " " Thank you , but it is very pleasant on the porch . Madam , you have a good son , " went on the steamboat owner . " I know that . " " He did my wife and little girl a great service the other day . " " Yes , he told me what he did . " " I think -- er -- that is , I 'd like to reward you , " stammered Andrew Shalley . He saw that Randy was no common boy with whom to deal . " Thank you , but I do n't wish any reward , sir . " " I felt you would say that , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then you have seen Jack Bartlett ? " " Yes , I just came from there . I wanted to reward him , but he would not have it . But I fixed him , " and the steamboat owner smiled broadly . " Yes ? " said Mrs. Thompson , curiously . " I found out he was going to move to Albany , so I gave him a free pass on my steamboat , the Helen Shalley -- named after my wife . Now he can go up and down the river as much as he pleases and it wo n't cost him a cent . I told him I 'd depend upon him to haul folks out of the water if they fell overboard , " and the steamboat owner laughed broadly . " That ought to suit Jack -- he loves the water so , " said Randy . " Do you like the water , too ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then maybe you 'd like a pass also . " " I could n't use it , Mr. Shalley . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to do something for you , to show I appreciate what you did for my wife and for Helen . " " I do not want anything , Mr. Shalley , excepting work . " " Work ? I should imagine you had enough of that right here . " " I mean work that would pay me regular wages . We must have money . My father needs the doctor , and medicine , and we have to buy groceries , and such , and we ca n't make the farm pay the bills . " " I understand , my lad . Where is your father ? " " I am here , sir , " came from the couch in the sitting room . " May I come in , Mr. Thompson ? " " Certainly , " answered the sick man , and a moment later Andrew Shalley entered the cottage and was shaking hands with Randy 's father . CHAPTER XIII MR . SHALLEY MAKES AN OFFER The two men conversed together for fully half an hour , and during that time Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make both ends meet . " I live at Nyack , " said Andrew Shalley . " And my headquarters for boats is there also . But the passenger steamer runs from New York City to Albany . The tugs run anywhere on the river , and on New York Bay . " " It must be a nice business , " said Randy . " I like boats of any kind . " " If I had a boat on the river here I might give you a job , " went on the gentleman . " But all of my craft are on the Hudson . " " They tell me that the Hudson is a grand stream . " " Nothing finer in this country , my boy , nothing finer . I have traveled all over the United States and I know . I think it is fully equal to the German Rhine and the St. Lawrence . " " Maybe you could give me a situation on one of your Hudson River boats , " went on Randy , struck by a sudden idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Randy , you would n't want to go away ! " cried Mrs. Thompson . " I would if it paid to do so , " answered Randy , quickly . " There is n't much chance for work in Riverport . " " And I can keep an eye on the garden , " said Mr. Thompson . " I know I am going to feel some better now this spell is passing . " " If you cared to leave home I might give you some sort of a job on one of my boats , " went on Andrew Shalley , thoughtfully . " What kind of a job ? " " I 'd have to see about it first . I 'll tell you what I 'll do , I 'll send you a letter next week . " " Thank you . " " That will be best . But now I am going to do something else . " The steamboat man drew out his wallet . " I want you to accept this . " And he held out five crisp ten-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the steamboat man urged it and finally laid the bills on the table . " I am sure you are more than kind , Mr. Shalley , " said Mrs. Thompson . " I shall remember you . " " Let us call it a loan , " said Mr. Thompson , " to be paid back when I am at work once more . " " Yes , call it a loan , " said Randy , " otherwise I , for one , do n't want it . " " Have your way , " laughed Mr. Shalley . " But do n't worry about the payment . " Before he left he walked around the little farm and praised what Randy had done . " Evidently not a lazy boy , " he told himself , " and one who is willing to aid his parents . That is the sort I like . " " He is a very nice man , " said Mrs. Thompson , when the visitor had departed . " Randy , you were fortunate to make such a friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to pay back that money some day . " " I can do that -- when I am able to go at carpentering again , " put in Mr. Thompson . After that a week passed quietly enough . Randy worked early and late and got the little farm in good shape and also visited Jack and bade his friend good-by . " Maybe I 'll get a position on one of the Hudson River boats , " said our hero . " If you do , and you stop at Albany , you must come and see me , " answered Jack , and gave his new address . On the following Monday came a letter from Andrew Shalley . It was short and to the point and read in part as follows : " All I can offer you at present is the position of a deckhand on my steamboat , the Helen Shalley . If you wish to accept that I will pay you twenty dollars per month and your board at the start , and more when you are experienced . If you wish to accept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office . " " Here 's an offer at last ! " cried Randy , as he read the communication . He had been fearful that Andrew Shalley might forget him . " Twenty dollars per month is not so very much , " said his mother . " Yes , but I am to get my board , so the money will all be clear profit , outside of the cost of my clothing . " " I suppose you will live on the boat , " put in Mr. Thompson . " Most of the crew do . " " I can send the most of the money home each month , " continued Randy . " The boat wo n't run during the winter , " said his mother , who did not much relish having her son leave home . " Well , it will run until cold weather , anyway , and perhaps after that Mr. Shalley will give me something else to do . " The matter was discussed that evening , and before he retired , Randy penned a letter to the steamboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . The prospects ahead filled our hero with pleasure . The new position would enable him to see a little of the world and meet other people , and he was sure steamboat life would suit him thoroughly . He knew there would be plenty of hard work , handling freight and baggage , but this did not daunt him . " I 'll try to do my best , " he reasoned . " Then maybe Mr. Shalley will give me something better later on . " Randy did not have many clothes , so there was not a great deal to pack . What he possessed was gone over by his mother , and then packed in a valise . Out of the money on hand he was given the price of his stage and railroad ticket and five dollars for other expenses . " I sha n't spend only what is necessary , " said he to his parents . Randy was glad to see that his father was improving . A good deal of the rheumatic pains had left Mr. Thompson and he could get around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before he could go at carpentering again , but he could aid a good deal on the farm , which was something . All too soon for his mother came the time for Randy to depart . Mrs. Thompson kissed him affectionately and his father shook him by the hand . " Come back home if it does n't suit you , Randy , " said the mother . " Yes , come back , and we 'll get along somehow , " added his father . " I am sure it will suit me , " said the boy . " I know the kind of a man Mr. Shalley is . We 'll be sure to get along . " Randy left home early in the morning and half an hour later was on the stage , bound for Leeville , where he was to take the train for Tarrytown , which is directly across the Hudson River from Nyack . His going away was done so quietly that not a dozen persons knew of his departure . The stage was but half filled , so he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arriving at Leeville he had an hour to wait for the train and spent the time in walking around the little town . He had just passed one of the largest stores when he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned , to find himself confronted by Bob Bangs . " What are you doing here ? " demanded the big boy , rather impudently . " What business is that of yours ? " retorted Randy , not liking the manner in which he had been addressed . " Oh , you need n't answer if you do n't want to , " sniffed Bob Bangs . " I am going to Nyack . " " To Nyack ? What for ? " " I am going to work for a steamboat owner . " " Humph ! Going to work on the river ? " " Yes . " " Cabin boy , I suppose , " sneered the rich boy . " No , as a deckhand . " " I thought so . It 's a dirty enough job , and you are welcome to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is clean , " answered Randy , warmly . " Ha ! What do you mean by clean money , " demanded the big boy , suspiciously . " Just what I said . " " Maybe you are trying to help spread that report that the Bartletts started about us , " said the rich youth . " What report do you mean , Bob ? " " You know well enough -- the one about my father . " " I do n't know . " " Ai n't the Bartletts telling everybody that my father shoved ' em out of the iron works and that our money was n't clean ? " " I have n't heard it . " " Bah ! You need n't play the innocent . I know you , and I know Jack Bartlett , too . " " I do n't think your folks treated the Bartletts just right , " went on our hero , resolved to stand up for his friends . " We treated ' em better than they deserved . If I had been my father I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have dared , Bob Bangs . But I am not going to quarrel with you . What brings you to this place ? " " That 's my business . " " You need n't tell me if you do n't wish to . " " I am here to get a new horse . I am going to ride horseback after this , " went on the rich boy , boastfully . " It 's a horse that costs four hundred dollars , too . " " Then you are in luck , " was all Randy answered , and walked away , leaving the rich youth gazing after him doubtfully . CHAPTER XIV BOB BANGS AND HIS HORSE Randy continued to wander around the country town , taking in such sights as came to view . In the meantime Bob Bangs went after the horse he had mentioned . The rich youth had bothered his father for a horse for a long time and at last Mr. Bangs had consented to give him a steed . The horse was to be taken in exchange for a debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and take the animal to the summer resort at which he and his mother were stopping . It may be mentioned that the horse was worth only a hundred and fifty dollars , but the falsehood he had told in regard to the horse 's value did not bother Bob Bangs in the least . He loved to boast upon every possible occasion . " Is he gentle ? " asked the rich boy , as he approached the horse , that was standing in the yard of the former owner . " As gentle as a lamb , " was the answer . " He -- he wo n't run away , will he ? " went on Bob , timidly . To tell the truth he knew very little about horses , although he pretended to know a great deal . " He never ran away in his life , " declared the man who was disposing of the horse . " Then I guess it is all right , " said the rich boy , and started to mount into the saddle , for the steed was ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wanted now . " " I want you to sign a receipt first , " said the man . " Oh , all right . " The receipt was produced , stating that the horse was received in good condition and that the debt was canceled thereby , and the rich youth signed his father 's name and his own under it . Then the man held the horse while the boy mounted . " All safe and sound ? " asked the man . " Yes , " answered Bob Bangs . " Good-day , " and off he rode . " Good-day , and good luck to you , " answered the man , and he smiled rather grimly to himself as he entered his house . " The horse seems to be a nice one , " thought Bob Bangs , as he rode away . " I wish I could meet Randy Thompson , it would make him feel sick to see me on such a fine animal . " The rich youth 's wish was gratified , for turning a corner he caught sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out of the way there , Randy Thompson ! " he cried , and urged his horse forward . Randy had to jump back , or he might have been knocked down . " Ai n't this a fine horse ? " Bob Bangs cried . " Do n't you wish you had him ? " And he cut the steed with the whip he carried , to make him increase his speed . The horse did not like the treatment received and up came his hind hoofs viciously . " Stop ! None of that ! " roared Bob Bangs , in fright . " Whoa there ! " He began to saw on the reins , and as a consequence the horse turned first in one direction and then another . Then he started to back and came up on the sidewalk , scaring several women and children . " Whoa ! Get up ! " screamed Bob Bangs , more frightened than ever . " Whoa , I say ! What in the old Harry is in the beast , anyway ! " " Look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll go through a window next . " " Bob , let me lead him into the street , " cried Randy , rushing up and catching the horse by the bridle . " You let my horse alone ! " shouted the rich boy , unreasonably . " I can manage him well enough . " " Very well , " answered Randy , quietly , and dropped his hold . As he did so the steed made a plunge along the sidewalk for several yards , knocking over a barber 's pole and a newsstand . " Stop dot ! Vot you mean py dot ? " yelled the German barber , rushing from his establishment in alarm . " Get along there , you brute ! " cried Bob Bangs , savagely , and struck the horse once more . Again the steed swerved , and made a half turn and began to back . " Stop him ! " " He is going into the window ! " Crash ! And then followed a jingle of glass , and into the window of a grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hind hoofs rested on a row of canned tomatoes and sardines . Bob Bangs gave a yell of fear and terror and dropped to the sidewalk and then caught the horse by the head . The groceryman came forth from his store in a hurry , and a bitter argument ensued , while a big crowd began to collect . In the end Bob Bangs had to promise to pay for all damage done , and led his horse away by hand , too fearful of further trouble to mount once more . Randy did not wait to see the end of the dispute , for the train was now due and he had just time enough to hurry to the depot and get aboard the cars . He dropped into the first seat that came to hand and laughed heartily . " You seem to be enjoying yourself , " said a man sitting near . " I just saw something very funny , " answered our hero , and told what it was . The man laughed , too . " It puts me in mind of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a trick animal and got me into seven kinds of trouble . " Randy had not had many opportunities to ride on the cars and he enjoyed the trip to Tarrytown very much . Noon found him in the city named and he crossed the river on the ferryboat . Then he hunted up a cheap but neat restaurant , where he got dinner . " No use of bothering Mr. Shalley just at noon hour , " he thought , and so did not go around to the steamboat man 's office until one o'clock . A clerk was present who said his employer would come in at two o'clock , so our hero had another hour to wait . " Is your name Randy Thompson ? " questioned the clerk . When told that it was , he continued : " Mr. Shalley is expecting you . I believe you are to be one of the new deckhands . " " Yes . " " I hope you find the work agreeable . " " So do I. " " The other new hand did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just one week . " " What was the matter ? " " I believe he said he could n't get along with Polk , the purser . " " I hope I do n't have any trouble with anybody , " said Randy , anxiously . " I am willing to work hard . " " You 'll find Captain Hadley a fine man to deal with . I think he is one of the nicest captains on the river . " " What do you do here ? " " Oh , I am general office clerk . My name is Bart Sandwood . " " I am glad to know you , Mr. Sandwood , " answered our hero , and smiled . " I hope business is good with the steamer . " " Travel has been very good and we are getting our share of freight . The other lines bother us some , but not a great deal . " " Is the Helen Shalley one of the big boats of the river ? " " Not one of the largest , but she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen her ? " " Not yet , but I hope to soon . " " She will be on her way down the river this afternoon . She runs from New York to Albany one day and back the next . She does n't run on Sundays . " " I am glad of that . I do n't care to work on Sunday . " " Well , you 'll have to do a little . When there are no passengers on board , that is the time to put things in order . " " True enough . I am afraid I will be green . " " Were you never a deckhand before ? " " Never . " At this the clerk gave a low whistle . " I do n't know if Captain Hadley will like that or not . He is a very strict man , even though kind . " " I shall do my best to please him . " " Early in the spring we had two green hands , but they could n't learn at all , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I am sure I can learn -- anyway , I mean to try . " " You certainly look bright enough to learn . The other fellows were illiterate foreigners and always tumbling over their own feet . One dropped a trunk on a passenger 's foot and the other broke open a box with some fine dishes . That capped the climax , and the captain got rid of them just as soon as he could find some other hands to take their places , " concluded Bart Sandwood . CHAPTER XV RANDY AS A DECKHAND When Mr. Andrew Shalley came in he was full of business . He nodded pleasantly to Randy . " I will see you in a little while , " he said , and turned to his clerk . Then Bart Sandwood was sent off on an errand and the steamboat owner turned to look over some letters that had come in . " Now I am at liberty , " he said , pleasantly , shaking hands . " Are you ready for work ? " " Yes , sir , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on a large river steamer ? " " No , Mr. Shalley , but I am willing to do all I possibly can to make myself truly useful . " " Well , if I am any judge of character , you 'll get along . All you 've got to do is to keep your eyes open and obey orders . We have one old deckhand , Pat Malloy . He will teach you what to do . " " When can I go to work ? " " The boat will be along down the river soon . I 'll take you on board , as I want to see the captain . As soon as you are settled I 'll have you fitted out with a uniform . " " How much will that cost me ? " " In your case it wo n't cost anything . " " You are very kind . " " Remember , I take a personal interest in you , Randy , and I want to see you get along . Do your duty and rest assured I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll disappoint you , Mr. Shalley . " Randy waited around the office until it was almost time for the steamboat to make a landing . Then he went down to the dock with his newly-found friend . Here were a number of passengers , and also a quantity of baggage and freight . Presently the Helen Shalley hove into sight , with flags flying bravely in the breeze . As Randy had been told , she was not a particularly large steamboat , but she was well proportioned and graceful , and well liked by those who patronized her . We will get better acquainted with the craft as our story proceeds . As soon as a landing was made , Mr. Shalley went on board , taking Randy with him . Captain Hadley was at hand . " So this is the new deckhand , eh ? " said the captain , in bluff tones . " Pretty strong , are you ? " " I think so , " answered Randy , respectfully . " Well , you 'll have to be , to stand this work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not a great deal , but I think I can learn . " " We are shorthanded , so you can jump right in , " went on the captain of the steamboat . " Yes , sir . Who will tell me what to do ? " " Pat Malloy . He is the head man of the gang . Here , Malloy , " he called out . " Aye , aye , sur , " answered a brawny and jolly-looking Irishman , coming forward and touching his cap . " Here 's your new hand . " Pat Malloy looked at Randy in some astonishment . Our hero was neatly dressed and did not look as if he was used to hard labor . " Sure an ' it 's only a boy , " murmured the head deckhand . " He says he can work . Give him a chance , " put in Andrew Shalley . There was plenty to do , and Randy threw off his coat , took off his collar and tie , and pitched in . The labor was by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing up a trunk to the best advantage , yet he did very well , and Pat Malloy nodded approvingly . " Sure , an ' ye do better nor some o ' thim foreigners already , " he declared . " Kape it up an ' we 'll git along foine together . " Captain Hadley and Andrew Shalley watched the work for several minutes , and then walked to the cabin of the steamboat . Here the owner of the boat told something about Randy . " I want you to give him a chance even if he is a bit green , " said he . " I want the lad to get along . " " He shall have all the chance possible , " answered Captain Hadley . " I am glad to get a hand who is intelligent . " Then the two conversed upon private matters until the boat was ready to leave Nyack . " Good-by , my boy ! " cried Mr. Shalley , on leaving . " Take good care of yourself , and let me know how you get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered our hero . " It may be hard work at first , but you 'll get used to it . " " I am not afraid of hard work . " " The captain will give you a uniform in a few days . " The gangplanks were hauled in , the lines cast off , and with a hoarse whistle the Helen Shalley continued on her course down the Hudson . There was a small Italian band on board , consisting of two violins , a harp and a clarionet , and they struck up a popular air . The work at the dock had somewhat exhausted Randy , who was not used to handling such heavy stuff so quickly , but he took pains to conceal his feelings . " I am not going to back down , no matter how hard the work is , " he told himself . " Others can do it and so can I. " Among the deckhands was a tall , limber American man named Jones . He came up to Randy after the work was done . " Malloy told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pointers , " said Jones . " Come ahead . " They passed from one end of the steamboat to the other , through all of the three decks , and Jones named over the various parts and told what the deckhands were expected to do . Then they went below and he told of some work there . Lastly he took Randy to the sleeping quarters . " This is my bunk , " said Jack Jones . " That will be yours over there . When you get the chance , I 'll advise you to air your bedding . You can do it after we tie up in New York and the passengers go ashore . " The quarters were small , but not any smaller than Randy 's garret apartment in the cottage . Everything was kept as clean as wax , for both Malloy and Jones were enemies to dirt . Randy was glad to learn this and resolved to give the others no cause for complaint regarding his own personal habits . " Some boats are very dirty and the bunks not fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Malloy wo n't allow it on this boat , and I wo n't have it either . " " And I am with you , " answered our hero . " Came from a farm , did n't you ? " " Yes , but our family was n't on the farm long . " " I came from a farm myself . " " How long have you been on this boat ? " " Came the middle of last season . " " Do you like it ? " " If I did n't I should n't be here . " " I suppose that is so . " " Captain Hadley is a fine man to work for . He is strict but fair , and that is what I like . " " What about the others ? " " The mate , Tom Blossom , is nice , too . The man we all hate is Peter Polk , the purser . " " What 's the matter with him ? " " Well , between you and me , I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He is always making trouble for somebody . Nobody seems to like him much , although he attends strictly to business . " " I hope I do n't have trouble with Mr. Polk . " " Well , you will have to watch yourself . " Several other landings were made , and promptly at the appointed time the Helen Shalley swung into her dock at New York City and the remaining passengers went ashore . Then began the labor of unloading the baggage and freight , after which the deck was swabbed up , the brass-work polished , and such baggage as was at hand taken on board for transportation up the river the next day . When he had finished his day 's labors Randy was tired and perfectly willing to rest for a while . He had had a good supper and might have gone directly to bed , but instead he sat up to write a letter to the folks at home , telling his father and mother of his day 's experience . Our hero had to go ashore to post the communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a little walk around before returning to the steamboat . He was soon walking along West Street , and then took to a side street running up to the avenues . Now , although our hero did not know it , he had chosen one of the worst streets in this part of the great city . It was filled with tenements and groggeries of the lowest description , and the sidewalks swarmed with all sorts of low characters . He had scarcely walked two squares before a rough-looking fellow jostled him . The next instant Randy felt a hand in his pocket . " Stop that ! " cried Randy . But the fellow was already running up the street . Our hero clapped his hand in the pocket and discovered that eighty cents in change was missing . " I am not going to lose that money ! " he told himself , with vigor . " I may be a greeny , but I 'll give that thief some trouble . " At first he thought to cry out , but then reconsidered the matter and remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away went man and boy along the crowded thoroughfare . The man evidently thought he could lose himself in the crowd , but by the aid of the street lights , Randy kept him in sight . He passed along for two blocks and then turned into a side street and then into a blind alley . Our hero managed to keep him in view and saw him spring up the steps of a dilapidated tenement house . The man ran through the lower hallway and into the back yard , piled high with rubbish of all kinds . Here he hid behind some empty boxes . Randy was soon in the yard and gazing around eagerly . As he did so he saw a thin and pale girl of about ten standing near . Soon she came up to him timidly . " Did you see a man run in here ? " said Randy . " Yes , " she answered , but in a hesitating voice . " Where did he go ? " " I do n't dare tell you , " whispered the girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And who is Bill Hosker ? " " Do n't you know him ? " And the little girl 's eyes opened in astonishment . " No , I do n't . " " Bill Hosker is the boss around here . He does just as he pleases . If anybody crosses him Bill ' most kills them . " " Oh , he 's a bully , is that it ? " " Yes . " " Well , where did he go ? " " You wo n't tell him I told you ? " " No . " " He crawled in behind those boxes , " answered the little girl and then ran away . Randy waited to hear no more , but made a dash for the boxes . As he did so , the fellow who had robbed him leaped up , club in hand . " Go out of here ! " he cried , in a hoarse voice . " I do n't want anything to do with a kid like you . " " You give me my money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let the like of you rob me . " " Ho ! ho ! Hear the kid talk ! Go away , before I maul ye ! " And Bill Hosker brandished his club . But our hero was not to be daunted thus readily , and looking around he espied a stick and picked it up . Then he advanced upon Bill Hosker , who promptly leaped to the top of a big packing case . The next instant he came down upon Randy , bearing him to the ground . Our hero tried to defend himself , but it was useless . He was crushed beneath that heavy weight , and then the rascal gave him a crack on the head that stretched him senseless . CHAPTER XVI IN NEW YORK CITY " Will he live , mamma ? " " I think so , Rose . But he has been badly misused . " " Bill Hosker ought to be locked up for it . " " Nobody will lock Bill up . He has too much influence with the politicians , " answered the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious . Mother and daughter had carried our hero from the yard to their room in the rear of the tenement . Nobody else had been around . The girl had witnessed Bill Hosker 's nefarious deed and had at once summoned her parent . Mrs. Clare was a poor widow lady who supported herself by sewing . Rose was her only child and did what she could to help her mother . Sewing did not pay well , and the Clares had all they could do to make both ends meet . But Mrs. Clare had a warm heart and so had Rose , and it pained them greatly to see Randy so mistreated . They carried him into their one room and placed him on their bed and did what they could for him . At last he opened his eyes and stared around him . Then he sat up slowly . " Where am I ? " he asked , faintly . " We brought you into the house -- mother and I , " answered Rose . " Do n't you remember , Bill Hosker struck you down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Randy took a deep breath and put his hand to his head . " He hit me pretty hard , did n't he ? " " I am afraid he did , " answered Mrs. Clare . " It was a shame , too . " " Where is he now ? " " He ran away . " " He stole eighty cents from me . " " Perhaps he took more , " said Rose . " He went through your pockets after he knocked you down . I saw him do it . " With his head still aching , our hero felt in first one pocket and then another . He gave something like a groan . " Every cent is gone ! " " How much did you have ? " " Between four and five dollars . " " I am sorry for you , " said Mrs. Clare . " But I am afraid you will never see your money again . " " Does that rascal live around here ? " " Sometimes . He comes and goes to suit himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . " " Is there any use of my reporting this to the police , do you think ? " " I do n't think so . He once took my pocket-book from the table here -- I am sure of it -- but when I reported it to the police nothing was done . They said his word was as good as mine . " " How long have I been here ? " " About half an hour . " " Then he has had a good chance to get away . Did you bring me here ? " " Yes . " " You are very kind , Mrs.  - -   - -   " " I am Mrs. Clare and this is my daughter Rose . " " And I am Randy Thompson , a deckhand on the Hudson River steamboat Helen Shalley . " " Oh ! " Mrs. Clare paused for a moment . " Do you know Mr. Polk , the purser ? " " Yes , but not very well . I just got the job as a deckhand to-day . " " Mr. Polk is a relative of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We -- that is -- well , we are not very good friends , " went on Mrs. Clare . " Mamma thinks Mr. Polk has n't been honest with us , " put in Rose , quickly . " I do n't think so either . " " Rose , you must not talk so ! " " But it is true , is n't it ? " returned the daughter . " I may be misjudging Cousin Peter , " said Mrs. Clare . " You see , " she added , by way of an explanation , " my cousin Peter Polk had the settlement of my husband 's affairs when he died , and I have always imagined that -- well , that Rose and I did not get exactly what was coming to us . " " Mamma thought the account was three hundred dollars short , " said Rose , who was inclined to be blunt . " Could n't you get a clear statement ? " questioned Randy , with interest . " We got a statement , but it was not clear to me , " answered Mrs. Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Randy got on his feet . He felt rather dizzy and he had a large lump over his left ear , where he had been struck by the club . " See here , " he said , when he was ready to depart , " I am much obliged to you for what you have done . But I 'd like you to do more , if you will . As soon as this Bill Hosker comes back to this neighborhood let me know . You 'll always find me on board of the Helen Shalley . " " I 'll let you know , " answered Rose . " But do n't let Bill Hosker know who told you , or he 'll want to kill me . " When Randy got back to the steamboat he felt so weak he could scarcely walk on board . Jones came forward to meet him . " Say , you ai n't been drinking , have you ? " he demanded , as he saw our hero stagger . " No , I do n't drink , " answered Randy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And sitting down on a bench he told his story to the other deckhand , and let Jones feel of the lump on his head . " I was going to warn you when you went ashore , but I thought you 'd be wise enough to keep out of trouble . It 's a shame . " " They told me it would n't do any good to tell the police . " " I am afraid not . Such things happen pretty often in that kind of a neighborhood . " Randy was glad enough to turn in . He bathed the lump with cold water and put on some witch-hazel , which made it feel better . Despite the adventure he slept soundly until it was time to turn out in the morning . " I suppose you 'll want some money , " said Jones . " I can lend you a dollar till pay day , if you wish . " " Thank you , " returned Randy . " You are kind , and I 'll accept the loan . I 'll pay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate to be without a cent in my pocket . " " I have been there myself and know just how it feels , " answered Jones . He had , in his rough way , taken a fancy to our hero , which feeling was reciprocated . There was plenty to do before the steamboat left the dock at New York City , and Randy 's arms ached when the command came to cast off the lines . He had done his full share of the labor , and Pat Malloy nodded approvingly . " Kape it up an ' you 'll be all roight , " said the head deckhand . The trip to Albany that day had much of novelty in it for Randy . There was a good deal of work , of which he had not dreamed before , yet there were also times when he could look at the scenery as the big craft glided along . At the newsstand on board there was a big folding map of the river , showing the different towns and points of interest , and this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the map closely and was soon able to recognize certain points as they appeared . Several days slipped by and Randy felt quite at home on board . He had been supplied with the regulation deckhand 's outfit ; dark blue shirt and trousers , and a cap to match , and looked very well when thus attired . He was getting acquainted with the work and could handle a trunk , or a box or barrel almost as well as Jones or Malloy . " How does the boy do ? " asked Captain Hadley of Malloy . " It 's the new broom as swapes clane , " answered the head deckhand . " I ai n't braggin ' yit , captain . " " But he is doing all right so far ? " " Aye , aye , sur -- very well indade . " " I am glad to hear it . Mr. Shalley told me the boy needed the job . His father is on the sick list , and he has got to do what he can to help support his parents . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Malloy . " He 's better than thim foreigners , anyway . " To him , the only foreigners were Italians and Germans . He did not think himself one , although he had come from the " ould sod " less than six years before . CHAPTER XVII THE PURSER HAS HIS SAY One night , when the steamboat was tied up at Albany , Randy donned his street clothes and hunted up the place where Jack Bartlett lived . He found his former friend at home and glad to see him . " Come in , " said Jack , shaking hands . " How have you been since we met last ? " " Pretty fair , Jack . And how have you been ? " " I 'm all right . I 've got a job . That is why I have n't used my boat pass . " " A job ? " " Yes , I am working in the same place where father has a position . " " Then you are not going to school again ? " " Not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , father is n't earning any too much , so I -- well , I thought I 'd help the family along . " The two friends sat down in the parlor and our hero told his tale , and then Jack related some of his own experiences . " My father is in hopes that he can get at Mr. Bangs before long , " said Jack . " The trouble is , some papers are missing . He had them in a desk at the works , but when he came away he could n't find them . " " Perhaps Mr. Bangs got them . " " It is possible , but father ca n't prove it . " " Have you seen or heard anything of Bob Bangs lately ? " " He is along the Hudson somewhere -- on a vacation with his mother . " " I met him when he was getting a horse , " answered our hero and told of what had happened . " I wish I had been there ! " cried Jack , laughing heartily . " I 'll wager Bob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . He must have had a good bill to pay for damages . " Randy spent a pleasant two hours with Jack and then went back to the boat , Jack promising to visit the craft some night when the Helen Shalley should tie up at Albany again . So far matters had gone well on board . Randy was much amused by the passengers , especially those who were peculiar in their manners . There was one fussy old gentleman who went up and down the river twice a week . He always wanted to sit in a corner in the shade and asked a dozen times a day if they were n't behindhand . " We are exactly on time , " said Randy , to him , one day . " Hum ! " cried the old gentleman , consulting a watch he carried . " I think we are twenty minutes behindhand . " " We have n't been twenty minutes behindhand since I 've been on the boat , " said Randy , as he moved off . The old gentleman grumbled to himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randy saw an Englishman saunter along the deck and stop close to the old gentleman . Randy had noticed the Englishman before , because he spoke with a strong Cockney accent -- that is , he dropped h 's where they were wanted and put them in when not needed . At this time the steamboat was just approaching the Highlands . The Englishman pointed to the Highlands with his cane and addressed the old gentleman . " Hexcuse me , " he said , " but are those the ' Ighlands you brag about in this country ? " " The islands ? " was the astonished reply . " Why , no , sir , those are not islands at all . Have you never studied geography ? An island is entirely surrounded by water , " continued the fussy old gentleman . " Oh , you mean hilands . I do n't mean them at all , do n't you know . I repeat , are those the ' Ighlands you talk about so much ? " went on the Cockney , blandly . " They are not islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just exactly what I said , sir -- the ' Ighlands . " " No , not islands -- Highlands . " " Hexactly . " " But you said islands . " " No , I did not say hilands , I said the ' Ighlands , " went on the Cockney . " Hevidently you do n't understand good , plain Henglish , " and he walked off in disgust . " The imp , the blithering imp , " growled the old gentleman . " May he never come near me again ! " At one of the landings a barrel for use on the boat broke , spilling some fancy flour on the deck . Randy was clearing up the muss when the purser , Peter Polk , came along . Our hero did not witness his approach , and consequently the purser received some dust on his shoes , which had just been polished . " Hi ! hi ! Have a care there ! " he cried . " What do you mean by covering me with dust ? " " Excuse me , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you coming . " " I just had those shoes shined ! " " I am sorry , sir . " " You 're the new man , eh ? " " Yes , sir . " " You 're a blockhead , it seems to me , " went on the purser , who was in particularly bad humor that day . An angry remark rose to Randy 's lips , but he repressed it . " You be more careful in the future , or you 'll get into trouble , " grumbled the purser , and walked away . The moment the purser was gone Jones came up to our hero . " Brute , ai n't he ? " he said , in a low voice . " He called me a blockhead . " Randy 's eyes were flashing . " Do n't you mind him , lad . He is sour all the way through -- he do n't seem to be able to help it . " " I did n't see him coming . " " He should have looked where he was walking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him , " went on Randy . " I do n't think Captain Hadley would have spoken so . " " Not a bit of it -- the captain 's a gentleman , every inch of him . " " How do he and the purser get along together ? " " None too good , so I 've been told . I wish we had a man in place of Polk . " " So do I. " " More than likely , when he comes to pay you your wages , he 'll take out the price of a shoe shine . " " Would he really be mean enough to do that ? " " Polk is about mean enough to do anything . " There the talk ended and Randy finished up his work . The day passed , and when the steamboat tied up that night Randy was more than usually sleepy . It was very warm , and he went on the upper deck to get a breath of fresh air . " See here , " said the purser , coming up to him rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Talking about you ? " repeated our hero , somewhat puzzled . " That is what I said . " " Not particularly , Mr. Polk . " " Somebody on this boat is telling tales about me , and I do n't like it . " To this Randy made no answer . " Have you heard any stories ? " went on Peter Polk . " What kind of stories ? " " That I was going to leave the steamboat ? " " No , sir . " " No stories at all ? " " No , sir . " " Humph ! " And with this the purser walked away . " What did he want now ? " asked Jones , coming up a little later . " Wanted to know if I had been circulating stories about him . " " Did you tell him no ? " " I did . " " I 've heard a story -- in a roundabout way -- that Mr. Shalley is getting tired of the way Polk runs the money matters on this boat . " " Does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purser 's business . He does the buying -- or most of it -- too . " " I see . " " I do n't believe he buys to advantage , " went on Jones , closing one eye suggestively . " I do n't understand . " " Maybe he buys at two prices -- some of ' em do , you know . " Randy did not know , but he did not say so . " I knew a purser once -- on the Sea Shell -- who used to pay one price for a thing and then charge the owners of the vessel another price . At last they caught him at it and sent him to prison . " This opened Randy 's eyes to what his fellow-deckhand was driving at . " Do you imagine Polk is that sort ? " " He is certainly close . " " So you said before . Well , he ought to be watched . " " Oh , it 's not my affair , " said Jones . " Say , I am going to bed , " he added . " So am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Jones had said and also of what the Clares had told him regarding Peter Polk . CHAPTER XVIII A MEETING ON THE RIVER Two weeks passed and Randy felt quite at home on board of the steamboat . He had learned his duties fully and was giving satisfaction to Captain Hadley and Pat Malloy . His only enemy seemed to be Polk the purser , who was as disagreeable as possible . Our hero did his best to steer clear of the fellow , and in a measure succeeded . One evening , while the boat was tied up at the dock in New York Randy chanced to look ashore when he saw Rose Clare motioning to him . He at once joined the girl . " I came down to tell you that Bill Hosker was around yesterday , " said the girl to our hero . " Is he around now ? " questioned Randy , quickly . " No , he went away yesterday evening . He was only around about two hours . " " I wish I had seen him . " " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down last night , but a man here told me you were at Albany . " " Yes , we come to New York every other night , not counting Sundays . " " I think Bill Hosker will come again soon . I suppose he thinks you have given up trying to find him . " " Well , I have n't given it up , Rose . How are things going with yourself and your mother ? " " Not very good . " " Ca n't she get much sewing to do ? " " She and I made only five dollars and a quarter last week . " " And what rent do you pay ? " " Six dollars a month for just the one room . " " That is certainly hard . I wish I could help you , but I can't -- at least , not now . " " We would n't want help , if only we could get more sewing . " " I 'll ask Captain Hadley about it . He has a wife and a family of girls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain the next day , when the officer appeared to have little to do . " Captain , may I speak to you a moment ? " he asked , respectfully , and at the same time tipping his cap . " What is it , Randy ? " " I know a poor lady in New York who does sewing for a living . She is anxious to get more work and I am anxious to help her , if I possibly can . Do you know of anybody who would like some sewing done -- your wife or anybody else ? " " Hm ! I do n't know , " answered the steamboat captain . " I 'll remember what you say and see . Is that all ? " " Yes , sir . " " Where does the poor woman live ? " " Not far from our landing place in New York . " He gave the street and number . " It is n't a nice neighborhood , but it is the best the woman can afford , " he added . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad neighborhoods simply because they can not afford something better . I will speak to my wife about this . " The captain did as he had promised . Mrs. Hadley was going to New York the next day and said she would call upon Mrs. Clare . The family lived in Albany , so that the captain was home every other night . Mrs. Hadley was as good as her word . She was a Christian woman , a worker in the church , and she became at once interested in Mrs. Clare and her daughter Rose . " This is no place for Rose , " said she . " This foul air is bad for her . " " I know it -- but I do not see how I can turn myself , " said Mrs. Clare , with a sigh . Poverty had completely broken her spirit . The captain 's wife looked over some of the sewing that Mrs. Clare had done and soon learned that the woman was a clever seamstress . Then she made an offer . " If you wish , you can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can sew for me , and Rose can go to school and also help around the house . I will give you five dollars a week and your board . " " I will accept gladly ! " cried the poor woman , and burst into tears of gratitude . It was arranged that Mrs. Clare should leave New York on the following Saturday . She was to sell off the most of her things -- alas ! there were not many articles to dispose of ! and the others were to be transferred to Albany on the boat . " My cousin , Mr. Polk , will be surprised to learn of this move , " said Mrs. Clare to the captain 's wife . " What , is he your cousin ? " queried Mrs. Hadley . " Yes , by marriage , " and then Mrs. Clare told her tale of suffering , to which the captain 's wife gave a willing ear . " I must speak of this to my husband , " said Mrs. Hadley . " I do not think he likes Mr. Polk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage from one side of the lower deck to the other when Peter Polk came along . As luck would have it , some trunks were in the way , so that the purser could not pass . " Look here , you blockhead , why do n't you keep this gangway clear ? " he roared to Randy . " I am trying to clear it now , " answered our hero , as calmly as he could . " It ought to be kept clear always . Who ordered this stuff here , anyway ? " " Mr. Malloy . " " He had no business to do it . " " Why did n't I , I 'd like to be after knowin ' ? " came in a voice from behind the purser , and the head deckhand appeared on the scene . " Oh , so you 're here , are you ? " sneered Peter Polk . " I am that , Mr. Polk . I ordered thim trunks there . Have ye anything against it ? " demanded Malloy , boldly . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're blocking the whole gangway . " " Thim trunks had to be shifted , an ' Thompson is shiftin ' ' em . " " Humph ! " " I know me juty on this boat , Mr. Polk . " " Well -- er -- hurry up then and clear this gangway , " grumbled the purser , and walked away . Malloy closed one eye and looked at Randy suggestively with the other . " He knew he had no right to interfere -- it 's not his line o ' juty , " said the head deckhand . Randy completed his work and then went to one of the upper decks , to fix some of the awnings . To his surprise he found Mrs. Clare and Rose there , in conversation with Peter Polk . " Going to Albany ? " the purser was saying . " What for ? " " I have a situation there , and Rose is going also , " answered the poor woman . " What kind of a situation ? " " I am to sew for Mrs. Hadley . " " Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this announcement the face of the purser dropped . Evidently the news did not please him . " You wo n't find that very pleasant , " he said . " It will be better than starving in the city , Peter . " " How much is she going to pay you ? " Mrs. Clare told him . " That is not a fortune . You ought to be able to earn more in New York . " " I could n't get the work . " " I might have gotten something for you , if you had let me know , " went on Peter Polk . " Thank you -- I prefer to look out for myself , " answered Mrs. Clare , coolly . " This looks as if I was letting one of my relatives live on charity , " pursued the purser . " I do not consider it a charity . " " How did the captain 's wife hear of you ? " " Why , she -- there is a boy on this boat -- there he is -- he spoke to the captain about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is his name . " " He got the place for you ? " " Yes . " " How did you happen to know him ? " " It 's a long story . He was knocked down and robbed and Rose and I went to his assistance . But we must go now . Mrs. Hadley wanted us to do some sewing for the captain while on this trip , " and Mrs. Clare walked away , followed by Rose . Peter Polk gazed after them thoughtfully . " I hope she does n't get the captain 's wife too much interested in her affairs , " he muttered to himself . " I should n't care to have the old accounts raked up in court . " CHAPTER XIX AN UNLOOKED-FOR ENCOUNTER It was now early in September and the travel down the river was particularly heavy , for many folks who had been away for a vacation were returning to the metropolis . Baggage kept pouring in until the lower deck was practically filled . " This is a banner season , so Malloy tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is lots of work , " answered our hero , whose arms ached not a little . " Never mind , I 've got good news . " " What is that ? " " Mr. Shalley is going to allow us an extra five dollars this month . " " Good enough . " Randy had received several letters from home . Matters were going smoothly and Mr. Thompson was feeling better every day . The garden was doing finely . In one letter Mrs. Thompson wrote that there had been two strikes at the iron works , each due to Mr. Bangs ' overbearing manner towards his workmen . " I thought he 'd have trouble sooner or later , " said Randy to himself , as he perused the communication . " What a pity that Mr. Bartlett is n't in charge . " One fine afternoon the Helen Shalley was steaming down the river as usual and Randy was near the bow , coiling up a hawser , when he noticed a sloop some distance ahead . It was tacking in an uncertain manner , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing such a craft . The sloop was directly in the path of the big steamboat , and the latter gave a warning whistle and then turned to one side . As she did this the sloop turned in the same direction . " Hullo ! What does that fellow in the sloop mean ? " cried Randy to Jones , who was near . " What 's the matter ? " " He 'll be run down if he does n't look out . " " Some fool that does n't know how to sail a boat , I guess , " said the other deckhand . Swiftly the steamboat and the sloop drew close to one another . The big boat let out another warning blast , and again the pilot turned her out of her course . But the sloop also turned . " There is only one young fellow on board , " said Jones . " Look , he acts as if he was scared out of his wits . " " I know him ! " fairly shouted our hero . " You do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich young fellow I told you about . " " The fellow who could n't manage his hoss ? " " The same . " " Well , he does n't seem to know no more about his boat than he did about that hoss , " was the deckhand 's comment . " We are going to run into him ! " gasped Randy . " No , he is going to run into us . " " It will amount to the same thing -- so far as he is concerned . " " Maybe -- but it will be his fault if he gets drowned . " Another warning whistle now rang out , but was of no avail . The sloop swerved again and then came squarely up to the big steamboat , which was now backing water furiously . " Stop ! Do n't run me down ! " screamed Bob Bangs . He was fairly white with terror . His cries were cut short by the crash as the sloop struck . The bow was splintered , and the shock threw Bob Bangs overboard . Luckily he was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shalley continued to go ahead despite the fact that her engines had been reversed . The first surprise over , Randy was quick to act . Not far away was a life preserver having a line attached to it and this he took from its hooks . He waited for the rich boy to appear . Soon he came up , spluttering . " Catch the preserver ! " called out our hero and cast the article in such a skillful manner that it fell within easy reach . " Save me ! Save me ! " gasped the rich youth , throwing his arms wildly about him . " Take hold of the life preserver ! " called out half a hundred people at once . Then several other cries rang out . At last the motion of the water washed the life preserver up against Bob Bangs ' arm . He clutched at it desperately . By this time the steamboat had come to a standstill , and it was an easy matter for Randy and Jones to pull the rich youth towards the vessel . Then a rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , dripping with water . Illustration " Well , young man , you had a narrow escape , " said Captain Hadley , as he pushed his way through the crowd to the spot . " I know it , and it 's all your fault ! " whined Bob Bangs . " My fault ? Nonsense ! " " You ran me down ! I 'll have the law on you for it . " " Do n't talk like a fool , young man . I was in the wheelhouse myself with the pilot and saw just how you acted . Evidently you do n't know much about handling boats . " " I know all about them , " insisted the rich youth . But this was a falsehood , as Randy well knew . Bob could row and that was about all . " You 'll have to pay for smashing my boat , " went on the rich boy , after a pause . " And you 'll have to pay for wetting my new suit , " he added , gazing ruefully at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll not get a cent out of me , " said Captain Hadley , firmly . " This accident was clearly of your own making . We gave you plenty of room , but you turned directly into our course twice . Be thankful that you were n't ground up under the paddle-wheel . " " Yes , and be thankful that Randy Thompson threw you a life preserver , " put in Jones . At the mention of our hero 's name Bob Bangs looked around in surprise . He had not noticed Randy before . " What , you here ! " he exclaimed and did not seem particularly happy over the meeting . " I am , " answered Randy . " Did you throw out that line with the preserver ? " asked the captain . " I did , sir , " and Randy touched his cap . " I am glad to know it , " and the captain 's face showed his appreciation of Randy 's prompt action . " What are you doing here -- in that outfit ? " asked Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this steamboat . " " Pooh ! a deckhand ! " and the rich boy 's nose went up into the air in disdain . He would give Randy no credit for helping to save his life . " Clear the deck , please ! " called out Captain Hadley , to the crowd that was pressing in on all sides . " The excitement is over . The boy is safe . " " I want you to put me ashore , " said Bob Bangs . " We 'll make a landing a mile below here , " said the Captain . " I do n't want to go to the next landing . " " Sorry , but we ca n't turn back , " answered Captain Hadley . " What about my boat ? " " We 'll take it in tow . " This was done , and in a few minutes the Helen Shalley had resumed her journey . Bob Bangs was led to one of the staterooms and offered a dry suit of clothes , which he put on . " I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What for ? " " As a matter of record . And remember , I want the clothing returned . " " Humph ! Maybe my father will sue you for damages ! " " If he does he will lose the case . " Inside of five minutes the next landing place was made , and Bob Bangs went ashore , taking his wet suit with him . The damaged sloop was tied up at the dock , and having discharged and taken on passengers and baggage the steamboat sped on her way once more . " He 's as mad as a wet hen , " said Jones to Randy . " And he ought to be thankful for having his life spared . " " He always was a mean sort of fellow , " answered our hero . " And his folks are just as mean as he is . " " Then maybe they will try to make trouble for the steamboat owner . " Amos Bangs did try to make trouble . Two days after the accident on the river Andrew Shalley received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you perhaps know , my son , Robert Bangs , was out on the Hudson on the 6th inst. , in his sloop , when , without any cause whatsoever , your steamboat , the Helen Shalley , ran into his boat , smashed it completely and put him in peril of his life . " I am a man of few words , sir , and I demand damages for this outrage . If you wish to settle , you may send me your check for one thousand dollars ; if not , I will sue you for that amount . " CHAPTER XX WHAT CAME OF A DEMAND The letter from Amos Bangs worried Andrew Shalley a little and he at once called on Captain Hadley , as soon as the steamboat made a landing at Nyack . " It seems you ran down a boy a few days ago , " said the steamboat owner . " He tried to run us down , " answered the captain , quietly . " Was he hurt ? " " Not in the least . " " His father wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay him a cent . " " Did you run him down ? " " No , he tried to run us down . " " This is no joke , Captain Hadley . " " I know it , Mr. Shalley . But to threaten us with a suit at law is absurd . I can bring a dozen witnesses to prove that the accident was entirely of the boy 's making . " " I am glad to hear that , " and Andrew Shalley breathed a sigh of relief . He did not care so much for the money , but he wanted to know that Captain Hadley was not to blame . " That boy acted like a little fool from beginning to end , " went on the captain of the steamboat and then told his story . Later Randy was called up , to relate what he had done , and also Jones . " If there is any trouble some of the passengers will testify for us , " said Captain Hadley , and mentioned half a dozen who had said they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The passengers were well-known citizens , whose testimony would be sure to carry weight in any court of law . Having satisfied himself that Amos Bangs had no case against him , the steamboat owner wrote to the rich manufacturer to that effect . By return mail he received this reply : " Your bluff will not work with me . You are to blame and must pay . If I do not receive your check for one thousand dollars by the middle of next week I shall bring suit . My son is now in bed and under the doctor 's care because of the accident . " " Humph ! Under the doctor 's care , eh ? " mused the steamboat owner . " This certainly seems to be serious after all . He will certainly make trouble for me even if he does n't win his case . " Again the steamboat owner interviewed Captain Hadley , and then the pair called in Randy , to learn what he could tell about the Bangs family in general . Our hero told all he knew , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Evidently he is a man to get money in any manner possible , " mused Andrew Shalley . " He will certainly bring suit . " " I do n't believe Bob is sick , " said Randy . " He must be shamming . " " I wish I knew for sure . " " Perhaps I can find out for you -- if you 'll give me a day or two off , " said our hero , struck by a sudden idea . " A good plan ! " cried Captain Hadley . " Let the lad see what he can do , by all means . " The matter was talked over , and the upshot was that on the next trip of the steamboat Randy went ashore at Catskill , near which town Bob Bangs and his mother were spending their vacation . From some men at the dock our hero was enabled to find out all about the damaged sloop , which had been returned to Catskill . It was to cost twenty dollars to put the craft in good condition again . " Those folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said one of the dock men . " It 's called the Sharon House . " " Thank you , " returned our hero . He was soon on the way to the Sharon House -- since demolished by fire . It did not take him long to cover the distance . As he approached he looked around for some signs of the Bangs family and presently espied Mrs. Bangs lounging in a hammock on a side veranda , reading a novel . " I wonder if it is possible that Bob is really in bed sick ? " he mused . " If he is it 's a wonder Mrs. Bangs is n't with him . But then I guess she is a selfish woman , anyway . " Randy walked around the hotel and down to the stable . Here he met a colored boy who helped around the horses . " Say , can you tell me where I can find Bob Bangs ? " he asked , boldly . " Bob Bangs jest went down to the ball grounds , " was the answer , which surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That way , " and the colored boy pointed with his hand . " I thought maybe Bob was sick . " " He ai n't sick -- he 's only pertendin ' , " answered the colored boy . Randy said no more but hurried off in the direction of the baseball grounds . Just as he came in sight of the place , he saw a figure ahead that looked familiar to him . " Unless I am mistaken , that is Bob , " he told himself , and hurried closer . It was indeed Bob Bangs , walking along as if nothing had ever happened to him . He was smoking a cigarette . He passed into the grounds and Randy did the same , and took a seat on a bench directly behind the rich youth . It was easy to see that Bob Bangs was not suffering physically . He smoked half a dozen cigarettes , and applauded as loudly as anybody when a good play was made . " Fine game , " said a man sitting next to Randy . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man and saw that he was evidently a merchant . " Excuse me , are you from Catskill ? " " I am . " " Do you want to do me a favor if I pay you for it ? " " Well , it wo n't be a favor if you pay me . " " I may want your assistance and I may not . Do you see that boy there ? " " Yes . " " He does n't look as if he was sick abed , does he ? " " Sick abed ? What sort of a game is this ? " and the merchant looked Randy over with much curiosity . " That boy 's father says he is sick in bed . I want to prove that it is n't so . " " What is the game , anyway ? " " He had an accident on the river and he wants damages from a man I work for . It is a put-up job . " " Oh ! I 've heard of such things before . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went down to the railroad and laid the blame on a train . He got five hundred dollars , but , later on , was found out and sent to prison for the deception . " " Well , this is n't exactly like that . Did n't you hear about a sloop running into the Helen Shalley a few days ago ? " " Oh , yes , a friend of mine , a passenger on the boat , told me about it . He said the boy did n't know how to handle the craft . " " Well , that is the boy . " " Indeed ! " " Does he act as if he was hurt or suffering ? " " Not in the least . " " Would you be willing to testify to that fact , if it came to law ? " " Certainly . " " Will you give me your name and address ? " " Here is my card , " and the merchant handed it over . He did not add that he occasionally sold Captain Hadley some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboat a service . The game was almost at an end when the ball was sent among the spectators . Seeing it coming towards him , Bob Bangs leaped up and tried to catch the sphere . It hit the tips of his fingers , stinging them greatly . Then the ball came towards Randy and he caught it and threw it back into the field . " What are you doing here ? " demanded Bob Bangs , as he caught sight of our hero . " Watching the game , " answered Randy , quietly . " Humph ! " " Pretty nice game , Bob . " " Humph ! " muttered the rich boy again . " I see you are feeling fine again . " " I am not -- I am real sick , " answered the rich boy , quickly . " Sick in bed , eh ? " went on our hero , with a grin . " I was in bed . " " Last night , I suppose . So was I. " " I 'm sick yet . " " You showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When did you come in ? " " Right after you . " " Humph ! Have you been watching me ? " " Yes . " " You might be in a better business , " sneered the rich boy . " I do n't think so . You need watching . You and your father want to cheat the steamboat company by pretending that you were hurt in that collision , and here you are as well and hearty as ever , " added Randy in a loud voice , so that those nearby might hear . " I ai n't well -- I 'm sick . " " You said that before -- but nobody will believe it . " " You 're well enough to go to a ball game and yell and smoke cigarettes , anyway , " put in the merchant sitting next to Randy . A good play brought forth a cheer from the crowd which drowned out further talk . In the midst of the temporary excitement Bob Bangs sneaked from the stand and from the ball grounds . " He feels sick over this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sue the steamboat company for that sickness , " laughed our hero in return . CHAPTER XXI RANDY VISITS HIS HOME As soon as he returned to the steamboat , Randy acquainted Captain Hadley with all he had seen and heard and gave the captain the card of the merchant . " You have done well , Randy , " said the master of the steamboat . " I fancy this will cook Mr. Amos Bangs 's goose . " At Nyack , Mr. Shalley came on board and heard what our hero had to say . " I am glad you have a witness , " said he . " I have heard of Mr. Budmister before . " " A good business man , " said Captain Hadley . " He will make a good witness -- if the case comes to a trial . " But it never did come to a trial . Andrew Shalley received one letter from a lawyer , threatening the suit , and in return wrote back the particulars of what Randy had learned , and added that if he heard any more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy to defraud . There the matter ended . The captain was so pleased that when Randy asked for a three-days ' leave of absence , that he might visit his home , it was readily granted . The boy was also given some extra pay for his work at Catskill . Randy 's homecoming brought a warm smile to the faces of his father and his mother . His mother kissed him tenderly and his father shook hands . " How are you feeling , father ? " " I am almost well , Randy . I expect to go to work next week . " " But not in a cellar , " said the son , quickly . " No , Mr. Jackson is going to build a wing on his house and has given me the whole contract . " " That is good . " " I will be able to make more money than if I was working for a boss , " went on Mr. Thompson . " Well , you wo n't be sorry for that , " said Randy , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely . The late vegetables were coming in well and their neighbor , Jerry Borden , had given them a helping hand . " Say , you 're a-gittin ' to be a regular sailor , ai n't you ? " said Sammy to Randy . " Hardly a sailor , " answered Randy , with a laugh . " I am a steamboat deckhand . " " It 's about the same thing . Wish I was a sailor . " " Maybe if you sailed on the ocean you 'd get seasick , Sammy . " " I would n't , nuther . I was readin ' about Robinson Crusoe once . I wish I was cast away on a barren island . It would be lots of fun . " " Especially if you had nothing to eat and to drink . " " Oh , I 'd get something from the ship , as Crusoe did . " " If the ship did n't go down in the middle of the ocean . " " When I was on the island I 'd sleep every morning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do if the savages came after you ? " " I 'd fight and kill them all -- that is , all but one . I 'd want that one for my man Friday . " " He ai n't going to be no sailor , " broke in Mrs. Borden , who overheard the conversation . " He is going out to hunt eggs an ' he is a-goin ' to do it right now , or I 'll get the whip . " " I 'll get the eggs , " answered Sammy , and hurried off without further delay . " That boy is crazy to go somewhere all the time , " said Mrs. Borden . " He does n't seem to like the farm a bit . " " Better let him look for work somewhere , " said Randy . " Maybe it will cure him of some of his notions . " " Maybe , " sighed the mother . All too soon Randy 's visit had come to an end . He remained at the little farm over Sunday , going to church with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson River early Monday morning . Several days passed quietly and once more our hero fell into his routine work . Jones was sick , so the deckhands had a little more to do than usual . Randy pitched in with vigor , much to the satisfaction of Malloy and Captain Hadley . One day , while handling baggage at the dock in New York , Randy was surprised to see Amos Bangs and a stranger come aboard . He soon lost sight of the pair and did not see them again until the middle of the afternoon , when he discovered them in a corner of the cabin , talking earnestly . " It is queer Mr. Bangs should use this boat -- after his quarrel with Captain Hadley and Mr. Shalley , " said our hero to himself . He had occasion to pass the pair a little later and was surprised to hear the name of Mr. Bartlett mentioned . " Do n't worry ; we 'll down Bartlett easily enough , " said the strange man , a fellow with bushy black whiskers . " I hope so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be saying about Jack 's father , and remembering what he had heard in the past , Randy walked outside of the cabin and close to a window which was wide open . From this point he could hear what was said without being seen very readily . " I do n't like the way matters are standing , " he heard Amos Bangs say . " We must make our position more secure , Tuller . " " I do n't see how we are to do it , " answered the man with the heavy whiskers . " I wish I could get Bartlett to sell his stock and sign over all his interest . " " Can you do that without making him suspicious of what is going on ? " " Humph ! He is suspicious already , that 's the trouble . " " Does he know about the deal with Kastner ? " " I think not . " " It will be a blow , when he hears of it . " " I do n't intend he shall hear of it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd go ahead . " " Ca n't you get him ? " " Get him ? I do n't dare breathe a word to him . " Amos Bangs laughed . " And the funny part of it is , Bartlett thinks Robinson is in with us . " " You are sure of that ? " " Dead certain . " " Then you must keep Bartlett and Robinson apart . " " If I can . " " What did you do with the papers you took from Bartlett 's desk ? " " They are in my safe at home . " " Why do n't you destroy them ? " " I will , some time . " " It is dangerous to leave them around . " " I am the only person who knows the combination of the house safe . The papers ca n't get out without me . " So the talk ran on for a good hour , during which time Randy heard many things which appeared to be of value to Mr. Philip Bartlett . Then the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the last our hero saw of them until they left the boat , half an hour later . The talk he had heard set Randy to thinking . Plainly Amos Bangs and his companion were a pair of rascals and were trying to defraud Mr. Bartlett out of some if not all of his belongings . " I 'll have to call on Mr. Bartlett and tell him what I have heard , " Randy told himself . " See here ! " called out Peter Polk , striding up as Randy was going to the lower deck . " What are you loafing around here for ? " " I am going below now , " answered our hero . " You ca n't shirk your work that way , Thompson . " The purser came closer . " Listen , " he whispered . " After this you keep your nose out of my business . " " I did n't know I had my nose in your business , Mr. Polk . " " Oh , you ca n't fool me , Thompson . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how I was treating my relatives . " " You mean the Clares ? " " Of course I do . After this you keep your mouth shut , " pursued the purser . " If you don't -- well , you 'll wish you had , that 's all . " And Peter Polk went away in extremely bad humor . CHAPTER XXII MR . BARTLETT MAKES A MOVE As soon as the boat had tied up at Albany , and his work was at an end , Randy attired himself in his best and took a street car for the residence of the Bartletts . It was a humble place on a side street , quite in contrast to the fine residence the family had occupied in Riverport . " Hullo , Randy ! " cried Jack , as he came to the door to answer our hero 's ring . " This is a surprise . Walk right in . Did you send word that you were coming ? " " I did not , Jack . Is your father home ? " " Yes , he is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Had your supper ? " " Yes , I got a bite before I left the boat . " " All right -- otherwise I know mother will welcome you at our table . " Jack went off to tell his father , and presently Mr. Bartlett walked in . He looked rather care-worn and tired . Evidently his new situation was a hard one to fill and did not agree with him . " How do you do , Randy ? " said Mr. Bartlett . " Glad to see you . Jack says you want to see me . " " I do , Mr. Bartlett . Can I talk to you in private ? " " Certainly . Come into the parlor . " Mr. Bartlett led the way and closed the door . Then both sat down . " I want to tell you something about Mr. Bangs and a man named Tuller , " began Randy . " They were on the boat to-day and I overheard some of their talk . " " Tuller , eh ? " said Mr. Bartlett , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated the talk he had heard . Jack 's father listened with keen interest . He was astonished when Randy mentioned the papers which had been abstracted from his desk . " So Bangs has them in his safe at home , eh ? " he cried . " Well , I am going to get them , be the cost what it may . They belong to me , and I am going to take them no matter where I find them . " He was equally astonished to hear that a certain Mr. Robinson was not acting with Amos Bangs and certain other men , Tuller included . " They gave me to understand that Robinson was with them , " said Philip Bartlett . " If Robinson will only act with me , perhaps I can do a great deal . " " Then why do n't you write to Mr. Robinson and find out ? " " I will go and see him . " " Oh , then he lives here . " " No , in Springfield . But our works are going to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample time . Randy , I am very thankful to you for bringing me this news . " " I hope it does you some good , Mr. Bartlett . " " I think it will . Perhaps I 'll only be able to scare Bangs , but that may make him careful , so I can get something out of my stock in the iron works company . " " If you ever want me as a witness I will do what I can for you . " " Thank you , my lad ; you are kind and I will remember what you say . " After that Mrs. Bartlett and Jack came in and learned something of what had brought our hero to the house . " Good for you , Randy ! " cried Jack . " Father , if I were you , I 'd break into old Bangs 's safe . " " Pray do nothing rash , " pleaded Mrs. Bartlett . " Remember he is rich and has many friends . " " He is certainly rich , " said Randy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them are too overbearing . " " Bangs broke into father 's private desk and took the papers , " went on Jack . " It would be only tit for tat to break open the safe and get the papers back . " " I shall see Robinson first and then make up my mind what to do , " answered his father . Randy spent a pleasant evening with Jack , and when it came time to go to the boat Jack walked half the distance with our hero . " I wish father could get what is due him , " said Jack on the way . " He ca n't stand the hard work he is now doing . " The next morning Randy sailed down the river on the steamboat . Twenty-four hours later Mr. Bartlett crossed the Hudson and took a train for Springfield . He hoped to find Mr. Robinson at one of the banks and he was not disappointed . The bank official -- for such Mr. Robinson was -- listened with interest to all Philip Bartlett had to tell . He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected as much , " said he . " I was given to understand that Bangs had bought you out . I could n't understand it either , for you once told me that you did not wish to leave the works . I have just gotten back from a trip to Europe and have a good deal to attend to here , but I will take this matter up as soon as I possibly can . " " And you will stand in with me ? " asked Mr. Bartlett , anxiously . " If you wish it . " " I do . " " Then we must act together . " " And what would be your advice regarding those papers in Bangs 's private safe at his house ? " " Get out a search warrant and take a professional safe man along , to open the strong box , " answered the bank official , promptly . " And do not delay either . He may take it into his head to burn the papers up . " " I will do as you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-time will power had come back to him and he lost not a moment in carrying out his plans . He visited a firm dealing in safes and from them got the address of a man who claimed to be able to open any ordinary safe made . Then he called on this individual . " You open safes ? " he asked . " I do -- if I have the proper authority , " answered the man . " Can you open a first-class house safe ? " " Yes . " " How long will it take ? " " From five minutes to three hours . " " What are your charges ? " " Ten to fifty dollars . I 'll have to see the safe before I can set a definite figure . " " Will you be at liberty to-morrow ? " " I 'll be at your service if you engage me now . " " Very well , you may consider yourself engaged . I wish you to meet me in Riverport at about noon . " " Your own safe ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " I think so . I 've got to go to court to get it , though . " " Ah ! a legal case , eh ? " " Yes . You do n't object , do you ? " " Oh , no , I have many legal cases . Had to force a safe for some lawyers in Bridgeport only last week . " " You will not disappoint me ? " " Not at all , Mr. Bartlett . " With this understanding Philip Bartlett left the safe opener and took a train back to his home . But , as it happened , a certain man saw him leaving the safe opener 's office . This man was none other than Tuller , the friend to Amos Bangs . " Bartlett , eh ? " murmured Tuller to himself . " What is he doing in Springfield ? " He chanced to know the safe opener , whose name was Westinghouse , and presently dropped into the other 's office as if by accident . " How is business , Westinghouse ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer . " Had two jobs last week . " " Good enough . " " How is business with you ? " " Booming . I suppose you get jobs ahead , is that it , or do you go out on the run , so to speak ? " " Sometimes I get orders ahead , but most of the jobs come in on the run -- safe out of order , or something like that . I 've got to go to Riverport to-morrow . " " Is that so ? Bank ? " " No , a private party , I reckon . Going to have a safe opened by an order from the court , I think . " " Is that so ! Well , I wish you luck on the job . Good-day . " " Good-day ! " answered the safe opener . Once on the street Tuller 's face changed . " Bartlett must have given that order , and if so he means to either open up the safe at the iron works or else the safe at Bangs 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing is found which will do us harm ! " At first he thought to telegraph , but then came to the conclusion that it would be too risky . A letter might not be received in time . " I 'll go myself , " he said , and an hour later was on his way to Riverport . CHAPTER XXIII THE PAPERS IN THE SAFE At Riverport the next day Mr. Bartlett called upon a lawyer with whom he was well acquainted and told to the legal gentleman all that he had learned and proposed to do . " I wish your assistance , Mr. Soper , " he said . " You shall have it , " was the lawyer 's prompt answer . " Can you get an order from the court to open that safe ? " " I believe I can . Come , we will go and see the judge at once . " Fortunately for Mr. Bartlett the judge was easily found , and when the matter was explained he issued the necessary papers and placed them in the hands of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the safe if it is locked ? " asked the judge . " Constable Carley is not equal to it . " " I have engaged a professional safe opener , " answered Mr. Bartlett . " He can do the trick for the constable . " " Very well . " Mr. Bartlett , the lawyer , and the constable waited until the stage came in . The safe opener was one of the passengers and at once joined the crowd and was introduced . In the meantime Jasper Tuller had also arrived in Riverport . In the morning he lost no time in calling at the iron works . " I want to see Mr. Bangs , " he said , to the clerk who came to wait on him . " Sorry , sir , but Mr. Bangs went out of town late last night . " " When will he be back ? " " Not until some time this afternoon -- possibly not until evening . " " Where did he go ? I must communicate with him at once . " " He went to Rochester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered the clerk . Jasper Tuller groaned in spirit . Could he have telegraphed to Amos Bangs he would have done so , but the telegram would have remained at the office awaiting a call . " I must make a move on my own account , if I can , " he muttered . He called a carriage and was driven to the Bangs mansion . A servant answered his rather impatient ring at the front door . " Is anybody at home ? " he asked , abruptly . " Mr. Bangs has gone away , sir . " " I know that , " he snapped . " Is Mrs. Bangs at home ? " Now it happened Mrs. Bangs had come home the night before , intending to go away again two days later . But she had given orders that she wished to see no one . " I -- I do n't know , " said the servant girl . " I can see . What is the name ? " " Jasper Tuller . It is highly important that I see somebody of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Bangs was in an upper hallway and overheard the talk . She knew her husband had had some trouble with a book agent over the payment of a bill and took Tuller to be that person . " A gentleman to see you , Mrs. Bangs , " said the maid . " He is very anxious about it . " " I can not see anybody , " returned the fashionable woman , coldly . " Tell him I am not at home . " The girl went down into the hallway , where she had left Jasper Tuller standing . " Mrs. Bangs is not at home , sir . You will have to call some other time . " " Is Mr. Bangs 's son at home ? " " No , sir ; he is away for the summer . " " When will Mrs. Bangs be back ? " " I ca n't say , sir . " " It is too bad . The matter is very important . I came all the way from Springfield to see Mr. Bangs . They told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see him or his wife on business . Have you any idea where I can find Mrs. Bangs ? " The girl hesitated . " N -- no , sir , " she faltered . Mrs. Bangs was listening as before and now realized that something unusual was in the air . She slipped down a back stairs and out of a rear door . Then she came around to the front piazza just as the door opened to let Tuller out . " Mamie , who is this ? " she asked , looking at the servant girl meaningly . " Are you Mrs. Bangs ? " asked Jasper Tuller , quickly , and , as she nodded , he continued : " I am glad you have come . I am Jasper Tuller , one of the stockholders in the iron works . Perhaps you have heard your husband mention my name . " " I have , Mr. Tuller . What can I do for you ? " " I would like to see you in private "  - -  this with a side glance at the servant girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuller , " and the fashionable woman led the way to that apartment . Then the door was carefully closed . " Something is wrong , " said the servant girl to herself . " I wonder what it can be ? " She was of a decidedly inquisitive nature and not above playing the eavesdropper . She tiptoed her way to the library door and listened intently , while at the same time applying her eye to the keyhole . " Now , what is it , Mr. Tuller ? " asked Mrs. Bangs , after the door to the library was shut . " Briefly , it is this , " said the visitor . " Your husband has certain papers in his safe -- papers which belong to another man ,  - -  Philip Bartlett . " " Proceed . " " I warned him to destroy the papers but he has not done so . Now Mr. Bartlett is going to come here , force open your safe , and take the papers away . " " Come here -- force our safe ! " gasped the fashionable woman . " He dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it legally , I presume . " " You mean he will bring an officer of the law here ? " " Yes . If those papers are found it will look black for your husband , for he has no right to have them in his possession . " " Oh , Mr. Tuller , what shall I do ? " " It is easy enough . Open the safe , take out the papers , and put them where they can not be found . " " Yes , but I do not know how to open the safe ! " " Do n't you know the combination ? Your husband said something about that , but I felt there must be some mistake . " " I did know the combination once , but I believe I have forgotten it , " went on the fashionable woman . She knitted her brows . " Let me see . It was three 9 's , I remember -- 9 , 18 , and 27 . " " Yes ! yes ! And what else . See if you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , but also for myself and others . " " I am trying to think . Let me see -- yes , there was a 2 and a 3 and then another 2 ,  - -  I mean so many times around . " " I believe I understand , Mrs. Bangs . You mean twice around to 9 , three times around to 18 , twice to 27 , and then off at 0 . " " Yes , yes , that is it ! " burst out the lady of the mansion . " How clever some men are ! " and she beamed on her visitor , who chanced to be well dressed and not bad-looking . " If that is correct , I 'll soon have the safe open , " said Jasper Tuller , and walked over to where the strong box stood , in a corner of the apartment . The lady of the mansion hovered near while Jasper Tuller got down on his knees and began to try the combination . He had to work the knob all of a dozen times before the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , as the contents of the safe stood revealed . " Do you see the papers , or rather , do you know them ? " asked Mrs. Bangs . " I will know them -- if I can lay eyes on them , " was the reply , as Tuller began to rummage around in the safe . The papers were sorted out in different piles and he went through each pile as rapidly as possible . Presently he found what he wanted . " Here they are ! " he cried in triumph , as he held them up . CHAPTER XXIV ANOTHER HIDING PLACE Mrs. Bangs breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the papers . " You are certain you are right , Mr. Tuller ? " she asked , anxiously . " Yes . " " Where did those papers come from ? " " Mr. Bartlett 's desk at the iron works . " " As they were in my husband 's safe I think you ought to give them to me . " " I will do so , Mrs. Bangs . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Trust me for that . " " The officers of the law may search the whole house . " " Dare they do such a thing ? " " Yes , but if everything is found square your husband can sue Bartlett for damages , " and Jasper Tuller chuckled loudly . " It will be a good joke on him . " " There are no more of the papers ? " " I will take another look and make sure . " This was done , but no more papers belonging to Philip Bartlett could be found . Then the safe was locked once more . " I will put these papers away at once , " said Mrs. Bangs and left the library with the documents in her hand . She was gone all of five minutes and came back smiling quietly to herself . " Now they are safe , " she said . " Nobody can possibly find them . " " I am glad to hear it , " answered Tuller . " Now I had better be going -- before Bartlett appears . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will not . " " And another thing , Mrs. Bangs . Pretend not to know how to open the safe . That will compel them to break it open , and your husband 's case against Bartlett will be so much stronger . " " I shall follow your advice , Mr. Tuller . But look , somebody is coming already ! " went on the fashionable woman , as a carriage turned in from the road and came toward the horse block . " I must get out of this ! Can I go by a back door ? " " To be sure , " said Mrs. Bangs , and showed the way . As Tuller slipped out and passed toward the back road where Randy had had an encounter with Bob Bangs , there came a ring at the front door . " Good-morning , Mrs. Bangs , " said Mr. Bartlett . " Is your husband at home ? " " He is not , " answered the fashionable woman , coldly . " I 've got a search warrant for this place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he proceeded to read the document aloud . " This is an outrage ! " cried Mrs. Bangs , with assumed dignity . " An outrage , and you shall pay dearly for it , Mr. Bartlett . My husband is no thief , to steal your papers . " " Perhaps not , " answered Philip Bartlett . " Nevertheless , I am going to have his safe searched and also this house . " " Well , since you have the law on your side , go ahead . But you shall answer to my husband for this indignity . " The constable began his work , and the safe opener approached the strong box and inspected it . " Can you open it ? " asked Mr. Bartlett , anxiously . " With ease , " was the answer . " This is one of the old-style safes . " " How much will it cost ? " " Ten dollars . " " Then go ahead . " The safe opener was soon at work . He turned the knob around slowly , listening intently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the door to the safe came open without an effort . Mrs. Bangs was disappointed . She had expected that the safe would have to be blown open in the most approved burglar fashion , and was wondering what bill for damages she could render . " You must have known the combination , " she said , tartly , to the safe opener . " This is my business , " was the quiet answer . The constable , with Mr. Bartlett 's aid , went through all the papers in the safe . Of course the all-important documents were not found . " Well ? " asked the lawyer , after a long wait . " They are not here , " replied Mr. Bartlett . He felt sick at heart over his failure to bring the papers to light . " Not here ! " " No , they must have been removed . " The library was searched , and then a look was taken through the whole house . Mrs. Bangs followed the men everywhere . " You shall suffer for this outrage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I presume I shall have to stand for what I have done , " he answered , meekly . " Of one thing I am certain , Mrs. Bangs . Your husband has those papers , or else he has destroyed them . " " You can say what you please , Mr. Bangs is an honest man and a gentleman , " retorted the fashionable woman . At last there was nothing left to do but to leave the mansion , which Mr. Bartlett did with reluctance . " I am afraid I have made a mess of it , " he said to his lawyer . " I was certain we would find those papers . " " I am afraid you have hurt your case , Mr. Bartlett , " answered the legal light , bluntly . " Bangs will now be on his guard and will take good care to keep those papers away from you . " " Perhaps he has destroyed them . " " That is not unlikely , since it would do him small good to keep them . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better wait and see what develops , " said the lawyer . The safe opener and the constable were paid off and Philip Bartlett returned to Albany in anything but a happy frame of mind . A day or two later he called upon Randy , when the steamboat tied up at the dock for the night . " My fat is in the fire , " he said to our hero , and told of his failure to locate the missing documents . " Mr. Bartlett , I am sure Mr. Bangs said the papers were in his safe ! " cried Randy . " He must have taken them out when he returned home . " " You can be a witness if the matter is brought into court ? " " Of course . I remember very well all I heard . " " Well , that is something , " answered Philip Bartlett , hopefully . He went home and the next day received a strong letter from Amos Bangs denouncing him for the action he had taken . Part of the letter ran as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not wish to drag you into court on account of your wife and family . In the future you need expect no favors from me . I am done with you . If you want to sell your stock in the iron company I will give you the market price , not a cent more . Remember , I shall be on my guard against you in the future , and if you dare to molest me again you shall take the consequences . " " He will do what he can to ruin us , " said Mrs. Bartlett when her husband read the letter to her . " I suppose so . " " What is the market price of the stock ? " " It has no regular market value now . Bangs will buy it for about ten cents on the dollar . " " Oh , Philip , that is so little ! " " I 'll not sell the stock , " said Mr. Bartlett . " I 'd rather lose every cent than play into Amos Bangs 's hands ! " CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Albany buying a new pair of shoes when he met Rose Clare , who was also doing some shopping for her mother . " Oh , Randy , how do you do ! " cried the girl , running up and shaking hands . " Very well , Rose , " he answered . " You look well . " " Oh , I am feeling splendid . " " It did you good to get out of New York . " " Indeed it did , and mamma is ever so much better too . " " I am glad to hear that . Do you like it at Captain Hadley 's home ? " " Yes , mamma and Mrs. Hadley have become great friends . " " Do you go to school ? " " Yes . And , oh , I ' most forgot to tell you . I got a letter from New York to-day . It was from another girl , one who lived in the house with us . She says Bill Hosker has come back to that neighborhood . " " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " " Then I am going to hunt him up . " " Oh , Randy , please do n't get into any more trouble , " pleaded Rose . " He has got to give back my money , or take the consequences . " " You know what a ruffian he is ! " " I will be on my guard this time , Rose , and maybe I 'll take a friend along , " added our hero . When he returned to the steamboat he told Jones about what he had heard . Jones was now feeling very well once again , and he readily volunteered to go with Randy and hunt up Hosker as soon as the boat got to the metropolis . Then Pat Malloy got wind of what was up and said he would go too . " It 's no use of going to the police wid such a mather , " said the head deckhand . " We 'll bring the rascal to terms ourselves . " It was a clear , cool night when the landing was made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then made off for the neighborhood where Randy had been attacked . " Here is the spot where I was first robbed , " said our hero , and pointed it out . They walked around the neighborhood for nearly an hour , and were growing somewhat disheartened when Randy gave a cry : " There he is ! " " You are sure ? " asked Jones . " Yes . " " Let me speak to him first . Then we 'll know there ai n't no mistake , " went on Jones . Randy was willing and he and Malloy dropped behind . Bill Hosker had just come out of a saloon and was wiping off his mouth with the back of his hand . He turned down a side street . " Hullo there , Bill Hosker ! " cried Jones , pleasantly . The bully and thief swung around on his heel and looked at the deckhand in perplexity . " Who are you ? " he asked , roughly . " Am I right ? Is this Bill Hosker ? " " Dat 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see , " said Jones and beckoned for the others to come up . When the street ruffian saw Randy his face changed color and he wanted to run away , but Jones grabbed him and so did Malloy . As both were powerful men , Hosker was as a kitten in their grasp . " Youse fellers let me go ! " " I want you to give up the money you took from me , " said Randy . " I do n't know you , young feller ! " " Yes , you do . Will you give up the money or not ? " " I ai n't got no cash . " " Then you 'll come to the station house with me . " " I bet yer I wo n't ! " cried Bill Hosker . He started to struggle when Jones hauled off and slapped him hard on the right ear . " Now be good , or I 'll shove a few of your teeth down your throat , " said the deckhand . " This ai n't no foolin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quick about it . If you do n't give up I 'll maul you so your own mother wo n't know you ! " Bill Hosker was thoroughly alarmed . He did not mind going to the station house but he did mind a good drubbing , and he saw that those who held him were in no mood to be trifled with . " Say , let us straighten dis t'ing out , " said he at length . " I want my money , " answered Randy . " Will yer drop de matter if I cough up de cash ? " " Yes . " " All right den . How much was it ? " " Four dollars and eighty cents . " The street ruffian pulled a small roll of bills from his pocket . " Dare you are , " he said , as he passed over five dollars . " Youse kin keep de change . " Randy took the bills and stowed them away in his pocket . " I 'll give the change to some poor person , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are ye done wid de rascal ? " asked Malloy . " Yes . " " Well , I 'm not , " answered the head deckhand . " And neither am I , " added Jones . And then both hauled off and let Bill Hosker have it , right and left . The street ruffian had one eye blackened and a tooth knocked out , and went down in a heap more than dazed . " Let that teach you a lesson , " said Jones . " It 's better nor a month in jug , " was Pat Malloy 's comment . " The state wo n't have to feed the blackguard . " Randy had already walked on and his friends joined him , and all hurried back to the steamboat . It was several minutes before Bill Hosker got up . " I 'd like ter kill dem fellers ! " he muttered . He hurried for the nearest saloon , where he tried to drown his troubles in drink . In the saloon were several who knew him , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought on another quarrel , and as a consequence both men were pushed out of the drinking resort . They continued to fight on the sidewalk , until a policeman came along and tried to stop them . Then Hosker attacked the officer , and as a consequence was placed under arrest . The next day he was brought up in court and sentenced to a year in prison for his misdeeds . " I do n't think he 'll forget us , " said Jones , as the steamboat was reached . " Maybe he will lay for us , " said Randy . " Well , we can kape our eyes open , " put in Pat Malloy . " I shall not visit that neighborhood again , " said our hero . " Now I have my money back I am satisfied . " " New York has altogether too many such toughs , " put in Jones . " The police ought to clean them all out . When I first came here I was attacked in my boarding place on the Bowery . " " Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but he did n't succeed . I played a neat trick on him . " " What did you do ? " " I had a roll of bills and these I placed in an inside pocket . I also had an imitation bank-bill -- one of these advertisements you often see . Well , I took a small roll of paper and put the imitation bill around it , and put the roll in my vest pocket . The would-be thief got the roll and ran off with it . " " He must have been angry when he saw how he had been duped , " laughed Randy . " I did n't see that fellow again for nearly six months . Then I met him on the steamboat where I was working . When he saw me he sneaked out of sight in a hurry , I can tell you . " " Did you follow him up ? " " I tried to , but I did n't see him again until we were making a landing . Then I tried to grab him , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his legs could carry him , " concluded the deckhand . CHAPTER XXVI NEW TROUBLES On the following day Randy noticed that Peter Polk seemed unusually sour and thoughtful . " Something has gone wrong with him , that is certain , " thought our hero . " I wonder what it can be ? " He did his best to keep out of the way of the purser and succeeded until nightfall . But then , when he was carrying an extra heavy trunk , Peter Polk got in his way and made him stumble and drop the piece of baggage . The trunk was split open at one end and some of the contents fell on the deck . It was a lady 's trunk , filled with feminine wearing apparel , and a good many passengers laughed . " What do you mean by running into me , you blockhead ! " cried the purser , in a loud voice . " Why do n't you look where you are going ! " " It was not my fault , " answered Randy , warmly , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me drop that trunk . " " I did not . It was your own clumsiness . " " No , sir , " said our hero , firmly ; and a crowd began to collect . " Do n't dare to contradict me ! " fumed the purser . " It was your fault , and the damage shall come out of your wages . " " Mr. Polk , it was not my fault and I shall not stand for the damage done . " " Ha ! you defy me , eh , you cub ! Go on about your work and I 'll settle with you later . " " What is the trouble here ? " asked Captain Hadley , coming up through the crowd . " The blockhead of a boy dropped that trunk and broke it open . " " He ran into me and made me drop it , " retorted our hero . He felt just reckless enough to stand up for his rights , be the consequences what they might . " Put the trunk to one side , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have no time to waste on this just now . Get that other baggage ashore . " " My trunk ! " shrieked the maiden lady , rushing forward . " Oh , who broke my trunk ? " " It was an accident , madam . " " And all my dresses spilt out , too ! I shall sue the steamboat company for damages . " " We will settle with you , madam . I am sorry it happened , " went on the captain , soothingly . " It was a mean thing to do , " said the maiden lady and began to weep . " Two of those dresses are brand-new . " " I guess they are not injured much . " Randy and the others had gone to work again . Our hero 's thoughts were busy . " I believe Polk ran into me on purpose , " he whispered to Jones . " Maybe he wants to get you discharged , " answered the other deckhand . " I do n't see why . " " He 's down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think so ? " " Sure . He hated it worse than poison , for the captain now knows just how meanly he acted towards the widow . " The damaged trunk was passed over to a man on the dock and after some excited talk the maiden lady accepted ten dollars , with which to have the box repaired and her things put in proper order . It was more than was actually coming to her and she went off secretly pleased . In the meantime one of the passengers , an elderly man who traveled on the line a great deal , went to Captain Hadley . " What is it , Mr. DeLong ? " asked the master of the vessel , kindly . " I wish to speak to you about that trunk that was broken open . " " What of it ? " " I saw the accident . I was standing quite near at the time . " " Well ? " " I take an interest in that young deckhand of yours -- he has done me several small favors from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smashed , and I wanted you to know it . " " How did it happen ? " " Your purser got in the way and made the boy stumble . To me it looked as if the purser did it on purpose . " " This is interesting , Mr. DeLong . But I do n't see why the purser should do such a thing . " " Neither do I , excepting he may have a grudge against the boy . " " Humph ! " The captain grew thoughtful . " I will investigate this . " " Do so , and believe me , the boy is not to blame , " said the elderly passenger , and withdrew . As soon as the end of the trip came , and the work on deck was finished , Randy was called to the captain 's office . " Now what have you to say about that smashed trunk , Thompson ? " " I am not to blame , Captain Hadley , " answered our hero , and told exactly how the incident had occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " " He ran into me and made me drop the trunk . If I had n't dropped the trunk I would have fallen down with the box on the top of me , and gotten hurt . " " This is a strange statement , Thompson . Why should Mr. Polk run into you ? " " He hates me , because through me your family learned how he had treated Mrs. Clare when he helped to settle her husband 's affairs . " This threw a new light on the matter and the captain nodded slowly and thoughtfully . " I did not think this of Mr. Polk . " " I think he hopes I 'll lose my job , " went on our hero . " He continually calls me a blockhead , just to get me mad . I think he 'd like to see me lose my temper and pitch into him , and then he could get me my walking papers . " " I think I will have to put the damage to the trunk down to the regular expense account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future be more careful , and keep out of Mr. Polk 's way . " " I will certainly be careful , and I 'll watch him , too , " answered Randy . Evidently Peter Polk was surprised to see our hero go to his work whistling after his interview with the captain . He went to the master of the vessel himself a little later . " Is that boy going to pay for the trunk ? " he asked , sourly . " No , you can put it down to the regular expense account , " answered Captain Hadley . " Humph ! It was his fault . " " He says not . " " Did he blame it on me ? " " He did . " " It was his own fault . " " We wo n't argue the matter , Mr. Polk . Put it down to the regular expenses and let it go at that , " and Captain Hadley turned again to the magazine he had been reading . " Sticking up for the boy , " muttered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get that cub yet , see if I do n't ! " A day passed and Randy stuck closely to his duties . He saw but little of Peter Polk and gave the purser a wide berth . The purser watched the youth narrowly , but said nothing . " He has got it in for you , " said Jones to Randy . " Take my advice and keep your eyes open . " " I am watching him . " " He is a man I should n't trust nohow . He has got a bad pair of eyes . I do n't see how Mr. Shalley trusts him with all the boat 's money matters . " " Neither do I , " answered our hero . " He could walk off with thousands of dollars if he wanted to , " said Jones , and there the talk was dropped . CHAPTER XXVII RANDY MAKES A DISCOVERY The next day Randy wanted to change some of his underwear and went into his locker for his things . To his surprise he found in the locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Hullo , what does this mean ? " he asked himself but could not answer the question . He looked the articles over and made sure they did not belong to any of the other deckhands . Then as he was folding up an extra-fine outing shirt , he saw a letter drop to the floor . He picked it up and saw that it was addressed to Peter Polk . " Can these things belong to Polk ? " he asked himself . " If so , how did they get here ? " Curiosity prompted him to look into the envelope in his hand . Inside was a single sheet of paper on which was scrawled in a bold , heavy hand this brief communication : " Peter Polk : If you do n't pay me that commission of twenty dollars at once , I will go to old man Shalley and let him know how you are boosting up the expense account . G. A. G. " Randy read the letter with great interest . It was postmarked New York and the date was four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he reasoned . " What can it mean ? Can Mr. Polk be cheating Mr. Shalley in some way ? " Then he remembered how the purser purchased all the supplies for the steamboat and paid the bills , and gave a low whistle . " I must see Captain Hadley about this , and at once , " he thought . " But no , maybe it would be better to go and see Mr. Shalley direct . " He placed the letter in a safe place and then went out on deck . He had just started to look for Captain Hadley , to tell him about the strange wearing apparel -- when Peter Polk rushed up to him . " Look here , Thompson , I want you ! " shouted the purser , wrathfully . " What is it , Mr. Polk ? " " I 've got you , you young thief ! " " I am no thief , " answered our hero , warmly . " You are ! " " Who says Randy is a thafe ? " demanded Pat Malloy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He has stolen some of my underwear , " went on the purser . " Tell me what you have done with the stuff at once ! " " Your stuff is in my locker , Mr. Polk , but I did not take it . " " Ha ! what a yarn to tell . Hand the stuff over at once ! " " You can get it if you wish , " answered Randy , with a shrug of his shoulders . " I will . Malloy , come along as a witness , " answered the purser . He walked to the compartment where the deckhands slept and from our hero 's locker hauled the articles that belonged to him . " What do you say to that ? " he cried , turning to our hero . " I did not put the things there , Mr. Polk . " " If you did n't , who did ? " sneered the purser . " Perhaps you did yourself . " " Me ! " " Yes . " " You are crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " To get me into trouble . You hate me and want to injure me , that 's why . " " Nonsense . You stole these things , it is useless for you to deny it . " " But I do deny it . I am no more a thief than you are -- maybe not as much of a one , " added Randy , significantly . At these words the purser turned pale for a moment . But he quickly recovered . " I shall report this to the captain . " " I 'll report too . " " I 'll have you discharged . " " We 'll see about that . " Taking his things , Peter Polk went to the captain 's office and told his story . Captain Hadley at once sent for Randy . " This is a queer happening , Thompson , " he said . " Captain Hadley , I am not guilty , " answered Randy . " It is only another plot of Mr. Polk to get me into trouble . " " And you think he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish you would give me a day off , " went on our hero , after an awkward pause . " What for ? " " I wish to see Mr. Shalley . " " He is in New York , on business . " " So much the better . I can call on him there , after we tie up . " " Do you want to take this matter to him ? " " Not this alone . I have something else of importance . I know he will want to see me . " " Well , you can go . I hope you are not going to run away , " and the captain smiled faintly . " I have nothing to run away for , sir . Mr. Polk is down on me and I am going to do what I can to show him up , that is all . But please do n't let him know that I am going to see Mr. Shalley . " " You have learned something important ? " " Yes , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I ca n't speak of it just yet to you . " " Well , what about this clothing affair ? " " Wo n't you let it rest for a few days ? " " If you wish , " answered Captain Hadley , and then he was called away to attend to some important duties . Although Randy did not know it , Peter Polk was nearby and caught a good bit of the talk between our hero and the captain . His face grew deathly pale when he learned that Randy was going to see Mr. Shalley and about his own personal doings . " What has that cub discovered now ? " he asked himself . " What can he tell about my doings ? " He was so worried he could not attend to his work . He turned the matter over in his mind and suddenly remembered the threatening letter he had received . He had paid the claim , but what had he done with the communication ? He searched everywhere for it , but without avail . " Fool that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it overboard , " he muttered to himself . " If that boy has the letter it may lead to an investigation , and then --  --  " He did not finish but clenched his hands in rage and fear . He watched Randy narrowly , and after New York was reached saw our hero make preparations to go ashore . He did not know that Mr. Shalley was in the metropolis and could not comprehend Randy 's move . " Are you going ashore ? " he asked of our hero , when he got the chance . " I am . " " Where are you going ? " " Excuse me , Mr. Polk , but that is my private business . " " Did Captain Hadley say you could go ? " " He did . " " Well , come to my office a minute , I want to talk to you , " went on the purser , in a lower tone . " Very well , " answered Randy , and followed the man to the office , which at this time was deserted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your locker besides my clothing , " said the purser , after he had made certain that no outsiders were around . " I found a cigar holder and a match safe . " " And what else ? " " I must decline to answer that question . " At this blunt refusal the brow of the purser darkened . " You wo n't tell me ? " " No . " " Did you find a -- er -- a letter ? " " Perhaps I did . " " I want you to give it up . " " I did n't say I found it . " " But you did find it . It is my property and you must give it to me . " To this Randy was silent . " Do you hear me ? " " I am not deaf , Mr. Polk . " " I know what you want to do ! " hissed the purser . " You want to get me into trouble . But I 'll not let you do it . " " Maybe you 'll get yourself into trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , but --  --  " He paused and his manner changed . " See here , Thompson , you are a poor boy , are n't you ? " " I admit it . " " Well , some extra money will come in handy , wo n't it ? " " What do you mean , Mr. Polk ? " " I 'll give you -- er -- five dollars for that letter . " " I have n't said that I had it yet . " " But I know you have it . Come , what do you say ? " " I say , I am going about my business , " answered Randy , and started for the doorway . " Not yet ! " cried the purser , wrathfully , and flung him back into a corner . " You 'll settle with me first , even if I have to call a police officer ! " CHAPTER XXVIII OUT OF A TIGHT CORNER Randy was surprised and dazed by the treatment he received at the hands of the enraged purser and for the moment knew not what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you do that again ! " he cried , a dangerous glitter coming into his eyes . " I will do it -- unless you give up that letter . " " You shall never have the letter , Peter Polk . " " Ha ! so you admit at last that you have it ! " " I do . " " Then hand it over or I will call an officer and have you locked up . " " Call the officer , if you dare , " and our hero shrugged his shoulders . " You stole more than the clothing and the letter , " went on the purser , craftily . " You took fifty dollars in money . " " I took absolutely nothing , and you know it . " " Then you want me to call in the officer ? " " Do as you please , " said Randy , recklessly . Peter Polk was nonplused . He did not want to call an officer . Yet he wanted to get the precious letter . " You will save yourself a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , in a more subdued tone . " Well , I do n't intend to give it up . " " If I have you arrested I can send you to state 's prison for five or ten years . " " I will risk it . " " What do you intend to do with that letter ? " said the purser . " That is my affair . " " Going to Mr. Shalley , eh ? " " Perhaps . " " It wo n't do you any good . " Again Randy was silent . He had stepped close to the door . On the instant Peter Polk did the same . " You are not going just yet , " cried the purser , meaningly . Randy looked through the little window of the office . He heard footsteps approaching . " Hullo there , Jones ! " he called out . " What 's wanted ? " came from the other deckhand . " Come to the office , please . " In a moment Jones appeared . He was carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open that door , " said Randy to Peter Polk . " No more nonsense , please . " " You are not wanted here , Jones ! " cried the purser , angrily . " You are wanted , " said Randy . " Open the door . I want to get out . " Jones set down his pail and pulled on the door . Seeing resistance would be useless , Peter Polk allowed the door to come open . At once Randy stepped out into the gangway . " I 'll explain this to you some other time ! " he called to the other deckhand , and then ran off before Peter Polk could stop him . " Where are ye goin ' ? " called out Malloy , as he crossed the gang-plank . " I 'm off on business , " answered our hero , and then paused for a moment . " Tell Jones to keep an eye on Mr. Polk , will you , please ? It is very important . " " I will , " was the reply . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the corridor he met the steamboat owner , just ready to go out . " Oh , Mr. Shalley , I want to see you ! " he cried . " What is it , Randy ? " " It 's quite a story and very important . " " Then come to my room , " and the steamboat owner led the way to the elevator . As soon as they were in the room our hero told his story in all of its details and then produced the letter he had found . Andrew Shalley listened closely to the story and pondered over the letter for some time . " Randy , have you any idea who this person who signs himself G. A. G. can be ? " " I 've been thinking that over , Mr. Shalley , and I have found out that there is a head clerk who works for Bann &; Shadow , the wholesale grocers , whose name is George A. Gaffney . Gaffney used to come and see Polk once in a while . " " And we buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the steamboat owner . " So we do . " " I will look this man Gaffney up at once . " With the steamboat owner to think was to act , and going below with our hero he consulted a directory and found that George A. Gaffney lived on West Twenty-sixth Street . " I will call upon this fellow , " said he . " You can go along . " They took a car on one of the avenues and got out at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street . They had to walk half a block . The neighborhood was not of the best , and Gaffney 's residence proved to be a four-story apartment house . The man lived on the top floor with his wife and four small children . George Gaffney was at home , sitting in his shirt sleeves by a front window , smoking a pipe . He was surprised to receive visitors at that hour . " Is this Mr. George A. Gaffney ? " questioned Andrew Shalley . " That 's my name . " " Are you a clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am . " " I would like to see you privately , Mr. Gaffney . " " Who are you ? " " I am Andrew Shalley , the owner of the steamboat Helen Shalley . " " Oh ! " George Gaffney was taken aback and showed it plainly . His wife had come to a back doorway and was looking at the visitors curiously . " Step in , sir , " said the clerk , in a husky voice . " Mary , I will see this gentleman alone , " he went on to his wife , who at once retired , closing the door after her . Andrew Shalley was a good judge of character and he saw that George Gaffney was a family man of fairly good qualities . He was extremely nervous . " I think I can get him to confess easily enough -- if he has anything to tell , " thought the steamboat owner . " Please be seated , " said the clerk , and Mr. Shalley and Randy sat down . Then there was a slight pause . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to perform , " began Andrew Shalley , in a cold , hard voice . " Why -- er -- what do you mean ? " stammered the clerk . " I refer to your dealings with my purser , Peter Polk . " " I -- er -- I have n't had anything to do with him -- that is -- we had some little business , but --  --  " The clerk was unable to go on . " You sent him a threatening letter the other day . " " Me ? Who says so ? " " I have the letter in my possession . " The clerk winced and the steamboat owner saw that the shot struck home . " This affair is a very serious one -- you know that as well as I do , " continued Andrew Shalley . " The fact of the matter is , it is a state 's prison offense . " The mention of prison had the desired effect . George Gaffney broke down completely . " Oh , sir ,  - -  I - -  I did n't mean to do any wrong -- Polk said it would be all right . He got me to go into it -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was thirty-five dollars and that I will pay back . Mr. Shalley , I -- er -- I hope you wo n't prosecute me , for the sake of my wife and children ! " And the clerk wrung his hands in despair . " Did n't you get any more than thirty-five dollars ? " " No , sir , not a cent more , I swear it . And Polk said that was due to me legally . " " If that is true , I will not prosecute you ,  - -  but on one condition . " " Name it . " " That you tell me everything you know about Peter Polk 's doings . " " I will do it , Mr. Shalley . " CHAPTER XXIX GEORGE GAFFNEY 'S STATEMENT " I can not tell you all Peter Polk has done , " said George Gaffney , on beginning his story , " but I can tell you all so far as it concerns his purchase of goods from Bann &; Shadow . " " That will be enough , " answered Andrew Shalley , and brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He came to our firm three years ago and began to purchase various goods for the Helen Shalley . At first he met all bills promptly and never asked for any rebate or commission . That lasted for about three months . " " He must have been feeling his way . " " He was . At the end of six months he made a claim of a rebate on a bill for a hundred and fifty dollars and we allowed him ten dollars . Then he got ten dollars more on another bill , and after that he claimed a rebate of ten per cent . on everything he bought of us . " " You have all those bills on your books ? " " We have . " " Good . Go on . " " He gradually got bolder and wanted me to aid him in getting a commission elsewhere on regular steamboat supplies . I was willing to make a little extra money and introduced him to the firm of Leeson &; Bronette . Leeson is an easy-going man and he promised Polk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars ' worth of goods from them , and got , I am pretty sure , from fifteen to twenty per cent . on every bill paid . " " Oh , what a rascal ! " murmured Randy . " Then I introduced him to another man , Aaron Denman , and he got goods from that man too and got his commission -- how much I do not know . For introducing him to Denman I was promised that commission of twenty dollars . I saw Polk was making money hand over fist , and when he did not pay me I got mad and wrote the letter . " " And you are sure you never got a cent more out of him than thirty-five dollars ? " " Not a cent . Once in a while he treated me to a dinner and twice he sent me a box of cigars , and that is all . To tell the honest truth , I did not press him very hard , for I did not believe in what he was doing . I want to be an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I knew it , " continued George Gaffney . After that he went into a great many more details , to which Andrew Shalley and Randy listened with interest . " I can get the actual figures for you from our books , " said the clerk . " What does your firm say to this ? " asked the steamboat owner . " Oh , they wanted the business , so they simply shut their eyes and did n't say anything . " " But that was dishonest . " " True -- but such things are done every day , " and the clerk shrugged his shoulders . " If Peter Polk has been getting ten to fifteen per cent . on all goods he has been buying for me he has robbed me of thousands of dollars , " said Andrew Shalley . " It will be a hard matter to prove some of the transactions , Mr. Shalley . I guess he knew how to cover up his footprints pretty well . " " Well , if I can only prove some of them it will be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before he left that night he drew up a long document containing the main facts of the case , and had George Gaffney sign it and had Randy put his name down as a witness . " What do you want me to do , Mr. Shalley ? " asked our hero , after they had left the clerk 's house . " You can go back to the steamboat . I am going to hire a first-class private detective to investigate this matter thoroughly . When I expose Polk I want all the evidence on hand with which to convict him . " " He will want to know what I did . " " That is true . " Andrew Shalley mused for a moment . " Randy , you mind your own business , " he said suddenly and sharply . Then he began to chuckle . " Now you can go back and tell Polk that I told you to mind your own business . " " I will , sir , " and our hero grinned broadly . " I will also give you a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That will help to keep you out of further trouble . " The letter was penned , and a few minutes later our hero was on his way back to the boat . Andrew Shalley went in another direction , to hunt up a detective to work on the case . It must be confessed that Randy felt much lighter in heart . He now knew exactly what kind of a rascal Peter Polk was , and felt that the purser could no longer drag him into trouble . " He will soon come to the end of his rope , and that will be the last of him , " said our hero to himself . When he arrived at the boat it was very late and everybody but the watchman had gone to bed . He turned in without awakening any of the others and slept soundly until morning . Much to his surprise Peter Polk did not come near him that morning , and our hero was kept so busy at one thing and another that he had little time to think about the purser and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he delivered the letter Mr. Shalley had given him to Captain Hadley . The captain read the communication in silence . Then he uttered a low whistle and looked at Randy thoughtfully . " I 've been suspecting this , " he said . " Randy , I believe you are to keep mum for the present . " " Yes , sir . " " I doubt if he troubles you any more . " " I 'll be glad of it . " " Well , get to work , and some time we 'll see what we will see , " answered the captain ; and there the talk was dropped . It was a windy and cloudy day , and a majority of the passengers were glad enough to remain in the cabin during the trip up the river . About noon it began to thunder and the sky grew very black . " We are up against a storm now , " said Jones to Randy . " We 'll have to take in some of the bunting . " The order was issued , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strip the decks . Soon it was raining furiously and all of the deckhands got pretty wet . All of the passengers had gone inside , so the decks were practically deserted . Randy was folding up some bunting when he heard a quick step behind him . Turning , he saw himself confronted by Peter Polk . The purser 's face was dark and full of hatred . " Now , Thompson , I want to know what you did last night , " snarled the man . " I went ashore , " answered our hero , as coolly as he could . " To see Mr. Shalley ? " " Yes , if you must know . " " And you gave him that letter ? " " I did . " " What did he say ? " " He told me to mind my own business . " " What ! " For the instant Peter Polk 's face took on a pleased look . " So he really told you that ? " " Yes . " " Humph ! I reckon you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hero made no reply . " Is the old man going to investigate ? " went on Peter Polk . " You had better go and ask him . " " You answer my question , Thompson ! " " I have nothing more to say . " At this the purser grew furious . There were many occasions when his temper got the better of him and this was one of them . He suddenly grabbed Randy by the throat , bending him backward over the rail . " You little cur ! " he hissed . " You are trying to get the best of me ! But you sha n't do it ! " " Le -- let go ! " gasped Randy . He could hardly speak . " I 'll let go -- when I am through with you . But first I --  --  " What further Peter Polk had to say was drowned out by a violent crash of thunder . Then came a perfect deluge of rain , driven over the decks by a wind that blew almost with hurricane force . Randy struggled harder than ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboat , caught by the blast , careened to one side , and in a twinkling the youth was over the rail . Peter Polk released his hold , and down went poor Randy , until , with a splash , he sank beneath the waters of the Hudson River . CHAPTER XXX A SWIM FOR LIFE The shock came so suddenly that for the moment poor Randy scarcely realized what was happening . He went down and down and swallowed not a little of the river water . When he came up , blowing and spluttering , he could see but little around him . Fortunately , he had gone off to the rear of the steamboat , thus escaping the danger of being struck by a paddle-wheel . All was so dark and the rain was so thick he could not make out the shore line . " I 've got to swim for it , " he reasoned and struck out bravely . It was no easy matter to keep afloat with so much clothing on . He listened , thinking he might hear the steamboat , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sound . Presently came another flash of lightning and then he saw the boat far ahead of him . No one but Peter Polk had witnessed his fall from the deck and nobody appeared to be coming to his assistance . He kept his head well above water and at the next flash of lightning caught a glimpse of one of the river banks . Without further hesitation he struck out in that direction . It was a long and exhausting swim and poor Randy thought he would never reach the shore . The current carried him far down the river , to where there was a small cove , lined with rocks on one side and bushes and trees on the other . He caught at some of the bushes desperately and at last pulled himself to a place of temporary safety . For the time being our hero did nothing but try to get back his breath and his strength . In a general way he had an idea that he was some distance below the town of Catskill . What to do next he hardly knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this storm , I suppose , " he told himself . " But that wo n't do a great deal of good , since I ca n't get any wetter than I already am . " Feeling a little bit rested , he presently got up and walked around the edge of the cove . Then he began to climb the river bank proper . It was hard work , but soon he came out on a river roadway and saw at a distance a hotel and half a dozen fashionable cottages . " This looks familiar , " he told himself . " Well , I declare , that place yonder must be the house at which Bob Bangs and his mother are stopping ! " Back of the house was a big barn and further to the rear was another building , used as a summerhouse and a place where oars and other things for small boats might be stored . The summer storm was now letting up a bit . It was still raining , but the thunder and lightning had ceased and the wind had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Randy took himself to the summerhouse . He was busy emptying the water from his shoes , when he heard somebody utter an exclamation and turning saw Bob Bangs standing near , umbrella in hand . The rich youth was staring at him in astonishment . " Where did you come from ? " he demanded , as he entered the summerhouse . " From the river . " " You look pretty wet . " " I have been in the water quite some time . " " Oh ! Did you fall overboard from the steamboat ? " " I did . " " You must be pretty careless , " went on Bob , with a sneer . " I certainly did n't fall overboard because I wanted to , " answered Randy as lightly as he could . " Say , I understand you are trying to get my father into trouble , " pursued the rich boy , throwing himself on a bench . " Who told you that ? " " Never mind . You are hand-in-glove with the Bartlett crowd . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jack is my dearest friend . " " Humph ! I should n't care for him for a friend . " " And he would n't pick you for a chum , " added Jack , quickly . " I consider myself better than Jack Bartlett . " To this our hero did not answer . " My dad is going to make it hot for old Bartlett , " went on Bob . " He is going to sue him for defamation of character . " " When ? " " Oh , before a great while . Bartlett had no right to search our house and break open the safe . " " He had the law on his side . " " No , he did n't . Just you wait till my dad brings suit . It will ruin the Bartletts . " " I hope not . " " How do you like being a steamboat deckhand ? " went on the rich youth , to change the subject . " Very well . " " It must be a dirty job , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might be worse . " " When I leave school I am going to be a lawyer . " " I hope you make a success of it . " " I shall -- I am going to be one of the greatest lawyers in this country , " added the rich boy , boastfully . " Are your folks here ? " " My mother is . Dad is at the iron works . " " They tell me he is n't doing very well there , " said Randy . " He is doing fine . He discharged some of the good-for-nothing hands , that 's all . Bartlett used to hire a lot of sticks . " " I do n't believe it . Mr. Bartlett knows his business . " " Humph ! " The rain was letting up and Randy prepared to walk to Catskill . As wet as he was , he resolved not to ask any favor at the hands of Bob Banks . " Going , eh ? " said the rich youth . " Yes . " " Humph ! " murmured Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady rain , Randy walked rapidly to the town -- doing this that he might not take cold . Once at the town he hurried to the steamboat landing . " Hullo , where did you come from ? " exclaimed the dock master , who knew him well . " From a bath , " answered Randy with a laugh , and then said he had fallen overboard from the Helen Shalley just before the landing at Catskill was made . " Nobody said anything about it , " said the dock master . " I guess they did n't know it , " answered our hero . " What are you going to do now ? " " Telegraph to Captain Hadley and then stay in town until the boat comes back to-morrow . " " Better get dried off first . You can come to my house if you wish . It is not far off . " " Thank you , Mr. Ball . " Randy 's telegram was a short one . It ran as follows : " Fell overboard . Am safe at Catskill . Join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with Mr. Ball to the latter 's house . Here he was loaned some dry clothing and Mrs. Ball treated him to a late but satisfying supper . After the meal was over , and as it was now clear , he decided to take a walk around the town before retiring . Had he known of what that walk was to reveal he would have been very much surprised . CHAPTER XXXI NEWS OF IMPORTANCE As was natural , our hero drifted down to the long steamboat landing . While he was standing around , he saw a ferryboat coming across the river , filled with passengers from the railroad station on the opposite shore . As the passengers alighted he recognized Amos Bangs in the crowd . The rich manufacturer looked around anxiously , and presently caught sight of Mrs. Bangs , who had come to meet him in a carriage . Randy slipped out of sight . " Well ? " demanded Amos Bangs , as soon as he and his wife were together . " Oh , Amos ! " the woman cried , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Viola ? " demanded the husband , harshly . " I can do nothing with the girl . " " And she knows where the papers are ? " " She does . " " How did it happen ? " " When Mr. Tuller called upon me she played the eavesdropper . She saw us open the safe and take out the papers , and when I went and hid the papers she followed me . " " But you said you were sure nobody knew where the papers were . " " I thought so at the time , but I was mistaken . " " How did it come out ? " " The girl did not sweep and dust the parlor to suit me , and I took her to task about it . She threw down her broom and said she would take no words from me . Then I told her to pack her trunk and leave the house . She grew more impertinent than ever , and said she would go , but I would have to pay her her wages regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me to go and look for the papers I had hidden . " " And they were gone ? " " Yes . I was so overcome I nearly fainted , " and Mrs. Bangs 's face showed her deep concern . " What next ? " " I went back to the girl and told her she must give the papers up or I would have her arrested . She laughed in my face . Oh , Amos , think of that horrid creature doing that ! " " She knew she had you , " growled the rich manufacturer . " What did you do then ? " " Why -- I -- broke down , I could n't help it . I asked her what she wanted for the papers . She would n't tell , and I said I would give her five dollars . Then she laughed in my face again . I wanted to drive her from the house , but I did n't dare . " " Did she say what she was going to do ? " " At last she said she would make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to pay her wages regularly and also twelve dollars a month for her board . " " Will she work for you ? " " No , indeed , she says she will go and live with her married sister . " " Humph ! Let me see , her name is Jackson , is n't it ? " " Yes , Mamie Jackson . Her sister lives over in Oakdale . " " Did she go to Oakdale ? " " I suppose she did . " " She must have the papers with her . " " No , I think she hid them , for she said we would n't find the papers even if we searched her and her trunk . " " I will have to go to Oakdale and see her , " said Amos Bangs , after a pause in which he rubbed his chin reflectively . The rich manufacturer and his wife had withdrawn to a corner of the dock while talking . Randy had kept nearby , behind some boxes and barrels , and had heard every word that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the track of Mr. Bartlett 's papers at last , " he told himself . " Now , what had I best do about it ? " His one thought was to outwit Amos Bangs , and with this in mind he left the dock and walked rapidly toward the telegraph office . " I wish to send another telegram , " said he as he drew the pad of forms toward him . " Must be your night for sending messages , " answered the clerk , by way of a joke . " I want this rushed through -- it is highly important . " " All right , hand it over . " Randy hardly knew what to say , but soon wrote down the following , addressed to Mr. Bartlett : " Papers taken from Mrs. Bangs by Mamie Jackson , a servant , now at sister 's in Oakdale . Hurry if you want to get them . Address me at Catskill . " Having sent the message , there seemed nothing for Randy to do but to retire . This he did , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartlett , which was in these words : " Coming down first morning train . Meet me at Catskill Station , Hudson River Railroad . " Having received this message Randy consulted a time table and found that the first Albany train would arrive at the station across the river at about seven o'clock . He arranged to be on hand , and then tried to go to sleep again . But the most he could do was to take a few fitful naps . As soon as the train rolled in Philip Bartlett alighted . Randy rushed towards him . " Are you going to Oakdale ? " he asked , quickly . " Do you think it worth while , Randy ? " " I do . " " Then I will go . You must come along . " " I will , " answered our hero , and then Mr. Bartlett got back on the train and Randy followed him . " I left word with Mr. Ball , so Captain Hadley wo n't worry about me , " Randy explained when seated . " Now tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently . " I have been on the anxious seat ever since I received your telegram . " " I want you to get in ahead of Mr. Bangs , " said our hero , and then told all he had overheard . " I will make that servant girl give me those papers , " said Mr. Bartlett , with decision . " Perhaps you can scare her just as Mr. Shalley scared a fellow who was aiding another man to rob him , " answered our hero . " I will tell you about that another time . I am pledged not to say anything just at present . " CHAPTER XXXII BROUGHT TO TERMS -- CONCLUSION They had to make one change of cars and then take a stage running to Oakdale , which was but a small village four miles from Riverport . When they arrived it was close on to midday . Fortunately for them , one of the storekeepers of the village knew Mamie Jackson 's married sister and also knew Mamie , and he told them where to go . It was a dilapidated cottage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds . " Not very thrifty people , that is certain , " was Mr. Bartlett 's comment . " I think I shall know the servant if I see her , " said Randy . They paused at the gate and saw the two sisters near the side porch . One was on a bench shelling peas and the other was lolling in a hammock . Each looked very untidy and both wore wrappers that were full of holes . " That is the servant , " said Randy , pointing to the person in the hammock . " And see , she has some papers in her hands ! " " Step behind the wellhouse , " said Mr. Bartlett , and this both of them quickly did . " Well , go ahead and read the papers , Mamie , " said the woman on the bench . " Ai n't no use , Sarah , I ca n't make head nor tail of ' em , " answered Mamie Jackson . " What do you suppose makes ' em so valuable ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that Mr. Bartlett to get hold of ' em . " " I think you made a good bargain with the Bangses -- that is , if they pay up . " " I 'll make ' em pay . Oh , Mrs. Bangs was scart , I could see it . " Mamie Jackson laughed shrilly . " And to think she was going to discharge me ! " " Well , I guess you gave her a piece of your mind . " " So I did . She is too stuck-up to live , " went on the former servant girl . " When I get my money I 'm going to have a fine dress too -- and I 'll buy you one , Sarah . " " Oh , Mamie , will you ? I want a blue silk so ! " " I 'm going to have a green silk , and a parasol to match , and then -- Oh , dear ! look at them bees ! " And with a shriek Mamie Jackson threw up her arms and sprang out of the hammock . For the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the situation , Randy darted forward and secured them . Then he turned the documents over to Philip Bartlett . " Who are you ? " demanded the woman of the cottage , rising in alarm . " It 's that Mr. Bartlett himself ! " shrieked Mamie Jackson , forgetting all about the two bees that had disturbed her , and which had now flown away . " Oh , how did you get here ? " she faltered . " I came after my papers -- and I got them sooner than I anticipated , " answered Mr. Bartlett , and there was a tone of triumph in his voice . " Are those your papers ? " asked the girl , trying to appear innocent . " You know they are . " " I do not . I -- I found them . " " I know better . You took them from where Mrs. Bangs hid them . " " Well , she did n't have any right to them . " " I know that well enough . " " I -- I was going to send them to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . " Really , " returned Philip Bartlett , dryly . " Well , I will save you the trouble . " " It 's a shame to suspect an innocent girl like me , " said Mamie Jackson , bursting into tears . " My sister never did anything wrong , " put in the other woman . " As I have my papers I wo n't argue with you , " returned Mr. Bartlett . " But when the proper time comes you may have to explain how you happened to get the papers . " " Are you going to haul Mr. Bangs into court ? " " Perhaps . " " Well , I will tell what I know about them , if it will do any good . Mrs. Bangs and a man named Tuller plotted to keep the papers out of your reach . They opened the safe and took the papers out just before you came with that constable . " After that Mamie Jackson seemed anxious enough to confess and told her whole story , omitting to state how she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for keeping silent . " We may as well go back to the town , and take the stage for Riverport , " said Mr. Bartlett to Randy . " I will then telegraph to Mr. Robinson to come on , and we will settle with Bangs , Tuller &; Company in short order . " " Will you make him give up the control of the iron company ? " " Either that or have him arrested for fraud . " The journey to Riverport was quickly made , and the telegram sent to Mr. Robinson . The bank official sent word back that he would be on in the morning . Then Mr. Bartlett went to a hotel and Randy hurried home . " Why , Randy , is it really you ! " cried his mother as she kissed him . " This is certainly a surprise . " " I did n't expect to come home , " said he . " How are you and how is father ? " " I am real well as you see , and your father is doing splendidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years back . " " That is good news . " " But what brings you ? " " I will tell you , " said Randy , and sitting down he told his story , just as I have related it here . In the midst of the recital Mr. Thompson came in , and he listened also to what our hero had to say . " I hope Mr. Bartlett gets what is coming to him , " said Mr. Thompson . " And I hope Mr. Shalley brings that Peter Polk to terms also . " The next morning Randy received word to come to the iron works . He went and there witnessed a stormy meeting between Amos Bangs on one side and Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Robinson on the other . Randy was called in as a witness , and what he had to say made Amos Bangs gasp for breath and sink into a chair . " You are going to expose me -- to ruin me ! " gasped Amos Bangs , at last , addressing the two men who had accused him . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do as we think is fair , " said Philip Bartlett . " As for ruining you , I think you have about ruined yourself . " " But my wife , and my son --  --  " " Mrs. Bangs does not deserve my sympathy after what she has done . As for your son , he can go to work , as my son has done . " " Bob ! What can he do ? " " Work may make a man of him . He will never amount to anything if you bring him up in idleness . " " It is hard ! " groaned Amos Bangs . " I -- I shall have to go to work myself ! " " That is what I was forced to do , " answered Philip Bartlett , dryly . " But you will not be so badly off , Mr. Bangs . Your stock is worth at least four or five thousand dollars . " " Humph ! That is not much . Well , I suppose I am cornered and must do as you say , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad to escape arrest . A lawyer was called in , and the best part of the day was spent in drawing up and signing various legal documents . The iron works were thereby placed in the control of Mr. Bartlett , Mr. Robinson , and a stockholder named Wells , and Philip Bartlett was made the general manager of the company . All of the books and accounts were placed in charge of an expert accountant , and in the end Amos Bangs had to make good a deficiency of cash . The former rich man had to give up his elegant mansion , and soon after he and his family moved to the West without leaving their new address behind them . When Randy went back to the steamboat , two days later , a surprise awaited him . An accountant , assisted by a detective , had gone over Peter Polk 's affairs and discovered that the purser had robbed Andrew Shalley of between eight and ten thousand dollars . Polk had taken time by the forelock and fled . He tried to get to Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as he was trying to cross the Suspension Bridge at Niagara Falls . Later on he was brought back and tried , and received three years in prison for his crimes . He had nearly six thousand dollars of the stolen money in the bank , and this was turned over to Andrew Shalley . Two hundred and fifty dollars went to Mrs. Clare as part of her husband 's estate . " Bringing Peter Polk to justice is due to you , Randy , " said the steamboat owner , after the affair was a thing of the past . " I feel I must reward you for what you did . " " I do n't ask any reward , Mr. Shalley . I am glad that I cleared my own name . " " Here is something for you , nevertheless , " said Andrew Shalley , and handed a big document to our hero . " What is it ? " " It is the deed to the farm on which your folks are living . It is made out in your name . I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have something that you can really call your own , " and Mr. Shalley laughed pleasantly . " Mr. Shalley , you are more than kind , " cried Randy , warmly . " Do my parents know of this ? " " No . You can go home over Sunday and surprise them . " " I will , and I thank you very much , sir . " Randy went home , and there was a general rejoicing over the good news . But more was to follow . " I met Mr. Bartlett to-day , " said Mr. Thompson . " He says they want a first-class carpenter at the iron works to take charge of the repairs He offered me the place at a dollar a day more than I am getting . " " Good enough , father ! " cried Randy . " That is just like Mr. Bartlett . " " He said he wanted to do something for us on your account . And he sent you this , " added Mr. Thompson , and brought out a neat silver watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly . Not long after that the season on the river closed and Randy came home for the winter . As his father now had a steady place at good wages , the youth went to school , in company with Jack Bartlett , who had moved back to Riverport with the rest of his family . Randy was a good scholar and made rapid progress . " I want you to get a good education , " wrote Andrew Shalley to our hero . " Then , later on , you can enter my office if you wish , or take a better place on the steamboat . " Six years have passed since that time and Randy has finished his education . He is now the general manager for the steamboat company , and rumor has it that he is soon to marry Rose Clare , who still lives with the Shalleys . He is prosperous , but come what may , will never forget the time when he was only a deckhand . THE END The Famous Rover Boys Series By ARTHUR M.
