 | There are over two and a quarter million people in Georgia and two-thirds of then are directly dependent upon the returns of agriculture for support . This fact alone suffices to warrant a close study of the conditions affecting Georgia farmers and of the tendencies at work among them . But when it is remembered that Georgia is one of a group of States possessing similar industrial organizations , the study assumes at once a greater importance and the subject immediately invites a wider interest . Certain advantages are to be had from restricting the investigation to a relatively small territory . The facts pertaining to such a field are more easily handled and mastered and hence lead to conclusions that possess greater precision and definiteness . The conclusions reached may be applied with modifications more or less slight to the larger territory similarly circumstanced . The study involves two inquiries of high importance . The first is concerned with the efficiency of the farming system . It seeks to ascertain whether land , labor , and capital are so combined and organized as to produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is produced is distributed among the agents of production in an equitable way . It should be borne in mind that the system that gives the first result ? the largest total return may or may not be conducive to a beneficent distribution of that return . It is possible to conceive that a relatively small total product well distributed might result in greater social well-being than a larger product badly distributed . By comparing the area of Georgia with its population it is found that there are about thirty-eight people to the square mile . This means that if the land were apportioned among the people of the State in equal lots , each man , each woman , and each child would get about seventeen acres . If Massachusetts should make such a distribution each individual would receive less than two acres ; in New York and Pennsylvania such a partition would give each person about four acres . It thus  | appears that Georgia is not suffering from over-crowding . The extent and character of the land of the State would warrant a double trebling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the attempt to answer the two main inquiries of this paper , it is necessary to notice the relation the farmers sustain to the land they cultivate . This is not only a fitting point of departure , but , if thoroughly understood , it will place one far along the highway that leads to the goal of the investigation . This relation has assumed since the war a variety of forms and moreover each of these forms is at the present time represented in the State . A broad classification gives three types based on the relation of the farmer to the soil ; farms worked by owners , farms worked by tenants , and farms worked for wages . The second is by far the most numerous class and herein especially lies the variety , for there are at least four distinct types of tenancy in operation in the State at the present time . Tenancy in Georgia is for the most part a post bellur growth and the freedmen have entered largely into the composition of the tenant class . Before 185o the tendency toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary policy pursued by the government of the State . In order to encourage the settling of the western part of the State a liberal system of land distribution was practised as fast as the Indian claims were quieted . For instance , in 1833 over 50,000 lots , containing 16o or 40 acres each , were granted to those who had not previously drawn . Six distributions had been made previous to this one and yet the census of 1850 says there were only about 52,000 farms then in the State . Allowing a wide margin for the inaccuracy of the census figures , the conclusion is nevertheless irresistible that there was a great tendency , towards large holdings . The policy of distributing the land and its consequent cheapness help to explain the absence of any large body of tenantry and the marked tendency toward , large holdings proves that the big plantation under the circumstances and viewed from the standpoint of economic production was a genuine success . Regarding the tenants before the war numerous inquiries have been made and various answers received . According to TENDENCIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants , others say there were only a few here and there and one of the most intelligent witnesses declared he had never heard of such a thing as a tenant before the war . The preponderance of evidence however goes to show that there were tenants in various parts of the State and there is unanimity as to the form of tenancy among those who assert its existence . It is what was then and is still called the " third and fourth " system . According to this arrangement the land owner furnishes the land and house in which the tenant lives and in return gets one-third of the grain and onefourth of the cotton . CHANGES WROUGHT BY THE WAR . Everyone knows that the civil war gave the economic organization of the State a tremendous shock ? as far reaching in its effects as the jar of an earthquake upon a city . One influence of the jar was the cracking of the large plantation from which fragments have been falling ever since . The extent of this influence is apparent from the following table compiled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number of Average Size of Population . Farms . Farms in Acres . 1860 62,003 429.8 1,057,286 1870 69,956 338.0 1,184,109 1880 138,626 187.9 1,542,180 1890 171,071 147.3 1,837,353 1900 224,691 117.5 2,216,331 The suddenness that characterized the metamorphosis of the slaves into freedmen and the consequent disorganized condition of labor precluded the possibility of the immediate natural adjustment of the economic forces of the State . The planters who had prospered under the old regime were unable to adjust themselves to the new order of things so swiftly brought upon them . The war had left them without money and without any easy way of getting it . They resorted to the cotton factors and merchants for the money and supplies necessary to run their farms , mortgaging the anticipated crop and their land as security . Cotton rapidly declined in value and the decade 1870 to I880 in the above table tells the result . The  | farms almost doubled in number in the ten years and the average size decreased from 338 to 188 acres . Immediately after the war many of the negroes were hired for wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom meant no work and so many agencies were employed to put them in an antagonistic attitude towards their former masters that brilliant results were not obtained . Land was very cheap and thousands of the negroes bought farms but in most cases after holding the farms for a few years they were unable to meet the payments incident to holding them and had to surrender titles . TENANCY SINCE THE WAR . The system of tenancy that tended to prevail in the decade after the war was the " third and fourth " system . The little direct supervision incident to this form of tenancy makes it ill suited for successful use with the negro . Since the ' 7o 's it has been on the wane till today it is found only here and there in the State . The next form of tenancy to preponderate was the " half " system . This is another species of share tenancy and according to its operation the landowner furnishes the land , live-stock , and implements and exercises a greater degree of control than is the case in the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the cost of fertilizers , of ginning , and of wrapping the cotton for the market . After these expenses are deducted one-half of the crop goes to the landlord and the other half to the tenant . It is today a very prevalent form of tenancy in Georgia . Its shortcomings will be pointed out in another connection . In the last decade there has been a marked increase in the number of " standing rent " and cash tenants ? the former far outnumbering the latter . According to the " standing rent " plan the land owner furnishes the land and house and gets in return a stipulated amount of cotton . A " one-horse " farm of about thirty acres rents for from two to three bales of cotton according to the fertility of the land . PRESENT CONDITIONS . The farms operated by owners fall into two general groups : small farms cultivated by actual owners and larger farms TENDENCIES AMONG GEORGIA FARMERS . 113 worked by hired labor under the direct supervision of the owner . The latter is by far the more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection it may be noted that there is a tendency among the more aggressive farmers to adopt the wages system instead of renting the farms to tenants . The significance of this tendency will appear in the sequel . The land-owning farmers of the State are in much better financial condition now than they have been for many years ? in truth their condition is better than it has been since the war . Three influences have co-operated to bring about this result : The Farmers ' Alliance movement , the banks , and the higher prices that have prevailed in the cotton market for the past few years . That the last named influence has contributed powerfully toward the well-being of all the cotton producers is so evident that the statement needs no elaboration . In order to appreciate the full significance of the Alliance movement it would be necessary to make a careful study of the agricultural credit system as it has developed within a generation . The rise of this credit arrangement was indicated above in connection with the breaking up of the plantations just after the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer without money resorts to the merchant in the beginning of the year and arrangements are made whereby the merchant agrees to furnish the farmer with the supplies needed in making the trop , oftentimes taking a lien upon the prospective crop as security . These supplies are furnised at " time " prices , and " time " prices are from ten per cent . to 50 per cent . higher than cash prices . Though the farmers in the Alliance movement failed to carry through to success their specific plans for curtailing the high profits thus made by the merchants , nevertheless the co-operation and agitation did redound to their material benefit in their dealings with the merchants . The average difference between the " time " and cash prices is now perhaps twenty or twenty-five per cent. ? this of course is equivalent to an annual rate of about forty per cent . since the accounts run upon an average about six months . Formerly the difference was greater than this . In the past few years the number of banks in the country towns has increased rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is estimated that seventy-five per cent . of the loans of these banks is to farmers . They borrow money from the banks on accommodation notes at eight , or ten , or twelve per cent . and are thereby enabled to pay the merchant cash for the goods bought . Many merchants look with favor upon this , saying that it is safer and better for them to do a cash business than to run the risks and undergo the losses incident to the credit system . The great losses and risks are of course the raison d'etre of the great difference between cash and " time " prices . When it is said that many merchants have become rich and have acquired much land through the credit system , it should be remembered that many more merchants through the same system have become poor and have lost everything . It takes a very skilled business man to manage successfully a large agricultural credit business . All of this , instead of palliating the system , goes to show its inherent perniciousness . The tenants as a body are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have little or no surplus left over at the end of the year when the accounts are settled , and but for the limitations placed upon the extent of their credit by forseeing landlords or merchants their accounts in many cases would enlarge far beyond the possibility of being covered by their part of the annual crop . The merchants are by no means the exclusive sharers of the gains that result from the practice of advancing supplies to tenants . As was said above , many of the landowners have become independent in recent years and are in position to get money from the banks . With the cash thus obtained or otherwise secured they discount their tenants ' accounts with the merchants at the end of each month . This of course does not benefit the tenant since it is merely a shifting of the possible twenty or twenty-five per cent . profit from the merchant to the landlord . It is useless to speculate upon what the tenant might accomplish in the way of extricating himself from this predicament if he would use economy , foresight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not possess . He is in a bad fix and ought to be helped out of it , provided it can be done in a way that would strengthen rather than weaken him . Those farming under the " half " system form the main body TENDENCIES AMONG GEORGIA FARMERS . 115  | of the tenants under discussion and the negroes chiefly compose this body . Now it is a well known fact that the average negro needs directing ? without it he usually makes a failure , with it he makes a good farmer . Although under the " half " system the landlord nominally manages , yet he does not exercise that degree of direct supervision that the negro needs in order to succeed . The above line of reasoning makes it easy to answer the two inquiries announced in the beginning of this paper . It not only shows that the total product of agriculture in Georgia is not as large as it might be if the present forces were differently combined , but with equal clearness it discloses the fact that the actual return is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown that things are not in a static condition ? that changes are in progress revealing certain tendencies . In view of these tendencies and of the conditions above described the following suggestions are ventured as to the manner in which improvements in production and in the distribution of the product are to come about : All forms of tenancy in Georgia will gradually disappear except the " standing rent " or cash system . Most of the white farmers who do not own farms and many of the more intelligent negroes who do not come into possession of farms will compose this " standing rent " class . The great body of tenants , that is to say those now working under the " half " system , will become wage laborers upon the plantations they now operate as tenants . The landlord and the former tenant alike will be benefitted by the change . The total output will be greater and the share of each is likely to be greater . For the landlord there will also be an immense gain in the improvement of his farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the grasp of the credit system . Receiving wages monthy , or more often , he will be enabled to pay cash for goods bought . Instead of paying $12o for $moo worth of goods , he may then buy $12o worth of goods with the $120 . Some may look askance at the above suggestions because they seem to imply the continuance of large holdings . It may be said however in support of the position taken that under certain circumstances large holdings may be of greater benefit 2  | to all concerned than small holdings : this is certainly true when the small holder does not know how to manage his holding . But the scheme here outlined includes the existence of small farms alongside the large ones . Moreover the wages system here advocated , so far from precluding the possibility of the laborer 's becoming a proprietor , really in removing him from tenancy places him upon a highway more likely to lead to the acquisition of a farm . As fast as the laborers become capable of managing small farms successfully they should become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the plan here presented . Certainly the scheme will render their condition more tolerable until they are capacitated for the better state .
