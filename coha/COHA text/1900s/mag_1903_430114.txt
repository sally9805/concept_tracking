 | METHODISM dates from the year 1739 , when , in England , John Wesley began to preach - experimental religion , " attesting its reality by an account of the sudden , strange , but delightful warming of his heart when he felt that Christ had died for him , " and that ; , through faith in His name . . . his sins were blotted out . " The history of his preceding struggles and seven years ' preaching is as absorbing as a romance , but only the date of his emancipation is needed here ; for that determined the time of the first- centennial thank offering made by Methodists . All Methodism celebrated in 1839 the centennial of its birth with gifts expressive of its estimate of the blessings which Cod through Methodism had bestowed upon its votaries . In 1866 , the centennial of the first appearance of Methodism on this side of the Atlantic , a second thank offering was made in the United States and Canada . Above ten million dollars was then given by the Methodist Episcopal Church alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Methodist family celebrated the event in similar manner . As the close of the nineteenth century drew near , certain ministers of influence in the Methodist Episcopal Church directed attention through the denominational press to the importance of recognizing the birth of the new century . In the summer of 1895 , the Wesleyan Conference , then in session at Hull , England , resolved to ask the Church for one million guineas , to be a memorial of the gratitude of the Church to Cod . and to be used for the advancement of His kingdom as ' understood by Wesleyan Methodists . One of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church , and another prominent connectional officer , since elected bishop . having been sent as fraternal delegates to the Wesleyan Conference , were present when this subject was discussed , and on their return to this country advocated the proposition that the Methodist Episcopal Church should make a special effort in the same ( Erection . Meanwhile , the presidents of Methodist colleges and universities took up the matter and appointed a committee to wait on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee arrived , the bishops had considered the question and reached a unanimity of affirmative sentiment . At first , some of them thought that it would be wiser to ask only ten million dollars ; but the majority , recognizing that , though the average wealth per member of the Wesleyan denomination in England probably exceeds that of the Methodist Episcopal Church , the latter has nearly four times as many members as the former , believed that it would he safe to appeal for the larger sum . In the course of the discussion , those who doubted became convinced , and the bishops sent forth a stirring appeal . When twenty million dollars was specified in their statement many in the Church thought it too much , and some newspapers echoed their sentiments , saying that the country had not yet recovered from the fearful panic and depression which began in 1892 , and intimating that the denomination must have " lost its head , " and that no general effort would be made .  | More than a year and a half remained before the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday in May , 1900 , in that center of energy and index of financial prosperity and adversity , Chicago . During this period , the condition of the country had improved and the spirit of the people become confident . For the first time in the history of the denomination , an equal number of laymen and ministers composed the General Conference . Such an opportunity for discussion and illumination had never before existed . In their quadrennial address to the conference the bishops stated what they had done , and the reasons therefor . Their communication was referred to the appropriate committee , which reported unanimously in favor of undertaking to raise twenty million dollars . This action was vital , for in Episcopal Methodism , ? outside of the right of appointing and ordaining pastors , ? the power of the bishops as such is limited to recommendations . Under the constitution , the General Conference has power to make the rules and regulations for the Church , and no other body can veto its action . This movement was not enacted into the form of law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects its bishops more than the Methodist Episcopal , and when their opinion and desire are expressed as a unit and approved by the General Conference the effective force engendered is equal to that of the coherence and loyalty of the Church . For the purposes of such an achievement , no ecclesiastical body is more efficiently organized . The clergy are organized into conferences ; these meet once a year , and every member able to do so is required to attend . Methodist Episcopacy is not diocesan . Were it so , the bishop would have no power outside of his own diocese ; theoretically , Methodist bishops have all power at all times . They divide the work of superintendence among each other , so that each of the one hundred and fourteen conferences at its annual session is presided over by a bishop . Each of these conferences is subdivided into districts , over each of which a member of an Annual Conference previously appointed presides . In order both to instruct and awaken the Church , as well as to constitute a center of communication and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed , of whom Bishop Andrews . whose episcopal residence is in the city of New York , was chairman , and a connectional secretary was appointed . In harmony with Methodist usage , this secretary became the executive head of the movement . and choice was made of the Rev. Edmund M. Mills . at the time presiding elder of an important district in one of the largest conferences . He had been secretary of his own conference for many years , is an alumnus of the oldest university in the Church and secretary of its board of trustees . and also a member of the Board of Control of the Epworth League , the young people 's society of the Church , which , according to the figures commonly given out , numbers more than a million and a half members . From the commission , through him , proceeded the various official statements made to the Church . He speedily published the conditions upon which offerings were to be received , and made it clearly understood that nothing was to be counted in the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twentieth Century Thank Offering . - What was begun or performed before this enterprise was launched was excluded from the table . llso , he made known that none of the ordinary fixed charges " of the Church were to be included , such as the support of pastors , the keeping of church property in repair , the erection of new churches , the support of annual missionary , educational , Sunday School Union and Church Extension , and other collections of a similar character . During the four years from 1899 to 1902. inclusive . he traveled in every State and Territory except Texas , attending conferences and holding meetings in the interest of the offering . The presiding ' elders , in their quarterly visitations to the churches , cooperated with the pastors , and assisted in the holding of district conventions , many of which they organized . The presidents of colleges and seminaries were also concerned to see that under such a universal system of appeal the interests over which they presided were properly exploited . Various superintendents of philanthropic movements were similarly interested . Much is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial enterprises . and much about astonishing political activity . In many parts of the country , these were fully equaled in the canvassing for the twentieth-century thank offering . Had the whole Church been equally well cultivated , it is reasonable to believe that thirty instead of twenty millions would have been the result : but the vastness of territory , the absence of many members from home at the time the appeals were made and collections taken , and many other impediments prevented this . Only such an organization as is herein described . and a secretary preeminently fitted for the position , made possible such a result . Neither could he nor the organization have accomplished it had not the bishops and the editors of the Church press throughout the whole of the vast field enthusiastically and with much tact and persever- ance promoted the esprit doG rail 's of the denomination : ? and these could not have succeeded had not leaders among the laity , both men and women . been intensely interested , and a multitude of the people accepted the appeal in the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about $7,000,000 was given ; to theological seminaries. $55,730 ; to seminaries and academies , $1.132.100 .

For various philanthropies and charities , $2 , - 519.701 was contributed , and for a permanent fund for the support of worn-out ministers , $604,000 . To this must be added $379,000 given to establish churches in destitute communities outside the ordinary work of church extension . The rule of the Methodist Episcopal Church with regard to building new churches is this : An " estimate of the amount necessary to build shall be made ; and three-fourths of the money , according to such estimate , shall lie secured or subscribed before any such building shall be commenced . " There will always be many churches which are indebted to the amount of one-quarter the cost , which is often more than was estimated and may be increased by delayed payments of interest . Various circumstances also lead to the ignoring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has been necessary to rebuild at once . or a better church was demanded than could be erected by the insurance ; hence . in an expanding body , dealing extensively with the South and the far Nest , at all times there will be many church debts . These are reported annually to every conference . Only such debts as have been paid under the impulse of this movement have been included in the accounts . The proposition appealed strongly to many localities that would perhaps have postponed the payment of their debts for a long term of years , and 9.003.59G of the twenty-million-dollar thank offering thus accumulated was devoted to the work of providing things honest in the sight of all men . The exact amount received from all sources can not be ascertained until after the assembling of the spring conferences : but up to January 15 of the present year . 820 , M97,270 was duly accounted for and certified to by the secretary . In addition to this . the regular fixed charge and benevolent collections of the Church , amounting to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a decrease . This means that in the last four years this one denomination of evangelical Christians has , without aid from the State . under the influence only of personal interest and persuasive arguments , expended above one hundred million dollars for its faith . The primary work of Methodism was to revive and spread spiritual religion . For some decades , its energies were devoted chiefly to this end . Awakened religious interest , however , created a strong desire for education among the common people . hence the extraordinary progress made by the Church in this department of civilization . Homes for the aged . hospitals , orphan asylums , naturally came later . Temperance , ? meaning by this total abstinence from intoxicating liquors , ? has been strenuously insisted upon . as well as abstinence from all amusements tending to make the youth of each generation indifferent to the appeals made to them by parents , pastors , and teachers for a higher life than that which seeks chiefly sensuous enjoyment or material prosperity , or forgets in " the life which now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial achievements of the denomination will permanently distract its attention from its primary work is a question of vital importance . not only to Methodism , but to American Christianity . Since all these gifts have been voluntary , and the people are entitled to all the privileges of the denomination , social , intellectual , moral , and religious , whether they give much or little , it may reasonably be assumed that the original impulse which gave rise to Methodism has by no means expended its force .
