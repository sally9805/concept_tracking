txt Many complaints have lately come to THE NEW YORE TIMES about the almost open way the policy sharks are now operating in this city and the seeming indifference of the police to the operations that go on almost under their eyes . The most persistent of these complaints have come from residents of the section lying between Second and Lexington Avenues and Ninety-seventh to One Hundred and Third Street , a district comprised in the Twenty-ninth Police Precinct , the station house of which is in East One Hundred and Fourth Street , and is presided over by Capt . Haughey . This district is full of cheap tenements , especially on Ninety-seventh and Ninetyeighth Streets , between Second and Lexington Avenues , where mania ? negroos reside , and it is said here , as is always the case in cheap tenement districts , the policy shark has found his richest harvest . Policy playing has never , even during the sporadic crusades that have been initiated against it , been stamped out . Even the police admit that it exists , and that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fact by those who have studied the situation that the police have never tried to eradicate the evil for the reason that the game is backed by persons of political influence and that the same persons who are known to manage the police end of other gambling concessions are large interested in policy as well . Whatever may be the reasons for police lethargy , it is a generally admitted fact that the policy writer and backer is now reaping an uninterrupted - harvest , and the manner in which the writer conducts the game nowadays makes it very hard , under the law as it exists at present , to catch him in the act , and if he is caught , a fine , which the backer pays , is imposed and the game goes on as usual . Formerly the policy writer had his shop where he conducted business , and it was not hard to locate him on account of the steady stream of abject looking men , bedraggled women , and unkempt children who Were continually going to and coming from the shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact was reported to the police , the commanding officer in the precinct used to go to the writer and warn him to close up . This he did at once , only to open up again in the neighborhood , and it did not take long to apprise the customers of the change . But the policy writer nowadays works his scheme in another way . Instead pf having his customers come to him , he goes to them . He does away with the item of rent for his shop . he minimizes the chances of detection , and he brings the game so close to the policy fiends that there is no chair 3e for escape . r 7 , an or woman who has acquired the policy-playing habit ; and-it is asserted that there are many of these to whom the vice Is all that opium smoking is to the opium fiend. may make up his or her mind to quit . but with the writer at the door it is hard for a person habituated to the vice to resist . and , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim as possible . The writer therefore makes his daily rounds of the tenement houses in his district . He knows the weaknesses of his victims and plays upon them , and it was learned yesterday that there are in the district given above some half dozen writers who knock with great regularity every morning at the victim 's door , gets from him or her the gig to be played , writes the slip in the victim 's house , and collects the few pennies . It is said that in many instances , babies . scarcely able to lisp the numbers , meet the writer at the door and tell him the numbers and hand him the pennies . That the police know of this method of operation is shown by the statement Capt . Haaghey made to a NEW YORK TIMES reporter yesterday , when the complaints from citizens in his precinct were shown to him . The latest complaint is dated Feb. 1 , and says : To the Editor of The New York Times : Is it possible through your valuable paper to put a stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in the neighborhood of Second . Third , and Lexington Avenues , from Ninety-seventh to One Hundred and Third Street . some even in the rooms of tenants ? It is useless to speak to the police in the district . This has been tried several times . Negroes and whites are both issuing policy slips and are continually playing policy before the eyes of children and the respectable families of the neighborhood . A READER OF THE TIMES . Capt . Haughey , when he first saw the communication , said it was probably written by some one who had a personal spite against him and wanted to get him out of the precinct . " If there is any policy being written . " he said , " the writers are carrying their slips in their hats . A man might go up to your room and make out a slip and get your Money . and no one but you and he would be any the wiser . " The player is not going to give the writer away , and no one sees him doing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would there be any aid to us by a change in the law ? Well , I 'm not here to criticise the laws or to comment on them . That 's for the Judges . We do the best we can to enforce the laws as we find them . " Capt . F. Norton Goddard . the Republican leader in the Twentieth Assembly District , has been an active foe of the policy writer and backer for years . He has had many passages with precinct commanders , notably Carts . Delaney and Martens , and has been more or less successful for the time in breaking up the game in his district , outside of which his operations do not extend . Ir was through his efforts that several policy writers w ? re sent to prison a few weeks ago . the first time that such a punishment has been inflicted . He said yesterday that wherever the policy playing vice took root there a plague spot was made , and pauperism became rampant . Few things . he maintained , would do as much toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backer . and through Theron G. Strong Cant . Goddard has had introduced in the Legislature a bill making it a misdemeanor for the first offense and a felony thereafter to have policy writing materials in one 's possession . " Under the law as it now exists . " said Capt . Goddard , " it has been extremely hard to catch the writer . lecause he had to be taken In the act of receiving money for a play , or while actually writing one . If this bill passes . it will have the same effect as the bill that provides for the punishment for having burglars ' tools in one 's possession . If , then , the police can be stirred up the writers will have to explain their possession of policy books and slips or take the consequences . " It is within my knowledge that the police know the writers and claim that arrests are innocuous because the writers can not be caught in the act . That they know who the writers are is proved by the fact that whenever there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few writer 's , who are thereupon brought to court and promptly discharged for want of evidence . " There will be a hearing on this bill in Albany on Feb. 7 when ex-Judge Olcott , Gen. Andrews , Theron G. Strong , Alexander Mason . Magistrate Cornell. and I will be there to speak in favor of it . " This is not a crusade on my part against gambling . although I do not say that I would not join one if it was properly planned and conducted , but it is a crusade against a vice that produces direct pauperism . I have had a great deal of experience with it . and I am heartily with TEE NEW YORE Tnuns in any effort to stamp out a vice that produces such baneful results . "
