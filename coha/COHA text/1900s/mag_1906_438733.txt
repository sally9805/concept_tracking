THE development of the art book as a really active factor in current literature here and in England is recent enough for certain questions of form to have failed , as yet , to get themselves settled . Since I began these annual surveys of the subject is the Atlantic , I have had occasion to note more than one definite step of policy taken by the publishers in what has looked like a regular campaign toward the establishment of a practicable and profitable method . Readers on both sides of the ocean have been extraordinarily stimulated to interest themselves in art matters , and little by little the books intended for this rapidly expanding public have been taking the right shape . Attention was drawn last year in this place to the increase in the number of books projected less as handsome gifts than as thorough studies of valuable themes , adequately but not too luxuriously producedas regards press work and illustration . At the same time half a dozen works were recorded which had been brought out in sumptuous form , ? works like The Prado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Portrait Miniatures , by Dr. Williamson , or the Romney of Air . Humidify Ward and Mr. W. Roberts . This year it would seem as if the manufacture of these imposing quartos and folios had been almost entirely abandoned . One or two examples will presently be touched upon , and it may be remarked in passing that an books on a great scale , when they have a certain diameter , will always be successful ; but on the whole it looks as though the less expensive volume were destined to be accepted as the type . The art student of modest means longs to possess many a monumental book , but its price places it beyond his reach , ? for a time at least . If he has patience he may ultimately be able to acquire the coveted book . A number of the costly publications I have in mind have proved doubtful ventures , though of great intrinsic merit , and copies of them have lately been displayed for sale in those shops which make a business of disposing of " remainders " at seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the book devoted to a single master , I suppose for the reason that the student can , as a rule , find all that he wants to know about such a subject in some inexpensive volume , and he feels that to pay twenty-five dollars , say , for a collection of fine photogravures , is , for him , an extravagance . Hence the fact that the superbly made books of the present season are not biographical monographs , but works of a miscellaneous character , appealing to the collector even more than to the student . The first of these publications is The Royal Colledion of Paintings at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle , ' brought out by command of the king in two magnificent volumes , with an introduction and descriptive text by Mr. Lionel Cust . It contains one hundred and eighty photogravures of generous dimensions , and it forms a precious record of one of the finest collections in the world . This collection , founded in Tudor times , embraces many more masterpieces than one would assume to be in it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain has not been , in every generation , a house of connoisseurs . The truth is , however , that , what with the commissions executed by court painters , the gifts received from foreign sovereigns , and the purchases frequently made by the kings and queens of England , the artistic property of the crown remains to-day positively resplendent , despite even such a catastrophe as that which followed the execution of Charles I , in the dispersal of his /aid trial and other treasures by order of Parliament . Mr. Cust gives an interestird ; account of the way in which many of the martyred king 's belongings were recta. - ered for England , and he shows too precious additions were made to the royal collection even in the Victorian epoch , which has always had a feeble reputation in matters of art . The popularity of lei it Iters like Winterhalter and Von Angoli al court has seemed to spell a wholly bark wardtendency in respect to taste in that quarter ; but Mr. Cost justly an he s much of the fact , hitherto very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Prince Albert was s advanced enough in connoisseurship to have err-chased some highly interesting examples of the early Italian school . Indeed , this book will go far to establish in an expectedly favorable light more than one of those who have helped to make the royal collection . People who have given to Henry VIII and Charles I more credit , as lovers of art , than they have given to any of their successors , will acquire from Mr. Cust 's pages a new sense of what was done in the same field in the Georgian epoch and later . The superb photogravures in this book illustrate masterpieces of the Italian , Dutch , Spanish , Flemish , French , German , and English schools . which have been known before as pl'ieeless , but which have not before been placed so effectively in the perspective of England 's social history . By a rather striking coincidence Ihr second of the elaborately made publications which I have to record also relates to England . This is the smaller , but still ample , volume called British Painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' which has been brought out with text by Mr. Edmund Goose . It is not no much a history of the subject as it is a collection of Significant Art Books plates after those mezzotints , " plain and i.olored , " in which the enchanting portraits painted by fashionable artists who ere also men of genius , were reproduced ith an elegance and a skill unsurpassed be the originals . The plates in their turn a.ri , so well made that in some , if not in al s , they actually rival the qualities of he mezzotints from which they are taken , Mr. Gosse 's text provides an instructive accompaniment to the illustrations , but it is as a picture gallery in little that this will find its appreciative public . It is to be followed next year by a similar volume in which the succession of painters and engravers will be carried on from Reynolds to the nineteenth century . , krt and society meet on polished terms in Mr. Gosse 's pages , and , in fact , the world of his painters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stately beauties that one might easily forget that the artists had their iiihem in in that flashing epoch . It is very : noel ) worth while , therefore , to consider , with the other works under discussion , a book , which , while not strictly speaking an art book , does a great deal to increase our knowledge of the milieu in which British art was produced at a critical stage of its history . The new edition of the Reminiscences of Henry , Ingelo , ' which has been printed in two well-proportioned volumes with a wealth of illustrations , is a blessing , since it gives new life to the observations of a man qualified to speak with equal authority on the figures of the Court and those of the studios in the eighteenth century . A scion of a family renowned in the annals of professional swordsmanship , he was brought up in the brilliantsocietycrowding the rooms of the fashionable fencing-master of an age jealous of the point of honor . Great nobles sought the tuition which , of all men in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lordly patron then was often , in his condescending way , the friend of those who served him . Both as a boy in his father 's house , and afterwards , when himself a tower of strength to the young bloods about town , Angelo had every chance to use his sharp eyes and equally attentive ears , and to store up impressions of his celebrated contemporaries . Throughout his career , too , artists , musicians , authors , and wits generally were among his intimates , and he was able , in consequence , when he wrote his reminiscences , to show the reader many a great man at play , unbending and talking about his profession without reserve , humanizing himself , as it were , for the edification of posterity . Thus the student who has seen only the monumental significance of a certain historic portrait by Reynolds has but to turn to Angelo to be brought closer to the mood in which the painter actually iipproached his work . Here is the revealing anecdote : " Garrick , one day dining at the elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West was of the party , and speaking of Sir Joshua 's incomparable portrait of the Marquess of Granby and his horse , observed , ' I was complimenting my friend on the nobleness and grand simplicity of the composition , and the candid-minded painter , with a simplicity no less noble and grand , returned " Sir , I took the hint for that composition from a common woodcut , the headpiece to a worthless ballad . " ' " Angelo 's book is thickly studded with these bits of workshop gossip , free anecdotes of artists and others whose eminence he fully appreciated , but whose everyday walk and demeanor friendship authorized him to sketch with an utterly unhampered pen . Ile tells us of the actor Quin , and of the way in which that blithe spirit used to talk to Gains-borough . " Sometimes , Tom Gains-borough , " he would say , " the same picture , from your rigmarole style , appears to my optics the veriest daub ? and then  --  the devil ' s in you ? I think you a ' Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enthusiastic but not too patient effort to master one musical instrument or another ; we see Rowlandson getting to the bottom of his twelfth glass of punch as he exchanges stories with Peter Pindar and other old cronies ; or we see George Morla nd , half drunk , and diverting that rare Bohemian , the Right Honorable Charles James Fox , will his bemused humor . The king himself frequently passes across the stage , mingling with artists , and playing , in a manner all his own , the aesthetic wiseacre . In short , these Reminiscences recreate the very life and movement of the time . The court painter and the caricaturist jostle one another in the volumes , and we are made to feel how the suave ministrations of a Reynolds and the boisterous , heavy-footed satire of a Rowlandson or a Gillray , were nourished at the same fountains of social habit . The numerous plates , often in color , from mezzotints and other prints in the collection of Mr. Joseph Grego , who supplies notes on them for this edition , complete an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits , some capital views and a number of humorous pieces . In more than one case the illustration is unfamiliar , and in every case the subject is so interesting , the artistic quality of the original work is so high , and the reproduction has been so perfectly made , that Mr. Grego 's share in the publication is hardly secondary in importance to the text . With this book we take leave of the collector and his editions de luxe , passing to the student and to the works framed for his use , which , as I have indicated , dominate at this time ; but we will remain on English soil . English writers have busied themselves with uncommon energy over the history and criticism of art in the last few years , and of late they have been ' especially attentive to their own heroes and institutions . The books treating of these form a eloni , which serves to bring up the whole ? vies. lion of what the relation of the genius of the people has been to art from the v , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book what Britain 's rulers have done to assemble a great body of work by the mastcN , and to contribute thereby , whether Consciously or unconsciously , to the development of a standard of taste . We have been reminded by Mr. Gosse 's book and by the Angelo " Reminiscences " of that fruitful period in which it must have seemed to those who lived in it that an English school had at last been raised upon a firm foundation . But in neither case have we been made aware of one of those long-continued creative forces of which the student is conscious when he traversing the history of one of the Continental schools . To think of the eighteenth century in English art is to think of masters like Reynolds and Gains-borough , who appeared upon the screw as practically unheralded gifts from the gods , and , dying , left practically no heirs . Hogarth alone survives as a truly racial type , and there has never been a second Hogarth . To think of Mr. Cust 's royal connoisseurs is to remember that the salient Tudor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as years went on it was to alien hands ? to those of a Van Dyck , for example ? that the court was wont to go for its paintings . Native talent , when it cropped up , was for a long time apt to be crassly imitative . The absence of an inborn feeling for art in the British nature is exposed with obviously unintentional clearness by the authors of The Royal Academy and ifs Members , 1768-1830,1 a book in which one would expect to find , if anywhere , some evidences of a national predilection . Without unfairly exaggerating what was , The Royal Academy and its Menders. 176S-1830 . By the late J. E. HODGSON , R. A. , and FRED A. EATON , M. A. Assisted by G. D. LESLIE , R. A. New York : Charles Seribner 's Sons . 1905. dolihi less , is kind of accident , we may , nevertheless , find a rather uninspiring sinificance in the " first cause " of 11'mglard 's most famous art institution . In the book under consideration , written by the late Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the aid of Mr. G. D. 1 , , - tic , it is related that the talk in Lon- in the eighteenth century about starting a more or less official society was brought to a head by the financial returns of an exhibition got up for the benefit of de Foundling Hospital . " That charitable exhibition in Great Comm Street , " re are told , " was the germ of the Royal cademy . " Exhibitions were organized , , pith lively anxiety as to the possible profits , and as we go through this volume it is difficult not to feel that it commemorates a purely economic phase in the development of British art . There is something very characteristic about George the Third 's solicitude for what he loved to call " My Academy . " He had a real share in its administration , undertaking " to supply any deficiencies between the receipts derived from the exhibitions and the expenditures incurred on the schools , charitable donations to artists , etc. , out of his own privy purse ; " and though the artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never ceased to interfere when their actions in money miters struck him as injudicious . From the start , admission to the Academy conferred solid benefits upon an artist ; it meant that he had achieved a definite and honorable standing , and reassured the hesitating purchaser of a picture as nothing else would have reassured him . So it was in the eighteenth century , and so it is to-day . Neither in the old days nor in the new has the Academy stood for an artistic inspiration . The presence of a handful of great men in its earlier councils , such men as Gainsborough or Reynolds , invested it with a passing glamour , but nothing could snake the Royal Academy a really constructive influence , for the excellent reason that the art of the country , broadly speaking , has not potently enough reacted upon its affairs . Messrs . Hodgson , Eaton , and Leslie leave the reader only the more convinced that the institution of which they are so proud stands not as a proof of artistic impulse , but us a monument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work now in course of publication under the title of The Royal Academy of Arts . ' This is a complete dictionary , compiled by Mr. Algernon Graves , of exhibitors front the foundation of the Academy in 1769 to the year 1904 . With each name in the alphabetical list the titles are given of the works exhibited by the owner , the date of exhibition and the catalogue number being affixed . As each letter in the alphabet is dismissed , blank pages arc inserted , so that the record can be carried on almost indefinitely . Two volumes have thus far been published , bringing the list down to " Dyer . " As a work of reference for the historian , whether dealing with the Academy or with any one of a tremendous company of artists , lids handsomely printed compilation commands the warmest praise . It is the kind of book which , when needed at all , is needed sorely . ' lire biographer of an artist , wishing to set t le a question of date , may easily find just the information he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to regret is that he should have been chary of the piquant notes , which , as he has shown in a few instances , he is well qualified to write . Of the few masters whose biographies touch the history of the Royal Academy , Reynolds is the one figuring most conspicuously among recent publications . Sir Walter Armstrong 's excellent critical life of him , 2 which was first published a few years ago in a massive folio , is now available in ? convenient , inexpensive , but still well printed and illustrated , octavo , similar to the reprint of his Gainsborough , issued a year ago . There is also a new book on the subject , Mr. William B. Bard ton 's Sir Joshua Reynolds , P. R. A. , ' which , if less vigorous in its ideas than Armstrong 's work , has the merit of telling the story of the painter 's life with much entertaining detail . Mr. Boulton is not altogether to be blamed for saying nothing new . The subject has been pretty nearly written to death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left by his more brilliant predecessor . Armstrong does not give a wholly sympathetic view of Reynolds as a man . Mr. Boulton denies that he was hard-hearted , and brings some fairly conclusive evidence to prove ins case . This book and the Arm- ! ' strong reprint are cited as good examples of the kind of useful publication that is nowadays being put at the service of the student with a slender purse . Another popular volume that deserves commendation is Mr. Roger Fry 's new edition of Sir Joshua 's Discourses delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy . ' The editor , in his introductions and notes , does a great deal to minimize the insidiously dangerous effect of much that is old-fashioned , and , indeed , actually wrong-headed , in the text . He can not quite turn the Discourses into a living work of instruction , which the reader may enjoy without constantly being on his guard against misconceptions due to Reynolds 's identification with a very early stage in the modern study of art . On the other hand , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student who knows how to make the proper deductions for himself or can use caution in taking advantage of Mr. Fry 's guidance . . Above all things he will learn SONS of the lofty spirit in which the represitaative men of the British school bay " - bored . That spirit has been , indeed , En : , . land 's chief artistic possession . reared up comparatively few painters of the first rank , but she has brought forth many an artist whose noble rage wins sympathy for work that would otherwise be forgotten . This thought springs naturally Iron , the perusal of a book into which , I dam say , the art student preoccupied with technique would scarcely think of dipping : I refer to B. R. Ilaydon and his Friends , ' by George Pastors ( Miss Symonds ) . Rarely has a professional TIM had a career more bitter than that whin ' , fell to the lot of this friend of Keats and Lamb . He had an incurable gift for misfortune . Poverty and disappointment hounded him until he chose suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could write in his journal , on going to see one of Sebastian ? del Piombo 's pictures , " If God cut not my life prematurely short , I hope I shall leave one behind me that will do more honor to my country than this has done to Rome . " In other words , he cherished high ambitions with a splendid sincerity , and the concise , well-balanced account of his career which George Poston has prepared is well worth reading for its reproduction of the atmosphere in which generations of British artists have lived . In the persistence of his misery Haydou is unique , but in bis point of view , in the very soul of him , he is curiously representative . Nobody thinks of admiring his portentous compositions any more , but no one . who studies his life and personality fails to recognize the gleam of the divine lire that be possessed . How often has this boon been granted to British artists without the other endowments necessary for its happy exploitation ! Their name is legion . Again and again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have had the artist 's enthusiasm in its purest - tale , all the devotion to high ideals that the most philosophical criticism ceuld ad , : and again and again these zealous : akers have fallen short of success for : lie tragically simple reason that they itase never , in the strict sense , known low to manipulate paint . This is the olt that we feel behind the strange history of the Royal Academy . This is the Ilandicap which a rare being like a Gains-borough , a Ilogarth , or a Constable has , eaped , but which Haydon and hundreds of others have found nothing less than crushing . One thinks of it with a . harp sense of the vanity of human effort . as one turns to an art book of absorbing interest issuing from the press almost at the moment in which I write these words . The relation of technique to the spirit of the artist is a problem opened anew by I r . W. Holman Hunt in his P re-Raphael- and the Pre-Raphaelite Broth , erhood . ' The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man who was horn in 1897 , began to paint at an early age , has been painting ever since , and , throughout his long career , has been a man of original i. leas and of interesting friendships . He is the patriarch of English Pre-Raphaelitism . He writes as one who assisted at the birth of a celebrated movement , and now , in dignified isolation , defends its principles against an unsympathetic generation . Perhaps " defends " is scarcely the right word , for itis doubtful if in many studios occupied by types of young England the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelites would be discussed with much feeling . In young England 's eyes they are played out . To Mr. Hunt they still burn as they burned in the days when he and Millais and Rossetti lived largely on poetry and dreams , and planned a rejuvenation of English art . In turning his pages one is torn between admiration seal despair . On one side we have the spectacle youth kindling with a magnificent purpose and living laborious nights and days in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pictures of that old life , for its vivid anecdote , for its riches of personalia , and for its manly tone , the narrative is readable and delightful to a wonderful degree . But there is the other side to the medal ; there is the group of young zealots resolutely walking into the impasse so favored by their countrymen in matters of art , the impasse of an inartistic method . Mr. Hunt makes an allusion to this question of method which is touching in its sincerity ? and futility . " It is HOW high time , " he says , " to correct one important misapprehension . In agreeing to use the utmost elaboration in painting our first pictures , we never meant inure than to insist that the practice was essential for training the eye and hand of the young artist ; we should not have admitted that the relinquishment of this habit of work by a matured painter would make him less a Pre-Raphaelite . I can say this the better because I have retained , later than either of my companions did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the burden of what the Pre-Raphaelites actually produced . Millais , who was most the instinctive painter in the group , developed , as we all know , a method of his own ? and ceased completely to be a Pre-Raphaelite . Rossetti , it is true , broadened in his style to some extent , but he retained , no less than Hunt did himself , the essential temper of the cult , and that was all for a meticulous realism which was hung like a millstone around the neck of every man dedicated with greater or less fervor to the establishment of the Pre-Raphaelite idea . Hunt , Rossetti , Madox Brown , Burne-Jones , ? these and all the others made the same mistake . Many commentators have proceeded as though there was something deeply esoteric about the Pre-Raphael- , ? 71 ; Significant Art Books ites ; they IIIIVC taken the movement with an appalling seriousness , as though it had something dramatically memorable about it , instead of being an episode which , on the Continent , would long since have been put in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , is not what Hunt and his comrades meant when they formed their Brotherhood ; it is not the priority of this or that contributor to the scheme , though this is fair game in an historical byway . No , the true point is simply that the Pre-Raphaelites , as Mr. Hunt shows , sought to return to nature , to build their works on the rock of truth , and , in the effort to do this , forgot to learn what to leave out . They went in for excessive definition . and in wreaking themselves on unimportant details they paralyzed what we may call the nerve centres of artistic freedom : they narrowed their vision until they saw all the petals of a rose and not the rose ; they cramped their brush hands within the limits of an almost calligraphic style , until all that meant the bold caressing of pigment became to them a sealed book . The frontispiece to Mr. Hunt 's first volume offers a perfect illustration of the point . It is from his painting of The Lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for Moxon 's edition of Tennyson , years ago took captive every lover of subtly woven line . The painting , as we see it in the frontispiece aforesaid , is a glorious invention ; the romantic figure with its waving tresses is set in a scene that is itself all fascination ; and here you have , indeed , a poetical conception which owes quite as much of its quality to Hunt as it owes to Tennyson . Yet to apprehend it on these high grounds the critic has to shut his eyes to a hundred details , to passages in the delineation of the figure and the accessories which are hopelessly overdone . So it is with all of Hunt 's pictures ; so it is with all Pre-Raphaelitism . The Lady of Shalott is finely imagined ; so are The Eve of St. Agnes , Valentine and Sylvia , The Light of the World , and The Hireling Shepherd , and so are all the rest . only at the rarest intervals , in a portrait win a glimpse of landscape , has Mr. Hunt relaxed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his research inn detail . The painter , no less than the part . must , if he is to achieve anything , - itre life steadily and see it whole ; " he wild not exalt the substance over the form . any more than he roust exalt form over substance . He must establish a perfect harmony between the two , and he inns ; learn that if there is a passion which bd. the beauty in a thing of nature 's making . there is a passion which feels the beauty in a stroke of paint laid on the caner , with an inspired sense of the genius of sheer paint . When these two passion , are blended into one , the artist produces a masterpiece . Regret over Mr. Hunt 's failure to put the highest kind of work to his credit is deepened by appreciation of the tone in Isis book , to which reference has already been made . In his preface he has this passage : " Burne-Jones , once conversing upon the shortness of human life for the attainment of maturity in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years were needed . This , though an unpremeditated exclamation , was not a baseless guess . " Here you have the key to Mr. Hunt 's reminiscences ; his high aspirations have never quenched in hint a certain beautiful modesty , and the story of his struggle to attain to mastery in his profession touches the imagination of the reader as some chronicle of heroic things might touch it . Is it not doubly hard , then , to have to admit that the painter 's effort has been only half rewarded , that his pictures have never been stamped with the authority which ought to have been granted to the holder of such ideals ? Remembering all that the history of the British school suggests , one speculates idly as to whether the fate of Holman Hunt , and , for that matter , of all the other English Pre-Raphaelites , has not been determined as much by the force of national temperament as by the mistaken ? c ; huttheyadopted . Does not the group ilitHtrate once more the presence of something in the air of England which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique that only a fire born masters have been able to triaeph over their surroundings ? Certainly one English artist after another has eontirmed this hypothesis . Witness , for example , another of the new books , Mrs. Russell Barrington 's G. F. Watts : Re.iniseences . ' The author of this affectionately fashioned memorial reveals no critical qualifications for her task , and her volume is to be taken only as a stop-gap to serve while Mr. Spielmann is preparing the official biography . Mrs. Barrington has //I/parent/1y little , if any , knowledge of Watts 's limitations . She scarcely realizes that , while he occasionally drew like is master , he more often drew no better than the average student . Though she admits , in speaking of his color , that " at times it onild become almost smoked and murky , to suggestive , I think , of decay , ? she is net aware of the frequency with which Watts , as a colorist , deserved this con/I/num lion . But , on the other hand , her reminiscences are decidedly welcome , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the painter once uttered in her hearing . " I am nothing , " he exclaimed . " Oh ! you will find out I am nothing . One thing alone I possess , and I never remember the time I was without it , ? an aim toward the highest , the best , and a burning desire to reach it ! " As with blunt , so it is with Watts . The man is a creature of spiritualized visions , of grand thoughts ; but no matter with what energy he seeks to translate his conceptions into terms of form and color , he ends by exciting admiration for his moral fibre and for his imaginative qualities , rather than for the envelope of aesthetic beauty in which he tries to present those elements . He once told Mrs. Barrington that he " alas always seeing Titian in nature . " He saw much else there ; he saw a world so full of humanitarian and grandiose ideas that his mind was rapt away from the mundane issues of the studio , and his best pictures became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits rather than the inevitable expression of a trite artist 's view of his material . Struggling about in him were powers of design worthy of the great Venetians , and the grand style was in his blood ; but he conveys the impression of a man who never succeeded in really organizing his resources , if , indeed , he ever seriously tried to do anything of the kind . Think of what his majestic allegories would have been made , think of what we would behold in the many portraits he painted from the leading spirits of his time , if he had subjected himself with a good will to a long period of academic training ! De moves us , as it is , through his spiritual and intellectual qualities ; but with a perfected technique he would not simply have recalled the memory of the old masters , he would have actually revived their tradition as a fructifying force ; and his influence , which has done so much to purify artistic ideals , would have also affected matters of method . We relinquish Mrs. Barrington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emotion of gratitude for the teachings of character , and with a poignant consciousness of how little character alone can do , in art . to withstand the tooth of time , if it is not aided by consummate powers of eve and hand . That there are occasions on which the inexorable law may be suspended is shown by the history set forth in Kate Greenaway , ' by Messrs . M. II . Spielnranr and G. S. Layard . The most charming of all the modern illustrators of children 's books could never quite bring her art to the point of technical perfection which even Ruskin , who was the last man in the world to put form before substance , was constantly urging her to seek . Perhaps , she felt that , in her minor sphere , technical perfection was not of transcendent consequence . At all events , she went her way , doing the best she could , but shrinking with ineradicable sensitiveness from the life studies which Ruskin advised , and contenting herself with the effects easily within her grasp . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she bad followed too assiduously the precepts of the schools , she would have lost some of the sweetness , some of the naivete , some of the freshness which is like unto the freshness of childhood itself , in which we recognize , when all is said , a touch of genius . Mr. Spielmann and Mr. Layard paint a most winning personality in this book , printing many delightful letters written by Kate Greenaway or by Ruskin and other friends of hers ; and the numerous illustrations in colors round out the record of a life summed up in the one word " felicity . " Kate Greenaway lived apart from the main currents of British painting , and from the nature of her work it is probable that the historian of the school will always assign to her a subordinate position . We can imagine the scorn which would be excited in some circles by a sentence in a little note she wrote to Lady Maria Ponsonby , some ten years ago . " Tell Mr. Ponsonby , " she says , " I hate Beardsley more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , who bad not a tithe of Aubrey Beardsley 's technique , has left infinitely more than that young decadent has left which the world will not willingly let die . After all , she drew well enough to say what she wanted to say , and her bewitching little figures have an unfading vitality . As has recently been said of them , they are the embodiment of the civilized world 's child ideal ; " they belong to the eternal spring , with whose sweet freshness the artist so often surrounded them in her drawings , ? to the tender grass , the golden-eyed narcissus , the capering lamb , the rosy apple bloom , the blue sky with its floating lice , at cloud , in which she so delighted . " That is enough , and we willingly let the life studies go , despite Ruskin 's playful pl-c ings . I must briefly glance at a book about one other of his friends and disci. pies , an Englishwoman who was never in any serious sense a maker of works of art , but whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the late Lady Dilke , whose four volumes on the French art of the eighteenth ceimirt it has been my privilege to praise in the pages of the Atlantic . Under the title of The Book of the Spiritual Life , ' her husband has published half a dozen imaginative pieces of hers , prefixing to then a short but adequate memoir . This souvenir of a brilliant and scholarly woman , the intimate of some of the best thinkers of her day , and herself an accomplished and substantially useful writer , should be read by every one interested in the literature of art . We have been long in the atmosphere of things English in this survey of the year 's art books , and we do not altogether leave it in taking up one of the most important of the publications peculiarly our own , Mr. Samuel Isham ' , History of American Painting ? This forms part of the admirable series on American art , which Professor John C. Van Dyke is editing . It divides itself naturally into two sections , the early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isham proves himself a competent historian . Our eighteenth-century painters were less the founders of a new school than they were the missionaries of an old one . Men like Gilbert Stuart and Copley worked from a point of view which had been originally established by Reynolds and his followers , and if we subordinate patriotism to critical principles , we are n . I to be reconciled to a moderate mate of their standing . We can not ' e ourselves on them as upon new own creative types , sprung from our own soil . Ihn neither need we overstate what they ed to English precedent , and it is on this point that Mr. Isham 's book is gratii , herly strong . fin narrates the career of our early men of distinction at some leoglh , giving a clear idea of their per-codifies and of the world in which they ed , and bringing out all those merits which could fairly be called individual . 1k makes it plain , that is to say , that if Stuart was an Anglo-American artist , Ile e as also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest in the group he does for the rest , rendering credit where credit is due for a higher level of proficiency than the casual reader might be disposed to attribute to our pioneers . Mr. Isham shows discrimination as well as sympathy in this first part of his book ; and in his treatment of the immediately succeeding phases of his subject , as well as of the members of the Hudson River school , he uses precisely the discretion called for in a history which has no authoritative predecessor . We have always had a tendency to think pretty well of ourselves ; and since our art history is only about a hundred years old , it is very desirable that it should be described with a sense of measure . For the student no one could be a more inspiriting or a safer guide than Mr. Isham is , among the painters who flourished before the middle of the nineteenth century . He makes an equally good interpreter of those landscape men , like Ines , Wyant , and Homer Martin , who slowly emerged from the rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously in the extension of our range . If he had been able to remain outside his subject , as it were , seeing to its very centre , but preserving otherwise the detachment of the natural critic , he might have dealt wills the modern artists no less luminously than with those who have disappeared from the scene . Unfortunately , Mr. Isham is an artist himself , and in handling the works of his contemporaries he writes as if perpetually in fear of letting himself go . Art history is nothing if not a history of values , and the genuine historian is known no more by his accuracy in the recording of facts than by his courage in estimating the subtler elements for which they stand . It is not enough to be told the name and date of an artist , with a superficial description of the kind of pictures he has painted . We want to know whether he is good or had , whether he is really an artist , or is only a mediocrity , stodgily practicing the rudiments of his profession . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit and as an influence , or is it simply marking time ? Light on these matters is necessary if a reader is to get a workable idea or just what American art , since 1875 , has meant or is meaning to-day . Specific influences , like those of Paris in general and impressionism in particular , require to he followed up through the ramifications of all the studios ; and we may go farther and say that when this has been done it is the duty of the historian to bring some broad ideas of artistic right and wrong , of progress and decay , to bear upon the data he has assembled . His instinct will tell him where to curb the play of his faculty of generalization . Mr. ' sham seems to prefer to remain on the safe side . He runs through the directory of artists , if not with the glibness of an auctioneer , at any rate with little more originality than we would look for in that personage , and the result is an abundance of information of a commonplace sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage : " Another man excelling in pure painting is William T. Dannat , whose early work showed clearly his training in Munich and under Munkacsy . One of his first works , a Quartette , now in the Metropolitan Museum , was declared by Albert Wolff to be the best piece of painting in the Salon of 1881 , and Wolff , if no very subtle critic , knew his trade and voiced accurately the current opinion . " There is more in the same colorless vein . Mr. Dannat is thereby disposed of , roughly speaking , but I wonder if any reader unfamiliar with his work would gather a correct notion of just where he belongs in our artistic hierarchy from what Mr. Isham says about him . The want of grasp in the second half of this book is to be deplored for two reasons . To begin with , Mr. Isham is , as I have said , the first to write a history of American painting on a generous scale , and with modern research . Secondly , he had a unique opportunity to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of kindness . No school is ever the worse for the application of the highest standards in the appraisal of its productions . What Americans have lacked in willingness to buy pictures executed by their countrymen , they have made up in printed , postprandial , and other fervid amiabilities , which , if not unforgivable on some grounds , are at any rate harmful in that they retard the growth of the power of discrimination in the public mind . I rejoice in Mr. Isham 's praise of some of his fellow painters , but I would have greater confidence in his book if I could find in it the bitter truth about this or that painter , characterizations of poor work as poor , with the critic 's reasons for his severity . By this process he would accustom the readers in schools , who will form a large part of his audience , to look at pictures with a livelier curiosity and a sharper intelligence . In the history of art a painter must be candidly and rigorously treated , both as a link in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can his rank be fixed . In some of the current monographs analysis of the individuality of an artist is carried so far as to destroy all sense of proportion ; the writer loses his hold on critical principles in a rapture of admiration . This is notably the case with M. Camille Mauclair , whose Auguste Rodin : the Man , Iris Ideas , his TV orks , is almost a good book . ' The interpretation of th , . French sculptor is helpful at many polo Is but in the long run it bewilders the render through its reckless eulogy . I mention this book , in fact , chiefly for the sake of the specimens it contains of Rodin 's talk . They are full of interest as giving momentary , half-formed glimpses into the workings of his mind . It is worth wading through M. Mauclair 's delirious periods to get at the suggestive reflections which he has quoted from his adored toaster . A very capable biographer is M. Auguste Brea ! , who has written in his elasquez ' just the handbook to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope , there will be a pocket edition of Mr. Ricketts 's book on /he Prado . While we are waiting for it M. lireal promises to hold the field . lie has plenty of enthusiasm in his heart , but he writes with moderation , and his little book forms an almost ideal introduction to the study of Velasquez . It appears in the Popular Library of Art , a series of small illustrated volumes in which Eng . lish and foreign critics have been writing on great subjects in brief and simple fashion . The series is one of the best produced by the recent movement in art literature . To another , the Library of Art , a more ambitious venture , which I have dealt with before , there have lately been added several good monographs . Mr. Basil de Selincourt 's Giotto surveys the painter 's works with thorough-going system , and il is rational in criticism . I like especially the way in which the author has shown that care for what lie calls Giotto 's " religious earnestness of purpose " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore shows a similar freedom from Morellian pedan to a : his Albert Diirer , ' contributed to snore series . He does not attempt to overhaul questions of minute scholarship , but wreaks himself on a broad interpre- tion of Diirer 's genius ; the book is , indeed , simply a long essay , and an essay richly colored throughout by the author 's iwn temperament . Mr. Moore has ideas as well as insight , and from time to time strikes fire from his theme . In a series like the Library of Art the best books are those which are the most provocative , which do most to rouse in the reader an bilcrest in the subject in hand . Such a hook is Mr. Moore 's . The reader must an elsewhere for a full and formal narrative of Dfirer 's career , but Mr. Moore will take him close to the secret of the German master 's ark Mr. M. Henderson 's Constable ' is a creditable piece of recline composition , but there is more el the inspiring quality which we have t.oHnd in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anello.s This is the first book to be written in English about the Italian pointer and medalist , and the author has made the most of his chance . Pisanello is a simple and yet a complex type . His ddle has the purity characteristic of early Italian art ; but while in some of his paintags , like the portrait of Ginevra D'Este in the Louvre , or in some of his drawings , his draughtsmanship has a flower-like delicacy , his medals rise to a plane of antique austerity and force . At one moment he recalls the subtle , evanescent charm of Botticelli ; at another it is the grandeur of Mantegna that he brings to mind . Mr. Hill paints his portrait and interprets his art with a skill worthy of the theme . In all this collection of monographs there is nothing better than this learned but flexibly written book , and Uwe are only two or three of its companions that are so good . Italian art does not loom large in the books of the year . Save for Mr. Hill 's Pisanello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mantegna , for example . A work of which much was expected , Professor Charles Herbert Moore 's Character of Renaissance Architecture , ' has turned out a sad disappointment . The same author 's Development and Character of Gothic Architecture , first published fifteen years ago , was so well written that it had not seemed possible that he could write a dull book on Renaissance . It would seem , however , as if Professor Moore 's devotion to Gothic had dried up any sympathies he may ever have had for the architecture of the Renaissance in Italy . He has traveled about amongst the beautiful buildings of the South , chiefly bent upon proving that men like Alberti , Brunelleschi , Michael Angelo , Bramante , and so on , used classical motives in ways to violate the sanctity of architectural principle , and the result is a book of nearly three hundred captious , irritating pages . There is something comic about the pedagogical gravity with which Professor Moore summons before his tribunal the men of genius who forgot to consult the rules when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts black marks against their names , and dismisses them with a caution . Prejudice could no farther go . But happily , while Professor Moore is reiterating his charges , the architecture of the Renaissance will endure , and those who know a beautiful thing when they see it will go on delighting in Brunelleschi and Bramante . One recalls the words Matthew Arnold supposed himself , in a famous preface , to address in certain circumstances to a portly jeweler from Cheapside . " The great mundane movement , " he said , " would still go on , the gravel walks of your villa would still be rolled , dividends would still be paid at the bank , omnibuses would still run , there would still be the old crush at the corner of Fcnchurch Street . " Likewise I feel that Renaissance architecture will survive Professor Moore 's disapproval . Through allowing his tale of its departures from academic correctness to obscure the record of its splendors , he has discounted the legitimate weight of his argument , and given to what ought to have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The few books that remain for consideration form themselves into two groups . One is composed of volumes relating to museums . M. Salomon Reinach 's Repertoire de Peintures du Mogen Age et de la Renaissance , ' the first volume of which has lately been published in Paris , is a book which students , critics , and historians everywhere will find a precious boon . It giveS in well-drawn outlines the essentials of hundreds of paintings , classified according to subject ; and the notes not only locate every picture , but give the different attributions where the doctors have disagreed , and other information . A mom practical work of reference in its field could not be invented . Paintings of the Louvre : Italian and Spanish ' by Dr. Arthur Mahler , Carlos Blacker , and W. H. Slater , is a judicious handbook to the schools named in the French museum . The small but fairly clear illustrations add a good deal to this volume , which , by the way , is to be followed by one treat- ing of other schools . M. Gustave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery , ' is a book of intelliala and pleasant talk . Printed in han , u , form and with better illustrations , ? r of the photogravures and half-tones in , volume are of a distinctly inferior quality , ? it would make a first-rate pop , , , : , , , , guide ; but under the circumstances unlikely to deprive Mr. Edward well-known volume of its vogue . A nua , - torions contribution to museum literaul , is Sir Walter Armstrong 's account of The Peel Collection and the Dutch Scheel ei Painting , ' in the familiar series of Portfolio Monographs . The illustrations m lab ! he better , but they are pretty good , and the text provides a really valuable description of a signally important group of paint - ings in the National Gallery . Lastly I have to refer to three volumes intended more especially for the collector . In the Connoisseur 's Library , a series of handsomely made volumes , Mr. Alfred Maskell 's Ivories , ' Mr. Dudley Heath 's Miniatures ' and Mr. Frederick S. Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched upon the enterprise . All are written with authority . and contain the numerous facts whiell the collector needs .
