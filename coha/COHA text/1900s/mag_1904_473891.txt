THERE were three of us ? Beard ( civil engineer ) , myself , and Agamemnon ( our servant ) ? hound for a certain unmapped and unexplored portion of Bolivia . Our route lay from Quilca , in Peru , across the one hundred miles of rainless desert that stretches along the whole west coast of South America ; then we were to make a connection with the mail-train that crawled twice a week over this desert to Arequipa . The stand - by bell of the Limari tinkled from her engine-room , our baggage and freight were safely stowed in the wallowing Peruvian lanehas alongside , and the Bolivian mail followed . The Captain of the Port and the Inspector of Customs balanced down the swaying gangway and dropped into the gig alongside . We followed . Before us stretched the long , barren line of rocky coast , fading away in thesoft mist of a Peruvian winter . For it is winter here , damp and chill , in September . Directly ahead is a narrow , ragged break in the cliffs . Inside is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrier of half-concealed rock before us , and soon we are in the smooth waters of the cafion beyond . On either side the red volcanic bluffs - rise for perhaps two hundred feet , their faces scarred and seamed or beaten into grotesque forms by the Pacific of ages past . Up this defile we rowed for several hundred yards , then we rounded a ragged promontory , and the full glories of the metropolis of Quilca burst upon us . A broken flight of steps led from the water , and , back of it all , two thin straggling lines of woven-cane huts hounded the solitary street . Two houses , more dismally pretentious than the rest , with mud walls and corrugated-iron roofs , marked the local seat of government . In the distance rose the red volcanic hills , dull , Hat . and shadowless under the clouded sky of the tropical winter . We had cabled from Lima for horses and a pack-train to meet us and bring us over the desert to San Jose , where we could get the train to the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clatter of the pack-mules as they passed our quarters , and the " Hole , hola ! Huish , huish ! " of their arrieros . It was our train . In the middle of the lone street the arrierns were busy lashing our smaller packages in rawhide nets . Scattered about in the sand were the larger cases of freight ? prospecting machinery and mining hardware ? amounting to a little over a ton in weight ; and still under the guard of Agamemnon in our quarters of the night was the personal equipment ? trunks , instruments , rifles , shotguns , cartridges and powder and shot ? making nineteen hundred pounds more . And blocking the only thoroughfare of Quilca were the twelve pack-mules ? long-haired , disconsolate animals , with pepper-and-salt complexions , save where patches of bare hide showed the chafing of the pack-ropes . They looked as though our own regulation army load of one hundred and sixty pounds per mule would be far too great . And they were to divide four thousand pounds among them . It was eleven o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack lashed in place . The arrieros swung their long , knotted rawhide thongs , the saddle-galled bell-mare clanged as she led the way . and we climbed into our saddles and fell in behind the straggling mules as they led the way up the dismal street and out into the desert . The trail rose sharply as it left Quilea , and then wound around to the right , where it joined the old desert road used by the Spaniards after their conquest , and for centuries before that by the Incas in their barter with the coast . On each side rose white walls of rotten rock , higher than our heads as we rode by , the path between them worn down by plodding hoofs for untold ages . Upon this path the rock was ground to a fine white powder that rose in clouds andcovered us until we looked ahead as through the mists of a fog . Vaguely , over the walls , the ragged volcanic hills silhouetted against the sky . We kept on ascending between these winding walls , at length emerging on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen from the decks of the Lemari . A short distance over the level ground , and then from the farther edge we looked down on the flat , stony bottom of the Vitor Valley ? a ragged gorge that wound a tortuous course through the desert . A narrow trail with short , sharp angles zigzagged down a steep gully to the bottom . The mules carefully picked their way down among the loose stones , halting inquiringly at times to choose perhaps a shorter cut . If it seemed to their instinct feasible , they gathered their hind legs under them , their front hoofs sticking stiffly out in front , and slid down on their bellies , in a cloud of dust , and carrying with them a small avalanche of loose shale as they landed in a section of the trail below . You sit back in your saddle ? all saddles in these parts have cruppers and breastplates to prevent your sliding over the animal 's ears as you go down or slipping off behind as you go up a mountain path ? and as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces itself as to the consequences of a mule 's misstep . That it is not all idle speculation is shown by the scattered skeletons below in the valley , bleached to varying degrees of dull white . We do not descend to the pavement of river-washed stones on the bed of the valley . Twenty yards above , the trail leads abruptly off to the left into a narrow ditch worn in the face of the cliff , which in places has been scooped out to allow for the width of the packs , leaving an insecure overhang of rock above . For miles we followed the contour of the valley , clinging to the steep slopes and the sides of the cliffs that hedged it in . Then down a clayey bank the trail started diagonally across the bottom of the valley to the farther side . Occasionally we would come suddenly on a little clearing where two or three Indians , grisly through the ashen grime , were burning charcoal ? little twigs scarcely bigger than one 's finger . We came out at the farther side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the little stony flat before them , three straggling huts of woven cane with thatched roofs of barley straw marked a lonely hacienda . A few dirty Indians- and their slatternly- wives lounged about . A short distance beyond , the trail led over the steep talus at the base of the cliffs ; then on up through a narrow wedge-shaped crevice that wound back and forth in short ascending turns , till it disappeared over the edge of the mesa a thousand feet . above . For miles on either side it was the only break in the cliff ; and as we looked at the stiff prospect ahead of us , the rocky descent of a few hours before seemed like gentle morning exercise in the Park . For a short distance the trail ran straight up over the loose shale ; then the real ascent began . Ten yards to the right , then ten to the left , and steeper with each change . The mules humped their hacks and scratched along on the toe of the hoof , choosing their foothold with the nice precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right , then two to the left ; then a rest of half a minute , when without urging they would recommence . the ascent . Slowly and tediously we climbed , and finally rode out on a broad , level plateau that stretched away and merged with the desert hills of the distance . Below us toiled our pack-train , tediously weavingback and forth on the zigzag trail . As each section reached the level ground , the arriero dismounted and went among his animals , talking mule- talk , and easing loads to a better balance or tightening the stretched cinches . All the unkempt , hairy sides were heaving with heavy breaths . A few lay down ? a bad sign in a pack-animal . But in twenty minutes every mule was apparently as fresh as ever , wandering about and foraging on the stiff , wiry bunch-grass of the arid soil . And when we started they stepped off easily under their loads , with their long ears briskly flapping . The two small arrieros loft us here and returned to Quilea , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent plodding over the desert to San Jos &; The trail over the plateau had been worn in parallel furrows like the thin strip of a newly ploughed field . Each mule chose his furrow and insistently walked there , resenting the effort of any of the others to get in ahead of him . When a collision ' occurred you could hear the rattle of nail-kegs and the clatter of shovels , picks , and hardware a half-mile off as they hutted and shoved for the right of way . Our two remaining arrieros rode in the rear , muffled in their gaudy woollen ponchos . Occasionally a lean arm would shoot out from under its folds and the knotted thong bite the flank of some lagging mule . These mule-drivers ' thongs are long , braided strips of rawhide spliced into the curb-reinthey use no snaille -- ending in a heavy knot . Its twelve or fourteen feet lie coiled in the bridle-hand until called into service . Then with a twist of the wrist it feeds rapidly out through the right hand , humming like a sawmill as it circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally corrects the indisposition for which it is intended . Often the arrieros imitate its vicious hum , and it will frequently prove sufficient . The trail was distinct enough ? there was no fear of wandering away from its slender ditch worn in the bed of the arroyo . Here and there a ragged little hole dug in the soft walls of white rock marked the lonely home of some desert badger ; and again we would ride past whole colonies of them . In these badger villages the holes fairly honeycombed the sides of the trail and the bluff walls of the arroyos , and the shuffling claw-marks of the badger trails scarred the dust in all directions . There were no other signs of life ; not even the scaly windings of a lizard were to be seen , and the sparse patches of bunch-grass had long since disappeared . Mile after mile we pushed up these narrow valleys . The badger-holes disappeared , and strange desert growths began to appear from time to time . As we had ascended , the clouds had seemed to lower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mists floating about us . One more steep loomed ahead . We pushed through the damp strata of mists clinging to its sides , and came out on the flat land above in the long level rays of the setting sun . Below us , over the clouds , it cast its cold , blue shadows and sparkling high lights , transforming those shifting , unstable vapors into rippling waves of golden foam . To the east the whole desert glowed with color . The long furrows of the trail wove themselves in patterns of orange and purple . Rolling shadows , rich in their changing violets , faded slowly and softly away in the horizon or lost themselves among the ragged mountains that stretched away to the left . Gorgeous reds and scarlets , madders , oranges , crimsons ? every brilliant color of the palette ? spread in glowing masses , changing with each minute of the dying day . The saddle-stiffness , cracked lips , and parched throat , dry with the alkaline dust , were forgotten ? even the dismal clank of the bell-mare slowly toiling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those few brief moments of the vanishing day we felt the subtle desert spell . The shadows grew colder , and merged one into another ; the desert dimmed , a few stars glistened , and , as though a door had closed behind us , we passed into the night . Twilight is short in the tropics . Down by the horizon on ourright the Southern Cross slowly lighted up ? four straggling points of light that feebly struggled with the blazing stars about them . We closed in behind the swaying shadow of the mules , from which came the subdued rattle of packs and creaking cinches , that were the only sounds to disturb the dark stillness . It was but a little way now ; in another hour we would be in camp . Out of the shadow ahead came the clash of picks and shovels , the rattle of a load as it struck the sand , and the swaying shades of the mules divided around a black mass stretched on the trail . It was the first note of exhaustion . For twelve hours the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the halt on the cliff , miles back , end the wonder of it was that , with their loads , none had dropped before . As we rode up we could see against the faint starlit ground the sprawling silhouette of the beast , lying as he fell , the long , expressive ears limp on the desert sand . The arrieros dismounted and pried him on his feet again , and patiently he hit the trail . In the next half-hour four more went down . At one time half our mules were down , and we strung out over the desert for two miles picking them up . A few minutes later we swung off to the right , stumbling through a series of broken ditches ? the remains of the old Inca irrigation systems that ran for miles back into the Andes . Then we dropped down steep winding paths , our shoulders scraping against walls of sand as we turned to the right or eft around the corners . The mules apparently understood that a camp was not far ahead , and seemed fresher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight in our saddles once more , with the hard rattle of stones underfoot and the cool wet sound of running water just ahead . Then the noiseless , padded ground of a corral , and the mules lay down and we climbed out of our saddles . It was the camp at last . A dried old Indian appeared from somewhere , and by the light of his tallow dip I made out the time ? half past three in the morning . We had come seventy-six miles without water or rest- At a little after six we were awake . The sun was rising above the cliffs that lined the valley , though the chill of the night air still lingered . Coffee awaited us in the openwork cane but of the Indian proprietor of this hacienda , and as soon as we finished it we would start . In the daylight we could see that we were in a broad level valley . Through the centre of the valley ran a brook ? a portion of the same Vitor River of the day before , but now dwindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings with low walls of broken stone from some Inca ruin . A short distance off was the mission church of the desert , announced by a cross of two twigs tied with a strip of rawhide arfd surmounting an excrescence of broken stones evidently intended as a steeple . We drank the thick , black coffee , for which the Indian refused both money and presents , and at seven o'clock we started . It was all white sand now , and everywhere the same hot , white glare hedged us in . There was not a breath of air , and as the sun rose higher it beat down with a constantly growing heat . Then once more out on the flat desert above . For endless miles it stretched , quivering in the heated air of the morning . Away down in the east the long line of the ragged , snow-covered Andes loomed up , their summits thrust through the low banks of clouds along the horizon . All signs of a trail had disappeared . The little furrows left by the passing pack - trains were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the west . It is the unvarying steadiness of these winds that causes the curious crescent-shaped dunes of sand found on this desert . There were thousands of these shimmering in the long distances of the heated glare , from little ones just blown into existence and not six inches from tip to tip up to great banks forty feet high and with two hundred feet between the horns . Superheated puffs of air blew from them that struck like a breath from the first run of molten slag . The heat crept between your closed teeth and dried your tongue . When you spoke it was from the throat , and the words seemed to shrivel in your mouth . Fur twenty miles we plodded over the scorching glare , and then , far ahead , a small dark patch appeared . Slowly it developed and became a dull , dusty green ? scraggly palms and a few peach-trees ; then a railroad station with a hot galvanized-iron roof . It was San Jose . In the half-hour to train-time our saddles were off and stored , the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably in the shade of the agent 's thatched porch . The Arequipa train backed in , and the agent and conductor loaded the one lox car , and we followed our outfit in . Through every turn , in every valley as it opened up , were the ruins of the old Inca days ? mouldering scenes of ancient greatness ? all the way to Arequipa . From here we strike into the uncharted interior , and it will be many months before we see even such crude civilization as we are leaving to-day .
