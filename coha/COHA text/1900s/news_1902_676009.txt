txt Commissioner Partridge at a late hour Yesterday afternoon was hastily called from Police Headquarters for a conference with Mayor Low in the City Hall . At the end of the interview he would not tell what it was about . The Mayor was equally uncommunicative . The Police Commissioner was not in a pleasant frame of mind when he left the Mayor . He was angered at an interview appearing in an afternoon paper in which he was made to say that Devery still controlled the police , and that there was no man under him whom he could trust with the exception perhaps of Capt . Cross . " I have been misquoted , " he said , " and I want to have this thing put straight . What I said was that the Devery influence was still too prominent in the department . So it is . What I mean is that those conditions which bear bad influence , which were brought in there I do n't say by whom , are still there . I do not say that Devery is giving orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the subtle influence which prevailed under Devery is still there . " " What do you attribute it to ? " he was asked . " I take it from the fact that the department has been going from bad to worse for fifteen years , and has been getting still worse in the last three or four years when Devery was the ruling spirit there . " " Then it is Deveryism ? ' " Well , that is what they call it . " " Then the police force is still too TammanyizedS " " Yes . I said it was best for-the courts to decide Whether or not Devery is still Chief of Police . He has been removed by legislative action , and he has appealed from that action , and , if the court decides in his favor , why , then , he is Chief of Police again , is n't he ? But I think in that case I have sufficient charges against him to warrant his removal . " " Would you prefer charges as Commis. shiner of Police ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . " " If he were reinstated as Chief of Police , could you hear charges against him as Commissioner ? " " Why . certainly I could . If the decision is in favor of him , it would keep the mate ter in suspense so much longer . " " Have you the material for these charges at hand ? " " They have not been formulated . There is no occasion to formulate them . " " How about the Captains and higher officials of the force . Are they Deveryized ? " " Many et them are ; some are not . " " Do you think more are than are not ? " Well , there are different degrees of Deveryism . They run from the saturated solution of Deveryism through all grades to the ultra extreme . " " Do you feel that there are a large num. ber of higher officers in the department whom yrei can not trust ? " " I believe that there are men , there are many higher officials , who would be absolutely loyal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , notably among these Inspector Cortright . There are some who give me no evidence of a readiness to suppress vice and crime . ' , " How many of those are there who are loyal and how many who are not so loyal ? " That brings up the question of charges . With regard to that question I may say I have made no charges , but it is an open secret that there are Captains against whom it is possible charges may be made . But I have mentioned no names . " " Are the names mentioned in the interview with you this afternoon correct ? ' " I repeat what I said  --  that I mention no names . " " Is the statement about Inspector Cross correct ? " " Not strictly . I look upon Inspector Cross as a capable and efficient office : . He was one the first to show a disposition to carry out the ideas I expressod to the commanding officers on Tan , 1 , aria he has done so with vigor and success . " The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Commissioner is rather despondent and tired of his job . Is he ? " " No . I am not blue over conditions in the department . It is not pleasant to , be misrepresented " Then the dommissioner is still boss oz the department , and not Devery ? " " He is . " ? " It is understood that you have twenty men whom you are thinking ' of bringing , . charges against . Is that true ? " " I can not say . " " How many have you in mind to bring up on charges ? " ? I can not say . " " Did you say that the recent revolt was brought about by Devery ? " The Commissioner hesitated a few moments , and answered : " I did not say it was . It might have been . " ALLEGED POOLROOM FOR WOMEN RAIDED . Inspector Kane WWI Capt . Schmittber ? gees Men Find Racing Cards in Supposed Manicuring Establishment .
