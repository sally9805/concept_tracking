txt IPresident Herbert H. Vreeland of the 1 Metropolitan Street Railway Company , against whom William N. Amory brought the charge of criminal libel subsequent to the accusations of falsified accounts against . 1 the company , issued yesterday afternoon a statement made by expert accountants in i answer to the allegations made in the recent 1 report of Eugene A. Philbin . The statement , whicill was mailed last night to all of the company 's stockholders. 1 Iwas prefaced with a note from Mr. Vreeland to the effect that ill view of " the wide publication of misleading and injurious statements regarding the financial affairs of the company " he had asked Stephen Little , Farquhar J. , and Has1 pins &; Sells , certified public accountants . to make an investigation and submit a report that could be presented to the stockholders . Next came a letter from the expert accountants to Mr. Vreeland , stating that they had been requested to examine " a memorandum containing allegations . Inferences , and conclusions claimed to be based principally upon the reports of your company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This memorandum . " continues the letter signed by the experts . " appears to be identical with the publications in the New York newspapers on April 10 , 1993 , and you inform us that it includes the substance of the charges respecting the management of your company which w-eie called to your attention by the District Attorney of the County of New York . " We have examined this memorandum in detail . Its contents are subdivided into twelve articles , each of which we have carefully investigated . Our comments upon each of them are contained in the report herewith submitted . " We have no hesitation in saying that there is nothing in the reports , and other papers referred to in this memorandum , so ' far as their contents are brought before us. and nothing in any of the comparisons and analyses therein made which affords the slightest ground for any charge of corporate mismanagement , or for the suggestion that any funds of the company have been misappropriated . Nor does an examination of the memorandum raise anydoubt in the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports at the time when they were made , or as to the propriety of the expeditures therein reported . The least that can be said in comment upon the allegations , inferences , and conclusions of the memorandum to which you have called our attention . is that they are wholly mistaken . " THE ACCOUNTANTS ' REPORT . The accountants ' report in full was as follows : " We submit herewith in detail our report upon the memorandum you have handed us . We have considered the subdivisions contained therein in their numerical order . retaining in each case the caption that appears in the memorandum . NO . I. " ' Cash disbursements for new constr'bclion , &c.,; wrongly reported . ' " The allegation under this headline is in effect that during certain specified year .. , : the cash disbursements for new construction and equipment were reported to the Railroad Commissioners as amounting I0 $33.413.421.85 in the company 's cash statement , while in the company 's general baionce sheet they were said to amount during the same period to only *I:rt.:155.572.76 . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect . The sum reported in the general balance sheet for the period stated was $25.703. - 572.70. but the difference , for the purpose of this inquiry , is immaterial . " The question which this comparison seeks to raise is : What became of the missing ** The answer is that there is no missing $10.000,000 , and that the comparison is mistaken . misleading . and contrary to all principles of accounting . The company 's statement of cash disbursements represents obligations paid during the specified period , while the increase in the amount charged to the construction and equipment account . as shown on the balance sheet , represents obligations incurred . The two things are obviously so different that any attempt to compare them is preposterous and conveys no meaning whatever . " The reference to loans and investments and to the difference between the east : statements and the balance sheets in respect of these . is met by the same answer . We repeat that there is no occasion to reconcile the cash statement with the balance sheet , nor is any inference whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . - To base a charge of corporate mismanagement upon the fact that a disagreement does exist is simply absurd . NO . II . " ' False balance of $3.090,000 due from lessor companies carried forward from 1901 to 1902 . ' " The suggestion made under this heading is that because your company reported to the Railroad Commission , ( Report of 1001 , Page 1,071,1 ' amount clue from lessor com1 , : ; 1/iPs ? June 30 , 1901. ** and the next year reported ( Page 1,109 , ) ? balance due from lessor companies , June 30 , 1901 : $5,245,598.78 , ' it follows that a false balance was stated . amounting to 83,000.000 . This inference is entirely unwarranted . The transaction embodied in these two reports was simply this ? $h.000.000 had been paid by the lessor companies to the Metropolitan in notes on account of additions and betterments made by the Metropolitan Company upon their respective lines , and the notes falling due . were not paid by the lessor companies , but were taken up by the Metropolitan Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the notes were. : of course . charged back to the lessor companies ' accounts on the Metropolitan Company 's books . NOS . HI .. IV .. V. , VI . " ' In relation to the Second Avenue Railroad Company ' : ( IV . ) ' Repeated charges ' ter same construction work oil certain leased lines ' : ( V. ) ' Excessive charge for reconstruction on the Thirtyfourth Street Crosstown Railway Company ' : ( VI . ) ' Neglect to report in detail cost of new construction year by year . ' ? ? The points raised under these headings relate mainly to the cost of construction work , and are merely expressions of opinion that this cost was excessive . " We shall not undertake to discuss that question as to which certainly no one : s qualified to form an opinion who does not know of his own knowledge all of the physical conditions under which a given piece of road was built . " In making out the allegation that this cost of construction was too great , it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports your company has made to the Railroad Commission . Certain items reported as the cost of constructing a certain road during a given year are pointed out , and attention is then called to the statement in the same report that the road is in operation . Thereafter a further creased item , stated in respect of a subsequent year Ls cited , and , recalling that the road was said-to he in operation , it to assumed that this state of the accounts implies a double charge . There is no - ground for such an assumption . The work of construction is not necessarily , nor often , completed when the road is put into opera -- tion . On the contrary . it goes on for months , even years . and any charge for that road in the report of a given year means only the cost of such mileage as was constructed and accounted for during that year . " Another mistaken assumption of a ? aim . filar kind appears under the above captions . Observing in the annual reports amounts therein stated to be expended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the road therein stated , it is assumed that the charge applies to the entire mileage so reported . But it is not so . The charge made represents the cost pf such work as has been actually done and accounted for at the time the report is made . Subsequent charges refer to subsequent - work , and all such charges added together are the cost of the entire mileage ' of the road . An illustration of the manner in which the author of this memorandum has continually imposed upon himself in the examination of your annual reports appears in the criticism that ' The enormous sums carried by your company year by year since MIS under the head of " New construction on lines owned and leased to be distributed " ( reaching a total of more than 322,000,000 in 1901 , ) would permit of an apparently easy way for falsification of accounts and for misappropriation of funds . ' On the contrary , an undistributed account would be the very last place in which anybody would undertake to conceal false accounts or misappropriated funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully accounted for , and it is by no means remarkable that the Metropolitan Company , during the period of its sudden and wonderful expansion , should have had a very large open account . The remark that ' no necessity existed for such an account , ' disqualifies anyone who makes it from discussing the accounts of the Metropolitan Road . Your company was building for She account of many subsidiary companies , and the best way to keep its construction account intelligently and with accuracy was the way in which it was kept : namely , by holding it together until the work was completed , and then apportioning the amount to the different properties to which it appertained . NO . VII . Excessive charge for engineering and superintendence on the Central Park , North and East River Railroad Company . ' " Under this headline attention is called to an entry in the company 's report of 1902 of $322,340.45 expended for engineering and Superintendence. and , adding thereto some other items , it is made to appear that the charge for this service upon a mil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e:141.731.ae . It appears that the company 's report in respect to this charg ** contain a clerical error , and that $200,000 of the $322,340. - 15 should have been charged to track and roadway and electric line construction . This . of course , does not affect the aggregate charge to construction and equipment , as both of these amounts were , included in such aggregate . The item of 59.1192.97 stated by the company to be incurred in confliction with the organization or construction of the property is properly classified by the company . regardless of the date of the road 's organization , and , being an item of legal expense . ' it is in accordance with the provision of the Street Railway Accountants ' Association of America relating to classification , and this memorandum in declaring it to be ' an entirely improper charge ' speaks in violation of the nuthority it cites . NO . VIII . " ' Excessive Claims for the Value of Investments Credited in the Company 's General Balance Sheets . ' " It is here contended that the valuation placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in excess of the actual valuation , ' and the conclusion is reached that , as you have issued a certain amount of Metropolitan stock for these investments , on which stock you pay 7 per cent . dividends . ' the company is paying out annually $1,400.000 to receive in return SSIN0.000. ? because ' the company 's income from these investments , as its own annual reports prove , is but S300,000 a year . ' This is wholly mistaken . The annual reports prove nothing of the kind . They prove that the Metropolitan Company derives that much income in the shape of interest and dividends from these securities . But as lessee or owner of these properties it derives from them also all their net returns over and above their regular dividends , to say nothing of the value of each property to the Metropolitan system as a whole . The false assumption shown above renders this criticism absurd . " Moreover , as a matter of correct accounting , these investments should be held on your books at cost irrespective of their par or market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write up or down the value of its investments to agree with the fluctuations of the market . NO . IX . " Lease by the Metropolitan Street Railway Company to the Interurban Street Railway Company . ' " There seems to be no foundation for the statement that the sum of 823.000.000 to be paid to the Metropolitan Company by the Interurban Company , under the agreement of lease , was to be used for any other purposes than those mentioned in the Metropolitan Company 's circular of Feb. 14. 190a . The Auditor of the company certifies that on Feb. 1 . 1002 , the floating debt of the Metropolitan Company was 810.648 , - 972.81 , of which 30.432,800.46 represented the cost of the Third Avenue stock , and that substantially all of the balance had been incurred in the extension of the electrical system to Metropolitan lines . It seems to be conceded that approximately 812,000,060 would be required to extend the electrical system to the Metropolitan lines which were operated by horse-cars at the time the Interurban lease took effect , so that it follows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt incurred in or occasioned by the purchase of the Third Avenue stock and in defraying the expense of extending the electrical system . " The suggestion that the Interurban transaction provided for the general purposes of the Metropolitan Company . $3.501 , - 000 of the new refunding bonds simply because that happens to be the difference between 354.000,000 , the amount of these bonds reserved for refunding purposes , and 84S,196,000 , the amount of the underlying bonds , is entirely - met by the provision of the mortgage ( which seems to have been overlooked in the memorandum ) to the effect that these $5 , SO4.000 of bonds can not , prior to Jan. 1 . 1920 , be used for any other than refunding purposes . It is simply the usual condition of a refunding mortgage to provide for the premiums upon underlying bonds bearing high rates of interest . - The creation of a separate mortgage of $3.000,000 by the Central Crosstown Company is fully explained by your statement that as the Metropolitan Company owns only about three-fourths of the capital stock of the Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lease , it was clearly to the interest of she Metropolitan Company that the Central Crosstown Company should prooure by the pale of its own bonds the necessary funds to provide for the conversion of its system to electricity , thus placing upon the minority stockholders their proportionate share of the cost of such conversion . " Your Treasurer informs us that the Interurban Company has paid to the Metropolitan Company , under the agreement of lease , the sum of 816.548.000 . From this sum the floating debt existing at the time of the lease has been paid in full and the construction expenditures subsequently incurred have been more than provided for , NO . X. " Alleged Payment of Large Sums of Money by Lessor Companies . ' " Under this heading it is pointed out that , following the stereotyped forms adopted by the Railroad Commission , you have represented that certain amounts of money were paid to the Metropolitan Company by certain lessor companies during certain years . and no account of such payments being found in the reports of those companies , it is alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these items refer are similar in principle to the transactions mentioned , in Article II . of this report . The lessor companies gave to the Metropolitan not cash , but notes on account . It is ridiculous to accuse the Metropolitan Company of having ? availed itself of the printed form of the report of the Railroad Commissioners ? to charge its treasury with something which it never received . " The claims of the Metropolitan Company against its lessor companies , which in this memorandum are said to amount to $13.180,339.63 and of which it is alleged that they ' seem to be totally unfounded . ' represent a debt for improvements and betterments constructed by the Metropolitan Company upon its leased properties . The extent to which they are founded ' would no doubt be realized by any lessor company that undertook to break its lease . NO . XI . " ' Excessive Charge for New Construction in the Year 1902 . ' " The matters which are undertaken to be criticised under the headline above , are not susceptible of intelligent discussion from entries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the absence of thorough and detailed knowledge of all the physical conditions under which it was built is the merest guesswork . In the memorandum many inferences of excessive . cost are based Upton the difference between obligations reported as paid and obligations reported as incurred , and , - of course , there is absolutely no basis for such inferences . Inferences of excessive cost are also based upon the disposition of construction charges which occurred in 1902 at the time the Metropolitan property was leased to the interurban . These charges had been , theretofore undisturbed . They related to work previously done , and the memorandum makes the mistake of assum2ng that they related only'to the work reported as under way in 1902 . " No ground for questioning the correctness of the company 's reports or thepropriety of the charges made in its construe-. than accounts is to be found in-the fact that - the sums reported as having been expended , for construction in a given year appear to be large as compared with the amount of work done in that year , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not necessarily , nor often , apply only to the work so reported . NO . XII . " ' Difference in balance sheets and income account as reported on March 31 , 1902 , to the New York Stock Exchange and to the Railroad Commissioners . ' " Under this ' headin- attention is called to certain differences between a report of your company 's affairs rendered to the Railroad Commissioners as of March 31 , 1902 , and another report rendered to the Stock Exchange . as of the same date . The fact is , however , that although these two reports were made as of the same date , the report to the Railroad Commissioners , being only a quarterly report , Was considered tentative in character and did not include the general construction account , which is reported only at the end of each fiscal years , while the balance sheet submitted to the Stock Exchange , which was not prepared until late in the month of July , was intended to ' he full and complete . Furthermore , in the interim the lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of April 1 , 1902 , so that the statement made to the Stock Exchange necessarily included many adjustments which had not been made when the report to the tailroa-d Commission was prepared . It was necessary that these adjustments should be made to refer back to the period anterior to the date of the lease . The item of cash referred to in the memorandum was a construction fund belonging to th4 Third Avenue Railroad Company , and its ' omission from the Stock Exchange report was properly made in view of the fact that it was not a part of the funds of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company . " The memorandum concludes with a reference to the statement of the income account made by the company to the Stock Exchange . and to the statement made to the Railroad Commission as of the same date , and finding many differerces therein , states that they ' call for a clear explanation in detail . ' With this we do not agree . as the differences are sufficiently explained by the fact that to the Railroad Commission the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly operated . Whereas to the Stock Exchange it was reporting the operations of its entire system , which included a considerable mileage operated by subsidiary companies , who by law make their own reports to the Railroad Commission . STEPHEN LITTLE , " FARQUHAR J. , " HASKINS S. SELLS , " Certifici Public Accountanta . " FIGHT FOR FREE TRANSFERS . Chairman Lehmaier of West Side Committee Seeks a Mandamus . A proceeding has been commenced for a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the Interurban Street Railway Company to give free transfers at the corner of Eighth Avenue and One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street . This proceeding is brought in the name of James S. Lehmaier , Chairman of the Executive Committee of the West Side Committee of One Hundred , as relator . The action is brought in the Supreme Court and is noticed before Judge O'Gorman at Special Term May 4 , and will be pressed for an early hearing and decision in order that if it be appealed it may be decided by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for this department before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney in the Blume case before Justice Worcester , is the attorney for Mr. Lehmaier in this case and Edward B. Whitney is counsel . The proceeding is intended as a test case , and if successful will , it is thought , necessitate free transfers at all points of intersection of the roads covered by the Interurban lease . It was admitted on the trial before Justice Worcester by the company 's Superintendent , Mr. Delaney , that the only reasons he knew of for the refusal of transfers at that point were the old contract between the Third Avenue and Manhattan Railways for S-cent tickets and the belief that the refusal of transfers would be profitable to the company . DRAWS A CAR WITH HIS TEETH . Iron-Jawed Man Entertains Broadway with His Feat of Strength , but Gets Himself Arrested . Otto Petersen , a slim little man , yesterday performed his promised feat of dragging a street car up Broadway at Madison Square with his teeth . But unfortunately the police and the general public were not in the confidence of the press agent of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result he was lodged in a cell in the West Thirtieth Street Station by Policeman John Day , who regarded Petersen as of unsound mind and bent on suicide . The officer 's opinion was shared by spectators until it was learned that Petersen is the athlete who in a few days will leave for Niagara Falls , where he says he will suspend a wire across the falls which will be used by him in a daring feat of carrying a man on his back across the chasm above the roaring waters , while he himself is suspended from a small wheel by his teeth , the wire being suspended at an angle . It was about 4 o'clock when Petersen suddenly darted from the midst of a small group of men standing at Broadway and Twenty-third Street . Reaching the northbound track , Petersen stood in the middle of it and gesticulated to the motorman of a car on its way up towp . The motorman shouted at him and jammed the brake dowp hard . The moment the car came to a stop Petersen quickly fastened one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin in the front bumper , ran it under one arm , and adjusted the other end , which was fitted with a rubber plate , between his teeth . Then he began to tug . The motorman seemed dumfounded , and , releasing his brake , the vehicle began to move very slowly , but it had not gone more than five feet before Officer Day and the conductor of the car had grabbed Petersen and unfastened the chain . Petersen and . some of his friends who had accompanied him to see the feat performed tried to explain matters to Day , but the latter was deaf to explanations , and said , " Sure , the man 's as crazy as a loon . I 'll take him to the house . " And to the house Petersen went , where , in default of bail . he was placed in a cell on a charge of disorderly conduct . Petersen is thirty-three years old , barely more than five feet in height , and weighs only 130 pounds . He is the physical direct or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue , Brooklyn . He resides on a houseboat at the foot of Thirty-second Street , Brooklyn . WANT COPPERSMITHS TO QUIT . Central Federated Union Names Rapid Transit Committee and Hears Milk Wagon Warning . At the meeting of the Central Federated Union yesterday Henry George , Jr. , was allowed the privilege of the floor and reiterated at length his criticism of the Rapid Transit Commission . As a result the Central Federated Union appointed a committee of five to co-operate with other bodies in an agitation for municipal control of rapid transit . According to James Wilson , delegate of the International Association of Machinists , the Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Iron Shipbuilders , which threatens to tie up the shipyards on May 1 , has proved as ungrateful as King Lear 's daughters . Mr. Wilson said that during the strike of the boilermakers in the Townsend-Downey shipyards the machinists had gone out in sympathy , and yet the boiler makers were doing the work of striking machinists at the Quintard Iron Works , foot of East Twelfth Street . It was decided-as the sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Quintard Iron Works , and to so inform the boiler makers ' delegates . Delegate Wilson says that the strike is against the employment of nonunion men . The employers say that it is against the employmatt of members of the Amalgamated Engineers ' Association , whose headquarters are in England . The machinists class them as non-union men . The delegate of the Milk Wagon Drivers ' Union complained that one or two firms were standing firm against the recognition of the union label by the drivers . Out of 1,800 milk wagon drivers 400 had joined the union and one firm had threatened lo discharge any of its members who joined the union . n4ron . Every delegate take notice , " said the rlhairrean . " Do n't allow milk to be supplied to your homes unless there is a union label on the wagon . " Several delegates promised to drink none but union label milk . WhereUpOn other delegates smiled . A misanthropic delegate at the back of the hAll remarked that it was a safe =praise.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
