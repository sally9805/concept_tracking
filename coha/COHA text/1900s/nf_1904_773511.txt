txt // are an interpreter , a helper ; you know better than he does about all things , and your knowledge is to teach his ignorance . " " Certainly , that is what I mean . A pretty state of things it would be if children were to be allowed to think they know as much as their parents . There is no way except to break their wills in the beginning . " " But you have just said that it is not to your will as will that he is to yield , but to your superior knowledge and experience . That surely is not breaking his will : It is of all things furthest removed from it . It is educating his will . It is teaching him how to will . " This sounds dangerous ; but the logic is not easily turned aside , and there is little left for the advocate of will-breaking but to fall back on some texts in the Bible , which have been so often misquoted in this connection that one can hardly hear them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was added " in the Lord , " and " because it is right , " not " because they are your parents . " " Spare the rod " has been quite gratuitously assumed to mean " spare blows . " " Rod " means here , as elsewhere , simply punishment . We are not told to " train up a child " to have no will , but our own , but " in the way in which he should go , " and to the end that " when he is old " he should not " depart from it , " ? i. e. , that his will should be so educated that he will choose to walk in the right way still . Suppose a child 's will to be actually " broken ; " suppose him to be so trained that he has no will but to obey his parents . What is to become of this helpless machine . // which has no central spring of independent action ? Can we stand by , each minute of each hour of each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Go there ? Can we be sure of living as long as they live ? Can we wind them up like seventy-year clocks , and leave them ? But this is idle . It is not , thank God , in the power of any man or any woman to " break " a child 's " will . ' They may kill the child 's body , in trying , like that still unhung clergyman in Western New York , who whipped his three-year-old son to death for refusing to repeat a prayer to his step-mother . Bodies are frail things ; there are more child-martyrs than will be known until the bodies terrestrial are done with . But , by one escape or another , the will , the soul , goes free . Sooner or later , every human being comes to know and prove in his own estate that freedom of will is the only freedom for which there are no chains possible , and that in Nature 's whole reign of law nothing is so largely provided for as liberty . Sooner or later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , it comes through clouds of antagonism , and after days of fight , and is hard-bought . It should come sooner , like the kingdom of God , which it is , ? " without observation , " gracious as sunshine , sweet as dew ; it should begin with the infant 's first dawning of comprehension that there are two courses of action , two qualities of conduct : one wise , the other foolish ; one right , the other wrong . I am sure , for I have seen , that a child 's moral per BITS OF TALK . ceptions can be so made clear , and his will so made strong and upright , that before he is ten years old he will see and take his way through all common days rightly and bravely . Will he always act up to his highest moral perceptions ? No . Do we ? But one right decision that he makes voluntarily , unbiassed by the assertion of authority or the threat of punishment , is worth more to him in development of moral character than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to do by some sort of outside pressure . I read once , in a book intended for the guidance of mothers , a story of a little child who , in repeating his letters one day , suddenly refused to say A. All the other letters he repeated again and again , unhesitatingly ; but A he would not , and persisted in declaring that he could not say . He was severely whipped , but still persisted . It now became a contest of wills . He was whipped again and again and again . In the intervals between the whippings the primer was presented to him , and he was told that he would be whipped again if he did not mind his mother and say A. I fore , get how many times he was whipped ; but it was almost too many times to be believed . The fight was a terrible ble one . At last , in a paroxysm of his crying under the blows , the mother thought she heard him sob out ! ' I " A , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I know once had a similar contest over a letter of the alphabet ; but the contest was with himself , and his mother was the faithful Great Heart // who helped him through . The story is so remarkable that I have long wanted all mothers to know it . It is as perfect an illustration of what I mean by " educating " the will as the other one is of what is called " breaking " it . Willy was about four years old . He had a large , active brain , sensitive temperament , and indomitable spirit . He was and is an uncommon child . Common methods of what is commonly supposed to be " discipline " would , if he had survived them , have made a very bad boy of him . He had great difficulty in pronouncing the letter G , ? so much that he had formed almost a habit of omitting it . One day his mother said , not dreaming of any special contest , " This time you must say G. " " It is an ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to say it again , " said Willy , repeating the alphabet very rapidly from beginning to end , without the G. Like a wise mother , she did not open at once on a struggle ; but said , pleasantly , " Ah ! you did not get it in that time . Try again ; go more slowly , and we will have it . " It was all in vain ; and it soon began to look more like real obstinacy on Willy 's part than any thing she had ever seen in him . She has often told me how she hesitated before entering on the campaign . " I always knew , " she said , " that Willy 's first real fight with himself would be no matter of a few hours ; and it was a particularly inconvenient time for me , just then , to give up a day to it . But it seemed , on the whole , best not to put it off . " So she said , " Now , Willy , you ca n't get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off saying it , the harder it will be for you to say it at last ; and we will have it settled now , once for all . You are never going to let a little bit of a letter like that be stronger than Willy . We will not go out of this room till you have said it . " Unfortunately , Willy 's will had already taken its stand . However , the mother made no authoritative demand that he should pronounce the letter as a matter of obedience to her . Because it was a thing intrinsically necessary for him to do , she would see , at any cost to herself or to him , that he did it ; but he must do it voluntarily , and she would wait till he did . The morning wore on . She busied herself with other matters , and left Willy to himself ; now and then asking , with a smile , " Well , is n't my little boy stronger than that ugly old letter yet ? " Willy was sulky . He understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . " Are n't you going to dinner , mamma ? " " Oh ! no , dear ; not unless you say G , so that you can go too . Mamma will stay by her little boy until he is out of this trouble . " The dinner was brought up , and they ate it together . She was cheerful and kind , but so serious that he felt the constant pressure of her pain . The afternoon dragged slowly on to night . Willy cried now and then , and she took him in her lap , and said , " Dear , you will be happy as soon as you say that letter , and mamma will be happy too , and we ca n't either of us be happy until you do . ' : // " Oh , mamma ! why do n't you make me say it ? " ( This he said several times before the affair was over . ) " Because , dear , you must make yourself say it . I am helping you make yourself say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this room , nor go out myself , till you do say it ; but that is all I shall do to help you . I am listening , listening all the time , and if you say it , in ever so little a whisper , I shall hear you . That is all mamma can do for you . " Bed-time came . Willy went to bed , unkissed and sad . The next morning , when Willy 's mother opened her eyes , she saw Willy sitting up in his crib , and looking at her steadfastly . As soon as he saw that she was awake , he exclaimed , " Mamma , I ca n't say it ; and you know I ca n't say it . You 're a naughty mamma , and you do n't love me . " Her heart sank within her ; but she patiently went again and again over yesterday 's ground . Willy cried . He ate very little break fast . He stood at the window in a listless attitude of discouraged misery , which she said cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ask for some plaything which he did not usually have . She gave him whatever he asked for ; but he could not play . She kept up an appearance of being busy with her sewing , but she was far more unhappy than Willy . Dinner was brought up to them . Willy said , " Mamma , this ai n't a bit good dinner . " She replied , " Yes , it is , darling ; just as good as we ever have . It is only because we are eating it II BITS OF TALK alone . And poor papa is sad , too , taking Ins all alone downstairs . " At this Willy burst out into an hysterical fit of crying and sobbing . " I shall never see my papa again in this world . " Then his mother broke down , too , and cried as hard as he did ; but she said , " Oh ! yes , you will , dear . I think you will say that letter before tea-time , and we will have r : nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I try all the time , and I ca n't say it ; and , if you keep me here till I die , I sha n't ever say it . " The second night settled down dark and gloomy , and Willy cried himself to sleep . His mother was ill from anxiety and confinement ; but she never faltered . She told me she resolved that night that , if it were necessary , she would stay in that room with Willy a month . The next morning she said to him , more seriously than before , " Now , Willy , you are not only a foolish little boy , you are unkind ; you are making everybody unhappy . Mamma is very sorry for you , but she is also very much displeased with you . Mamma will stay here with you till you say that letter , if it is for the rest of your life ; but mamma will not talk with you , as she did yesterday . She tried all day yesterday to help you , and you would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mamma , are you sure I shall ever say it ? " asked Willy . " Yes , dear ; perfectly sure . You will say it some day or other , " // " Do you think I shall say it to-day ? " " I ca n't tell . You are not so strong a little boy as I thought . I believed you would say it yesterday . I am afraid you have some hard work before you . " Willy begged her to go down and leave him alone . Then he begged her to shut him up in the closet , and " see if that would n't make him good . " Every few minutes he would come and stand before her , and say very earnestly , " Are you sure I shall say it ? " He looked very pale , almost as if he had had a fit of illness . No wonder . It was the whole battle of life fought at the age of four . It was late in the afternoon of this the third day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking steadily at the floor , for so long a time that his mother was almost frightened . But she hesitated to speak to him , for she felt that the crisis had come . Suddenly he sprang up , and walked toward her with all the deliberate firmness of a man in his whole bearing . She says there was something in his face which she has never seen since , and does not expect to see till he is thirty years old . " Mamma ! " said he . " Well , dear ? " said his mother , trembling so that she could hardly speak . " Mamma , " he repeated , in a loud , sharp tone , " G 1 G ! G ! G ! " And then he burst into a fit of crying , which she had hard work to stop . It was over . Willy is now ten years old . From that day to this his mother has never had a contest with him ; she has always been able to leave all practical questions affecting his behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think this or that will be better . " his self-control and gentleness are wonderful to see ; and the blending in his face of childlike simplicity and purity with manly strength is something which I have only once seen equalled . For a few days he went about the house , shouting " G ! G ! G ! " at the top of his voice . He was heard asking playmates if they could " say G , " and " who showed them how . " For several years he used often to allude to the affair , saying , " Do you remember , mamma , that dreadful time when I would n't say G ? " He always used the verb " would n't " in speaking of it . Once , when he was sick , he said , " Mamma , do you think I could have said G any sooner than I did ? " " I have never felt certain about that , Willy , " she said . " What do you think ? " " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying it to myself as long as that ! " said Willy , It was singular that , although up to that time he had never been able to pronounce the letter with any distinctness , when he first made up his mind in this instance to say it , he enunciated it with perfect clearness , and never again went back to the old , imperfect pronunciation . Few mothers , perhaps , would be able to give up two whole days to such a battle as this ; other children , other duties , would interfere . But the same principle // could be carried out without the mother 's remaining herself by the child 's side all the time . Moreover , not one child in a thousand would hold out as Willy did . In all ordinary cases a few hours would suffice . And , after all , what would the sacrifice of even two days be , in comparison with the time saved in years to come ? If there were no stronger motive than one of policy , of desire to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first aim should be to educate their children 's wills and make them strong , instead of to conquer and " break " them . SO BITS OF TALK . THE REIGN OF ARCHELAUS . HEROD 'S massacre had , after all , a certain mercy in it : there were no lingering tortures . The slayers of children went about with naked and bloody swords , which mothers could see , and might at least make effort to flee from . Into Rachel 's refusal to be comforted there need enter no bitter agonies of remorse . But Herod 's death , it seems , did not make Judea a safe place for babies . When Joseph " heard that Archelaus did reign in the room of his father , Herod , he was afraid to return thither with the infant Jesus , " and only after repeated commands and warnings from God would he venture as far as Nazareth . The reign of Archelaus is not yet over ; he has had many names , and ruled over more and more countries , but the spirit of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power is at its zenith . He is called Education ; and the safest place for the dear , holy children is still Egypt , or some other of the fortunate countries called unenlightened . Some years ago there were symptoms of a strong rebellion against his tyranny . Horace Mann lifted up THE REIGN OF Al ? ChELAUS. 5 , his strong hands and ' voice against it ; physicians and physiologists came out gravely and earnestly , and fortified their positions with statistics from which there was no appeal . Thomas Wentworth Higginson , whose words have with the light , graceful beauty of the Damascus blade its swift sureness in cleaving to the heart of things , wrote an article for the " Atlantic Monthly " called " The Murder of the Innocents , " which I wish could be put into every house in the United States . Some changes in school organizations resulted from these protests ; in the matter of ventilation of schoolrooms some real improvement was probably effected ; though we shudder to think how much room remains for further improvement , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools in Brooklyn that in the primary departments of the grammar schools " an average daily number of 33,275 pupils are crowded into one-half the space provided in the upper departments for an average daily attendance of 26,359 ; or compelled to occupy badly lighted , inconvenient , and ill-ventilated galleries , or rooms in the basement stories . " But in regard to the number of hours of confinement , and amount of study required of children , it is hard to believe that schools have ever been much more murderously exacting than now . The substitution of the single session of five hours for the old arrangement of two sessions of three hours each , with a two-hours interval at noon , was regarded as a great gain . So it would be , if all the brain-work // of the day were done in that time ; but in most schools with the five-hours session , there is next to no provision for studying in school-hours , and the pupils are required to learn two , three , or four lessons at home . Now , when is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , before school ; that is plain . School ends at two . Few children live sufficiently near their schools to get home to dinner before half past two o'clock . We say nothing of the undesirableness of taking the hearty meal of the day immediately after five hours of mental fatigue ; it is probably a less evil than the late dinner at six , and we are in a region where we are grateful for less evils ! Dinner is over at quarter past three ; we make close estimates . In winter there is left less than two hours before dark . This is all the time the child is to have for out-door play ; two hours and a half ( counting in his recess ) out of twenty-four . Ask any farmer , even the stupidest , how well his colt t or his lamb would grow if it had but two hours a day of absolute freedom and exercise in the open air , and that ? in the dark and the chill of a late afternoon ! In spite of the dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on until he is called in by you , who , if you are an American mother , care a great deal more than he does for the bad marks which will stand on his week 's report if those three lessons are not learned before bedtime . He is tired and cold ; he does not want to study ? who would ? It is six o'clock before he is fairly at it . You work harder than he does , and in half an hour one lesson is learned ; then comes tea . After tea half an // hour , or perhaps an hour , remains before bed-time ; in this time , which ought to be spent in light , cheerful talk or play , the rest of the lessons must be learned . He is sleepy and discouraged . Words which in the freshness of the morning he would have learned in a very few moments with ease , it is now simply out of his power to commit to memory . You , if you are not superhuman , grow impatient . At eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in no condition for healthful sleep ; and his heart oppressed with the fear of " missing " in the next day 's recitations . And this is one out of the school-year 's two hundred and sixteen days ? all of which will be like this , or worse . One of the most pitiful sights we have seen for months was a little group of four dear children , gathered round the library lamp , trying to learn the next day 's lessons in time to have a story read to them before going to bed . They had taken the precaution to learn one lesson immediately after dinner , before going out , cutting their out-door play down by half an hour . The two elder were learning a long spelling-lesson ; the third was grappling with geographical definitions of capes , promontories , and so forth ; and the youngest was at work on his primer . In spite of all their efforts , bedtime came before the lessons were learned . The little geography student had been nodding over her book for some minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care ; I 'm so sleepy . I had rather go to bed than hear ally kind of a story . " But the elder ones were grieved and unhappy , and said , " There wo n't ever be // any time ; we shall have just as much more to learn to-morrow night . " The next morning , however , there was a sight still more pitiful : the Child of seven , with a little bit of paper and a pencil , and three sums in addition to be done , and the father vainly endeavoring to explain them to him in the hurried moments before breakfast . It would be easy to show how fatal to all real mental development , how false to all Nature 's laws of growth , such a system must be ; but that belongs to another side of the question . We speak now simply of the effect of it on the body ; and here we quote largely from the admirable article of Col. Higginson 's , above mentioned . No stronger , more direct , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , according to Carlyle , was the only perfectly healthy literary man who ever lived . He gave it as his deliberate opinion , in conversation with Basil Hall , that five and a half hours form the limit of healthful mental labor for a mature person . ' This I reckon very good work for a man , ' he said . ' I can very seldom work six hours a day . ' Supposing nis estimate to be correct , and five and a half hours the reasonable limit for the day 's work of a mature intellect , it is evident that even this must be altogether too much for an immature one . ' To suppose the youthful brain , ' says the recent admirable report , by Dr. Ray , of the Providence Insane Hospital , ' to be capable of an amount of work which is considered an ample allowance to an adult brain is simply absurd . ' ' It would be wrong , therefore , to deduct less than a half // hour from Scott 's estimate , for even the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of real mental effort for them , and reducing this for all younger pupils very much further . ' " But Scott is not the only authority in the case ; let us ask the physiologists . So said Horace Mann before us , in the days when the Massachusetts school system was in process of formation . He asked the physicians in 184o , and in his report printed the answers of three of the most eminent . The late Dr. Woodward , of Worcester , promptly said that children under eight should never be confined more than one hour at a time , nor more than four hours a day . " Dr. James Jackson , of Boston , allowed the children four hours schooling in winter and five in summer , but only one hour at a time ; and heartily expressed his detestation of giving young children lessons to learn at home . " Dr. S. G. Howe , reasoning elaborately on the whole subject , said that children under eight years of age should never be confined more than half an hour at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can study four hours daily . Children between eight and fourteen should not be confined more than three-quarters of an hour at a time , having the last quarter of each hour for exercise on the playground . " Indeed , the one thing about which doctors do not disagree is the destructive effect of premature or ex56 BITS OP TALK . cessive mental labor . I can quote you medical authority for and against every maxim of dietetics beyond the very simplest ; but I defy you to find one man who ever begged , borrowed , or stole the title of M.D. , and yet abused those two honorary letters by asserting under their cover that a child could safely study as much as a man , or that a man could safely study more than six hours a day . " " The worst danger of it is that the moral is written at the end of the fable , not at the beginning . The organization in youth is so dangerously elastic that the result of these intellectual excesses is not seen until years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight fall , which she ought not to have felt for an hour , or some business man breaks down in the prime of his years from some trifling over-anxiety , which should have left no trace behind , the popular verdict may be Mysterious Providence ; ' but the wiser observer sees the retribution for the folly of those misspent days which enfeebled the childish constitution instead of ripening it . One of the most striking passages in the report of Dr. Ray , before mentioned , is that in which he explains that , ' though study at school is rarely the immediate cause of insanity , it is the most frequent of its ulterior causes , except hereditary tendencies . ' It diminishes the conservative power of the animal economy to such a degree that attacks of disease which otherwise would have passed of safely destroy life almost before danger fs anticipated . " // It would be easy to multiply authorities on these points . It is hard to stop . But our limits forbid any thing like a full treatment of the subject . Yet discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a reform is brought about . Teachers are to blame only in part for the present wrong state of things . They are to blame for yielding , for acquiescing ; but the real blame rests on parents . I-Iere and there , individual fathers and mothers , taught , perhaps , by heart-rending experience , try to make stand ' against the current of false ambitions and unhealthy standards . But these are rare exceptions . Parents , as a class , not only help on , but create the pressure to which teachers yield , and children are sacrificed . The whole responsibility is really theirs . They have in their hands the power to regulate the whole school routine to which their children are to be subjected . This is plain , when we once consider what would be the immediate effect in any community , large or small , if a majority of parents took action together , and persistently refused to allow any child under fourteen to be confined in school more than four hours out of the twenty-four , more than one hour at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' brain-work in a day . The law of supply and demand is a first principle . In three months the schools in that community would be entirely reorganized , to accord with the parents ' wishes ; in three years the improved average health of the children in that community would bear its own witness in ruddy bloom along the streets ; and perhaps even in one // generation so great gain of vigor might be made that the melancholy statistics of burial would no longer have to record the death under twelve years of age of more than two-fifths of the children who are born . // THE AWKWARD AGE . THE expression defines itself . At the first sound of the words , we all think of some one unhappy soul we know just now , whom they suggest . Nobody is ever without at least one brother , sister , cousin , or friend on hand , who is struggling through this social . lough of despond ; and nobody ever will be , so long Ls the world goes on taking it for granted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through it . Nature never meant any such thing . Now and then she blunders or gets thwarted of her intent , and turns out a person who is awkward , hopelessly and forever awkward ; body and soul are clumsy together , and it is hard to fancy them translated to the spiritual world without too much elbow and ankle . However , these are rare cases , and come in under the law of variation . But an awkward age , ? a necessary crisis or stage of uncouthness , through which all human beings must pass , ? Nature was incapable of such a conception ; law has no place for it ; development does not know it ; instinct revolts from it ; and man is the only animal who has been silly and wrong-headed enough to stumble into it . The explanation and the remedy 6o BITS OF TALL are so simple , so close at hand , that we have not seen them . The whole thing lies in a nutshell . Where does this abnormal , uncomfortable period come in ? Between childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition from one to the other . When human beings , then , are neither boys nor men , girls nor women , they must be for a few years anomalous creatures , must they ? We might , perhaps , find a name for the individual in this condition as well as for the condition . We must look to Du Chaillu for it , if we do ; but it is too serious a distress to make light of , even for a moment . We have all felt it , and we know how it feels ; we all see it every day , and we know how it looks . What is it which the child has and the adult loses , from the loss of which comes this total change of behavior ? Or is it something which the adult has and the child had not ? It is both ; and until the loss and the gain , the new and the old , are permanently separated and balanced , the awkward age lasts . The child was overlooked , contradicted , thwarted , snubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? in many cases , thank God , very seldom . But the liability was there , and he knew it ; he never forgot it , if you did One burn is enough to make fire dreaded . The adult , once fairly recognized as adult , is not overlooked , contradicted , thwarted , snubbed , insulted , whipped ; at least , not with impunity . To this gratifying freedom , these comfortable exemptions , when they are once es . tablished in our belief , we adjust ourselves , and gross contentedly good-mannered . To the other regime THE AWKWARD AGE . bt while we were yet children , we also somewhat adjusted ourselves , were tolerably well behaved , and made the best of it . But who could bear a mixture of both ? What genius could rise superior to it , could be itself , surrounded by such uncertainties ? No wonder that your son comes into the room with a confused expression of uncomfortable pain on every feature , when he does not in the least know whether he will be recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder he sits down in his chair with movements suggestive of nothing but rheumatism and jack-knives , when he is thinking that perhaps there may be some reason why he should not take that particular chair , and that , if there is , he will be ordered up . No wonder that your tall daughter turns red , stammers , and says foolish things on being courteously spoken to by strangers at dinner , when she is afraid that she may be sharply contradicted or interrupted , and remembers that day before yesterday she was told that children should be seen and not heard . I knew a very clever girl , who had the misfortune to look at fourteen as if she were twenty . At home , she was the shyest and most awkward of creatures ; away from her mother and sisters , she was self-possessed and charming . She said to me , once , " Oh ! I have such a splendid time away from home . I 'm so tall , everybody thinks I am grown up , and everybody is civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of superb physique , charming temperament , and uncommon talent , who is to this day ? and he Is twenty-five years old ? nervous and ill at // ease in talking with strangers , in the presence of his own family . He hesitates , stammers , and never does justice to his thoughts . He says that he believes he shall never be free from this distress ; he can not escape from the recollections of the years between fourteen and twenty , during which he was so systematically snubbed that his mother 's parlor was to him worse than the chambers of the Inquisition . He knows that he is now sure of courteous treatment ; that his friends are all proud of him ; but the old cloud will never entirely disappear . Something g has been lost which can never be regained . And the loss is not his alone , it is theirs too ; they are all poorer for life , by reason of the unkind days which are gone . This , then , is the explanation of the awkward age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the source whence its misery springs . Everybody 's consciousness bears witness . Everybody knows , in the bottom of his heart , that , however much may be said about the change of voice , the thinness of cheeks , the sharpness of arms , the sudden length in legs and lack of length in trousers and frocks , ? all these had nothing to do with the real misery . The real misery was simply and solely the horrible feeling of not belonging anywhere ; not knowing what a moment might bring forth in the way of treatment from others ; never being sure which impulse it would be safer to follow , to retreat or to advance , to speak or to be silent , and often overwhelmed with unspeakable mortification at the rebuff of the one or the censure of the other . Oh ! how // dreadful it all was ! How dreadful it all is , even to remember ! It would be malicious even to refer to it , except to point out the cure . The cure is plain . It needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be enough . If human beings are so awkward at this unhappy age , and so unhappy at this awkward age , simply because they do not know whether they are to be treated as children or as adults , suppose we make a rule that children are always to be treated , in point of courtesy , as if they were adults ? Then this awkward age ? this period of transition from an atmosphere of , to say the least , negative rudeness to one of gracious politeness ? disappears . There can not be a crisis of readjustment of social relations : there is no possibility of such a feeling ; it would be hard to explain to a young person what it meant . Now and then we see a young man or young woman who has never known it . They are usually only children , and are commonly spoken of as wonders . I know such a boy to-day . At seventeen he measures six feet in height ; he has the feet and the hands of a still larger man ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than grace . But his manner is , and always has been , sweet , gentle , composed , ? the very ideal of grave , tender , frank young manhood . People say , " How strange !

Neither his father nor his mother ever departed for an instant , in their relations with him , from the laws of courtesy and kindliness of demeanor which governed their relations with others . // He knew but one atmosphere , and that a genial one , from his babyhood up ; and in and.of this atmosphere has grown up a sweet , strong , pure soul , for which the quiet , self-possessed manner is but the fitting garb .

DURING the whole of one of last summer 's hottest days I had the good fortune to be seated in a railway car near a mother and four children , whose relations with each other were so beautiful that the pleasure of watching them was quite enough to make one forget the discomforts of the journey . It was plain that they were poor ; their clothes were coarse and old , and had been made by inexperienced hands . The mother 's bonnet alone would have been enough to have condemned the whole party on any of the world 's thoroughfares . I remembered afterward , with shame , that I myself had smiled at the first sight of its antiquated ugliness ; but her face was one which it gave you a sense of rest to look upon , ? it was so earnest , tender , true , and strong . It had little comeliness of shape or color in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ; she had worked hard ; she had evidently been much ill ; but I have seen few faces which gave me such pleasure . I think that she was the wife of a poor clergyman ; and I think that clergyman must be one of the Lord 's best watchmen of souls . The children ? two boys and two girls ? 5 // were all under the age of twelve , and the youngest could not speak plainly . They had had a rare treat ; they had been visiting the mountains , and they were talking over all the wonders they had seen with a glow of enthusiastic delight which was to be envied . Only a word-for-word record would do justice to their conversation ; no description could give any idea of it , ? so free , so pleasant , so genial , no interruptions , no contradictions ; and the mother 's part borne all the while with such equal interest and eagerness that no one not seeing her face would dream that she was any other than an elder sister . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary fot her to deny requests , and to ask services , especially from the eldest boy ; but no young girl , anxious to please a lover , could have done either with a more tender courtesy . She had her reward ; for no lover could have been more tender and manly than was this boy of twelve . Their lunch was simple and scanty ; but it had the grace of a royal banquet . At the last , the mother produced with much glee three apples and an orange , of which the children had not known . All eyes fastened on the orange . It was evidently a great rarity . I watched to see if this test would bring out selfishness . There was a little silence ; just the shade of a cloud . The mother said , " How shall I divide this ? There is one for each of you ; and I shall be best off of all , for I expect big tastes from each of you . " " Oh , give Annie the orange . Annie loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sudden air of a conqueror , and at the same time taking the smallest and worst apple himself . " Oh , yes , let Annie have the orange , " echoed the second boy , nine years old . " Yes , Annie may have the orange , because that is nicer than the apple , and she is a lady , and her brothers are gentlemen , " said the mother , quietly . Then there was a merry contest as to who should feed the mother with largest and most frequent mouthfuls ; and so the feast went on . Then Annie pretended to want apple , and exchanged thin golden strips of orange for bites out of the cheeks of Baldwins ; and , as I sat watching her intently , she suddenly fancied she saw longing in my face , and sprang over to me , holding out a quarter of her orange , and saying , " Do n't you want a taste , too ? " The mother smiled , understandingly , when I said , " No , I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care about oranges . " At noon we had a tedious interval of waiting at a dreary station . We sat for two hours on a narrow platform , which the sun had scorched till it smelt of heat . The oldest boy ? the little lover ? held the youngest child , and talked to her , while the tired mother closed her eyes and rested . Now and then he looked over at her , and then back at the baby ; and at last he said confidentially to me ( for we had become fast friends by this time ) , " Is n't it funny , to think that I was ever so small as this baby ? And papa says that . hen m imma was almost a little girl herself . " // The two other children were toiling up and down the banks of the railroad-track , picking ox-eye daisies , buttercups , and sorrel . They worked like beavers , and soon the bunches were almost too big for their little hands . Then they came running to give them to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how that poor , tired woman will hate to open her eyes ! and she never can take those great bunches of common , fading flowers , in addition to all her bundles and bags . " I was mistaken . " Oh , thank you , my darlings ! How kind you were ! Poor , hot , tired little flowers , how thirsty they look ! If they will only try and keep alive till we get home , we will make them very happy in some water ; wo n't we ? And you shall put one bunch by papa 's plate , and one by mine . " Sweet and happy , the weary and flushed little children stood looking up in her face while she talked , their hearts thrilling with compassion for the drooping flowers and with delight in the giving of their gift . Then she took great trouble to get a string and tie up the flowers , and then the train came , and we were whirling along again . Soon it grew dark , and little Annie 's head nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " Dear , are you too tired to let little Anne put her head on your shoulder and take a nap ? We shall get her home in much better case to see papa if we can manage to give her a little sleep . " How many boys of twelve hear such words as these from tired , overburdened mothers ? // Soon came the city , the final station , with its bustle and noise . I lingered to watch my happy family , hoping to see the father . " Why , papa is n't here ! " exclaimed one disappointed little voice after another . " Never mind , " said the mother , with a still deeper disappointment in her own tone ; " perhaps he had to go to see some poor body who is sick . " In the hurry of picking up all the parcels , and the sleepy babies , the poor daisies and buttercups were left forgotten in a corner of the rack . I wondered if the mother had not intended this . May I be forgiven for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little group , standing still just outside the station , and heard the mother say , " Oh , my darlings , I have forgotten your pretty bouquets . I am so sorry ! I wonder if I could find them if I went back . Will you all stand still and not stir from this spot if I go ? " " Oh , mamma , do n't go , do n't go . We will get you some more . Do n't go , " cried all the children . " Here are your flowers , madam , " said I. " I saw that you had forgotten them , and I took them as mementoes of you and your sweet children . " She blushed and looked disconcerted . She was evidently unused to people , and shy with all but her children . However , she thanked me sweetly , and said , ? " I was very sorry about them . The children took such trouble to get them ; and I think they will revive in water . They can not be quite dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an emphasis which went from my heart to hers . Then all her shy7o BI7 'S OF TALK . ness fled . She knew me ; and we shook hands , and smiled into each other 's eyes with the smile of kindred as we parted . As I followed on , I heard the two children , who were walking behind , saying to each other , " Would n't that have been too bad ? Mamma liked them so much , and we never could have got so many all at once again . " " Yes , we could , too , next summer , " said the boy , sturdily . They are sure of their " next summers , " I think , all six of those souls , ? children , and mother , and father . They may never again gather so many ox-eye daisies and buttercups " all at once .

Instead of the stones which are what strangers chiefly expect at her hands , she gives us a wealth of fertile meadows ; instead of stormy waves breaking on a frowning coast , she shows us smooth basins whose shores are soft and wooded to the water 's edge , and into which empty wonderful tidal rivers , whose courses , where the tide-water has flowed out , lie like curving bands of bright brown satin among the green fields . She has no barrenness , no unsightliness , no poverty ; everywhere beauty , everywhere riches . She is biding her time . But most beautiful among her beauties , most wonderful among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' travel in the provinces , I have been constantly more and more impressed by their superiority in appearance , size , and health to the children of the New England and Middle States . In the outset of our journey I was struck by it ; along all the roadsides they looked up , boys and girls , fair , broad-cheeked , sturdylegged , such as with us are seen only now and then . I did not , however , realize at first that this was the universal law of the land , and that it pointed to some72 BITS OF TALK . thing more than climate as a cause . But the first school that I saw , en masse , gave a startling impetus to the train of observation and inference into which I was unconsciously falling . It was a Sunday school in the little town of Wolfville , which lies between the Gaspcreau and Cornwallis rivers , just beyond the meadows of the Grand Prd , where lived Gabriel Lajeunesse , and Benedict Bellefontaine , and the rest of the " simple Acadian farmers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " looked on the happy valley " that Sunday morning . Convicting Longfellow of a mistake , they did descend " from their stations , " on solemn Blomidon , and fell in ' a slow , unpleasant drizzle in the streets of Wolfville and Horton . I arrived too early at one of the village churches , and while I was waiting for a sexton a door opened , and out poured the Sunday school , whose services had just ended . On they came , dividing in the centre , and falling to the right and left about me , thirty or forty boys and girls , between the ages of seven and fifteen I looked at them in astonishment . They all had fair skins , red cheeks , and clear eyes ; they were all broadshouldered , straight , and sturdy ; the younger ones were more than sturdy , ? they were fat , from the ankles up . But perhaps the most noticeable thing cf all was the quiet , sturdy , unharassed expression which their faces wore ; a look which is the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely see in children over two or three years old . Boys of eleven or twelve were there , with shoulders broader than the average of out +li : .. : " pro // boys at sixteen , and yet with the pure , childlike look on their faces . Girls of ten or eleven were there who looked almost like women , ? that is , like ideal women , ? simply because they looked so calm and undisturbed . The Saxon coloring prevailed ; three-fourths of the eyes were blue , with hair of that pale ash-brown which the French call " blonde cendree . " Out of them all there was but one child who looked sickly . He had evidently met with some accident , and was lame . Afterward , as the congregation assembled , I watched the fathers and mothers of these children . They , too , were broad-shouldered , tall , and straight , especially the women . Even old women were straight , like the negroes one sees at the South , walking with burdens on their heads . Five days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement of the province . The children of the city and of some of the neighboring towns marched in " bands of hope " and processions , such as we see in the cities of the States on the Fourth of July . This was just the opportunity I wanted . It was the same here as in the country . I counted on that day just eleven sickly-looking children ; no more ! Such brilliant cheeks , such merry eyes , such evident strength , it was a scene to kindle the dullest soul . There were scores of little ones there , whose droll , fat legs would have drawn a crowd in Central Park ; and they all had that same , quiet , composed , well-balanced expression of countenance of which I spoke before , and of which it would be hard to find an instance in all Central Park . // Climate undoubtedly has something to do with this . The air is moist , and the mercury rarely rises above 8o ? or falls below to ? . Also the comparative quiet of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the most significant fact to my mind is that , until the past year , there have been in Nova Scotia no public schools , comparatively few private ones ; and in these there is no severe pressure brought to bear on the pupils . The private schools have been expensive , consequently it has been very unusual for children to De sent to school before they were eight or nine years of age ; I could not find a person who had ever known of a child 's being sent to school under seven ! The school sessions are on the old plan of six hours per day , ? from nine till twelve , and from one till four ; but no learning of lessons out of school has been allowed . Within the last year a system of free public schools has been introduced , " and the people are grumbling terribly about it , " said my informant . " Why ? " I asked ; " because they do not wish to have their children educated ? " " Oh , no , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxes ! " " Alas ! " I thought , " if it were only their silver which would be taxed ! " I must not be understood to argue from the health of the children of Nova Scotia , as contrasted with the lack of health among ; our children , that it is best to have no public schools ; only that it is better to have no public schools than to have such public schools as are now killing off our children . The registration system of Nova Scotia is as yet // Imperfectly carried out . It is almost impossible to obtain exact returns from all parts of so thinly settled a country . But such statistics as have been already established give sufficient food for reflection in this connection . In Massachusetts more than two-fifths of all the children born die before they are twelve years old . In Nova Scotia the proportion is less than onethird . In Nova Scotia one out of every fifty-six lives to be over ninety years of age ; and one-twelfth of the entire number of deaths is between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person out of one hundred and nine lives to be over ninety .

That mother is the wisest , sweetest , most triumphant mother I have ever known . I am restrained by feelings of deepest reverence for her from speaking , as I might speak , of the rare and tender methods by which her motherhood has worked , patiently and alone , for nearly twenty years , and made of her two sons " lovers and friends . " I have always felt that she owed it to the world to impart to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write out , even in detail , all the processes by which her boys have grown to be so strong , upright , loving , and manly . But one of her first principles has so direct a bearing on the subject that I wish to speak of here that I venture to attempt an explanation of it . She has told me that she never once , even in their childish days , took the ground that she had right to require any thing from them simply because she was their mother . This ' // Is a position very startling to the average parent . It is exactly counter to traditions . " Why must I ? " or " Why can not I ? " says the child .

It came about because the parent was strong and the child weak . Helplessness in the hands of power , ? that is the whole story . Suppose for an instant ( and , absurd as the supposition is practically , it is not logically absurd ) , that the child at six were strong enough to whip his father ; let him have the intellect of an infant , the mistakes and the faults of an infant , ? which the father would feel himself bound and would be bound to correct , ? but the body of a man ; and then see in how different fashion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

When we realize what it is for us to dare , for our own pleasure , even with solemnest purpose of the noliest of pleasures , parenthood , to bring into existence a soul , which must take for our sake its chance of joy or sorrow , how monstrous it seems to assume that the fact that we have done this thing gives us arbitrary right to control that soul ; to set our will , as will , in place of its will ; to be law unto its life ; to try to make of it what it suits our fancy or our convenience to have it ; to claim that it is under obligation to us !

If we can also so win their love by our loving , so deserve their respect by our honorableness , so earn their gratitude by our helpfulness , that they come to be our " . overs and friends , " then , ah ! then we have had enough of heaven here to make us willing to postpone the more for which we hope beyond ! But all this comes not of authority , not by command ; all this is perilled always , always impaired , and often 113E REPUBLIC OF 2'HL FAMILY . 79 lost , by authoritative , arbitrary ruling , substitution 3f law and penalty for influence . It will be objected by parents who disagree with this theory that only authority can prevent license ; that without command there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn methods he has not tried . I know , for I have seen , I know , for I have myself tested , that command and authority are short-lived ; that they do not insure the results they aim at ; that real and permanent control of a child 's behavior , even in little things , is gained only by influence , by a slow , sure educating , enlightening , and strengthening of a child 's will . I know , for I have seen , that it is possible in this way to make a child only ten years old quite as intelligent and trustworthy a free agent as his mother ; to make him so sensible , so gentle , so considerate that to say " must " or " must not " to him would be as unnecessary and absurd as to say it to her . But , if it be wiser and better to surround even little children with this atmosphere of freedom , how much more essential is it for those who remain under the parental roof long after they have ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the fatal rock upon which many households make utter shipwreck of their peace . Fathers and mothers who have ruled by authority ( let it be as loving as you please , it will still remain an arbitrary rule ) in the beginning , never seem to know when their children are children no longer , but have become men and women . In any average family , the position of an unmarried daughter aftet sho 8o BITS OF TALK . is twenty years old becomes less and less what it should be . In case of sons , the question is rarely a practical one ; in those exceptional instances where invalidism or some other disability keeps a man helpless for years under his father 's roof , his very helplessness is at once his vindication and his shield , and also prevents his feeling manly revolt against the position of unnatural childhood . But in the case of daughters it is very different . Who does not number in his circle of acquaintance many unmarried women , between the ages of thirty and forty , perhaps even older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own lives than . they had when they were eleven ? The mother or the father continues just as much the autocratic centre of the family now as of the nursery , thirty years before . Taking into account the chance ? no , the certainty ? of great differences between parents and children in matters of temperament and taste , it is easy to see that great suffering must result from this ; suffering , too , which involves real loss and hindrance to growth . It is really a monstrous wrong ; but it seems to be rarely observed by the world , and never suspected by those who are most responsible for it . It is perhaps a question whether the real tyrannies in this life are those that are accredited as such . There are certainly more than even tyrants know !

When we realize what such friendship is , i seems incredible that parents can forego it , or can risk losing any shade of its perfectness , for the sake of any indulgence of the habit of command or of gratifying of selfish preference . In the ideal household of father and mother and adult children , the one great aim of the parents ought to be to supply , as far as possible to each child , that freedom and independence which they have missed the opportunity of securing in homes of their own . The loss of this one thing alone is a bitterer drop in the loneliness of many an unmarried woman than parents , especially fathers , are apt even to dream , ? food and clothes and lodgings are so exalted in unthinking estimates .

But the grumbler can not be shut up or killed , s'nce grumbling is not held to be a proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the pity . What , then , is to be done ? Keep out of his way , at all costs , if he be grown up . If it be a child , labor day and night , as you would with a tendency to paralysis , or distortion of limb , to prevent this blight on its life . It sounds extreme to say that a child should never be allowed to express a dislike of any thing which can not be helped ; but I think it is true . I do not mean that it should be positively forbidden or punished , but that it should never pass unnoticed ; his attention should be invariably called to its uselessness , and to the annoyance it gives to other people . Children begin by being good-natured little grumblers at every thing which goes wrong , simply from the outspokenness of their natures . All they think they say and act . The rudiments of good behavior have to be chiefly negative at the outset , like Punch 's advice to those about to marry , ?

" " You do not really mean what you say , my darling . It is of much more consequence that the grass should grow than that you should go out to play . And it is so silly to complain , when we can not stop its raining . ' " Mamma , I hate this pie . " " Oh ! hush , dear ! Do n't say so , if you do . You can leave it . You need not eat it .

We must wait till the fire burns better ; and the time will seem twice as long if we grumble . " " Oh , mamma ! mamma ! My steam-engine is all spoiled . It wo n't run . I hate things that wind up ! " " I3ut , my dear little boy , do n't grumble so ! What would you think if mamma were to say , ' Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! My little boy 's stockings are full of holes . How I hate to mend stockings ! ' and , ' Oh , clear ! oh , dear ! My little boy has upset my work-box ! I hate little boys ' ? " How they look steadily into your eyes for a minute , ? the honest , reasonable little souls ! ? when you say such things to them ; and then run off with a laugh , lifted up , for that time , by your fitly spoken words of help . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one generation of mothers to be made all right , what a millennium could be begun in thirty years !

Grumblers are the only thing in this world that it is right to grumble at . " // " BOYS NOT ALLOWED . " IT was a conspicuous signboard , at least four feet long , with large black letters on a white ground : " Boys not allowed . " I looked at it for some moments in a sort of bewildered surprise : I did not quite comprehend the meaning of the words . At last I understood it . I was waiting in a large railway station , where marry trains connect ; and most of the passengers from the train in which I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entirely alone in the car , with the exception of one boy , who was perhaps eleven years old . I made an involuntary ejaculation as I read the words on the sign , and the boy looked around at me . " Little boy , " said I , solemnly , " do you see that sign ? " He turned his head , and , reading the ominous warning , nodded sullenly , but said nothing . " Boy , what does it mean ? " said I. " Boys must be allowed to come into this railway station . There are two now standing in the doorway directly under the sign . " The latent sympathy in my tone touched his heart // He left his seat , and , coming to mine , edged in past me ; and , putting his head out of the window , read the sentence aloud in a contemptuous tone . Then he offered me a peanut , which I took ; and he proceeded to tell me what he thought of the sign . " Boys not allowed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is everywhere ; but I never saw the sign up before . It do n't make any difference , though , whether they put the sign up or not . Why , in New York ( you live in New York , do n't you ? ) they wo n't even stop the horse cars for a boy to get on . Nobody thinks any thing 'll hurt a boy ; but they 're glad enough to allow ' us when there 's any errands to be done , and " ? " Do you live in New York ? " interrupted I ; for I did not wish to hear the poor little fellow 's list of miseries , which I knew by heart beforehand without his telling me , having been hopeless knight-errant of oppressed boyhood all my life . Yes , he " lived in New York , " and he " went to a grammar school , " and he had " two sisters . " And so we talked on in that sweet , ready , trustful talk which comes naturally only from children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were over , and the choked and crammed passengers , who had eaten big dinners in that breath of time , came hurrying back to their seats . Among them came the father and mother of my little friend . In angry surprise at not finding him in the seat where they left him , they exclaimed , " Now , where is that boy ? Just like him ! We might have lost every one of these bags . " // " Here I am , mamma , " he called out , pleasantly . " I could see the bags all the time . Nobody came into the car . " " I told you not to leave the seat , sir . What do you mean by such conduct ? " said the father . " Oh , no , papa , " said poor Boy , " you only told me to take care of the bags . " And an anxious look of terror came into his face , which told only too well under how severe a regime he lived . I interposed hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your little son 's leaving his seat . He had sat very still till I spoke to him ; and I believe I ought to take all the blame . " The parents were evidently uncultured , shallow people . Their irritation with him was merely a surface vexation , which had no real foundation in a deep principle . They became complaisant and smiling at my first word , and Boy escaped with a look of great relief to another seat , where they gave him a simple luncheon of saleratus gingerbread . " Boys not allowed " to go in to dinner at the Massasoit , thought I to myself ; and upon that text I sat sadly meditating all the way from Springfield to Boston . How true it was , as the little fellow had said , that " it do n't make any difference whether they put the sign up or not ! " No one can watch carefully any average household where there are boys , and not see that there are a thousand little ways in which the boys ' comfort , freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered . This is partly intentional , // partly unconscious . Something is to be said undoubtedly on the advantage of making the boy realize early and keenly that manhood is to bear and to work , and womanhood is to be helped and sheltered . But this should be inculcated , not inflicted ; asked , not seized ; shown and explained , not commanded . Nothing can be surer than the growth in a boy of tender , chivalrous regard for his sisters and for all women , if the seeds of it be rightly sown and gently nurtured . But the common method is quite other than this . It begins too harshly and at once with assertion or assumption . " Mother never thinks I am of any consequence , " said a dear boy to me , the other day . " She 's all for the girls . " This was not true ; but there was truth in it . And I am very sure that the selfishness , the lack of real courtesy , which we see so plainly and pitiably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , certain result of years of just such feelings as this child expressed . The boy has to scramble for his rights . Naturally he is too busy to think much about the rights of others . The man keeps up the habit , and is negatively selfish without knowing it . Take , for instance , the one point of the minor courtesies ( if we can dare to call any courtesies minor ) of daily intercourse . How many people are there who habitually speak to a boy of ten , twelve , or fourteen with the same civility as to his sister , a little younger or older ? 7 // " T like Miss ? , " said this same dear boy to me , one day ; " for she always bids me good-morning . " Ah ! never is one such word thrown away on a loving , open-hearted boy . Men know that safe through all the wear and tear of life they keep far greener the memory of some woman or some man who was kind to them in their boyhood than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear , blessed , noisy , rollicking , tormenting , comforting Boy ! What should we do without him ? How much we like , without suspecting it , his breezy presence in the house ! Except for him , hqw would errands be done , chairs brought , nails driven , cows stoned out of our way , letters carried , twine and knives kept ready , lost things found , luncheon carried to picnics , threeyear-olds that cry led out of meeting , butterflies and birds ' nests and birch-bark got , the horse taken round to the stable , borrowed things sent home , ? and all with no charge for time ? Dear , patient , busy Boy ! Shall we not sometimes answer his questions ? Give him a comfortable seat ? Wait and not reprove him till after the company has gone ?

The masses of people who were waiting and the masses of people who had come surged toward each other like two great waves , and mingled in a moment . I caught sight of my poor little friend , Boy , following his father , struggling along in the crowd , carrying two heavy carpet-bags , a strapped bundle , and two umbrellas , and being sharply told to " Keep up close there . " " Ha ! " said I , savagely , to myself , " doing porters work is not one of the things which ' boys ' are ' not allowed . " r ao B17 'S OF TALH . HALF AN HOUR IN A RAILWAY STATION . IT was one of those bleak and rainy days which mark the coming of spring on New England seashores . The rain felt and looked as if it might at any minute become hail or snow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the huge railway station was as full of people as ever . One could see no difference between this dreariest of days and the sunniest , so far as the crowd was concerned , except that fewer of the people wore fine clothes ; perhaps , also , that their faces looked a little more sombre and weary than usual . There is no place in the world where human nature shows to such sad disadvantage as in waiting-rooms at railway stations , especially in the " Ladies ' Room . " In the " Gentlemen 's Room " there is less of that ghastly , apathetic silence which seems only explainable as an interval between two terrible catastrophes . Shall we go so far as to confess that even the unsightly spittoons , and the uncleanly and loquacious fellowship resulting from their common use , seem here , for the moment , redeemed from a little of their IN A RAILWAY STATION . lot abominableness , ? simply because almost any action is better than utter inaction , and any thing which makes the joyless , taciturn American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for the time being a blessing . But in the " Ladies Room " there is not even a community of interest in a single bad habit , to break the monotone of weary stillness . Who has not felt the very soul writhe within her as she has first crossed the threshold of one of these dismal antechambers of journey ? Carpetless , dingy , dusty ; two or three low sarcophagi of greenish-gray iron in open spaces , surrounded by blue-lipped women , in different angles and attitudes of awkwardness , trying to keep the soles of their feet in a perpendicular position , to be warmed at what they have been led to believe is a steam-heating apparatus ; a few more women , equally listless and weary-looking , standing in equally difficult and awkward positions before a counter , holding pie in one hand , and tea in a cup and saucer in the other , taking alternate mouthfuls of each , and spilling both ; the rest wedged bolt upright against the wall in narrow partitioned seats , which only need a length of perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the best method of putting whole communities of citizens into the stocks at once . All , feet warmers , pie-eaters , and those who sit in the red-velvet stocks , wear so exactly the same expression of vacuity and fatigue that they might almost be taken for one gigantic and unhappy family connection , on its way to what is called in newspapers " a sad event . " The only . uz BITS OF TALK . wonder is that this stiffened , desiccated crowd retains vitality enough to remember the hours at which its several trains depart , and to rise up and shake itself alive and go on board . One is haunted sometimes by the fancy that some day , when the air in the room is unusually bad and the trains are delayed , a curious phenomenon will be seen . The petrifaction will be carried a little farther than usual , and , when the bell rings and the official calls out , " Train made up for Babel , Hinnom , and way stations ? " no women will come forth from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no muscle will stir . Husbands and brothers will wait and search vainly for those who should have met them at the station , with bundles of the day 's shopping to be carried out ; homes will be desolate ; and the history of rare fossils and petrifactions will have a novel addition . Or , again , that , if some sudden convulsion of Nature , like those which before now have buried wicked cities and the dwellers in them , were to-day to swallow up the great city of New Sodom in America , and keep it under ground for a few thousand years , nothing in all its circuit would so puzzle the learned archmologists of A. D. 5873 as the position of the skeletons in these same waiting-rooms of railway stations . Thinking such thoughts as these , sinking slowly and surely to the level of the place , I waited , on this bleak , rainy day , in just such a " Ladies ' Room " as I have described . I sat in the red-velvet stocks , with my eyes fixed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you buy a basket ? " said a cheery little voice . So near me , without my knowing it , had the little tradesman come that I was as startled as if the voice had spoken out of the air just above my head . He was a sturdy little fellow , ten years old , Irish , dirty , ragged ; but he had honest , kind gray eyes , and a smile which ought to have sold more baskets than he could carry . A few kind words unsealed the fountain of his childish confidences . There were four children younger than he ; the mother took in washing , and the father , who was a cripple from rheumatism , made these baskets , which he carried about to sell . " Where do you sell the most ? " " Round the depots . That 's the best place . " " But the baskets are rather clumsy to carry . Almost everybody has his hands full , when he sets out on a journey . " " Yis 'm ; but mostly they does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little change , " said he , with a smile , half roguish , half sad . I watched him on in his pathetic pilgrimage round that dreary room , seeking help from that dreary circle of women . My heart aches to write down here the true record that out of those scores of women only three even smiled or spoke to the little fellow . Only one gave him money . My own sympathies had been so won by his face and manner that I found myself growing hot with resentment as I watched woman after woman 1 ' 04 BITS Or TALK . wave him off with indifferent or impatient gesture . His face was a face which no mother ought to have been able to see without a thrill of pity and affection . God forgive me ! As if any mother ought to be able to see any child , ragged , dirty , poor , seeking help and finding none ! But his face was so honest , and brave , and responsive that it added much to the appeal of his poverty . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing in her arms a large toy horse , and a little violin . " Oh , " I said to myself , " she has a boy of her own , for whom she can buy gifts freely . She will surely give this poor child a penny . " He thought so , too ; for he went toward her with a more confident manner than he had shown to some of the others . No ! She brushed by him impatiently , without a word , and walked to the ticket-office . He stood looking at the violin and the toy horse till she came back to her seat . Then he lifted his eyes to her face again ; but she apparently did not see him , and he went away . Ah , she is only half mother who does not see her own child in every child ! ? her own child 's grief in every pain which makes another child weep ! Presently the little basket-boy went out into the great hall . I watched him threading his way in and out among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless him ! ? pat the little fellow on the head ; then I lost sight of him . After ten minutes he came back into the Ladies ' Room , with only one basket in his hand , and a very // happy little face . The " sterner sex " had been kinder to him than we . The smile which he gave me in answer to my glad recognition of his good luck was the sunniest sunbeam I have seen on a human face for many a day . He sank down into the red-velvet stocks , and twirled his remaining basket , and swung his shabby little feet , as idle and unconcerned as if he were some rich man 's son , waiting for the train to take him home . So much does a little lift help the heart of a child , even of a beggar child . It is a comfort to remember him , with that look on his face , instead of the wistful , pleading one which I saw at first . I left him lying back on the dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the cars I sat just behind the woman with the toy-horse and the violin . I saw her glance rest lovingly on them many times , as she thought of her boy at home ; and I wondered if the little basket-seller had really produced no impression whatever on her heart . I shall remember him long after ( if he lives ) he is a man ! l o6 BITS OF TALK . A GENIUS FOR AFFECTION . HE other day , speaking superficially and uncharitably , I said of a woman , whom I knew but slightly , " She disappoints me utterly . How could her husband have married her ? She is commonplace and stupid . " " Yes , " said my friend , reflectively ; " it is strange . She is not a brilliant woman ; she is not even an intellectual one ; but there is such a thing as a genius for affection , and she has it . It has been good for her husband that he married her . " The words sank into my heart like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often stirred . And from those depths came up some shining sands of truth , worth keeping among treasures ; having a phosphorescent light in them , which can shine in dark places , and , making them light as day , reveal their beauty . " A genius for affection . " Yes ; there is such a thing , and no other genius is so great . The phrase means something more than a capacity , or even a talent for loving . That is common to all human beings , more or less . A man or woman without it would be a monster , such as has probably never been on the earth . All // men and women , whatever be their shortcomings in other directions , have this impulse , this faculty , in a degree . It takes shape in family ties : makes clumsy and unfortunate work of them in perhaps two cases out of thrre , ? wives tormenting husbands , husbands neglecting and humiliating wives , parents maltreating and ruining children , children disobeying and grieving parents , and brothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under all this , in spite of all this , the love is there . A great trouble or a sudden emergency will bring it out . In any common danger , hands clasp closely and quarrels are forgotten ; over a sick-bed hard ways soften into yearning tenderness ; and by a grave , alas ! what hot tears fall ! The poor , imperfect love which had let itself be wearied and harassed by the frictions of life , or hindered and warped by a body full of diseased nerves , comes running , too late , with its effort to make up lost opportunities . It has been all the while alive , but in a sort of trance ; little good has come of it , but it is something that it was there . It is the divine germ of a flower and fruit too precious to mature in the first years after grafting ; in other soils , by other waters , when the healing of the nations is fulfilled , we shall see its perfection . Oh ! what atonement will be there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! with what love we shall love ! But the souls who have what my friend meant by a " genius for affection " are in another atmosphere than that which common men breathe . Their " upper air ' ro8 BITS OF TALK . is clearer , more rarefied than any to w ' .. cn mere intellectual genius can soar . Because , to this last , always remain higher heights which it can not grasp , see , nor comprehend . Michel Angelo may build his dome of marble , and human intellect may see as clearly as if God had said it that no other dome can ever be built so grand , so beautiful . But above St. Peter 's hangs the blue tentdome of the sky , vaster , rounder , elastic , unfathomable , making St. Peter 's look small as a drinking-cup , shutting it soon out of sight to north , east , south , and west , by the mysterious horizon-fold which no man can lift . And beyond this horizon-fold of ' our sky shut down again other domes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances our little ball and we , with all our spinning , can hardly show like a star . If St. Peter 's were swallowed up to-morrow , it would make no real odds to anybody but the Pope . The probabilities are that Michel Angelo himself has forgotten all about it . Titian and Raphael , and all the great brotherhood , of painters , may kneel re A , erently as priests before Nature 's face , and paint pictures at sight of which all men 's eyes shall fill with grateful tears ; and yet all men shall go away , and find that the green shade of a tree , the light on a young girl 's face , the sleep of a child , the flowering of a flower , are to their pictures as living life to beautiful death . Coming to Art 's two highest spheres , ? music of sound and music of speech , ? we find that Beethoven // and Mozart , and Milton and Shakespeare , have written . But the symphony is sacred only because , and only so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have felt . Surely , the interpretation is less than the thing interpreted . Face to face with a joy , a sorrow , would a symphony avail us ? And , as for words , who shall express their feebleness in midst of strength ? The fettered helplessness in spite of which they soar to such heights ? The most perfect sentence ever written bears to the thing it meant to say the relation which the chemist 's formula does to the thing he handles , names , analyzes , can destroy , perhaps , but can not make . Every element in the crystal , the liquid , can be weighed , assigned , and rightly called ; nothing in all science is more wonderful than an exact chemical formula ; but , after all is done , will remain for ever unknown the one subtle secret , the vital centre of the whole . But the souls who have a " genius for affection " have no outer dome , no higher and more vital beauty ; no subtle secret of creative motive force to elude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subtlest essence of the thing they worship and desire , they have in their own nature , ? they are . No schools , no standards , no laws can help or hinder them . To them the world is as if it were not . Work and pain and loss are as if they were not . These are they to whom it is easy to die any death , if good can come that way to one they love . These are they who do die daily unnoted on our right hand and on our left ,  - -  Ito BITS OF TALK . fathers and mothers for children , husbands and wives for each other . These are they , also , who live , ? which is often far harder than it is to die , ? long lives , into whose being never enters one thought of self from the rising to the going down of the sun . Year builds on year with unvarying steadfastness the divine temple of their beauty and their sacrifice . They create , like God . The universe which science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is petty , beside the one which grows under their spiritual touch ; for love begets love . The waves of eternity itself ripple out in immortal circles under the ceaseless dropping of their crystal deeds . Angels desire to look , but can not , into the mystery of holiness and beauty which such human lives reveal . Only God can see them clearly . God is their nearest of kin ; for He is love . RAINY DAYS . I I i RAINY DAYS . WITH what subtle and assured tyranny they take V possession of the world ! Stoutest hearts are made subject , plans of conquerors set aside , ? the heavens and the earth and man , ? all alike at the mercy of the rain . Come when they may , wait long as they will , give what warnings they can , rainy days are always interruptions . No human being has planned for them then and there . " If it had been but yesterday , " " If it were only to-morrow , " is the cry from all lips . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds subject to mortal call or prohibition , the seasons would fail and death get upper hand of all things before men agreed on an hour of common convenience . What tests they are of people 's souls ! Show me a dozen men and women in the early morning of a rainy day , and I will tell by their words and their faces who among them is rich and who is poor , ? who has much goods laid up for just such times of want , and who has been spendthrift and foolish . That curious , shrewd , underlying instinct , common to all ages , which takes shape in proverbs recognized this long ago . Who knows when it was first said of man laying up money , " 3e lays by I12 BITS OF TALK . for a rainy day " ? How close the parallel is between the man who , having spent on each day 's living the whole of each day 's income , finds himself helpless in an emergency of sickness whose expenses he has no money to meet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no self-reliant habit of occupation , finds himself shut up in the house idle and wretched for a rainy day . I confess that on rainy mornings in country houses , among well-dressed and so-called intelligent and Christian people , I have been seized with stronger disgusts and despairs about the capacity and worth of the average human creature , than I have ever felt in the worst haunts of ignorant wickedness . " What is there to do to-day ? " is the question they ask . I know they are about to ask it before they speak . I have seen it in their listless and disconcerted eyes at breakfast . It is worse to me than the tolling of a bell ; for saddest dead of all are they who have only a " name to live . " The truth is , there is more to do on a rainy day than on any other . In addition to all the sweet , needful , possible business of living and working , and learning and helping , which is for all days , there is the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rainy day to hear . It drums on the window-panes , chuckles and gurgles at corners of houses , tinkles in spouts , makes mysterious crescendoes and arpeggio chords through the air ; and all the while drops from the eaves and upper window-ledges are beating time as rhythmical and measured as that of a metronome , ? time to which // our own souls furnish tune , sweet or sorrowful , inspiriting or saddening , as we will . It is a curious experiment to try repeating or chanting lines in time and cadence following the patter of raindrops on windows . It will sometimes be startling in its effect : no metre , no accent fails of its response in the low , liquid stroke of the tender drops , ? there seems an uncanny raiijort between them at once . And the beauty of the rain , not even love can find words to tell it . If it left but one trace , the exquisite shifting sheen of pearls on the outer side of the window glass , that alone one might watch for a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings , of them who are royally rich , to have garments sown thick in dainty lines and shapes with fine seed pearls . Who ever saw any such embroidery which could compare with the beauty of one pane of glass wrought on a single side with the shining white transparent globulets of rain ? They are millions ; they crowd ; they blend ; they become a silver stream ; they glide slowly down , leaving tiniest silver threads behind ; they make of themselves a silver bank of miniature sea at the bottom of the pane ; and , while they do this , other millions are set pearl-wise at the top , to crowd , blend , gEde down in their turn , and overflow the miniature sea . This is one pane , a few inches square ; and rooms have many windows of many panes . And looking past this spectacle , out of our windows , how is it that we dc not each rainy day weep with pleasure at sight of the glistening show ? Every green thing , from tiniest grass ' 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips of elms , also set thick with the water-pearls ; all tossing and catching , and tossing and catching , in fairy game with the wind , and with the rain itself , always losing , always gaining , changing shape and place and number every moment , till the twinkling and shifting dazzle all eyes . Then at the end comes the sun , like a magician for whom all had been made ready ; at sunset , perhaps , or at sunrise , if the storm has lasted all night . In one instant the silver balls begin to disappear . By countless thousands at a time he tosses them back whence they came ; but as they go , he changes them , under our eyes , into prismatic globes , holding very light of very light in their tiny circles , shredding and sorting it into blazing lines of rainbow color . All the little children shout with delight , seeing these things ; and call dull , grown-up people to behold . They reply , " Yes , the storm is over ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This kingdom of heaven they can not enter , not being " as a little child . " It would be worth while to know , if we only could , just what our betters ? the birds and insects and beasts ? do on rainy days . But we can not find out much . It would be a great thing to look inside of an ant-hill in a long rain . All we know is that the doors are shut tight , and a few sentinels , who look as if India-rubber coats would be welcome , stand outside . The stillness and look of intermission in the woods on a really rainy day is something worth getting wet to observe . It is like Sunday in London , or Fourth of // July in a country town which has gone bodily to a picnic in the next village . The strays who are out seem like accidentally arrived people , who have lost their way . One can not fancy a caterpillar 's being otherwise than very uncomfortable in wet hair ; and what can there be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which they creep , with wings shut up as tight as an umbrella ? The beasts fare better , being clothed in hides . Those whom we oftenest see out in rains ( cows and oxen and horses ) keep straight on with their perpetual munching , as content wet as dry , though occasionally we see them accept the partial shelter of a tree from a particularly hard shower . Hens are the forlornest of all created animals when it rains . Who can help laughing at sight of a flock of them huddled up under lee of a barn , limp , draggled , spiritless , shifting from one leg to the other , with their silly heads hanging inert to right or left , looking as if they would die for want of a yawn ? One sees just such groups of other two-legged creatures in parlors , under similar circumstances . The truth is , a hen 's life at best seems poorer than that of any other known animal .

All day comes and goes the sad train of friends ; lingering and turning back after there is no more to be said ; weeping when they meant and tried to smile ; more hungry for closer sight and voice , and for touch , with every moment that they gaze through the bars ; and going away , at last , with a new sense of loss and separation , which time , with its merciful healing , will hardly soften before the visiting-day will come again , and the same heart-rending experience of mingled torture and joy will again be borne . But to the prisoners these glimpses of t ( ( ends ' faces are like manna from heaven . Their whole life , physical and mental , receives a new impetus from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they live from one day to the next on a memory and a hope . No punishment can be invented so terrible as the deprivation of the sight of their friends on the visitingday . Men who are obstinate and immovable before // any sort or amount of physical torture are subdued by mere threat of this . A friend who told me of a visit he paid to the Prison Mazas , on one of the days , said , with tears in his eyes , " It was almost more than I could bear to see these poor souls reaching out toward each other from either side of the iron railings . Here a poor , old woman , tottering and weak , bringing a little fruit in a basket for her son ; here a wife , holding up a baby to look through the gratings at its father , and the ' father trying in an agony of earnestness to be sure that the baby knew him ; here a little girl , looking half reproachfully at her brother , terror struggling with tenderness in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and yearning and pity beyond all words to describe ; on the side of the prisoners , love and yearning just as great , but with a misery of shame added , which gave to many faces a look of attempt at dogged indifference on the surface , constantly betrayed and contradicted , however , by the flashing of the eyes and the red of the cheeks . " The story so impressed me that I could not for days lose sight of the picture it raised ; the double walls of iron grating ; the cruel , inexorable , empty space between them , ? empty , yet crowded with words and looks ; the lines of anxious , yearning faces on either side . But presently I said to myself , It is , after all , not so unlike the life we all live . Who of us is not in prison ? Who of us is not living out his time of punishment ? Law holds us all in its merciless fulfilment t20 BITS OF TALK . of penalty for sin ; disease , danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not numbered with the number of a cell , clothed in the uniform of a prison , locked up at night , and counted in the morning , is only an apparent difference , and not so real a one . Our jailers do not know us ; but we know them . There is no fixed day gleaming for us in the future when our term of sentence will expire and we shall regain freedom . It may be to-morrow ; but it may be threescore years away . Meantime , we bear ourselves as if we were not in prison . We profess that we choose , we keep our fetters out of sight , we smile , we sing , we contrive to be glad of being alive , and we take great interest in the changing of our jails . But no man knows where his neighbor 's prison lies . Flow bravely and cheerily most eyes look up ! This is one of the sweetest mercies of life , that " the heart knoweth its own bitterness , " and , knowing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends for other prisoners , standing separated from them by the impassable iron gratings and the fixed gulf of space , which are not inappropriate emblems of the unseen barriers between all human souls . We can show kindly faces , speak kindly words , bear to them fruits and food , and moral help , greater than fruit or food . We need not aim at philanthropies ; we need not have a visiting-day , nor seek a prison-house built of stone . On every road each man we meet is a prisoner ; he is dying at heart , however sound he looks ; he is only waiting , however well he works . If we stop to ask whether he be our brother ,
