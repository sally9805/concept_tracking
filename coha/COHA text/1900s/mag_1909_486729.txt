SIR : In your article on " The Football Deaths " ( the Nation , November 4 ) , you mention the reluctance of the football rules . committee to change the game in such a way that it will resemble the English , or soccer , game , in which players are not allowed to run carrying the ball The-chief argument we have heard against this-change is that the English game is not an , exciting enough contest for the young American . Permit me to point out that " soccer " is-not " the " English game , and that it is not an exciting enough contest for most young Englishmen . In the English universities two games of football are played ? Association , of " soccer , " and Rugby . Rugby , in which ' the player is allowed to run carrying the ball , is somewhat the more popular . But neither game has the universal vogue among schools and colleges which the American , game enjoys . At Eton , for instance , neither game is regularly played ; there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall game " and the " field game , " both differing widely from the games played at the universities . Winchester and Harrow also have games of their own In the colonies-Rugby is played in a way which seems to tend toward something like the American , game . There is , therefore , no game which occupies in England the position held by football in America , and the English universities have no predominant autumn sport . There are rowing events of some importance , track meets , hare and hound runs , and golf , tournaments . Lacrosse has been introduced , and has met with some favor Hockey  --  which we call " shinny " and relegate to vacant city lots  --  is nearly as popular as " soccer " football . But no one of these games is absorbing enough to arouse universal , interest and displace its rivals . A few hundred undergraduates watch the more important " rugger " games , but no match except the Oxford-Cambridge is played on a field provided with seating arrangements for a large audience . Those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a useless retrogression to attempt a modification of American football in the direction of either Rugby or " soccer . " It is not the rules that make the English game safe . The excessive softness of the ground , which ? is covered with very thick turf and rarely freezes or even dries out in the football : season , is one explanation of the comparative freedom of English players from injuTies more serious than sprains and bruises . But the great reason is the different spirit in which the games are played . The Englishman looks on a game as a means of finding amusement and exercise . He therefore refuses to take sport seriously , to " go in to the game hard " regardless of injury to himself or his opponents . Except in rowing , he pays little attention to training , coaching , and practice . And if he can afford to ? keep horses and hunt , or if he has facilities for shooting , or plays a good game of court tennis , he will not go in for organized athletics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not play football unless he - thinks football the most agreeable form of . outdoor exercise , and as long as he finds in the game what he is looking for , he does not ? care a great deal whether his side wins or not . This increase of efficiency at the cost of time and comfort would not appeal to him at all , for the English athlete has other interests outside his game , and would not think of sacrificing his studies , his social pleasures , or his leisure to a sport . It is this calm , casual , excessively amateur spirit , incomprehensible to many American athletes , which makes English games comparatively safe . Rugby , " soccer , " and hockey might be dangerous indeed if played " for God , for country , and for Yale . " If we wish to obviate the perils of American football it is not the rules we must An-glicize , but the temperament of the players . F. SCHENCK . . Orford University , November 15 . OPEN FOOTBALL . ' TO THE EDITOR OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an editorial paragraph , November 25 , your statement , in reference to the Yale-Harvard game , that " the expectation that the Yale ' team would open up the game for the game 's sake proved fruitless , " seemed to one reader at least to do some injustice to an eleven which surely during the past season has practised the new football , with its theories of open play . more consistently and brilliantly than any other eleven in the East . Any unprejudiced observer of the game you criticise will bear witness to the fact that that contest illustrated with peculiar force the advantages from a strategic , as well as a humanitarian , standpoint , of the open game , . as actually played by Yale , over the football of ten years ago , as employed by Harvard throughout the afternoon . Lilley 's injury was not due , as you intimate , to Harvard 's line-plunging tactics , but occurred in a broken field , and was caused by what - seemed to many spectators an unnecessarily Tough tackle , which the tension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? does not excuse . ? .. - New rules for enforcing less rough and ' more open play should undoubtedly be advocated , but jt seems ' that the efforts of - the football authorities hi:New Haven during the ' season which has just closed , as well as in previous years , to develop the game along open lines , should receive apipreciation and approval , certainly from the Nation . FRANCIS PARSONS . Hartford , Conn. , November 26 . We certainly had no intention of doing injustice to the Yale team . Our criticism of the game agreed with the comments made generally in the press . ? ED . NATION . THE " FOOTBALL " IMPOSTURE . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : It seems curious that the opponents of the fight to kill or cripple , miscalled a game , and miscalled football , have never noted the fraudulent shelter under which its advocates take refuge , and the false pretence by which they secure a good will meant for a wholly different- and real game . It is not football ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old football of our boyhood ; it is a " protective mimicry " of the name , used for something wholly different , and used " with intent to deceive . " The reason why almost none were injured in the old and none are reasonably secure from death or maiming in the new is that in the former the ball was kept on the ground ; in the latter it is kept in the arms ; hence , in the former the violence was expended on the ball , in the latter it is expended on the holder , or his companions . The " old boys " who rave over the game for old associations ' sake , and revile its opponents , are unconsciously be-fooling themselves or consciously befooling others . ANTAPATE . Hartford , Conn. , November 26 . THE READING OF VERSE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Whether or not it was by a cobrcideuce that in your issue of November n there appeared an interesting paper by Professor Gummere of Haverford College , protesting against the modern method of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opening of the New Theatre , and of the inability of most of the players , including those taking the parts of Antony and Cleopatfa , to render Shakespearean verse as verse , I do not know . In any case , I am sure that a great number of your readers hope that there may bb an awakening of the players , the dramatic schools , and those who profess English literature and elocution , to the fact that prose is prose and verse is verse . Why should the interpreters of Stephen Phillips ( his " Herod " is now to be seen in New York city ) , why should those who attempt to revive Shakespeare , fear to read their lines , not , to be sure , in the ranting or sing-song style of old-time barn-stormers , but in such manner as to treat their audiences to something of the beauty of the line , and to the richness of the poetical rhythm ? I wonder if the readers of the Nation happen to have seen the interview with Mr. Forbes-Robertson , that master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers only yesterday ? What the English actor says is so truly to the point , and bears so directly upon the discussion which the Nation has itself started up , that I presume to quote freely from his remarks . The trouble with contemporary stage elocution springs , says Mr. Forbes-Robertson , " from the actor 's very desire to act well . " Perhaps the word " realistically , " expresses more precisely what must have been in the speaker 's mind . Continuing : In his effort to appear natural , he the actor mumbles his words as too many people do in ' everyday life . Much of this can be corrected by constantly bearing in mind the true value of vowels , the percussive value of consonants , and the importance of keeping up the voice until the last word is spoken . There must be plenty of wind in the bellows , so to speak . The great thing is , to have the sound come from the front of the mouth . . . . The actor must learn to breathe deeply from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Too often the last word is not held up , and that is very often the important word . . . . Schools for acting are valuable , . . . but , after all , the actors , like other folk , must be- taught how to speak as children in the home , at school , and in society . ? The people of the Latin races are , as a rule , better speakers than we Anglo-Saxons . They speak more distinctly and with a better sense of the value of sounds and words . They elide their words , to be sure , but they do it beautifully . We are slovenly of speech , we drop our " r 's " and ignore our " ings , " not only among the untutored , but more and more among the cultured , especially in England . . . . In Paris the best French is spoken . There the French actor should get his standards . In London the best English is spoken  --  the English actor should speak as the most cultured do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much to choose between the English spoken at Boston , New York , Washington and other cities . The American actor should follow the best practice among the cultured of all cities . I need not apologize for citing so fully the words of one who is not only sane in his views upon right speaking , on and off stage , but who is also a successful exponent of his own philosophy . It is only fair also to add to Professor Gummere 's apt discussion of the subject Mr. Forbes-Robertson 's comment upon the elocution. of the French stage . The art of reading verse may have become well-nigh lost , so far as we Anglo-Saxons are concerned , but even the casual visitor to Paris ought to know that it is not lost to the leading members of the Theatre Francais . Perhaps it is unnecessary to add that the proper manner of reading English verse and French is so distinct that the practices of a Mounet-Sully and of a Forbes-Robertson have , in fact , almost nothing in common save a regard for that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry of the drama represented . W. New York , November 22 . GENERAL MEADE AT GETTYSBURG . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In your issue of November 18 , 1909 , you publish a most interesting letter from Mr. Jesse Bowman Young about the movements of Meade 's army from and after Gettysburg . Permit me to add some remembrances of my own confirming his conclusions . At the time of the battle of Gettysburg I was in Washington with a new regiment of infantry . The military authorities there were naturally much disturbed over the situation , and we were dispatched in great haste to join the army under Meade . Arriving soon after the battle of Gettysburg , I found our army encamped at or near a small town called Funkstown . I had previously served upon the staff of Gen. Sedgwick , who commanded the Sixth Corps , and I now called upon him . He received me kindly , and informed me that he had just returned from a conference of all the general officers , at which they had decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two volumes of somewhat sim -- Iron for a Farthing , " by the Macmillan liar character Millicent Sowerby 's " Yes-
