txt Canvassing the Mayoralty situation thoroughly at the meeting of the Democratic City Committee last night at the Democratic Club , the Brooklyn party leaders declared in most emphatic language that the nominee of the City Convention for the Mayoralty must be the strongest possible man who could be selected from the combined five boroughs . Without mentioning him by name , the lieutenants of Hugh let it be definitely known that . they did not regard Representative George B. McClellan as such a man , and they urged that no man not large enough to be able to become with grace the candidate of the party for the Presidency , if necessary , be placed , in the field at this stage . At last night 's meeting , for the first time in the present campaign , the leaders of the party from the various boroughs came together to freely discuss the situation . James J. Martin . the Chairman of the City Committee , presided at the meeting , which was strictly secret and held in an upper room in the Fifth Avenue clubhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Charles F. Murphy , the leader of Tammany Hall , and Daniel F. . As Judge was late in arriving , ex-State Senator John F. Ahearn took his place for a time . Brooklyn was represented by James Shevlin . State Senator Patrick H. McCarren , ex-President Bernard J. York of the Police Commission , and ex-Commissioner John L. Shea of the Bridge Department . Borough President Louis F. Haffen and Eugene J. the leader on the north side ? f the Thirty-fourth Assembly District , represented the Bronx . while Borough President Joseph Cassidy , Philip Cronin , George Creed , M. J. Goldin , and Joseph Meycrose were the Queens Borough representatives . Richmond interests were looked after by Edward M. Muller , Franklin C. Vitt , Daniel Campbell , and Arthur Yettman , while Judge John J. Kenny took the place of Judge Thomas W. Fitzgerald . It was nearly il o'clock when the committee was called to order by Mr. Martin and at that time the Democratic Club , which has been pretty much deserted of late . was filled with leaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception of a report from Mr. York . the Chairman of the sub-committee having in charge the arrangements for the convention in Carnegie Hall on Oct. 1 . He reported that the music and . hall have been engaged , the printing. - ortiered , and everything else taken care of . Then on motion of Mr. Shevlin of Brooklyn the chair named a committee of five to prepare a platform to be submitted to the convention . This committed , which consists of Messrs .

To -- this all of the men present assented , and then Mr. Shea , backed solidly by Messrs . Shevli ? McCarren. and York , presented 44-i.e Brooklyn view of the situation . They declared that it would be necessary to exercise the utmost caution in the matter of nominees , and that the campaign would hinge utmost entirely on the character hf the men whom they placed in the field . They also argued that victory alone is not the thing needed in this fight , but that the victory must be an overwhelming one in order to strengthen the party lines. , not only for the perpetuation of power in the municipality , but to gain victories in the State and Nation . In that view the Brooklyn men were backed up strongly by Borough Presidents Cassidy of Queens and Haffen of the Bronx . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for the office if he can land it . Judge Kenny of Richmond also took the same view , and urged the most careful consideration . Throughout all this discussion , lasting for more than two hours , the name of a single candidate did not come out , according to the unanimous declarations of the men present , when they were questioned after the meeting . However . the speakers made it plain that the nomination of Mr. McClellan. while nothing could be said against his character . would leave much to be desired , and that it would not be a matter of good party policy at this time . . Mr. Murphy , who has so long held McClellan in such high favor , did not argue in favor of his man , and because of the onslaught from other sources did not make any st eech on the subject of candidates . In this Isis lead was followed by the other represt.ntatIves from Manhattan . They contented themselves with listening to the . arguments at , inst the programme they wish to see g , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire cluceticn of slate be put over until next tweed The meeting was adjourned until Thursday night , at which time it is expected that the slate to be presented to the City i Convention will be announced in full .

After the meeting Mr. Murphy would not have anything to say on the subject of the McClellan candidacy beyond the statement he made from Tammany Hall earlier in the day that he had 110 candidate . Mr. Murphy let it be known that he thinks as much of Mr. McClellan as ever ? anti it is no i secret that he still holds to his idea that Ithe Representative should be nominated if 1 it is deemed probable that a victory can Ise gained with him as the standard bearer . The question will he thoroughly gone over to-day , when Mr. McClellan will arrive on the steamship Philadelphia . and vein he the subject of many conferences " during the 1 next five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conference Senator Me1 Carron said that the discussion was general in character . Not a name was mentioned throughout the meeting , he asserted . He also declared that no decision was reached ! as to which of the five boroughs should have the naming of the Mayoralty canI didate . ? We talked over the general situation 1 I freely and frankly , " lie said . " Every member of the committee was asked to express 1 his views , and those of us who had views I which we desired to impress on the corn ' ' Mace spoke our minds . " " Did Brooklyn put in any claim to name the candidate : " " It did not . " Mr. Shevlin told the same story , as did 1 Mr. McCarron and other members of the 1 committee with record to the mentioning of names . He main-tail-led with positiveness I that not a single name had been men ; tioned during the whole session , either for i the Mayoralty nomination , the Chairman ( ship of the convention , or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . " I said Mr. Shevlin , " notwithstanding the fact that we reached no conclusion . Those who had anything to say spoke out man fashion . There was no dissembling or mincing matters . " . Did Brooklyn put in a claim to name the head of the ticket ' : " " The position taken by Brooklyn was ; that the best man to be found in the Demo ? crane organization of the five boroughs should be named for Mayor . " " A man of Presidential size ? " " Yes . And why not ? New York City now has a population greater than the United States had when the first President of the country was elected . it ought to have at the head of its government a man who is big enough to be President .

We will settle this muddle first and then we will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . The impression seemed to prevail among the politicians at the club last night that : if McClellan was not named some one of ? . the Democratic Judges of the Supreme Court would be chosen . The names most thought of were those of Justice Morgan J. O'Brien and Justice Giegerich . As Justice Giegerich has only one year to serve . - while Justice O'Brien has more than half of his term still ahead of him , it was the impression that there would be less difficulty in inducing Justice Giegerich to accept than there would be in persuading Justice t , O'Brien to make the race . Lewis Nixpn was asked yesterday whether any tender had been made to him to , ! act as Chairman of the Democratic Con t ention . " I have had no such tender . " he said . 7 " I was not elected a delegate to the City Convention , and hence do not expect to attend .

" That is a matter for their personal con. consideration , " he replied . " What do you think the Democratic organization can do to stop the indorsement of Mayor Low by independent Democrats before the nominations are made ? " " I feel sure that Mr. Murphy is the one . - best calculated and able to answer that -. question .
