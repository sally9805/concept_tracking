President Roosevelt 's letter dismissing William S. Leib , Assistant United States Treasurer at Philadelphia , is neither short nor sweet . On several occasions the President has paid his respects to delinquent officials  --  the gentlemen taken in the postal frauds and the cotton-report scandals  --  in no uncertain tone . The letter to Mr. Leib matches the best of these denunciatory epistles . Leib had all the political backing that anybody could want . Senators Penrose and Knox requested a special hearing for - him , and Representative Patterson defended him . But no machine has commanded respect since November 7 ; and the Pennsylvania machine has been in such unusual disrepute that to throw a brick at it is everywhere regarded as an act of special virtue . The stoutest partisans will never dare to accuse the President of ignoring the claims of " the organization " and thus imperilling the nation . Leib is an old and hardened offender . The only thing to regret is that he was not beheaded earlier In this regret the President himself shares . " If the case had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , " says Mr. Roosevelt , " my belief is that 1 would have then requested your resignation . " Secretary Taft intimates that he expects Congress to investigate the Panama Commission . It would fail of its duty if it did not . The prima-facie evidence of waste , extravagance , and mismanagement is abundant . One result is pretty certain to be established  --  the folly of appropriating $10,000,000 to be expended in the discretion of any man . The temptation of such a sum available without a detailed estimate submitted to Congress is not unlike that of a huge - life- insurance surplus- it makes people mad to get at it . Congressmen who have seen the salary list of the Panama Commission are amazed at it . It has something of the air of a royal civil list . Then there are many contracts and purchases made by the Commission into - which Congress should feel it obligatory to look . Furthermore , the conditions on the Isthmus seem to call for scrutiny . The Herald printed on Friday the protests of . American clergymen in Panama against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned women , with the consent of the - canal authorities , the object being to make the laborers " contented . " And Physicians on the spot are speaking out against the certain result of this kind of " sanitation . " All told , an inquiry into the whole affair by a committee of Congress bids fair to be fruitful The system of control which Congress exercises over the Post-Office involves the appropriation of all the money needed for the entire establishment every year , and the subsequent return of the gross receipts to the Treasury . Thus , Mr. Cortelyou accompanies his request for $12,000,000 more money for next year with the prediction that he will be able to reduce the postal deficit from last year 's figure of $14,572,584 . He proposes to keep the clerical force practically at its present size , and has economized somewhat in the special facilities of railway transportation . Increase , of course , is regularly to be expected in - the general lines of the department work , and rural free delivery is naturally growing at a rate much beyond that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be a condition of equilibrium in which all parts of the country fare substantially alike , and growth keeps pace merely with the increase of population . That may be the time for going to the fundamentals of the postal-deficit problem . At present , the unprofitable departments of the service are growing so much faster than the income-producing ones that predictions as to anything but the immediate future are not to be trusted too much . ( Apart from the merits of the case , Midshipman Meriwether 's tiled at Annapolis brings out some amazing facts about the student " code " at the Naval Academy . Under it , not only have there been a score or more of pugilistic fights , under the rules of the prize ring , but official duty , not to speak of the obligations of a gentleman , has been steadily disregarded . The Annapolis " code , " in fact , has many of the absurd features of the duello . There is the same perverted sense of " honor , " the same compulsion to fight , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was testified that these brutal encounters often resulted in " handshaking " and a general withdrawal of insulting epithets . It was said that Merrwether , after calling ' Midshipman Branch a " sneak , " a " Ooward , " and " nio gentleman , " discovered after twenty rounds that he was one of the finest fellows on earth . This is too fantastic to be allowed in an Academy Where men are supposed to be taught realities . Apart from the fatal result an this case , the whole system , as disclosed , with its semibarbarousand obsblete standards of perkinal honor , elearrly calls-for- instant form , and by reform we mean abolition . Joseph Ralph Burton , United States Senator from Kansas , is reported to be somewhat depressed , and not without reason , for he has a second time been convicted of exerting his official influence in behalf of an enterprise which was using the Mails to defraud . The first conviction was set aside on the purely technical ground that the payment to Burton was made outside the jurisdiction of the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably succeed in having this second verdict set aside . While he is waiting for the decision of the higher court , he will enjoy the seclusion of private - life . " Though he is still a United States Senator , " says his counsel , " he will not take hiS seat . I do not believe this would be proper or dignified , and Senator Burton does not think so either . " We commend Burton 's modesty to the attention of two New York statesmen . - Of a certain kind of strenuous life , Gov . Jeff Davis of Arkansas is a most admirable example . It is not his fault if he is not now the idol of every barroom , the hero of every prize-fighter and gutter ruffian . ll/londay 's personal encounter in which he had his skull cracked by a pistol in the hands of ex-Congressman Dinsmore , was only his fifth fight within three years . He fought a draw with the Republican candidate for Governor in August , 1902 ; was knocked out by Judge Carroll D. Wood a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Vandeventer in October , 1903 ? and had another stand-up fight with Judge Wciod in December , 1903 He was threatened with death by his Attorney-General in September of this year , but still survives to fight again  --  and , " incidentally , to show the world how low a blackguard can become a Governor . An experienced , not to say hardened , protectionist will only smile at the demand of the artists that they - be no longer protected by the tariff on , art . These gentlemen meet in convention in this city to declare that the tariff as it affects them is blind and behind the times ; but what has that to do with the case ? If proving our fiscal system both stupid and obsolete could have altered it , we s , hould , have seen it changed years ago . Protection does not object to hard . names ; talk it what You like , provide-d you vote for the men who uphold it . Mr. Kenyon Cox asserted that the at ' - gument against the art duty is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the argument against a hundred otherduties , but what good does that do ? Protectionists will let you have all the logical triumphs you want if only they may remain in control of Congress and keep the schedules intact . The standpatters have no desire to get the better of the argument ; all they wish is to have the better of the voting in committee and on the floor . The situation would be different if the artists had a political following , or were in the habit of making large campaign contributions . In that case they would be an " interest " to be taken care of ; as it is , they are , from the point of view of the protectionists with a grip on Congress and the President , merely a lot of amiable enthusiasts whose protests and appeals can be disregarded with perfect safety . The truth is , the protectionists maintain that the moment an American citizen is allowed to buy a French painting without paying a tax on it , the schedules on imitation jewelry , steel rails , and pickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American regulates his expenditures for underwear , crockery , and garden hose solely with reference to the price he has paid for the oil paintings in his parlor . If that schedule is touched , all the others must go too . It seems to have been expected by almost no one that the anti-cigarette laws passed by Indiana and Wisconsin last winter would ever be enforced . Yet the reports now coming from both those States indicate that neither one is being allowed to become a dead-letter . Whether this means that they are to remain permanently on the statute-book or will be repealed with alacrity , depends on the temper of the people . There is one point , however , in which such a law is to be distinguished from nthe prohibition of liquor . If a " blind pig " is accessible and properly supplied , a drinking man can imbibe there about as well as anywhere else . He is accustomed to resort to a special place for his potations But the cigarette-smoker expects to indulge himself while going about his usual occupations . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cigarette-smoking , in other words , ceases to be attractive if it ( must be clandestine , and therefore the law has , in this special aspect , a better chance Of regulating it . And as the object of these laws was not to stop smoking in general , but this particular kind , every convert to the cigar or pipe is a living monument to the wisdom of the Western legislators . So , we may add , the young Nebraskan fined $50 and costs recently for rolling , otherwise " manufacturing , " a cigarette for his own use . . Boston is not so sure that her system of primary nominations is all that she thought it was . A fortnight ago the pri ' Diaries for the selection of candidates for Mayor were held . Five men  --  two Demodrats and three Republicans  --  had stumped the city , and roused more interest than has been shown in a municipal election since the late Mayor Collins put himself at the head of the Boston Democracy . Representative John F. Fitzgerald was the choice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But H. S. Dewey , one of the defeated Republican iaspirants , became suspicious of the methods used by Mr. Frothm gham 's campaigners to secure a bare 300 plurality . A cry of fraud was set up and a recount demanded . The result was to cut Mr. Frothingham 's plurality in half , and Mr. Dewey still insisted that he had been defeated by fraudulent votes , and announced that be would run as an independent candidate . Doubtless he Is Spurred on by Moran 's success in winning election as District Attorney independently . But , to judge from the comments of the Boston newspapers , there is little likelihood of Judge Dewey 's being hailed as a New England Jerome . " Preserving the gold standard " is too good a phrase to be lost ; we should incorporate it permanently in our political vocabulary . In 1896 the big insurance companies were paying $50,000 each to the Republican campaign fund in order to preserve the gold standard . In 1900 the standard still seemed to be in danger . In 1904 , ordinary men ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance companies continued to see the menace on the distant horizon , and cheerfully handed out the $50,000 ? taken , as usual , from the pockets of the policyholders . Nothing but the salvation of the country and the preservation of the gold standard , they assured us solemnly , could have induced them to contribute to a political Party . They regarded State issues and local issues as beneath their notice . On November 21 , however , Senator Thomas C. Platt testified in effect that he had a little gold standard of his own which he was preserving very industriously . He was not interested in the national but in the State , campaign ; and yet the Equitable paid him $10,000 a year , and the Mutual often gave as much . President Richard A. McCurdy , by the way , who swore that the Mutual did not give to the State campaigns , was the man with whom Platt had dealings . Plat is not the only man who had a gold standard . The Equitable has carried on its payroll for twenty-three years an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $2,000 to $6,000. - His duty has been to preserve the gold standard of individual officers of the company , and he mentioned specifically Mr. Alexander , Mr. Hyde , Mr. Tarbell , and Mr. Jordan . He would keep these gentlemen on good terms with the city government and get their tax assessments reduced . For such eminent services to the country $6,000 a year from the money of the policyholders was a miserably small reward . The testimony of Mr. George W. Perkins on Monday did not reveal him in an absolutely new light  --  it was of a piece with what had gone before ; but it was astonishingly replete with evasions , shifts , doublings , reluctance to come to the point , hollow excuses , pretences , and finally the most damaging admissions . Here was an enormous fiduciary business managed in the spirit of a Bowery shop for second-hand clothing . Deceit and misrepresentation were the chief stock in trade . The public was bamboozled , the Superintendent of Insurance was hoodwinked , the policyholders were deceived and cheated . Accounts were doctored , minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bleed the company at will , political contributions were made under lying entries in the books , and the whole vast system of irregularity and crookedness and graft covered with a thin veneer of the most disgusting hypocrisy . Mr. Perkins and his fele lows have made themselves impossible . They have forfeited all respect , and must lose their trust positions . If any of the trustees of either the Mutual or the New York Life think that their business can be saved except by the most radical changes of personnel , they are living in a fool 's paradise . Why , policyholders by the thousand are turning to Tom Lawson in preference to McCall or McCurdy or Perkins ' That is only a hint of the desperate situation which requires desperate remedies . Public confidence can be restored only by dismissing the men who have destroyed it . Mr. Tarbell 's views in the - matter of deferred-dividend policies are such as would naturally be expected from the head of a life-insurance company 's agents . Mr. McCall , in his testimony of October 7 before the Armstrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed his objection to " straight life " annual dividends , on the ground , very largely , that to get good solicitors the company must pay good commas sions , and that agents ' Commissions on a deferred-dividend policy are much larger than on ordinary life-insurance contracts . This argument would naturally appal to an officer whose duty it is to " show results " in new insurance . Mr. Tarbell undertook , however , to set forth arguments in detente of the deferred-ffividen.d principle itself . Briefly , his points are that such policies , maturing at a stated date , add to the safety of insurance by the large surplus funds accruing in the interim ; that they provide for the family when the policy matures ; that they are cheap insurance , because no dividends so high can be paid on the annual basis ; that they attract " good lives , " because men not in good health Would mistrust their chance of surviving to get the benefits of the " pool " ; that they induce men to insure who would not insure if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance ; and that they do not lapse as " straight life " policies often do . These arguments do not impress us . To say that withholding dividends for twenty years , and then paying them in a lump , adds to the safety of insurance , begs the whole question . If the funds reserved against such accruing dividends are calculated merely on the basis of safe insurance , then the company as a whole is protected neither better nor worse than it would have been without them . On the other hand , if the monstrous evils , extravagance , and corruption of which our great companies have been guilty , do not lie directly at the door of the abnormal surpluses thus accumulated , then the Armstrong committee 's researches have been in vain . As to the second point , a " twenty-year policy " at least provides no better for a family than a savings-bank account maintained by similar payments during the same period ; it is capable of proof , indeed , that its provision is far less adequate . That these policies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of accumulated dividends , are the cheapest form of insurance , we had not supposed even Mr. Tarbell would seriously contend . If allowance he made for those who lose all their dividends through death in the period prescribed , , we take it to , be the most extravagant form of insurance in the field . Mr. Tarbell 's other arguments hardly call for answer . Our own view of the matter is summed up in the Frick report 's conclusions , which we have quoted . heretofore ; we may add , with approval , the following remarks , addressed to the Insurance Commissioners ' Convention last September by Insurance Commissioner McGiv-ney : " The purpose of a mutual life-insurance company is not to have its members gambling on the misfortunes of its other members . The deferred-dividend plan is the medium of building up large surplus funds which are not required by law to earn any interest ; it furnishes a ready means to make up losses from extravagance and waste , and is a temptation to the manage-. went for hazardous and risky speculation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dark , " but for tricks ? that have not been vain , commend us to the insurance grafters . John . A. Nichols- received for some years $1,000 froJeadh of the three great companies with which to stop the mighty pen of the " rantankerous friend " at Al- ; bany , W. S. Manning . But the latter swears he got of late only a miserable $300 annually as his " legal " retainer . Profit for Nichols , just $2,700 a year . As for the mighty McCalls and 1VIeCurdys and Alexanders , this leaves their Wasted business ability in a sorry light . Any up-river graybeard with a sanctimonious ' air could stand them all up against a Wall and make them hold up their hands while he extracted from their pockets just what he wanted . So easy was this game that it makes the trade ' of a blackmailing society editor seem like an elaborate business transaction . But the magnates knew their methods were crooked , and so they paid every one who came along to save themselves from exposure . Assemblymen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Senators  --  ail knew a good thing when they saw it , and worked their mine for all it was worth . What mattered it if the money was stolen from men and women who tolled and slaved and saved pennies to pay premiums ? The woods were full of them ; the agents roped them in by the hundreds ; surpluses piled up ; the State Insurance Department connived willingly , no danger was in sight , and all went merrily . Is it any wonder that the Weans and McCurdys have a sense of deep personal injury at the thought that their little paradise has been rudely invaded ? There will presumably be considerable manoeuvring for position between the Liberals and the Tories before the impending dissolution and general election . If Parliament were in session , the King would no doubt send for Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and ask him to form a Ministry . Then the budget would be passed and the appeal to the country made . But Sir Henry is too old a bird to be taken in the net which Mr. Balfour is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he form a Government in the dark , drift along till February , then suffer a vote of no confidence in the House and be compelled to dissolve . He will refuse , unquestionably , to fall in with the strategy of the Tories in that way . They must either do their own dissolving , or stagger on under a still heavier burden of discredit . Of the outcome of the general election , there can be no reasonable doubt . Chamberlain talks valiantly about " closing up the ranks " and get- . ting rid of " blunt swords , " but such advocacy of a snug little party all of one mind is folly in an appeal to a ' great electorate where , as Lord Hugh Cecil remarks , success is " a matter of nose-counting , and each free-fooder has his nose . " The signs all point to a crushing defeat of the Chamberlain policy in the election of the new House . The argument has been strong against it ; tradereturns still stronger . Chamberlain himself expects to be beaten in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mess of it in office , and that , after a couple of years , his second chance will come . All this is in the lap of the gods ; the only certain thing is that the great issue is soon to be put to the electoral test , and that , whoever may hereafter lead the Conservative party in whatever paths , we ' are now witnessing the passing of Arthur Balfour . The executive Committee of the Zemstvo Congress , in pledging its support to the Witte Cabinet , " so long as it follows the path for the accomplishment of the liberties promised by the manifesto , " gives encouraging evidence that Russia has advanced far ' on the road to liberalism . The force of events , which is daily converting conservative leaders and journalists into adherents of the new regime , is not lost upon Witte himself . He appears sincerely intent upon gathering around him men who enjoy the confidence of ' the Liberals . Only four years ago , there appeared in Stuttgart a secret memorandum ( in Russian ) by Witte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zemstvo , " in which be attempted to prove that , " under an absolutist government , the labor of the social forces is incomparably more productive to the country and the people at large than it can lie under a parliamentary Government . " To-day , as the Premier of a Liberal Ministry , he promises universal suffrage and the widest possible concessions to the toiling masses throughout the land . His Conversion is evidently accepted as genuine by a majority of the zemstvo leaders , though the Moderates ? " Octobrists , " as they significantly call themselves  --  declare that Russia is not ripe for a constituent assembly . Among the men who enjoy alike the confidence of Count Witte and the zemStvoists there are not a few eminent names . Prince Urusoff , Witte 's first choice for Minister of the Interior , a ' prominent Liberal , was formerly Governor of Tver , but resigned under the Plehve administratlon . Prince Eugene Trubetzkoi of the University of Kiev is now one of Witte 's trusted advisers . Prince Volkonsky , M. Stchepkin , and Prince Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wielding great influence'in the Congress ; and even M. Petrunkevitch , the president of the Moscow Agricultural Society , a former exile in Siberia and a Radical leader , declares the restoration of ' order to be the first duty of the hour . But probably the most difficult problem that confronts Witte lies in the vacillation of the Czar , which is certainly , in this seeth , /fig time , more excusable than ever .
