PESSIMISTS sometimes tell us that life has become a uniform drab , and that all romance has passed away in the dull routine of modern existence . When they gay this , they forget the profession of war-correspondent . Here we have a calling , unknown sixty years ago , that is as full of excitement , uncertainty , and romance as the most greedy adventure - seeker could desire . The " special " of a great journal has the world as his field of operations . One month he is witnessing the triumph of modern artillery in a battle between a Chinese and a Japanese fleet ; the next , he is tracing the ways of Russian diplomacy in Peking . Soon afterwards , he may be hurrying off to a minor rebellion in South America , or picturing a phase of the struggle between East and West in the Balkans . He wakes up each morning conscious that before night he may be off on a journey of ten thousand miles . His preparations for long travel are always made . One special artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he calls his " hot " and his " cold " outfits . If his editor asks him to take the afternoon boat express to St. Petersburg , and go from there to Nova Zembla , he has only to send a brief wire home , After a cup , rght pa --  " Please bring cold bag Cha- ; rd " ALb.i ring Cross , twelve mid-day , " and he is ready . If Timbuetoo is his destination , he needs only substitute " hot " for " cold . " correspondents is considerable , and the In the office of one London daily paper danger is very great . The mortality a bag is kept always ready for any man amongst them is always enormous , eon-who has instantly to go off to the ends sidering their number . No campaign of the earth . Such preparations are ne- passes without several sinking before cessary . Take one instance alone . Last either the weapons of the enemy , or disVOL CI. ? No. 602. - 22 ease that always dogs a fighting force . They have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their news ; and when the work of the soldier is done , that of the correspondent is beginning , for he has to write his description of the battle , and walk or ride perhaps twenty-five miles or more to get it on the wire . Enormous physical endurance is to him absolutely necessary . " I have at least one advantage over other men , " said Archibald Forbes to Sir John ( then Mr. ) Robinson , when he first set out for the Daily News to the Franco-Prussian war . " You have many advantages , " the newspaper chief replied . " Yes , " the special assented ; " but you du not know the advantage I mean . After a day 's fighting I can walk forty miles to despatch my message . Other men have to wait for their horses . Horses are never to be found after a heavy fight ; and while they are searching , I have got through . " Much risk naturally brings adequate compensation . George Augustus Sala 's declaration that his paper " paid him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far wide of the mark of many men to-day . One of the best known of the " specials " receives ? 1000 a year in times of peace and ? 2000 during war . Another had ? 1000 when at home and ? 1500 when abroad ; and to this he added fully as large an amount from the sales of his correspondence reprinted in book form . Another was recently given a du uceur of ? 2000 by his chiefs at the end of a campaign . Many men are retained only during war-time , and then ? 100 a month is a usual rate of remuneration . But this does not represent all . The newspaper usually insures the correspondent 's life for a considerable amount , in favor of his wife . In at least one instance known to me the owners of the paper immediately settled a pension on the widow of their representative who died at the front . The newspaper correspondent is a costly luxury . All his expenses have to be paid , in addition to his salary , and these expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never mind the cost . " are his directions . Cable charges are a large part of his outlay . In the present South-African campaign these have been very heavy . Newspapers that do considerable business can , it is true , send their messages for I. a word , press rates . But press messages have a way of being delayed , and in moments of special interest no great papers use these rates . They send intelligence as ordinary cables , at 4s. a word , or as " urgent , " at 148. a word . Often enough the urgent message has got through no quicker than the press message . One newspaper bill for telegrams alone , during a quiet month of this campaign , came to 0000 . When the Transvaal war broke out , experienced newspaper managers realized that there would be unusual difficulties in supplying the world with news . The cable lines from South Africa are entirely under the control of the British powers , which have been used to the full . From first to last only such cable messages have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been examined . For the first time in British campaigns letters from the front have reached newspaper offices open , and endorsed on the cover , " Opened under martial law . " In olden times the newspaper correspondent had a free hand . It was his business to get what news he could and send it off as quickly as possible . He had to forage for his own food and look after himself . English generals changed all that . They made the war-correspondent a regular part of the army . Before joining he must receive a pass from the War Office , and this pass is difficult to obtain . Then he is treated as an officer ; lie is allowed to draw forage for his horse , and he is placed under martial law . If he disobeys the orders of the commander he can be shot by a drum-head court martial ? although in actual practice this would not be done . He is only allowed to go where the commander pleases , his telegrams must be read and approved by a special officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each journal that has a " special " at the front is carefully scrutinized : and if it is shown that the journal is publishing anything deemed detrimental to the army , the " special " is sent about his business . This is a very good plan ? for the generals . It silences criticism ; it suppresses ugly facts . Every correspondent , in each message , has the terror of the censor over him . He knows that if he writes anything in the least critical , his message will be at least delayed , and all his enterprise rendered useless . Unpleasant as censorship is in theory , it has been worse in practice . At the beginning of the war , staff-officers were appointed censors who had no idea of the requirements of their office . The theory held by correspondents was that when a staff-officer was so useless that no other task could be found for him he was made censor . These censors would pass messages without respect to order or time . Six correspondents would bring their messages in . The enterprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed first . Not at all . The last-corner 's copy would be looked at first , because it was on top of the pile . After the censor had read a page or two he would , likely as not , bundle the remainder into his pocket and go off to an entertainment or for a meal . Two correspondents would send their wires at once . One would reach London a week after the other . The censor exercises his blue pencil unsparingly . Many messages are suppressed altogether . Those that are allowed to pass are often rendered foolish , or at least useless . Take this sample : The correspondent writes : " Heavy Boer attack . Guns rain shell fire on position . Severe losses , both yesterday and to-day . " The message reaches the foreign editor in London thus : " Heavy rain yesterday and to-day . " But that is a trifle . In the early part of the campaign , when the cable company was overwhelmed by the rush of new work , the only way to get news through was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his message as twenty separate cables of twelve words each . These cables would comeinto the London office in the most elaborate disorder ? one , one day ; another , next week . The middle would come in first , the end next , and the beginning nut until a day or two after . How to piece them together and make sense of them puzzled the most ingenious editors in England . To-day most of the London cable editors have streaks of gray in their hair , young though they may be . The difficulties of cabling led most correspondents to rely mainly on written communications , and the best of our correspondence comes in this way . But in some cases it has been nearly as hard to get letters through as cables . At the beginning of the war most of the correspondents accompanied Sir George White in what were then the chief operations in Natal . They went with him to Ladysmith , and have remained there up to the time of writing this . They have only two ways of communicating with the outer world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is official , and so can not be used to any large extent . Flashing its sunlight enormous distances , it surely carries any communication right over the enemy 's lines solong as the sun shines . But when the sun goes behind a cloud , as during the fierce Boer attack on Ladysmith , all communication is at once cut off . The native runner has found sudden fortune ? or death ? in this war . He knows the country and is familiar with every kopje , and his work is to penetrate through the Boer lines with a message to the English headquarters . About one message in twenty thus sent from Ladysmith gets through . It is better not to ask what becomes of the men who try to take the other nineteen . If caught by the Boers they are liable to the fate of spies ; and doubtless that fate they often enough meet . Sometimes the native runnel ' is weeks making a roundabout trip . One man set out from Mafeking in November . He did not reach an English post , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February . To English newspaper men the war will always be remembered with sorrow because of the correspondents who have been sacrificed to it . The death at Ladysmith , of George Warrington Steevens , correspondent of the Daily Mail , is universally admitted to be a heavy loss to English literature . Mr. Steevens brought to his work the highest culture of the schools , and a literary gift that had , when he was still in his twenties , placed him amongst the most popular writers of the age . A fellow of Ball iol , made his first mark in newspaper work on the Pall Mall Gazette , when Mr. H. J. C. Gust was editor . The Pall Mall was , in those days , the marvel of English journalism . Its former editor , Mr. E , T. Cook , had left it rather than renounce his political opinions , and the proprietor surprised the world by putting a young and inexperienced member of Parliament in charge . Every one expected that ruin would result . Instead , the Pall Mall be-came a paper such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impudent , clever , with an undercurrent of scholarship , it gave the world a fresh shock every day . Among the brilliant band of young men around the editor , Mr. Steevens was easily first . But the outside public did not know him until he joined the Daily Mail . He began his work for it in. the summer of 1896 by a journey to America , and tour followed tour in endless succession . His wonder-ful picturesqueness , his clear vision , his power of grasping details and of making the strangest scene live before every reader , soon brought fame . Whether writing at leisure in London , or in the equatorial desert after hard-fought fight against savages , he ever displayed the same power . At the height of his fame he was but a boy . Married and settled , with a farm in Surrey , chambers in Bloomsbury , and a roving commission to cover the world , his life was sped at express rates . In the four years of his life on the Mail he lived more than most men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craved one more outing before fixing himself in London . So off he went to Cape Town , and began writing home what his friends hoped would he the crowning series of his adventures ? ? From Cape Town to Pretoria . " But for him there was to be no Pretoria . Shut up in Ladysmith , typhoid seized him . In the days of convalescence heart - weakness revealed itself , and all was over . On a wet , black midnight they bore his body out to Ladysmith Cemetery . The one illumination was the Boer searchlight dashing from the hills above . The little band of sorrowful men laid him tohis rest , and before many days the whole world was mourning with them the loss of a brave and bright soul . The death of Mr. Steevens has not been the only tragedy so far . Mr. FL F. Knight , of the Morning Post , has seen many campaigns since , when a lad , he fought for France in the war against Germany . He long served the Times , and his books relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But almost at the beginning of this war a Boer bullet so shattered his right arm as to necessitate amputation , and to imperil even his life . The bitterest part of it is that the bullet was fired after the enemy had hoisted a flag of truce , and when Mr. Knight was advancing with the soldiers to receive an expected surrender . The wound was severe , but happily the worst is now over ; and his friends declare that nothing would suit the correspondent better than to return to the front as soon as possible . No correspondent has done better service than Mr. Bennet Burleigh , the famous Telegraph special . He is now a veteran , but a veteran who can leave the younger men hopelessly behind . Beginning as a soldier , lie fought fur the Confederates in the civil war , and passed through adventures that would fill many a volume . Three times a prisoner , he obtairicd his liberty by feats that make the stories of Dumas seem tame . War over , he Look to journalism in Texas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what fear is , and his physical powers are enormous . To spend a day in battle and then ride sixty miles afterwards , write a long and brilliant despatch and get it first through , is to him a trifle . He does not know fatigue ; and the harder a campaign , the more he flourishes . He thrives on hardships as other men do on luxury . Yet , withal , he has sides to his character that men do not see in campaigns . He is so ardent a socialist that he actually fought as a Labor candidate at Glasgow in several elections . To understand the meaning of this , it must be remembered that in England the " Labor candidate " is almost universally regarded as a hopeless crank . His favorite drink is soda-water , and he abjures tobacco . He began the present campaign by taking a venturesome journey through the Boer army . He actually , at a time when every outlet from the Transvaal was closed , boarded the train of the Boer General Joubert and travelled with him , securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boer intentions . He so won Joubert that the old general lent him a conveyance to go over into British territory . Once at least during this campaign Mr. Burleigh , in spite of the censor , got in front of even the military authorities . The authorities paid him the undesirable compliment of appropriating his despatch and issuing it as official intelligence . The campaign has already made the reputations of a few of the younger men . Foremost of these is Mr. Hales of the Daily No one in England , not even the proprietors of his paper , can tell anything of this young correspondent , save that he is an Australian and is known as the " Australian Kipling . " He accompanied the Australian contingent , and at the last moment was engaged by the London paper he now represents . His pictures of the field-preacher and of the burial of General Wauchope have made him famous . They have been so widely quoted by almost every English-written newspaper in. the world , that it is unnecessary to reproduce parts here . Some complain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiplingism run mad . " But it goes home . Another who is showing the possession of powers that may carry him far if he does justice to himself is Mr. C. E. Hands , of the Daily Mail . Mr. Hands began life as a reporter on a halfpenny London evening paper , the Star . His unusually comic accounts of little gatherings of vestrymen and local committees became very popular . When the ENGLISH WAR-CORRESPONDENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA . Cust regime started on the Pall Mall Gazette he went there , and in due course , like many of the Cust men , drifted to the Daily Mail . He was through the Spanish-American war , and was seen to advantage there . He did not start for South Africa till January , and all who know his real literary ability expect much from him . Mr. Winston Spencer Churchill , the youngest of the correspondents , can hardly be said to have gained fame in this war , for he was famous before it . But he has certainly added greatly to his laurels . lie is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monopoly of either side of the Atlantic . Son of the most original and meteoric of modern English statesmen , Lord Randolph Churchill , he found himself , five years ago , a subaltern of twenty at Aldershot . He had joined the army for the sake of adventure ; and as no adventures promised in England , he obtained leave and hurried oil to witness the fighting in Cuba between Spaniards and Cubans . Somehow he found himself nearer and nearer to the fighting-line , until finally he was in it . When his leave was up he returned to England , decorated with the First-Class Order of Military Merit . He was just in time to accompany his regiment to India , and there he volunteered for the frontier expedition to Tirah . It was a dangerous expedition , for the natives were good at sniping , and were well protected in their mountain fastnesses . Rut the boy seemed to look out for danger . He rode on a white pony , the most conspicuous of all marks , and all the prayers of his friends could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . War followed war . To his military duties he added the business of special correspondent , and revealed unusual powers . After a second frontier expedition , he went with Kitchener to Khartum , shared in the great cavalry charge at Omdurman , andwrote the standard book on the cam-paign . In the intervals he wrote a novel , Savrola . Returning home , he resigned his commission rather than abandon writing , and entered politics . Still a boy of under twenty-five , he starred the country as a political speaker , unsuccessfully fought an election , and then hurried off to Natal for the war . His deed with the armored train , his wonderful escape from Pretoria , are known to all . Somewhat heavy - looking , ambitious , hard-working , with a touch of mysticism that attracts the mob , a born orator , with power to move people as he wills , Winston Spencer Churchill must go far . Today he is only twenty-six . How long can he keep up his present pace ? What will he be ten years hence ? Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older political parties , who look to him to lead them in a new political movement . Is his star to shine clearer and clearer , or is it to burn itself out by its very vehemence ? Who can say ? Two well-known Americans are now at the front , Mr. Richard Harding Davis and Mr. Julian Ralph , and they tooth are serving the Daily Mail . Mr. Davis , like Mr. Pearse of the Daily News , is a giant . Mr. Pearse stands six feet four in his stockings ; Mr. Davis is broad enough across the shoulders for a champion athlete . Of a ditTerent type is Mr. II . W. Nevison , of the Daily Chronicle . Mr. Nevison learned his first military lessons in Whitechapel , teaching the lads of the street to drill in order to promote discipline and self-control amongst them . Mr. Nevison has never reaped all the popularity his literary power deserves . He is perhaps too peasimistic for the mob ? a pessimism which his experiences in trying to improve the slums of East London must have helped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front would be to make this paper a mere string of names . There is Mr. Maxwell , of the Standard , who scored such a success in the Soudan campaign . One must not omit Mr. H. A. Gwynn , head of Reuter 's correspondents , perhaps the most typical special of all . Mr. Gwynno is so much abroad that London knows little of his personality , although it sees much of his work . He hurried straight from China to the seat of war . Even peers are eager to bear a pencil in the field , and Lord Do la Warre serves for the Globe .
