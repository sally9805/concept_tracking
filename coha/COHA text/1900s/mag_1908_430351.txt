The historian of the future , discussing civilized man of the twentieth century , will certainly record this period as one of transition . Whether we think of matters sociological or psychological , whether of the structure of society or the less tangible but no less important fabrics of the mind , no matter what we hope or wish , we can rest assured of one thing ? that there will be change . To those who love the old and fear the new , it often seems as if the end were near . Even the ardent radical can not resist an occasional sigh of regret , as the old landmarks , so familiar and once so well-beloved , slowly disappear . In religion , it is perhaps true that the majority of the old school do not see the advancing tide . Religious faiths have always been attacked by the enemies of God ; is He not still able to defend them ? The point overlooked is , that the so-called enemies are themselves representatives of the Almighty , and have , if they tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in'religion itself has not departed , the vast flood of literature on that topic sufficiently proves . These books are not written , printed , and bound , merely to ornament the shelves of booksellers . Readers they must have , ? eager , numerous , perhaps not overdiscriminating readers ; for , to tell the truth , many of the books are poor things . It is at first difficult to understand why the religious public seem to prefer an infinite variety of works of mediocre quality to a few of real excellence ; but perhaps it merely indicates a variety of tastes , and a desire to view matters from several different angles , ? and these , so far , are good signs . The authorship of the works is also significant . In these days of commercialism , we expect to see everything produced with an eye on the market-place ; but it must be said for our religious writers , from the wisest to the most absurd , that they are as a class obviously altruistic , bent upon flinging their message to a needy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three diverse works , now before us , have prompted these remarks . Dr. Crapsey , whose point of view is not unknown to the public , describes the fall of the dogmatic system and  | the re-birth of religion in a freer age , under the guidance of the intellect . This is his theology : " God is to us the sum of the forces of the universe ; to men of old he came now and then , he is with us all the time . He is the ceaseless energy from whom all things proceed ; he makes the outgoings of the morning and evening to praise him ; he sorrows over withered grass and notes the fall of the sparrow ; he regards the complaint of the poor and his eyelids try the children of men ; to know him is eternal life , and to serve him perfect freedom . . . . Man can become man only by making himself one with God . And it is in the strength of his divinity that the man of the human ideal and the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all peoples and bring all nations into the obedience of the Faith . " In another place we find this : " Not only do we have in the new dogmatic the friend God of Abraham , and the righteous God of Isaiah , and the Father God of Jesus ; but we have also the Infinite God of Copernicus and Bruno , the law-making God of Kepler and Newton , and the working God of Darwin ... . The God of Darwin . . . is the God who does things , the God who experiments , who is not afraid to soil his hands in the clay . " Various elements of the old dogma , such as those of exclusive salvation and of hell , are not merely discarded , but are vigorously condemned as immoral . The author is as sure of his ground as he is earnest and courageous , and we can not otherwise than wish . him well ; but at several points we find ourselves asking whether we are not escaping from one crassness to fall into another . The Catholics , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution of the confessional . Our God , if he is truly ours , must of necessity stand for something else than the noise and flurry of the outside world . In a philosophical sense , he may be everywhere ; but for practical purposes he comes in through a small door in our most private room , and we see him alone . " The Christ That is to Be " is an attempt to formulate the real gospel of Jesus , and to consider how it may be applied to the modern world . The author 's sympathies are largely with the past , and at the same time his keen interest is in developing for the future such fruits of the past travail of mankind as may prove most useful . He would not break with the Church , for that has held the thread of Christian thought along the ages ; but he would see the Church develop in the spirit of Jesus to meet new needs . Perhaps the following passage is as eloquent of the writer 's attitude as anything in the book : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that good lies at the heart of things must believe that this progress is real and , even if chequered , will be continuous . At the same time we know that at the beginning and at the end of every known sequence of fact or thought lies the unknown . Different epochs produce different theories with regard to the borderlands of knowledge ; farther off there is not even theory to support thought . It is only those who lack the power to learn from history who think that the tendency of thought for one age , although pointing for some time in one direction , necessarily points to finality . Our progress is rather to be observed in the ceaseless shifting of opposing races and schools . The progress of our knowledge is like an apocalyptic vision ; always , everywhere , we have doctrine warring against doctrine and theory against theory , men 's hearts failing them because the very foundations of their thought are shaken . In the gloom of each conflict , to some God seems gone from heaven ; the periodic pulse of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beats low , and parts of knowledge that seemed as steadfast as the stars in the firmament are lost . That which emerges out of the din and darkness is the wiser man , not with higher powers but with wider opportunity . He knows that if he goes backward he fails . He must press forward ; yet , as he goes , something in the creeds thane thinks to be dead rises and meets him after many days , like a child advancing from the dawn of the morning " ( pp. 195-196 ) . Professer Bousset , of the University of Gottingen , has much in common with the writer of " The Christ That is to Be . " He also would test modern Christianity by the teachings of Jesus , and would ally himself with the communities which hold the thread of Christian tradition . At the same time , he does not shrink from the consequences of modern thought . Thus , he says : " We no longer hold the belief that Jesus was absolutely different from ourselves ? He heaven-born , we earth-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblest and the most perfect that has been granted to humanity on its long journey from the lower stage to the higher . He is the goal of our existence , the leader of our life , to whom no other leader is comparable ' '  |
