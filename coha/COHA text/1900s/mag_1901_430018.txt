To meddle with theories of art is a good deal like making an excursion into the Arctic regions with a purpose of reaching the ultimate North . We must carry our provisions with us and expect a scarcity of human society . But the mystery entices and the desire to completely account for things urges on explorers in both cases . To change the figure , the problems of aesthetic bear the same relation to artistic products as do the mathematical solutions of strategetics to actual warfare . Wars may be waged , and poems and pictures made without conscious use of such underlying principles . But they are there and they determine the results . In the modern world , at least , artists have usually known what they were doing , and why . Goethe indeed said that he had never thought about thinking , but there are many volumes of his art speculations to contradict him . The great problem of aesthetic is this : What is the relation of art to existence ? Is it an imitation ? Is it an interpretation ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and morals ? Is it the universal filtered through the human mind ? Is it the particulars of experience arranging themselves into a new order of life ? On our answers to such questions depend our judgment of individual works of art . The two great philosophers of Greece gave a curiously different account of the origin and value of art . To Plato , himself a poet , artist , and creator of vital figures , art , or at least poetry , was a deluding lamp to men 's eyes and a snare to their feet I  | It was inferior to shoemaking ! It was a poor copy of the world which was itself only a paltry shadow of the Divine Ideas . Like Omar he would have burned all books , because if they resembled life they were unnecessary , and if they did not they were false . To Aristotle , on the other hand , crabbed logician , natural philosopher , Baconian before Bacon as he was , art was the concentrated image of the best of real existence . He thought it could react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalt him . Hence he considered it about the highest and most important human concern . The word msthetic is only of late application to the theory of the fine arts , and it is defined as the philosophy of the beautiful . As the Greek word from which it comes primarily means feeling or sensation , the narrowing of the derived term to signify matters of beauty is rather singular , more especially as it was first so used during the romantic outburst of the last century . Certainly other things than the beautiful can give us feelings and sensations ? even pleasurable ones . The ideal of Greek art may have been the regular , the harmonious , the perfect ; but even in Greek art what a wide range of creations , gorgons hydras and chimmras dire , fell outside the limits of this ideal . Unless we can accept such conceptions as the perfection of horror , the delightfulness of the ugly , and the fascination of evil , we can not even explain Greek art . And Gothic or Romantic art may be said to wreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the humanly imperfect . Modern or realistic art , rebelling from the abstract perfection of the Greek and the abstract imperfection of the Medimval Schools , has striven to be simply true . But truth without bias or selection is in art an impossibility ? and so what modern art has really done is to copy life in lower relief than it has itself . The commonplace good has become the insipid and the commonplace evil has become the base . Both are wanting in the greatness with which the older schools of art endow them . But what I wish to remark is that beauty is not really the aim of any of these art methods . What the first two strive for is the characteristic , the significant , the effective . What the last thinks it is striving for is truth . As men are constituted I believe that their emotions and intellect tend to stagnate and stiffen , and that art is the most powerful agency to shock or startle them into motion , and make them realize the fullness and vividness of existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , and so they charm . Things of power give them with sudden impetus and uncertain breaks , and so they fascinate . The great artists of the world wield both kinds of electricity . 1Eschylus is as romantic as Shakespeare and Shakespeare as classic as IEschylus . But the artist who deals in the commonplace and the inanely true does not yield us any shock at all , for his art is the essence of the stagnation in which we mainly dwell . As I have said , Plato and Aristotle view art mainly from a moralistic standpoint . We moderns have tried to change all that . We have looked through the rose-colored spectacles of beauty and the reversed opera glass of intellectual indifference , but after all the thing we are regarding will not budge or alter . Art does deal overwhelmingly with moral ideas , deals with them as life itself deals with them ? for or against . Roughly speaking the generations of the sons of men can be divided into generations of acquiescence and generations of revolt . When authority is paramount , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is content with that station in life in which it pleased God he should be born , then we get a literature like that of Cowper and Jane Austen . When the great deep of humanity is broken up and the whirlwind is abroad , we get an art like that of Byron . We have late instances of these arts of peace and war . For half a century Tennyson charmed the world with his serene or but slightly troubled verse . He gave us what has been called the clerical idyll ; he announced the banns of quasi-science and the Established Church . He was the Defender of Conservatism . " Proputty , proputty , proputty , that 's what I ' ears him say . " But discontent was stirring at his mild moralities and domestic virtues . And this discontent has drawn to a head in the prodigiousvogue of Fitzgerald 's Omar . A good many people have wondered at this vogue . Mere literary beauty does not explain it . Literary beauty never did explain any widespread popularity . Gray was half right when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in prose . But the Persian poem has matter in it . It is an expression of revolt . Not of violent revolt like that of Byron 's , but deep and hopeless . It is the doctrine of God damn . The ship of the world is sinking , so let 's get at the liquor room ! It has seized upon and temporarily satisfied the needs of thinking minds . I do not wish to say that literary expression always follows or precedes a general mood of thought . That is Taine 's rather cast-iron theory . No ! ! Solitary voices for good or evil are always crying aloud in the world . But the measure of their acceptance is the mark of the tides of thought . The supreme artists , indeed , sum up both sides , and usually find some way of reconciliation . I have gone over two parts of the content of art ? images and morality . There is , I think , a third ? intellectual intuition . Or , in other words , art relates itself to concrete nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and to the pure intellect . These three divisions correspond to the old names for the poet . He has been called the Maker , the Priest , and the Seer . In its highest reaches art is nothing less than revelation . The poet has gone up into the mountain and seen God . To speak in terms of philosophy , he has pierced beyond the phenomena of existence to the noumena ? to the thing in itself . And hence he sheds on mere phenomena a splendor and a radiance which is not their own .  | So far for the subject matter of art . Now for its presentation . What is artistic perfection ? This is a somewhat analogous question to that of finish in painting , about which Ruskin has written some final pages . But a great many people who are willing to admit that the proper finish for a picture is the amount adequate to express the artist 's purpose , hesitate to carry the same principle into the consideration of literature . They expect an epic to have the faultlessness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best behavior and avoid low ways . The good Homer must never nod . Byron very sensibly said that there was no long poem in existence the half of which was good . Of course he meant supremely good . Perfection itself is a matter of relativety and contrast . Where all is perfect nothing is known to be so . Mr. Palgrave remarks in one of his journals : " How unequally a vrai dire is Hamlet written . " That is the judgment of a lyric technician . And John Bright is said to have revolted at the changes of style in Shakespeare ? the alternation of high and low , the admission of the humorous and the vulgar , ? and to have considered Milton the greater poet because of the unvarying level of his work . Milton 's dignity comes largely from his subject , and when he has to deal with familiar facts in polysyllables there is in him at least a suspicion of that pomposity of which Wordsworth was to be the awful example ? " And at the Hoop alighted , famous inn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to give to Ajax and Diomede dining off of huge shins of beef the same splendor that he casts upon Apollo striding through the sky with the arrows rattling in the quiver on his back , or upon Achilles raising the grief-stricken Priam from the ground . And Dante , too , relaxes the tight-strung bow of language , again and again . In the Inferno there is vulgarity , coarseness , bestiality . And in the Paradiso he is so intent upon his argument that he forgets to write poetry at all . The most pervadingly elegant and in the ordinary sense poetic part of his poem is the middle section . Here he does not have to deal with the powers of darkness or the domain of the brute , nor does he soar into regions where ecstasy is tuned to utterance beyond human recognition ? and so he can be equable and pure and perfect . But he is greatest elsewhere . Necessarily it is in the drama that the contest between the varied content of reality and an even ideal presentation is the sharpest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that life must conform to art , that Queens , confidants , heroes , and servants must all talk in the same elegant and elevated strain , and passion and desolation and death wear the chains of an equal etiquette . Goethe in his later years came to adhere to this method under the persuasion that he was following the Greeks . The poet who gave us Auerbach 's cellar and the domestic scenes in Egmont tried to turn Romeo and Juliet into a perfect piece on this model . He smoothed out all the - vulgarities and colloquialisms , and made it as prettily insipid as a wool lamb . Fortunately we have in Shakespeare the ultimate power in the art of unity in contrast . He gives us just enough of commonness and coarseness to be a foil to his nobleness and perfection . What poems in the world are so bathed and fused in a single atmosphere as The Tempest or Twelfth Night , Romeo and Juliet or Macbeth . And this brings me to my conclusion . I have questioned , tentatively indeed , the theory that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful elements are such as , taken separately , horrify and terrorize and confuse . But in good art they never are taken separately . The artist leagues together his beauty and his ugliness , his shadows and his lights , his melodies and his discords , and gives us a whole which is calm in all its agitation . In it pain has become painless , evil innocuous , death immortal , and the transitory figures of joy and beauty are fixed in faultless form and unfading color .  |
