txt John D. Rockefeller began yesterday to tell the story of how he and his associates , starting on a combined capital of $4,000 , built up the business which eventually became the property of the Standard Oil Company , a business which spread from a humble little refinery in Cleveland to a corporation the property at which Is generally reputed to be worth In round figures $600,000,000 . Simply and without ostentation he told how the dollars accumulated during that time of the company 's growth from 1860 on . He told it much after the manner of a man relating the story of some one else 's success . There was no show of personal pride in his account . Mr. Rockefeller was a witness in his own behalf in the Government 's suit to dissolve the Standard 011 Company of New Jersey , the company which controls the seventy or more subsidiary concerns which go to make up the powerful corporation of which Mr. Rockefeller is the largest stockholder . For nearly two hours and a half he was on the witness stand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , where off and on for more than a year the hearings in the Government 's suit have been in progress before Special Examiner Franklin Ferriss . This room was far from adequate to meet the demands of the throng that struggled to get a look at Mr. Rockefeller as he sat on the edge of a straight-backed. wooden-bottom chair at one side of the Examiner . In the midst of Mr. Rockefeller 's recital it was found necessary to have a five-minute adjournment so that the room could be veritilated . His Start in Life . It was during this intermission that Mr. Rockefeller told how he came to get his first start in life , a start on borrowed capital , which he obtained without any ? other guarantee than his own boyish face and clear blue eyes . Mr. Rockefeller had left his chair and walked over to speak to several of the newspaper men he knew by sight . Shortly before the intermission he lied mentioned the name of T. P. Handy of Cleveland . TM : TIMES reporter asked him about Mr. Handy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business , " said Mr. 11 , , ckefeller , with a reminiscent smile . " Ile was a banker in Cleveland . I was only a straighthaired boy . That was away back in the fifties . I went to see Mr. Handy and told him what I wanted to do as a start in business . I explained to him how I Intended doing the business , but had no collateral to offer him . " Mr. Handy looked at me kindly , ' How I much do you want ? ' he asked . I told him $2,000 , and he let me have the money . He died several years ago . " Mr. Rockefeller 's voice trembled as he said this , and there was a faraway look in his eyes , Once in his testimony Mr. Rockefeller took occasion to say that the oil business had always been hazardous , always far more risky than banks or railroads . It was so in the old days and is so now , he said . During the recital of Mr. Rockefeller 's story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the secret of his and his associates ' success In business . " We always had good credit , " said Mr. Rockefeller . " We kept our covenants I and we paid our paper . " At Mr. Milburres side during his leads Ing of the witness over the early chap- .. ters of Standard Oil history sat Moritz : Rosenthal , senior counsel for the Stands ard in the present suit . And just behind him sat James S. Miller , who has also ; taken an active part in the case . They , . entered the court room with Mr. Rook &; feller a few minutes before 2 o'clock , the hour at which the afternoon session wail called . ' Air . Rockefeller and his lawyers , had walked over from 20 Broadway , the headquarters of the Standard Oil Company , and waited on the fourth floor or the Custom House until near the time for Mr. Rockefeller to take the stand . Frank B. Kellogg , Charles B. : Morrison , E. Dana Durand , and J. Harwood Graves , who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were on hand waiting for the arrival of the witness . They had been notified that ho would take the stand in the afternoon . There was a stir among the roomful of newspaper men and idly curious when . Mr. Rockefeller entered . He was ushered straight to the witness chair . Few in the courtroom had over seen him . As ho walked to the witness chair every one noticed his sprightly step for a man of his years . He was dressed in a plain business suit of dark cloth . The only jewelry he wore was a small pearl scarfpin and a watch chain of gold , which reached e across his vest . His testimony was given in a smooth , even voice . Often during his story he would pause and ask if . he was going too far . Now and then he started to tell some little personal reminiscence , but was checked by his lawyers . Once he started to tell a story of some man he knew when Mr. Milburn held up his hand . " Strike that out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , the stenographer . Yes , strike that out , " echoed Mr. Rockefeller , and he laughed heartily ( Bier the incident. , His Legal Residence . Mr. Milburn at the beginning led Mr. Rockefeller over the ground whszh the defense seeks to cover . After asking him where he lived and receiving the reply that his legal residence is 4 WestFifty-fourth Street , the lawyer asked : " What was your first connection with the oil business ? " " %first connection with the burin t ? 111%**R aaelagart OP 14 than ' 60 and not later than the besin-1 rang of ' 62 , " replied Mr. Rockefeller . Mr. Milburn suggested that he was quite I a young man at that time . " Somewhat younger than I am to-day , " said Mr. Rockefeller with a faint smile . Following Mr. Milburn 's lead he said that he was first engaged in the refining business . " There were five partners of us , " he said ; " Morris Clark . James Clark , Richard Clark ? Samuel Andrews , and myself . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. at Cleveland . " The refinery , he said , was a small one . This partnership continued until early in 186.5 , when Mr. Rockefeller bought out his partners . The company was dissolved and a new one organized under the name Rockefeller &; Andrews . The firm of Rockefeller &; Andrews continued in business for two years . In the meantime , however  --  it was about 1860 , he thought  --  another firm , William Rockefeller &; Co. , was organized . It was composed of John D. , his brother William , and Mr. Andrews . This company had a refinery next to Rockefeller &; Andrews in Cleveland . Men came still another firm  --  Rockefeller &; Co .. which was located in New York . Its business was the sale of oil for export and that of operating oil warehouses . The membership of this firm was the same as Rockefeller &; Andrews and William Rockefeller &; Co . William Rockefeller had charge of the New York end of the business . He removed to New York . A Saving in Exports . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil at this point and save the expenses of the commission men , " said Mr. Rockefeller ; " also to reduce the warehouse expenses , thereby reducing the expenses of export . " The next change , he said , came in 1867 , when all the properties of Rockefeller &; Andrews , William Rockefeller &; Co. , and Rockefeller &; Co. were put together and taken over by the firm of Rockefeller , Andrews &; Flagler . " Was Mr. Flagler an addition to your organization at that time ? " asked Mr. Milburn . Mr. Flagler was a man of large business experience  --  a valuable addition to our firm , " said Mr. Rockefeller . " A large amount of capital was brought into the company through Mr. Flagler . At that time Mr. Rockefeller and his associates had a large domestic trade as well as an export trade . The domestic trade was growing rapidly . In 1870 we enlisted a number of capitalists and organized what was called the Standard Oil Company of Ohio , " said Mr. Rockefeller . " It took oven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Rockefeller 8 , - Co .. and Rockefeller , Andrews &; Flagler . Those properties had already been merged  --  I overlooked that for the moment . " Growth of Refining Industry . The witness said his company got its oil to Cleveland over the Atlantic &; Great Western Railroad , and later over the Lake Shore . There had been a rapid growth in the refining of oil following the discovery of how to cleanse it . " Was it a prosperous business during those years ? " asked Mr. Milburn . " A very prosperous business , indeed , in the beginning , " said Mr. Rockefeller . He said the prosperity of those who were first in the field became known to others and there was a rush to get into the refining business . People who had been engaged in other businesses and knew nothing of oil hurriedly organized companies arid built refineries . " All sorts and conditions of refineries , from very small ones to moderate sized ones , according to the capital controlled , were started , said Mr. Rockefeller . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We started in with some experience . As far as we went we sought to build In the best possible way . We thought we had a model refinery at that time . " The reason why Mr. Andrews got an interest in the business , " said the witness , " was because he had a practical knowledge of the refining business . " He said the business was located in Cleveland because it was the best distributing point at that time . " We always had the trade which we could supply by way of the lakes , " he said , " reaching up into that large Northwestern country . ' To get the refined oil East they had the Lake Shore , New York Central , Atlantic &; Great Western , Erie , and at times the Pennsylvania Railroad , explained the witness . " But our reliance was upon what we called the Northern roads , " he said . Mr. Milburn suggested that the water communication East made Cleveland a favorable point for distribution . " Ah , yes , that was of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Rockefeller . " We loaded the oil on the lake craft and from the lake craft it was unloaded on canal boats . The water route ran all the way to New York . Of course , we had the capital to enable us to take this slower route . " Disadvantages of Cleveland . " What would you call the disadvantages of Cleveland ? " asked Mr .. Milburn . " Of course , we had a longer haul for the oil which was to be exported , " replied Mr. Rockefeller , adding that at that time his refinery in Cleveland was the largest there . " I believe it was the largest in the entire country at this time-1870 , " he said . The witness said a little earlier that he and his associates had a capital of $1,000 , - 000 in the Standard of Ohio . " How was this 81.009,000 in amount ? was it a large capitalization for a manufa  --  turing concern or not ? " asked Mr. Milburn . " I should say large , indeed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , who had begun with a capital of $4.000. in 1860 . " " As compared with other concerns ? " asked Mr. Milburn . " It was a very large capitalization , " repeated the - witness . " We were steadily Incorporating new ideas , and putting them into practice for the benefit of the business . We began manufacturing barrels . " In after years , " continued Mr. Rockefeller . " we were able to manufacture by machinery for less , than one-half the original cost of barrels . " The improvement in barrels . he said , was after Mr. Flagler became identified with the Rockefellers , soon after 1807 , he added . " When- you went into the manufacture of your own barrels were you an exception in the trade in doing that ? " asked Mr. Milburn . " For a considerable length of time we were , . without doubt , " said Mr. Rockefeller . " I can not speak with definiteness-as to the length ' of time . " He said that the manufacture of their own barrels represented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " ' That economy represented a considerable sum of money ? 2 suggested Mr. Milburn . " Oh , yes , a fine business ; a good business , " said Mr. Rockefeller . Needed More Capital . " We were constantly in need of increasing capital as our business developed , " said Mr. Rockefeller . " ' In establishing ourselves and our credit in New York we were able to procure money al lower sates than we could in the West . I am thankful to say we always had good credit . We kept our covenants and paid ; our paper , and our ability to get such ! leans and such capital was a great profit to us . Capital was of great value to us in those years . " - " We proceeded as rapidly as possible to purchase the cheapest money in the cheapest market in the world , " he said . Mr. , . niilbarn asked him if the men he brought into the Standard of Ohio at the time of its organization were capitalists . ? ' Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in us , and we could expect from them loans and financial assistance . Stillman Witt was one of the capitalists who entered the new company , he said . Amass Stone was another , and a third was T. P. Handy , the man who gave Mr. Rockefeller his start in business . They were all e'leveland men . The New Yorkers were Benjamin Brewster and a Mr. Jennings By the addition of these Men the borrowing ability of the company increased materially . Mr. Rockefeller said that New York was the principal exporting point in the old days , and that it had held its supremacy . The company began to own , its own lighterage in New York Harbor . This was another saving . No other oil comp any did ' that . He said it was their aim to provide their own radii- I ties rather than have ' others provide them . 1 The Ohio Organization . Mr. Rockefeller then told of the absorp-tion by the Standard of Ohio of several other oil firms that had been doing businas in Cleveland . One was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size to the Standard . Another was Alexander Schofield &; Co .. also large refiners . There were several others , but Mr. Rockefeller said-he could not remember them  --  about a dozen-in all . " How did the negotiations which re-sulted in the acquiring of these properties arise ? " asked Mr. Milburn . " In - the most natural way , " replied Mr. I Rockefeller . " We were Cleveland men , neighbors , acquaintances , friends , who had our property there in those days.1 We made utter failures of solicitations of capital from other large companies because of the risks in the refining business . Fears and appprehension had been aroused . In those days many schemes had been floated on small capital and large capitalization . The price of . their shares had been advanced on prospects , Many had occasion to regret the purchase Of such shares later . While my brother was at work in New ' York I was visiting other capitalists in Cleveland . I visited J. H. Wade , a neighbor of mine . He treated me kindly and politely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . " Rockefeller said that those perilous ' times in the oil business brought about the necessity of getting such capitalists as Mr. Jennings and Mr. Brewster into the company . Mr , Milburn wanted to know how the Standard of Ohio paid for the properties acquired in Cleveland . Mr. Rockefeller said that the owners received part cash and part stock . " Were any coercive measures used by you in the negotiations which resulted in the buying up of those properties ? " asked Mr. Milburn . " None whatever , " said Mr. Rockefeller , " They were fair negotiations , and I may say for myself that they were the kind of negotiations I have always made  --  no other . " Mr. Rockefeller said that the properties were bought because the Standard 's domestic trade had been growing steadily , and they wanted to extend it further . " You had faith in the business , Mr , Rockefeller ? " suggested Mr. Milburn . " Well , I did , " he replied . Q. ? Everybody did n't share it ? A.-0h , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion as to the ultimate success of the oh business . But as a rule our friends overlooked the necessity of having cash sufficient to balance the manufacturing interests . Q. ? I ask whether , looking at the business as a business , did it have unstable elements ? was hazardous . It was always considered a business of unusual risks . It was so considered then , and , ? with all the modern appliances of to-day . it is still a very hazardous undertaking . To-day it is not to be classed with such stable businesses as banking or railroad enterprises . But in 1870 many progressive steps had been made , said Mr. Rockefeller . although the refining business was in its infancy . The witness then began to tell how the smaller companies in Cleveland paid for their properties when the Standard bought them out . Most of them wanted cash , he said . I remember , one dear old man said to me ? " he began , when Mr. Milburn cut him off . As the afternoon 's session drew to a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early history of his successes in the oil business , ex-Judge John G. Milburn. who had been drawing the story of Standard Oil from Mr. Rockefeller , led him to that stage of the company 's history which related to the organization of the South Improvement Company , the concern which in 1812 stirred up such a furor of excitement among the oil men of Pennsylvania and led to legislative action . which canceled the charter of that concern . The Rebate Question . The Government 's allegation in its case against the Standard is that the South Improvement Company was started with the sole idea of obtaining a heavy rebate from the railroads on oil shipments ; that the Standard .011 men and some of the other influential oil refiners of the Pennsylvania field banded together under the head of this company , and made a contract with the then President of the Pennsylvania Railroad to ship their oil from 40 to 50 per cent , cheaper than it would ship the oil of those outside the company- . This is one of the Government 's strongest contentions . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention to it when he has Mr. Rockefeller under cross-examination . " I suppose you have heard of the South Improvement Company ? " asked - Mr . Milburn of Mr. Rockefeller , when this subject was reached . " Yes , I have heard of it , " said . Mr. Rockefeller . " What had you or your associates in the Standard Oil ' Company of Ohio to do with its origin ? " n We took a small interest of shares in that company , " replied Mr. Rockefeller . " We had , as you might say , little or nothing to do with any negotiations pertaining to it . Mr. Flagler , my brother William , and myself did not entertain the views of our friends , the refiners , over in Pennsylvania , who had the charter , and were - with Thomas A. Scott , in the belief that such an idea as was proposed was for the general settlement of some railroad troubles . " " Of what refining interest do you speak ? " asked Mr. Milburn . Of W. G. Worden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the Pennsylvania Road . " Mr. Rockefeller said that the refining interests referred to were hauling oil over Mr. Scott 's road . " Who were the active men in the South Improvement Company ? " asked Mr. Milburn . The Active Men in It . " I should say the active men in the movement were the refiners in Philadelphia and Pittsburg , " replied Mr. Rockefeller . Q. ? The leading men in the oil business at that time were yourself , your brother , and Mr. Flagler , were they not ? A. ? Yes . 0 . ? Did you negotiate that contract with the railroad ? A. ? We did not . Q. ? The gentlemen you mentioned . in Pennsylvania  --  they were in the refining business ? A. ? They were the largest in Pennsylvania and allied with Mr. Scott In the freighting scheme . 0 . ? Did you nave any faith and confidence in the practicability of such a 1 , iari ? A. ? I shared Mr. Flagler 's views that it was not a scheme which we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude you had toward it , did you come to take an interest In- the South Improvement Company ? A. ? Mr. Scott , who was then a potent factor in the Pennsylvania Road , was not to be disregarded in any means by either railroad men or shippers . ** I have mentioned were anxious te ' bring about a division of the railroad traffic . We did not wish to break with them  --  these gentlemen ? or with Mr. Scott , so we acquired an interest in the company . Q. ? Were you at any time a controlling interest . A. ? No. only a minority interest . Mr. Flagler , William Rockefeller , and I were subscribers . I do n't know to what amount , but the Standard 011 interests were in the minority . -0 . ? Do you ? ecall that ... ny stock in that company was ever issued ? A. ? I do n't have any recollection about it . I do n't remember having ever teen a share of stock . " Q. ? The scheMe failed ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe the stock was ever issued and no money was paid ; that is the best of my recollection . That is the result that Mr. Flagler and with my brother William , expected , but we deemed it better not to break with the powerful Mr Scott or the powerful refining iiiterests Mr , Mr. Rockefeller said ? that those ' who were behind the scheme thought it was a good one . " They were wild over it , " he said . " They believed they were going to reduce the cost of transporting oil and increase the profits on the sale of oil . Mr. Worden was very enthusiastic over the idea . According to them , it was a popular Idea and would benefit everybody , and the argument was that they were not seeking to make the price of oil less nor to have the railroads carry oil for nothing , but in the end to benefit the poor - refiner . But we did n't think it could be , corked out , " continued Mr. Rockefeller . " Had those Pennsylvania refiners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ? " asked Mr. Milburn . Competitors , Re Said . " None whatever , " said Mr. Rockefeller . " They were competitors . " " The South Improvement Company proi'ed very unpopular and aroused great opposition , " suggested the lawyer . " It did , " said . Mr. Rockefeller , adding : 1 " It takes our good friends ' down there in Pennsylvania  --  those who produce the oil  --  to arouse themselves over anything . 1 They show the same characteristics as iminers .. the world over . " . Mr Rockefeller will be on the witness stand to-day . when the . hearing- gods on at 10:30. o'clock .
