txt 1 Turning her back forever on the operatic stage , where she has won such signal triumphs in the past , Mme. Selma Kronold , the noted prima donna , has taken up her abode in a little cottage at the very gates of the Convent of the Sacred Heart on Convent Hill and fixed her heart on the austere life of a religieuse . To all but the most intimate friends of Mnie . Kronold , the announcement will come as a complete surprise . To the latter it has been ' known that the prima donna , though a Jewess by birth , has had since her early youth strong leanings toward the Roman Catholic Church . Her friends say that even on the stage she would have with her her rosary and Prayer Book . It was not until about two years ago , however , according to her friends , that Mme. Kronold openly renounced the faith of her fathers and became a member of the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius de Loyola , at Eighty-fourth Street and Park Avenue , This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having divorced her husband , Jan Koert , the Dutch violinist after ten years of married life . Early last Spring she first went to live in the little cottage on Convent Hill . It was generally believed among her friends that she had fixed her choice ' on the Convent of the Sacred Heart . Mme. Kronold took part in a retreat conducted at the convent during the Summer , and in which altogether 120 women spent five days in meditation and absolute silence . Since then the former prima donna has been living quietly in the cottage just beyond the walls of the convent . The windows of her little room , as austere in its I appointments as the cell of a nun , look out upon the convent grounds , with its ancient trees and its gray walls . Though bound by po religious vows , her life has been regulated almost entirely by the same rigid rules that guide the inmates of the convent . When a reporter for Tun Nsw YORK TiNI-ES called at the little cottage on Convent Hill last evening , Mme. Kronold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her custom , she was dressed entirely in black . " We live on sacred ground here , " she said with a smile as she returned to the house , " and the temptation to attend the ' little convent chapel : has grown , so strong upon me that , I no loriger:can ' resist it . " Yes , I am done with the operatic stage forever , much - as that may surprise my friends . In my present frame of mind it would be impossible for me to pursue that ' career . Few know , It , but it is a fact , that when , I sang in opera , it involved-a. permanent struggle with ? my conscience . " I Was brought up in a Roman Catholic convent of St. Thomas in Cracow , Poland , where I was born , and the religious training I received there has clung to me all through life . Consequently I always felt more or less out of place on the operatic stage . " Stage life and sincere religious conviction do not go hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which I did not take very kindly . The result was that Many of my associates on the stage were inclined to consider me prudish , and even Proud , but that was not the case . " The highest ambition of my life now would be to renounce the world and spend the rest of my life in a convent . For certain reasons I have not as yet been in a position to realize my fervent longing for this peace that can not be found in the world , but I still have hopes that I may be able to do so . It would not be correct to state that either last Spring or at any other time in the past I had settled this matter in my , own mind sufficiently to make the promises or speak the words that Would irrevocably bind me to the life of a religieuse . " Since Mine . Kronold has not been able to realize her hopes in this direction : she has been considering other plans by which to be useful to the Church . Naturally , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents might come into good I . account . Largelylithrough her efforts , a society , composed of men and women of the Catholic faith with musical and vocal training , and belonging to the Church , has been organized , with a view of producing 1 musical dramas in costume based on BibHeal scenes and stories and on Christian legends from lives of the saints . The society , which is known as the Dramatic Oratorio Society , has some sixty active members who will take part in the productions to be given and a great number of , ' passive members who will contribute financially and otherwise to the work . The I society is under the patronage of St. Cecilia 1 and has the approval of Archbishop Farley . The members of the society are required to ' , conform in every detail to the laws of the Church and to lead devoted Christian lives , Iand its work will be directed largely by , a ' 1 spiritual director . .. , I ' Mme. Kronold said last night that ' the sole purpose of the performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both for the audience and the singers . I The first performance probably will be given some time next month . Among the productions to be presented are " Joseph in Egypt , " " Judith . " " Esther , " " Ruth , " " Hagar , " " Jeplitha 's Daughter . " " Jairus 's Daughter . " " Lud mina , " and " The Legend of St. Elizabeth . "
