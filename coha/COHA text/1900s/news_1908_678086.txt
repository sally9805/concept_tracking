The case was heard before Supreme Court Justice Ford and a jury , and a sealed verdict , to be opened this morning , was ordered . According to the separation agreement , which is dated Nov. 14 , 1906 , Senator Platt agreed , if his wife would drop her action for divorce , to give her $25,000 down , $10,000 a year for five years , and certain valuable property , including Tioga Lodge , at Highland Mills . In consideration of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or his estate , besides agreeing not to sue him at any time in this State for a divorce . She , however , reserved the right to begin divorce proceedings against himat any time she chose in any other State , hut not on the grounds of his misconduct . Daniel De Wolf Weyer of her counsel was appointed Trustee for Mrs. Platt under the agreement . The present suit arises out of a misunderstanding between Mrs. Platt 's lawyers and ex-Justice Hatch , who was retained on behalf of Senator Platt in September , 1906 , when the settlement was arrived at . For the purposes of this action Marsh , Winslow &; Weyer assigned their claim against Senator Platt to Joseph , their managing clerk , and he brought the action . Senator and Mrs. Platt separated on Sept. 20 , 1906 . Soon after she began her suit for divorce against him through Marsh , Winslow &; Weyer . Frank H. Platt of the law firm of Boardman , O'Brien , Platt &; Littleton took charge of the case for his father . He retained Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marsh , Winslow &; Weyer , at which Justice Hatch was present . Bills amounting to between $6,000 and $7,000 for various - things , including diamonds purchased by Mrs. Platt , were discussed . Mrs. Platt wanted her husband to settle all these before she would agree to any settlement of their marital differences . Mr. Platt expressed his willingness to pay the bills for any necessaries up to tho date of their separation , Sept. 20 , 1906 , but would not agree to pay for luxuries . The necessaries amounted to about $3,600 . After this the separation proposal was discussed . When Frank Platt paid his father 's wife $25,000 he did so under the impression that this amount was to include the payment of the bills contracted by Mrs. Platt for necessaries . But Mr. Weyer said no such arrangement was made between him and Justice Hatch , and that the latter agreed that if Mr. Wever 's firm paid the bills the money so paid would be refunded to them later . Acting on this impression Mr. Weyer said he paid out $2,471 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I repudiated the verbal part of the agreement . The present suit was then begun to enforce the repayment of the sums paid out by Mr. Weyer . Albert Boardman appeared as counsel for Senator Platt yesterday . He contended that the separation agreement clearly set out that the $25,000 cash was paid for the express purpose of liquidating all outstanding accounts contracted by Mrs. Platt . In support of this contention he put Frank H. Platt on the stand. , and . the latter testified that the claim of Marsh , Winslow &; Weyer came " like a bolt from the blue " three months after he had considered the whole matter settled . He denied any knowledge of the alleged verbal agreement with Justice Hatch . Mrs. Platt , who was dressed entirely in black , except for a white feather in her hat , and who was accompanied by her daughter , Mrs. Carmody , was in court throughout the hearing of the case . She was called to the witness stand to testify as to the genuineness of the bills , on which the suit was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintiff . He told of the separation agreement , but could not say positively as to what arrangement was come to in regard to the outstanding accounts . Senator Platt was not called , age and feebleness makng it impossible to call him , as Mr. Boardman told the jury , besides which , he contended , it was not necessary . He also said that he was quite willing to stand by anything Justice Hatch had said or done , but he contended that the latter had never entered into any such arrangement as was alleged , and further that he had not authority to do so .
