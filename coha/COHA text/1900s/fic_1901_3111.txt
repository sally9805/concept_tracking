RUSSELL University Press John Wilson and Son Cambridge , U.S.A. **71;1002;TOOLONG THE ROSE OF DAWN A TALE OF THE SOUTH SEA Somnolent , vast , inert , the darkness lay Waiting for dawn . Across the ocean stirred A luminous haze , not light , but whispering light , So softly yet , the islands had not heard . The mystery of sleep was in the trees And on the weary stars . A little cry That broke the silence seemed a sacrilege . Then thro ' the palm trees glided like a ghost A dusky form ; the curtain of the dark Was rent with life , the forest brought forth men . Instinct with morning every eye was bright , Tho ' sleep so lately lay across their lids . No sinister intent had called them forth Upon the shadows . May held out her hands , And all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bonita played ,  --  Strong shining fish below the mid sea waves . Upon the beach beneath the paling moon The boats were launched . Amid the busy stir One man stood idle ; as a chief might order , He bade the youths prepare his long canoe . With folded arms he gravely watched the rest And gave them salutation haughtily . Uhila1 was he called , and in his veins There ran a slender stream of northern blood . He bore upon his old and indolent heart , Scarred with the sins of war , a white device . Taka , daughter of chiefs and Fiji 's pride , Lily of maidens , was betrothed to him ; Desirous eyes kinged him with envy 's crown . Footnote 1 : The lightning . Scraping across the beach the boats were launched , And as they touched the waves , they seemed to take New shape and dignity with that caress Of little lapping ripples round the prow . Uhila led the fleet as one who knew His right by reason of his age and skill . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach her snowy breast Veined with the purple brooks that sought the sea . Uhila watched it fade below the blue , Crouched in the bow , his grizzled chin in hand , Taking his ease , while small Kuma , keen-eyed , Famed for his daring , paddled lustily . The dawn had not yet broken , and the soft Beautiful haze that veils the birth of day Hung on the water . Loath to break the peace , Men gave their orders in hushed tones , the clean Chill of the morning wrapt their naked bodies . Then , as a slow blush mounts the cheek , a light Breathed from the sea , and all the air seemed warm As at the touch of spring , a violet streak , A pale leaf green , a golden , and a rose Broke in the sky , and morning was revealed . With a shrill cry , young Kuma raised his hand And pointed where with dip and shriek and wheel A flock of sea birds hovered ; all the rest Echoed the call and bending to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gained . Uhila grasped his rod , and at the stern Tossed out the shining hook , with laugh and cheer A glint of silver flashed , then all the air Was gemmed with streaming stars . They came from deeps ; From azure fairer than its mother sky Clouded with dazzling whitenesses of foam . Luck to their fishing : Now , fair and remote A scattered emerald from a broken chain Lying below the bending breast of heaven , The village had awakened ,  - -  once again Serene Kambara , island of the south , Exhaled its light upon the light of heaven . The verdure seemed to shine with lucent green , The red hibiscus burned with inward flame , And in the village happy song and shout Proclaimed the day was fair . Blue upon blue The bright waves glittered like a shattered star Set in the silver crescent of the sand . The palm trees ' plume uplifted dauntlessly To call the morning . At the forest 's brim The day was made alive by human flowers , Sweet maidens who against the emerald Showed warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the tropic sea Burned on their eyes and called them to its heart . Like eager sea birds they forgot the land , And , happy as the amorous waves , they gave Their slim brown bodies to the sea 's embrace . They found them driftwood and astride they leapt The feathered breakers , one with daring skill Curved her sweet length to lie within the palm Of a strong wave , and so was brought to shore . " Taka , " they cried , " has beaten us ; " and all , Shaking the bright drops from their shining hair , With laugh and song sprang to the beach again , Sunning themselves to languor ere they made Their pretty toilet . Some had gathered flowers In fragrant wreaths , and others brought the grave Work of the morning . Yet because the wine --  Sun of the South -- gilds even toil , it seemed A poet 's pastime . Scarlet beans they threaded Later to lie about some golden throat . Deftly they wove fine mats , and deftly twisted Bright witchery to adorn themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearled the air . Hush ! it is Taka singing :  --  " Far away In a fountain dwelt a maiden ; When the silver moon was high She was glad , but heavy laden Was she when its light must die . Far away . " Far away Came a stranger brave to love her , Loved her when the moon was high ; When the moon was pale above her Love grew pale and like to die Far away . " Far away From the fountain 's mist he drew her Happy while the moon was high , Waning , fled she , her pursuer Held her back , and saw her die Far away . " " ' T is a sad song for morning , " cried the maids --  " And for a bride . Come , Hopa , sing of laughter . " Hopa sang :  --  " Little brown streams , Slim as my fingers , Running and laughing While the light lingers , Have you no dreams , Little brown streams ? " Little brown maidens , Laughing and weeping , Singing and dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Little brown maidens ? " Afar there sounded in the mellow breeze The rhythmic movement of the maidens ' toil ; Before them on the sand a snowy sheet Lay spread ,  - -  the tapa cloth ; tutunga trees Yield them their inner bark , and lightly then The maidens tap the fibres till they join , Made firm with scented gums and bright with dyes , To form a fabric that a bride might choose , And this was for a bride . Among the rest One maiden shone ; a moon beside her stars , Taka , the fair . Her father was the chief Of this small village . His the splendid store Of kava bowls for which the isle is famed , The shining fish-hooks , fairest of mother of pearl , Great mats from ancient days with border rare Of crimson feathers , cruel tragic spears , Sweet unguents , necklaces of pearly shells Envied by maidens , and above them all Bales of the snowy tapa , made by hands Subtle , wise hands of women , over whom The earth had long laid flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale Droned by old men at twilight , future days Pleasantly certain as the next repast , Where gods and goddesses appear as birds , Trees , plants or moonlight , gently rising tide , And shining girdle of leaves ,  - -  all homely things , Which hold the people 's hearts.  - -  In this fair land Taka was born . Thro ' sixteen years of moon And tropic sun she blossomed in the air . Chilled by no frost , the world unconsciously Mirrored her sweetness back to her . The sun Had kissed her skin to a warm topaz ; rare As dusky wealth of Autumn , her sweet breast , Gleaming and bare , was hung with ropes of flowers Yellow and white , and in her curling hair Glimmered the pure gardenia . All the braves Wished her for wife , but old Akau the chief , Knowing Uhila 's prowess and the blood Left by an English forbear in his veins , Knowing that Taka too could boast , or mourn , A foreign ancestry , had lately pledged His daughter to this brave , and now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm sea the maidens paid their court To Taka , who so soon would leave their gay Indifferent frolic lives to wed the grave Stern chief . She did not falter at the choice . Love which the maidens sang was but a word ; She wished no better fate than to be mated To a strong warrior whom her heart held dear As friend to kind Akau . So she waited . In her slim hands she held a polished cup , The shell of cocoanut , which caught the light Like a brown pool . The toil of many days Had turned the tawny shade to warmest black In gradual depths as shaded Taka 's cheek ; With perfumed oil her fingers gave caress And waked the hidden pictures in the grain , The yellow sand , the dusky amber girl , The brown perfected in the shining globe . Earth 's monotones are justified in this . Close to her lolled small Hopa , blithe and gay As a young cricket , teasing all the rest With her sharp wit ; often she dropped her work --  The threading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suddenly She called , " A sail , a little sail , " and all Followed her pointing fingers . Far away , Tossed like a feather , black against the sky , Hovered a tiny craft , its unknown lines Marked it as stranger , and the maidens all Curiously watched its coming to the shore . All night the little shell with ceaseless dip And pause , and rise and dip again , had borne The trackless trade winds . Tui Tua Kau , " King of the Reefs , " had ventured over far From Tonga 's shore . Caught by a wanton gale , His idle racing , lengthened in a whim To cheat his laughing mates , grew a wild flight . The frail canoe seemed , on the angry sea , A sweet rose petal blown across the night . Yet wisely now the winds had mind to crown Their joyous undertaking , and upon The shores of Fiji 's isles they drew their prize . The maidens on the shore had seen afar The stranger 's coming , and the songs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come to claim his kingdom , lone , In a frail craft , with weary eyes , and hair Crowned with a fading wreath , more beautiful Than all their lovers , slender , strong and young . With one lithe spring he gained the yellow sand And caught the boat and drew it with a swing High on the beach ,  - -  its movement seemed alive . His sinewy fingers loosed the flapping sail , Gay shells clinked musical against the mast , And all the maidens , timorous as birds , Laughed at the sound with shy averted face . Then straight and slender as the cocoa palm , Straight as its shaft and crowned with shining hair , The stranger lifted up his head . The wreath , Faded yet still alive thro ' ocean 's breath , Drooped o'er his brows . His flashing sun-bright eyes Struck thro ' the group of girls as shoots a dart , And caught and quivered in sweet Taka 's breast . More noble than the rest , she scorned to fear , And graceful in her modesty she faltered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erect she faced him , o'er her brow the frail Curves of the crest she wore , antennae-wise , Trembled a little . As a maid beseems , Her eyes drooped from his gaze , yet not too soon To miss the gleam with which he caught the first Flash of her beauty . With that glance he gained --  Half conscious of a gladness -- that this maid Was still for winning . As the custom is Her hair fell in twin braids , and were she wed They had been sacrificed to that estate . Maiden she was , his eyes caressed the sign Black o'er the topaz beauty of her breast . The stranger spoke . " Malua am I called ; I hold for title Tui Tua Kau . Over the violent seas , beneath the frown , Cold and untoward , of a starless sky , The waves of chance have borne me ; thro ' the night Around me and above the pitiless trades Were blind with darkness , blown like maiden 's hair Across my face . As palm trees beaten by wind , The tortured breakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life seemed dead --  Then -- morning broke , and I behold the sun ! "  --  He held her with his gaze and found her eyes --  " On Tonga 's shore I reigned a chief , and now I am a beggar at your mercy . " Then The young pride mounting to his cheek , he cried , " Nay , but I jested , for I come so far To green Kambara for a lordly bowl Fit for the kava of a chief . " She smiled , And with the smile Malua felt the blood Leap in his heart , his heart inviolate Never before so stirred ' neath woman 's eyes . " Come , then , with me , " said Taka , and the beach Stretched from their feet , a ribbon that should bind In its white length the heaven to the earth . With delicate step she led him to the hut Where old Akau gave him kindly greeting . A little in the shadow , where the gourds And strange sweet herbs -- soft musty fragrances --  Hung swinging from the beams about her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , lightly folded on her golden breast , Her two hands lay like flowers . In the light Bright as a sun god sat Malua listening With greatest reverence to the aged man , Who spoke to him of ancient , long dead things While he displayed his wealth of burnished cups Out of the splendid eld . " My son , " he said , " Yours is dim future , mine the deathless past ; Heroes have died for me and yet shall die , And all the glory of the virgin earth Yields up its sweets to me , for now I rest And stretch my withered sinews in the sun And wait for peaceful death ; because your lips Are innocent , and dawn is in your eyes , I give you of my store the fairest treasure . After my Taka , you have won my heart . " In his strong hand he laid a bowl ; for this The ages had paid toll , soft lightnings shone From its brown glory , carved most royally . He raised the kava bowl aloft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a spear Shivered the dusk where Taka stood . The light Lay on her swelling throat , and showed her eyes Starred like a tropic night . The stranger 's hand Trembled a little , and his quick-drawn breath Carried a message from his breast to hers . They left the hut together . From the clear Bright heat of noon they turned , and took their way Into the greenly silent forest . Leaves Flickered above wet blossoms , simple sounds Of homely labor borne upon the breeze Made them the more alone . They spoke of Love , A mighty word to ease the strange new pain Born in their hearts . Sudden the path grew wide --  A little space deprived of flowers and life --  " The house of sandal wood , " said Taka , pointing , And there , the last home of a chief , it lay . White shells and snowy pebbles girt him round In his great mould of clay , and all his spears And clubs of war kept vigil , showing still His might in battle . Shrill the parrot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw their shadows from the place Sacred to death , the violent crime of war . A little shadow darkened Taka 's heart , Could this sweet world contain both death and love ? She sought Malua 's eyes to be assured That love lives always . He had gone before To hold the leaves for her to pass , and softly She came , and like a golden butterfly Her small hand fluttered down upon his arm . He caught his breath as tho ' the leaping blood That fled before this touch were very flame , Then slowly , slowly turned , and in her eyes Gave up his heart 's desire . No word was said . She knew not that she loved , he only knew She was the moon of women ; but their hearts , Wiser than they , had flowered into one . Then as she passed beneath the swinging leaves , He caught the wreath wherewith on Tonga 's shore The maids had crowned him " King of Love and Beauty , " And cast it from him with a high disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed to see it , and her step was light Along the flowery way . Love in this land Grows into perfect stature as the swift Sweet growth of nature . In these gracious souls Love stood full-armed , godlike , from birth . Their lips Whispered of life and laughter , but their hearts , Singing together , told each other clear : " Ah , Love , dear Love , there is no need to say , Catch up life 's song , its lightest , merriest word , Pledge deep the golden sun , the breeze and bird , Draw down long lashes over happy eyes , That none may guess the light that in them lies , Nor with what secret smile your lips are stirred . The moonlight is so short , so long the day , Nay , Love , dear Love , there is no need to say . " The whole world laughed with flowers overhead , The sky a hollow sapphire ached with blue , The green bright sea gave jewels to the sun , And all the air was love that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst Two radiant gods with brave , wide eyes , and hair Crowned with the beatific spring , they stood ,  --  Taka , the fair , and young Malua , fierce , Passionate-hearted youth , and passionate youth ; Faltering before her innocent gaze , he cried , " Dare I adore ? " so crystal clear she seemed A silver dewdrop in the rose of dawn . And Taka , trembling : " How can he be mine , So strong , so fair , a god with heart of flame ! " And so they strove against their hearts and lived Long lives of hope and fear and love 's sweet pain Within a heart-beat . But the time was near ! There in mid-forest , rimmed with leaves jade green , All singing in the sun ,  - -  as deep and brown As Taka 's eyes ,  - -  the pool disclosed itself . Across the clear light of the morning , showers Of fiery jewels shone against the trees ,  --  Rubies , bright sapphires , purple amethyst , Topaz , fierce opal , grass-green emeralds Flitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird or bird made flower , they seemed To eyes newborn upon a world of love . The air was heavy with strange scents , the old Familiar perfumes seemed so rarely sweet , The jasmine was the very breath of love . And when they rested on a flowery bank , And Taka wove the red hibiscus wreath To crown Malua , as he gazed at her , Stretched at her feet , his chin upon his hand , The whole long world had waited but for this . ( Weaving the rosy wreath . ) " My dream was of thee at sunrise With light steps over the sea . Lonely upon the mountain , I woke from my sleep for thee . " ( Weaving the rosy wreath . ) " The wild dark rocks were round me , The flowery maids were gone ; I woke , thou -- bright as lightning Beside me -- waited the dawn . " Weaving the rosy wreath , I weave my life in a dream . Thou camest through dawn on the sea , Red flower on a sunlit stream . " ( Weaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his hair . " My King , " she whispered , and Malua 's eyes --  Boy , spite of all his battles -- filled with tears Wrung from his burdened heart . He caught her hand ; The lake was hushed with noon-tide , far away A fond bird starred the forest with a cry . Then Taka turned , and in her eyes a light --  The light of summer moon in water still --  And in her face the glamour of moon and star , On which the crimson petals of her lips Lay trembling , eager wings to her new soul , Love was confessed . The day went swiftly on . Malua left her side to gather fruits For a love feast together . In a dream His heart had moved , and like a child he longed To prove it real by sweet familiar ways , Serving his fairest lady while their laughter Fell on the air like music . Taka , waiting On the green bank his coming , told her heart : " Not for his beauty only , tho ' his eyes Burn into mine more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arm Which broke a great branch that would stay my path , Not for his voice , a murmur of soft seas , Nor all the gracious ways he knows so well , Not for his love that breaks within his eyes ,  --  All these are dear , are dearer than my life , But for himself I love him , " Taka dreamed . " To be his sister , nay , his mother then , To welcome him from hunting with my eyes , To fight his battles with the other women , To triumph in his triumphs , yet perchance Be happier if when vanquished he would come Safe in my arms for shelter . If I might But suffer for his sake and see him stand Stronger and happier -- he should never guess --  But I might sometimes touch his hair and know The curls that clung around my fingers mine , Bought by my pain as he , Malua , mine . Just so the heaven belongs to each small star Fixed by its gracious power eternally . " Thro ' the late afternoon Uhila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand Opened , relaxed and empty , and her eyes Closed to the ardent sun . The village slept , Waiting for evening 's cool . Uhila came ; Over his shoulder like a silver shroud He brought the gleaming fish . The purple shadows Lay in soft pools about the palms ; the leaves , Listless as weary love , hung motionless , And the hot green gave color to the air , The world viewed through an emerald . He came , And to Akau 's hut he brought his gift , A mighty fish to grace the wedding feast . And where was Taka ? All the gorgeous day She had been absent , old Akau told ; And of the stranger , wanderer , with eyes Lit by the fires of youth , Akau told , Like a glad wind of morning bearing spring , Spring with the heart of summer , and his brow Crowned with the calm white flowers of innocence . Uhila knew , in days long past he too Had wandered thro ' the forest in the glory And glow of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool . His heart was stirred With turbulent emotions . She was his ,  --  Taka was his , the blossom that should cheer The winter of his age . His springing step Was stealthy as a tiger 's , and the way Was clear before him . Rightly was he named The lightning ; keen and cruel he would flash Into this sky of love , death in his hand . The path was strewn with little crimson flowers Scarlet festooned the trees , or was it blood That danced within his eyes ? His thoughts were vague : Death , mercy , love , but strongest was desire Merely to see and satisfy his fear . Sudden he saw them , and he hid his eyes Before the sight , then strained to see again Taka , her arms piled high with blossoms , stood , An amber goddess of spring with flying hair Beneath a flower-bent branch , whose leaves had caught One of her sun-kissed curls . Malua watched her . Laughing , she would have torn away the tress And with the effort all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with a low cry he withheld her hand , And standing where she needs must turn to see His two arms o'er her slender shoulder laid , With fingers little used to gentler arts His timid touch unloosed her perfumed hair , Too near -- for aught but that her curving throat Should be upturned to meet his sure caress , And all the blossoms drifted thro ' the air And fell like blessings on their bended heads . Uhila bore no more ; his heart was great With unshed tears ; their beauty and their love Touched like soft music on his injured soul With infinite sadness and a hopeless calm . He left them there and sought the forest shades To search his heart . A great nobility Slept in his native breast , and those pale drops Of northern blood had taught him self-control And might of mercy . To and fro he paced , Learning his lesson . Taka , little moon Sent by the gods to light his loneliness , Was his no longer . He must twist his heart , Wried with grim pain , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uhila should be great , Giving her to Malua as a gift , Showing Akau how he wished no more To wed so young a maid , and then the tears Broke from his eyes and burned his throbbing breast . Homeward he turned , and all the sleepy birds Twittered good-night -- and almost was he glad . In the cool green of evening , silent now Save for their beating hearts , the lovers came Back to the village . In the stranger 's honor The people made a feast . The air was filled With busy sounds of preparation . Some Brought driftwood for the fires , some gathered flowers To deck themselves , and all the fruitful earth Was robbed of its delights for beauty 's sake . Before the feasting Chief Akau rose , Grave and majestic , for the evening prayer ; Pouring libation from the kava bowl In a deep silence , to the gods he cried , " Take of our offering , O you mighty gods , Look on this people kindly , let them prosper In health and increase . Let the fecund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you well . Take of our offering , O you gods of war , Let men be brave and triumph in your name . Take of our offering , O you gods of sea , Spare us your wrath , and in your might depart Along the ocean to some far off shore . Take of our offering , all you mighty gods . " The feasting ended , round the fires they gathered , Wise aged men telling anew their tales Of youth , sweet purposeless youth which dreams of stars The while it gathers weeds -- of battles dire . Their thin cold blood warmed with grim memories Of gods they told , of goddesses with hair Streaming across the sunset , and of dear Women long dead , and then the maidens came , Singing their little songs . One sang of love : " The breath of spring is in his hair , He needs no crimson necklaces To win the favor of the fair . " The full moon leaned to kiss his eyes , The fairies brought him purple flowers , The flowers of love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdain , His heart strikes silver lightning , Their warm tears stir the flowers like rain . " The breath of love is in his hair , He needs no crimson necklaces To win the fairest of the fair . " Another sang of the sad mothers , lone In their dark homes at evening , while beyond The limitless twilight on some field of war Their hearts lie dead . " O my men , my men ! Keen in the rain and sunshine For glorious splendid deeds , You are gathered as idle weeds . " O my men , my men ! The mighty gods were jealous , Your virtues shone like a star ; The enemy came from afar ! " O my men , my men ! Vengeance shall follow soon , Your people shall blast the foe Or ever the cold winds blow . " O my men , my men ! My life is an empty shell , No one has heard my moan , I sit in the dark alone . " Then of the gods they sang ,  - -  a moonlight song : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , Reeds of the water-ways sway not , Sleep , that the gods may pass . " Deepen , you dreams of the sleepers , Veil you , O fire of the moon . Darken , you silver of stars , Sleep , for the gods come soon . " Sleep , for the gods who sleep not Pass on the midnight 's breath ; Mystical , magical , secret , Sleep , for to wake is death . " And after singing came the dance ; the brown Lithe women decked with bright fantastic hues Wavered into the circle of the light . Kneeling , they wove their spells . As gracious flowers Swayed by the winds of evening , they were blown By breezes of desire . The eye was filled With luxury of soft motion and the sound Of soft monotonous chanting charmed the ear . Then in their midst came Taka , and she stood , Waiting the signal . Slow she raised her arms , Slow as tho ' ages hung upon her hands Heavy with burdened love . The music hushed . Deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and then Laughter and light came dancing from her smile . Her fingers fluttered on the harp of love , And every chord uttered itself again Within some dusky heart . The earth was still . The warm night air was strong with heavy scent Of oil upon the dancers and the flowers That decked their breasts and hair . Malua 's soul Fainted beneath the load of so much love , And when the dance was finished , and her eyes Held him for one long second ere she smiled And stole away , he knew for death or life His spirit lay within her golden hands . Woe for Uhila ! As the twilight glow Faded in soft immeasurable plains Of darkness , so the beauty in his heart Faded in clouds of wrath . The great fire blazed --  A ruby in the raven hair of night --  And clear across the flames Uhila saw His rival , garlanded with blossoms , pale , Calm as a happy lover . Could he smile Over his empty hands and meekly bow --  Uhila bow !  - -  to taste a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurled the flames . Like blood the fire fell o'er the bare young heart , And he who watched in one mad bound foresaw How blood indeed might flash across that breast . The high resolve grew dim in that fierce light , " ' T is noble , strong ; " then , in a stab of keen Humor , he saw again a native brave Decking his naked body with the coat Crowned with the hat of some sea-faring man ,  --  Aping the civilization of his stride Till his new prowess fell to comrade 's jeers . So with a tiger heart it were to wear A grave forgiveness of this wanton wrong . The primal lust had burst the slender bar , Weak white man 's morals . Now to slay and slay . Darkling , he fixed Malua with his eyes , Noting each shadow of his changing thoughts , When the dear dreams centred on Taka , dreams Dimming his sight . Holding his lips apart , He slowly rose , Uhila following , For in the dark the music of her face Smote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the firelight ; silently He rose and stole away . The night was still , And " Taka , Taka , Taka , " rang his soul Against the stars . He felt infinity Above him brood , and knew the mighty gods , Who once in every lifetime drop an hour Of their remembrance fraught with godlike bliss To luckless man , had turned on him their eyes . Unconsciously his feet retraced the path To the dark pool where joy had birth that day . The scents that wake when the cool dusk begins Lapped him luxuriously ; the heavy sweet Of passionate gardenia ,  - -  kiss made flower ,  --  White as his turbulent love , was as the crown And climax of the jasmine stars that breathed His love in placid day , and when he paused Beside the pool , the forest held its breath . " O sweet , O beautiful ! " Malua cried , His young eyes blazing to the tropic night . " Never before , since all the gods were young , Was woman loved as I love Taka . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laid his arms about a slender tree , White in the moonlight , and his fevered cheek Pressed on its cooling stem . With broken music Shaken from his breast , he cried on Taka ,  --  Little happy words that mothers whisper Above their sleeping babes . " If love could find A way to utter love without her lips ! " Her lips , her eyes , the music of her voice --  Death would be easy on her golden heart . He pictured her at twilight in the door Of their far home , with eager arms outstretched To welcome him from toil ; how she would stand A queen among the other women , crowned With crimson flowers . How had he won her , he A stranger to her people and her blood ! For in her veins the stream ran pale , but , " Ah , " He cried , " my kiss shall burn it red again . White she may be , a queen , my queen , she is , And still my slave in fetters of my love . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young he was ! as Vave , the swift-footed Splendidly strong , an innocent god of war . The morn with chilly lips laid myriad kisses About his beauty , slipped thro ' jealous leaves Dripping with silver and fantastic fingers Reached to caress him from the amorous trees . Hither and forth he paced ; Uhila 's eyes Ached with his hatred of the sight ; at length " Taka , " Malua cried , and stretched his arms Rigid in air , his face against the sky . The goad was in Uhila 's soul , he leapt Into the moonlight and upon his foe . Fixed to the ground , they strove as giant trees Tossing fierce branches in a storm ; their wrath Smote on them like a tempest , hot with hate . Malua knew a curse was in the hands That sought his throat , and in the blazing eyes Close to his own . Life would defend fair life As chief and Taka 's lover . Round the shoulders Dark and strong , straining to his heaving breast , He threw his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing with the quick Sharp catch of weary runners . Then a turn --  Raising his knee , Uhila strove in vain To throw his enemy . Upon their heads And swaying bodies lay the silver light Of the bright moon . The great night seemed to pause Chin upon hand to watch the struggle , air Hushed to retain the hoarse and laboring sobs Such strain brought forth . Their shining bodies , oiled In honor of the feast , granted no hold To the fierce gripping arms . Then suddenly Uhila sprang aside and grasped a branch , A rough , harsh weapon -- for they were unarmed . Wary they watched each other 's eyes , like beasts Stealthy , retreating , circling with heads low , Bodies bent for the catch . Malua sprang Close to Uhila , caught his murderous hand , And with the branch between them , all its thorns Tearing their breasts , they strove once more . The moon Glittered in troubled ripples , they had come Under the shadow of the trees , the dark Goaded Uhila 's soul anew , his blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil 's skill . His straining form relaxed , Heavily slipping earthward ; ere Malua Could gain fresh hold upon his fainting foe , Uhila with a twist had laid him low , Knee on his breast , lean fingers at his throat Seizing his life . Malua 's eyes grew dim , The gentle stars seen faint thro ' hanging leaves Wavered uncertainly ; his brain seemed black , Confused with horrid death , the dewy moss He lay on failed beneath him . Suddenly Hanging upon the brittle rim of death , His outstretched hand , gripping the scattered leaves , Closed on a sharp stone , instinct more than brain Showed him the way ; he raised his weapon , struck And struck and struck again . The night looked down Waning , and saw thro ' tangled boughs a still , Dead figure on the troubled earth . All stained With crimson blood , there lay a crimson wreath , And thro ' the forest stole a dusky shade Fleeing he knew not where save that he ' scaped Death , that was lying by the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the night Had cried his love and anguish to the dark , Wandering half crazed thro ' forest deeps unknown , Feeling upon his throat the hand of hate , Feeling upon his heart the still more potent Fingers of love , came to the open shore Waiting for day . The restless , eager foam , Stretching white arms around the sleeping earth , Woke his great love anew . The loneliness Of open spaces set his hungry soul Dreaming of Taka , Taka who should come And fill the empty world for him . The sky Paled at the thought . The dawn was stealing near , Glimmering faintly on the edge of night . He could delay no longer ; like a thief He must secure his jewel in the dark . In the vast pause that presages the morn He came to Taka 's door . Ajar it stood , And on the mats within he saw revealed The pure young oval of her perfect face . " Taka , my little one , " Malua whispered , And thro ' her dreams " Malua " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw him at the door and came to him , Her dewy dreams still warm within her eyes , And gave her face to passionate caress . Then with soft , broken words he told again His love , and after when her heart was full Of glad acceptance , as a flash of fire Searing his image on her soul , he told How blood had paid the price of love . She heard , And daylight ebbed before her eyes to faint White mist , then refluent turned and smote Her heart 's eyes with the horror of the truth . Uhila dead . Uhila with the smile That woke for her alone . Her thoughts , like leaves Blown by cold winds , were scattered , and the words " Uhila dead " was but a symbol grim Of darkness . All the past , her happy life Flower in the sun , her home , and all the dear Familiar duties , all her life to come Woven with thoughts of kind Uhila , all Struck to the ground by murder . In her blood The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her people and her love , till now So beautiful . Malua knew her pain , And how upon its verdict hung his life . Death 's flame had touched the golden rose of love . If it be dross or gold , the test should tell . The black gulf night that lies ' twixt dawn and dawn , Deepened by darker sin ,  - -  could frail love , tired With passion , hope to bridge the perilous way ? His brain cried , " No , " his heart , " Ah , Gods , but yes Or I shall die . " He laid a tender arm About the shrinking child and drew her forth Along the forest path . She did not hear The morning birds who blithely welcomed day , She did not see the dew upon the leaves , Glamour of dawn , but dazed with love and pain , Yielding to that she knew not , kept the way Towards the forest pool . It seemed to them , Waiting the unutterable moment of their loss Or utmost gain , as tho ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air Seemed hollow and unearthly , breathless pause On a great brink . They reached the pool , and Taka Gathered her senses till her eyes were clear As shining wells of truth . She leaned no more Helpless upon Malua , tho ' his arm Circled her still . Before them on the path , Noble and dead , with mute hands pleading , eyes Subtle with secrets of eternity , Waited Uhila . In a moment 's space Malua knew the utter pangs of death Strong as his soul . And Taka must be free , Free to decide between the mighty dead And him , the weakest of all living men . He spoke no word , the blood of youth once more Fought with the skill , the power , the eloquence Of great familiar age . If Taka drew From out his arms and love a heart-beat 's time , She had decided , and Uhila won . This the boy knew . Taka had seen him , Ah ! Her woman 's heart in pity and distress Shivered as tho ' cold death had laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep as the world , and then -- the sky , pale stars , Rose dawn , unfathomed heaven rocked in his heart With tumult of his glory . Taka turned , Drew closer in his arm , and raising up Her flowery face smiled in his eyes . ' T was done --  Death , life and passionate passion burned away In the white flame of love . Uhila lay Vanquished , forgotten . Turning to the sea , Taka , Malua , children of the sun , Went forth to meet the sunrise and the day .
