TITE man who lives in a town ending in o can never be thoroughly happy , for he never knows what he is . For example , the man from Chicago goes through life wondering whether he is a Cbicagan , a Chicagoan , a Chicago/Ilan , a Chicagitan , or a Chicagonese . Similarly the inhabitant of Subiaco may be a Subiacan or a Subiacian or something else . For purposes of convenience we will call him a Subiacan , though the chances are that he is not fairly entitled to the name . ? Subiaco is situated about fifty miles from Home . In the " good old days , " when Rome was glthy , unhealthy , and wretchedly misgoverned , nobody thought of going to Subiaco , unless he were an artist in search of the picturesque and the economical . In order to reach it one had to drive twenty-five miles to Tivoli , and to walk , or ride a donkey , the rest of the way . To-day there is a railway direct from Rome to Subiaco . It crosses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then ascends the narrow valley of the Anio , which is full of picturesque scenery , modified by tunnels . The old way of travelling was far more romantic than the new , but it was undeniably tiresome . Now that it is so easy to reach Subiaco by rail the tourist declines to go , on the plea that Subiaco is only a railway station on the way from Rome to the Adriatic . Thus it comes to pass that the town is still in a comparatively primitive state . It is not clean , and it has never heard of drainage , nor of plumbers , but it is reasonably healthy , as most towns are where fierce war has not been waged against the local microbes , and they have not been exasperated and driven to retaliatory measures , as is the case in towns where sanitary science is epidemic . It was one of the merits of the feudal system that it developed the legs of princes and people alike . The baron always set his castle on the summit of a hill , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His retainers ? ironically so called for the reason that he never allowed them to retain anything of value ? built their huts on the slope a ' the hill outside of the castle walls , where they could hope for the protection of their lord . The medieval town was therefore a town that slanted more or less abruptly , and its inhabitants were continually going up or down hill , to the great development of their calves . We sometimes wonder how knights and men-at-arms in the feudal period could have borne the weight of their armor . It was manifestly because of their constant practice in climbing their hillside streets , and thus developing and hardening their muscles . These reflections inevitably occur to the visitor to Subiaco . The town is built on the sides of a steep hill that rises abruptly from the middle of the valley . The hill is crowned by the usual castle . : Many of the streets are simply stairways , and most of the others are as steep as coal-chutes . Walk anywhere in Subiaco and you see above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . It is nearly as hard to descend the streets as it is to climb them . You need not wonder that the typical Subiacan leg is finely developed , and much affected by artists desiring model legs for pictures of Samson . . Subiaco is cold in winter , and it frequently happens that a drizzling rain is followed by a sharp frost that coats the pavements with ice . In such circumstances the Subinean who ventures out-of-doors inevitably falls down-town . If lie is near the top of Subiaco , and his feet slip from under him , he shoots down the street with tremendous velocity , mowing down any man , woman , child , or dog that may happen to be in his way . It is said that on a frosty morning most of the population of Subiaco , except those who are bedridden , accumulates at the foot of the hill , and slowly disentangling itself , sits painfully on the ground until the ice melts . An icy day in Subject , ought to afford much attraction to the tourist ; but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the holder of Cook 's tickets , and he knows only the hotels of the large cities . There is an ancient inn called La Pernice , which being interpreted means the Partridge , where the visitor to Subiaco usually stops . Whether the Italian per-nice is a real partridge or merely a quail need not be discussed here , for such a discussion would reopen the dispute between New England and Pennsylvania as to the respective identities of the two birds . La Pernice is reasonably clean , and formerly it furnished board and lodging for four francs per day . That , however , was before Italy purchased with blood and gold the costly luxury of free government . In the old days one could also obtain board et the one pension of Subiaco for two francs per day . What are the expenses of living in . Subiaco at the present time I do not know , but judging from the fact that it no longer is the summer haunt of artists , it has probably learned the art of making out hotel bills in the genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed its guests with game , and brook-trout , and figs in season , and good wine at all seasons . It boasted of a dining-room situated in the middle of the house , and furnished with a long wooden table , like an overgrown carpenter 's bench , and a dozen wooden chairs . From the dining-room multitudinous doors opened into the bedrooms , and when breakfast was in progress - uncombed heads of different sexes were frequently thrust out from these doors by anxious guests fearful lest the supply of trout should prove insufficient for belated breakfasters . Truly the table of La Pernice was a good one , and the beds were wonderful . They were apparently furnished with mattresses of wool that had been subjected to enormous hydraulic pressure until they had ac- quired the hardness of Harvcyized steel . However , by spreading the sheet on the brick floor , the visitor could secure a comparatively soft bed , for the bricks were not glazed , but were ordinary bricks , set on edge . The walls of the inn are ornamented with drawings made by successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the names of some of the painters who have thus gratuitously decorated the walls of La Pernice , but among them are those of certain persons who have gained wide celebrity since the days when , with the reckless extravagance of youth , they gave to the inn drawings that would now bring high prices in the market . It would not be a bad idea for a modern Mmcenas to buy one of the walls of the dining-room , and hang it suitably framed in his picture - gallery . No llicenas has yet thought of doing this . Subiaco was originally built by Nero , who unquestionably had an artist 's eye for the picturesque , although his ideas as to lighting the streets with incandescent martyrs were indefensible from any point of view . He placed a villa on the slopes of Subiaco , and his drinking-cup was once struck by lightning as it stood on the table , filled with Subiaean wine . Nero regarded this as a dark and inexplicable portent , instead of a peremptory summons to sign the pledge , which was undoubtedly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village grew until the barons of the middle ages came and fortified it , and collected a good-sized population of retainers . It now numbers some seven thousand inhabitants , and has been made the scene of the opening chapters of one of Mr. Marion Crawford 's best novels . Decidedly Subiaco is picturesque , both within and without . As seen in the distance , with its castle standing close against the blue sky , - and its roofs of many tints climbing the hill , it is among the most picturesque of the many picturesque hill-towns of Italy . When one penetrates the town , with its steep and narrow streets filled with handsome women , and sturdy men , and prosperous cats , it appeals forcibly to the love for the medieval and unscrubbed , which characterizes the romantic mind . The male Subiacan exists by selling boots and shoes . Or , rather , he seems to exist by manifesting a willingness to sell them . The number of boot and shoe shops in Suhiaco seems to be altogether out of proportion to the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any sort , except in winter . How the boot-sellers can make a living in these circumstances does not seem clear . People who believe that the ancient Israelites grew rich by selling second-hand clothing to one another may perhaps be able to solve this perplexing problem . From the valley of the Anio branch out other valleys , still more narrow , and if possible more picturesque . Especially beautiful is the valley of The " Holy Place , " in which are the Benedictine monasteries , of which Santo Scolastica is the most important . Part way up the precipitous side of the valley is the cavein which St. Benedict lived at the beginning of his saintly career . This cave was hid from every human being , except a priest , who daily brought Benedict a loaf of bread , which he let down to him by a cord from the top of the hill . Occasionally the cord was cut , just as the saint was about to grasp the loaf , and the priest always said that the devil had cut it . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocked around him . The number grew so rapidly that half a dozen or more monasteries were built near the cave , and were later united in a Standard Benedictine Trust , of which St. Benedict was the head . At least three of these monasteries still survive , and are duly visited by every foreigner who goes to Suhiaco . Beyond a doubt Benedict was a deserving saint , and his followers were , at . least for a time , worthy of him . All the world knows that the Benedictines did much for scholarship during a period when men , outside of monasteries . considered fighting to be the chief end of man . A visit to the cradle of the Benedictine Order ought to be interesting , even to the most determined Protestant . St. Benedict 's cave is carefully preserved , although there is reason to think that it has been enlarged and fitted with certain modern improvements since his time . Outside of the mouth of the cave is a tangle of thorns and rose-trees , among which the saint was accustomed to throw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least this is the . usual explanation of his fondness for sleeping on thorns , but . another possible explanation is that he had tried the beds of La Pernice , and longed for something softer and more comfortable . Going up to the cave one day T overtook a British matron . She was a large blue matron , with yellow trimmings , and as she sat on her donkey close to a background of vivid green , she was a study in colors . Near to her stood her guide , with despair written on his more or less ' honest face . It was just at the foot of a steep ascent where the visitor to the monasteries must dismount from his donkey , and make the rest of the ascent with his personal legs . As I came within hearing the matron was saying , in the most decided tones : " i will not dismount . The ideyab ! I hired this donkey to take me to Santa Scolastica , and I shall sit here till you make him move on . " I passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affairs of a determined British matron . Three hours later , as I descended the hill , I found the matron still sitting on her donkey , in the same place where I had left her . The donkey was browsing contentedly : the guide was sleeping , utterly exhausted , and the matron 's face wore the expression of one who is determined to die rather than to yield . I have often wondered what was the fate of the three . Is the matron still sitting on the donkey , and is the guide still sleeping , after the excessive manner of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus ! Or did Sl . Benedict work a fresh miracle , and make the matron reasonable , as well as determined ? The influence of St. Benedict . and his monks still survives in Subiaco . Atleast Subiaco is still religious , and it is only fair to give credit for this fact to its long association with holy men . Since the government took possession of the monasteries the monks have been for the most part dispersed . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to keep them from falling into decay . In the town of Subiaco monks are painfully scarce , and where once every funeral was attended by at least two hundred monks , to-day only a dozen or so can be gathered together . I had the opportunity of seeing the funeral of a leading Subiacan boot-seller , and without doubt the funeral procession was an imposing one . At its head marched fourteen Capuchins , bearing torches and chanting psalms . They walked two by two , with an interval of at least fifteen feet between each successive pair . Evidently this was done in order to increase the apparent length of the procession ; but it was not the only way in which the managers of the funeral contrived to multiply a handful of monks into a large and impressive number . As the procession passed through the little market-place in which I stood , it turned into a side street , and presently the monks at its head were out of sight . Slowly the priests . the bier , and the friends of the deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanting was heard , and another fourteen Capuchins brought up the rear . Now I may have been mistaken , but feel nearly certain that the monks at the end of the procession were the identical monks who had also marched at its head . There was one fat monk , whom I am sure that I recognized , who , on his second appearance , was much out of breath , as a fat monk must he who runs rapidly round the block and then tries to sing . Did those monks , after leading the procession through the market-place , run through the side streets , and take up a new position at the end of the procession ? Some day , when figs are in season , and trout are complaisant , I hope to go back to Subiaco , and take a full census of the local Capuchins . In nu other way can I ever know precisely how many monks there were in that funeral procession .                    @
