txt There Will Be No War , Says Senator Depew  --  Ex-Secretary Shaw Refers to Need of Currency Legislation . Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans , Corn/Zander in Chief of the Atlantic fleet , who at the head of the greatest aggregation of first-class battleships ever assembled under a single American command is soon to start on the voyage to the Pacific . was the guest of the Lotos Club at a farewell dinner last evening . The occasion was in the nature of an ovation for " Fighting Bob , " who , when the diners finally gave him a chance to say a tew words , praised his men and his ships , declaring that no matter where they went , they were sure to give a good account of themselves , in frolic or in fight . The dinner was one of the largest ever given by the Lotos Club , and there was not a vacant seat in the banqueting hall when President Lawrence rapped for order . As is always the case when the Lotus Club gives dinners to famous men , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre was a picture of the Admiral , with just above it a picture of the old sloop of war Powhatan , on which Admiral Evans began his career as an officer of the American Navy . In the upper right hand corner was a reproduction of a painting representing the battle of Santiago , In which engagement , as a Captain , Admiral Evans commanded the battleship Iowa . In the centre of the card was a. splendid figure of victory leading the Atlantic fleet to sea . At the guest table with Admiral Evans were Rear Admiral Joseph B. Coghlan , U. S. N. , retired ; Bishop Henry Codman Potter , Capt . R. R. Ingersoll , Chief of Staff to Admiral Evans ; Col. Hugh L. Scott , U. S. A. , the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point ; ex-Mayor Seth Low , ex-Secretary of the Treasury Leslie M. Shaw , Senator Chauncey M. Depew , the Rev. Dr. James M. Buckley , and Commander Chandler , U. S. N. President Lawrence , in introducing Admiral Evans , said in part : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the bravest and most accomplished officers of the American Navy . Seldom has our navy been under fire during the past forty years without his taking part in the conflict . He was not at Manila because he was at Santiago , but had there been an Isthmian Canal ha might have contrived to be at both . We welcome him here with open arms . We Trish . tux him and , all the officers and men of Jilts great fleet a glorious and a prosperous ' voyage , a hearty welcome wherever they go , ' and a happy and sate return . Cheer Upon Cheer for Fighting Bob . As Admiral Evans rose to respond , the diners broke into cheers , and it was some time before the Admiral could say a word . Finally he managed to say " My friends . " ' whereupon the crowd started to sing " For he 's a jolly good fellow , " and then , . as the Admiral started a : third time to begin his speech a lusty diner shouted for three cheers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much waving of his hands managed to get a start . " Of course , you all know full well , " he said , " that speaking is not in my line of business , and if ever I had an idea that I could make a speech , I would only have to take a glance around this table and realize my mistake . And also permit me to say that I know that I am here , not because I am ' Bob ' Evans , but because I am a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy. - When the Admiral spoke of not being present because he was " Bob " Evans the diners arose in their seats and thundered at him the information that he was certainly wrong . - You are here because you are ' Fighting Bob ! ' " shouted an enthusiastic diner , and everybody shouted an assent to the statement . In the navy . " resumed Admiral Evans when the applause ceased . " we are not much different from all the rest of you , except possibly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . In the navy we have something back of us , and that is Uncle Sam . Permit me to say that in this hall to-night there are many of you who perhaps do not know how it feels to have 75,000.000 Americans behind you . It is a grand sensation , and that sensation has been mine on one or two occasions , and then it is that you feel anxious to do something disturbing . , We of the navy delight to please our ; employers . We like to do our work in a clean sort of fashion . I may add that in : the past forty-seven years we have done some very clean work , and our ability to repeat that clean work is not expended . yet . ' Answers for Skips in Fight or Frolics " My friends , or course you realize that it is very difficult to make a. speech when the regulations prohibit an officer - from talking about the only thing he knows anything about " However much has appeared " in the publics press and statements have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be out of place for me to say is. few words about what has appeared in the newspapers . . " This fleet of sixteen battleships , six torpedo boat destroyers , and about half a dozen auxiliaries , will sail from Hampton Reads on Dec. 16 . I do not think any one wants to stop us , and they could not they wanted to . I know the men who are under my command , and I know what our ship can do , and I think it will always be the case that they give a good account of themselves , whether it be a fight or a frolic . Japanese Would Welcome Them . It is a great pleasure to me to take this fleet into the Pacific , and it would be just as great a pleasure to take it to ' Yokohama . I know the Japanese people . I have lived among them , and I know that they would give us a royal welcome . We do n't fear flower bombardments , nor do we fear the dog shows , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I shall tell you a few things about your fleet , for it belongs to you . Several years ago , when I took command , the fleet was at target practice , and the results of that practice were considered fairly good , when compared to the records of other navies . In the target practice just ended the records excelled those of all other navies . I do n't ask you to believe what I am about to say , but I am te.iling the truth . ' We have just concluded in Massachusetts Bay a target practice , the first of the kind we ever had . In that practice we used a moving target , 30 feet high and SO feet long , moored in an open sea . The ships opened fire on these targets exactly as would be the case in battle , and some of the results were really startling . The Connecticut . for instance , got within range at the third shot , when at a distance of 8.600 yards , and in 2 minutes and 15 seconds the screen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen was examined it was found . that four .12-inch , nine 8-inch , and seventeen ' 7-inch shells had gone through it , ** pimply means that a battleship placed as was that target would have been cut in two in 21h minutes . You can imagine what would have happened in ten minutes . " For . night practice - we . used targets representing three torpedo boats approaching the fleet . I swill tell you that in the fleet there was not a ship that did not make enough hits to sink every one of those supposed torpedo boats . . ? " In conclusion ? I thank you for your kindness , and when we are on our way I hope that we will not be forgotten . " Bishop Potter , who follotvd Admiral Evans , told the Admiral that , the people who rejoice in peace were glad to know that wherever the fleet went the ships would be to oppressed people an emblem of good will on the part of the American Nation . Shaw For Merchant Marine . After Bishop Potter , ex-Secretary Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy , " he said . " but I was much interested in what the Admiral told us about that target practice , for I once upon a time had a superior who said that a navy is no good unless it hits . ' I am glad to know that we have one that hits . ' The fact that the world knows that we have such a navy is the surest guarantee of peace . However , I regret that we have no colliers or transports - or powder factories , and that we have to depend upon foreign flags to coal our ships . If this voyage were not one of peace , who would haul our coal ? " It costs $1.40 per capita in this country to support our navy ; and I am one of those who , after hearing Admiral Evans 's talk , think that the navy is worth that $1.40 . In the Spanish war Congress unanimously Voted $50,000,000 , to be spent as the President saw fit . That $50,000,000 would build a merchant marine that would support our navy anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is also needed some sober common sense and real statesmanship . " Several years ago I said there would be no currency legislation until after the crash . I trust to God that We will have some now . " Praise for the Men Who Do . II Senator Depew 's speech was devoted in part of a eulogy of " the men who do things . " Referring to the financial situation , he ? said : We have just passed through a crisis surpassing In perils to business that of ' 57 , of ' 01 , of ' 73. of ' 84 , and of ' 93. all of which I witnessed . The internal Interchange in prodUction - and manufactures in the United StaNs surpasses that of all the rest of the world . Less than per cent . of it Is done . with money and more than 95 per cent . with credit . In this fabric of National credit are every bank , every railroad , every manufactory . and every department of labor , wages , and employment In the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our ears and the consequence be more disastrous than ever before known upon this continent , ' but the day was saved by the pluck . courage , and genius fur affairs of the men who do things . He then made a. plea for the upbuilding of our merchant marine , and turned to the discussion aroused ' by the order sending our battleship fleet to the Pacific . On this he said : This dinner is a hall and farewell to the gallant Admiral upon his voyage to the Pacific Ocean . The commotion which this expedition has created and the discussion it has aroused all over the world is one of the eccentricities of the times . We have ** miles of coast on the Atlantic , and its harbors are familiar with our fleet . We have an equivalent number of miles on the Pacific , and most of its harbors have never seen an American battleship , or known the inspiration and education of an American man-of-war at their docks . Gentlemen , there will he no war . After this expedition the American navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the I:tilted States ' Government thinks it expedient , without any- question being raised on any pretext of sensitiveness or hostility . Coghlan 's Tribute to Evana . " We are here , " said Admiral Coghian , the next speaker , " to honor the man who is at the head of the list of Rear Admirals . A great many people , it appears , have become frightened at the dangers ahead of the fleet that is going to the Pacific . The people seem to have forgotten that we have splendid ships - and that the men who are in command of them arc men who thoroughly know their business . They talk about some other nation objecting ? to tile voyage of these vessels from American waters in the Atlantic to American waters in the Pacific . Tell me when any other nation ever consulted the United States concerning the ? movements of its ships in Its own waters ? " The fleet must be ready for use , as a unit , and this is the first time we have had a ehance for this practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they want to know what would happen if some European nation made war upon us while the fleet is away . Col. Scott will tell you that we have the finest system of coast defenses in the world , and the men lb charge of those defenses claim they can handle any fleet that may be sent against them . Others who spoke were Col. Scott , exMayor Low , Commander Chandler , and the Rev. Dr. Buckley .
