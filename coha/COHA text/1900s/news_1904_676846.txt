txt Sir Thomas Lipton entertained the crew of the United States flagship Olympia the other day at the Crystal Palace , London . The comment of The London Pall Mall Gazette was that " they were a seamanly body of men , well tanned , cheery , and wideawake , though a keen critic might have noted that many of them were younger than you find as a rule on an English man-of-war . There was something unmistakably Anglo-Saxon about their cheering . " Sir Thomas , whose words were frequently interrupted by cheers and laughter , started a short and seasonable speech with the familiar form of address , " Boys ! " and kept this homely strain up to the end . He told them to go wherever they liked , for all the grounds were open to them ; in short , they might paint the place red so long as they did n't run away with any of the statues . He was proud and happy to be able to meet so many stanch representatives of the United States Navy  --  a navy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to . make some small return for the great hospitality lie had always received across the water . Americans were nothing if not generous , and he knew that especially from the lickings they had given him . Those lickIngs had always been ladled out to him in no stingy way , and had left him in no kind of doubt as to how he was getting on . He had had a little experience of American sailors , and he could testify that they had nothing to learn so far as handling a boat was concerned . Ile hoped that when he next went across to their country- with Shamrock IV. , which he hoped would be at no far distant date , they would let him down gently . Sir Thomas reminded his hearers that he was one of the first to board the Olympia when she returned to Sandy Hook after her famous exploits in Manila Bay in ** and he had the privilege of being present with the crew at their smoking concert the same week at the Waldorf-Astoria . In conclusion , he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . and he hoped the union jack and the Stars and Stripes would long be intertwined in peaceful and loving harmony .
