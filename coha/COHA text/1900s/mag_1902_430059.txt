 | As the institution of slavery developed in America there arose in every part of the Union persons who were opposed to it . These opponents became very numerous in the North , less numerous in the middle Southern States , and least numerous in the far South . In Virginia they are found from the beginning of the evolution of slavery . They faced , however , an economic condition which had serious difficulties . The need for labor on the plantations , combined with certain social and political conditions , defeated the opposition to slavery . Yet this opposition was never entirely discouraged , and it manifested itself in various ways . It went into the legal life of the community with the result that there were several laws fixing the manner of emancipation . It also found expression in the opinion of certain great public men . The legal phase of the anti-slavery sentiment was manifested most notably in manumission . This was first by act of the legislature , then by consent of the governor and council , and later by will . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the decades immediately following the Revolution . The acts referring to the matter declared that it was " just and proper " that the " benevolent intention " of testators who sought to liberate their slaves should be carried into effect . The attitude of the courts was also favorable to emancipation , and in their interpretation of wills they displayed a spirit as mild as that of the legislature . But the presence of the free negro class , however , was not desired . Jefferson , whose opposition to slavery was pronounced , affirmed that the fear of the absorption of the negro socially and racially was one of the strongest forces which restrained emancipation . In this humane interpretation of the law the mass of the lawyers and other intelligent people of the  | community were agreed . This is not a conspicuous side of the anti-slavery sentiment , but it was a very vital side . It meant much for the well being of the negroes . On the other hand the views of certain prominent men who opposed slavery are better known . Their views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ; for they are but the indications of the social conscience on the matter , and this social conscience manifested itself more surely in law than in the opinions of these men . Vet these views were representative . They were also influential ; and they resulted in some serious attempts to enact laws which looked to the abolition of slavery in Virginia . They are , therefore , worthy of our serious attention . The first Virginian who gave effective and forcible expression to the anti-slavery sentiment in Virginia was Thomas Jefferson . His views upon the dangers of both the slave and the free negro elements , as upon most subjects to which he gave his earnest thought , though he spoke as an advocate and not as an impartial critic , deserved and received the careful attention of his contemporaries . He disliked the institution of slavery intensely on account of both social and political effects which he saw around him or thought he foresaw . " There must doubtless be , " he says in 1781 , " an unhappy influence on the manners of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions , the most unremitting despotism on the one part and degrading submission on the other . Fathers give way before their children ? children see their passions and learn to imitate them , give loose to the worst of passions , and daily exercised in tyranny can not but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities . " Jefferson believed that slavery not only destroyed the best morals of a people , but their industry also , affirming that " a very small proportion of proprietors were ever seen to labor . " The key to the apparent fervor and extravagance of his language in his Notes on Virginia , which becomes so intense that he perforce breaks off , admitting himself that he can not pursue the subject " with temperance , " is to be found in the doctrines of his political creed and philosophy . " With what execrations , " he says , " should statesmen be loaded , who permit one-half of the citizens to trample upon the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into enemies , destroy the morals of one part and the amor patriae of the other , who can not call that his native country in which he is born to live and labor for another , but must lock up all the faculties of his nature ? and entail his own miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him . " And further , he says that the only firm basis of the liberties of a nation is the conviction in the people 's mind " that their liberties are the gift of God , " and that " slavery removes this conviction . " He trembled for his country when he thought of the wrath of God against this unjust violation of the natural rights of man . " God is just ? his justice can not sleep forever , " he says , and " considering numbers , nature and natural means only an exchange of situation between oppressor and oppressed is possible , " and " by supernatural interference probable . The Almighty has no attribute which can take sides with us in such a contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural and civil , advocate a change . " Jefferson 's denunciation was against slavery not only as an abstract , but as a practical , principle . It was sinful per se , and , logically , because of this its fruits were wholly those of unrighteousness . He wrote for French ears attuned to doctrines of equality and the theory of the rights of man , and in some pique too , perhaps , at not being able to convince his fellow-citizens that the practice of slavery was wrong as well as its theory . But he had a hearing even in Virginia . St. George Tucker , Professor of Law in William and Mary College , and a judge of the General Court of Virginia , felt like Jefferson , that slavery was " incompatible with the principles of our government and that of the Revolution . " " We are imposing , " he says , " on a fellow-man who differs in complexion from us a slavery ten times more cruel than the utmost extremity of those grievances and oppressions of which we complained . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and learn to regard them as our fellowmen and equals except in those particulars where accident or possibly nature may have given us some advantage . " Such was the advanced sentiment in 1796 . Madison , Washington and Henry were more conservative in their expressions , but they wished to see the abolition of slavery . Madison strongly opposed any incorporation into the Constitution of the notion of  | property in human beings . And this was of all times the time when the slavery question should have been settled , if possible . Washington , though a slaveholder , took definite ground against the institution . " It is among my first wishes , " he said , " to see some plan adopted by which slavery may be abolished by law . " Henry , like many others , might be regarded as a theoretical though not a practical abolitionist . In 1773 he writes , regarding the principle of slavery , to a Quaker friend , " It is as repugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent with the Bible and destructive of liberty . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few in practice from conscientious motives . I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living without them . I will not , I can not justify it . " Before the close of the Revolutionary War Jefferson thought he saw a distinct change of popular sentiment . " The spirit of the master is abating , " he said , " that of the slave rising from the dust , his condition is mollifying , the way , I hope , preparing under the auspices of heaven for a total emancipation , and this is disposed in the order of events to be with the consent of the masters rather than by their extirpation . " But none of the leaders , apologists or anti-slavery men had a remedy to offer adequate to the disease , and the favorable sentiment that might have sustained any radical change promising success languished for nearly half a century longer , only to be finally reversed by pressure from without . Popular feeling was sufficiently aroused , however , at several periods to encourage the formulation of distinct projects for gradual general emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for unfavorable occurrences , might have been realized . Three well defined plans for such emancipation were publicly presented . They were all based upon a two-fold principle : ( 1 ) emancipation only of slaves born after a certain future time , especially females ; and ( 2 ) removal beyond the limits of the United States of the population thus freed . The first provision was necessary to protect vested interests , the second to protect society in the other States . The first scheme was Jefferson 's . That wise leader was a member of the committee of the Virginia legislature to revise the laws and to purge them of all " principles inconsistent with Republi- canism . " Acting with Wythe and Pendleton , his colleagues , he prepared in 1779 a scheme to remove slavery from the State . For some reason the measure was not taken up in the Assembly . Probably it was , as Tucker suggests , because opposition was foreseen to the part which provided for the " disposal of the blacks after they had attained a certain age . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching a certain age , then to he trained at the public cost in " tillage , arts or sciences " till the females had reached eighteen and the males had reached twentyone years of age , after which they were to be colonized in some acceptable place and given the stock and implements as well as the liberty necessary to enable them to begin life as a free people under American oversight . To deal with the free negro question as the United States has since done was , in Jefferson 's opinion , the height of folly . It was futile to hope to " retain and incorporate the blacks into the State . " " Deep-rooted prejudices of the whites , ten thousand recollections of blacks of injuries sustained , new provocations , the real distinction nature has made and many other circumstances will divide us , " he predicts , " into parties and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of one or the other race . " Amalgamation he regarded as both revolting and socially impossible . The black he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mental qualities , though , strange to say , he defended his morals . No place was suggested for the colony , but he secretly hoped one would open up in " the revolutionary State of America then commenced . " This hope he thought was realized in 1824 in independent St. Domingo under the control of blacks , who were willing to receive the freemen as citizens and to pay the cost of transportation . The chief expense thus left was the rearing of infants , which he suggested might be borne by appropriations from the vacant lands " ceded ( to the United States ) by the very States now needing relief . " The property loss involved amounted to only half of the direct taxes annually continued for twenty-five years , and this would be gradually lessened for the next twenty-five years , which would mark its final extinction . " And this amount , " he urged , " was paid not in cash , but by the delivery of an object which the Virginians had never known nor computed as a part of  | their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called on for nothing . " " Who could estimate , " he says of this project , " its blessings ! I leave this to those who will live to see its accomplishment and to enjoy a beatitude forbidden to my age , but I leave it with this admonition , to arise and be doing . " The notion of the master meeting the State half way and compromising upon a mutual property sacrifice was afterwards taken up by Faulkner , who held that the State had a right to destroy property in slaves , and also by McDowell , who urged a like principle against Goode in the debate of 1831-32 . Tucker , Jefferson 's contemporary , felt like him that Divine Providence would aid and smile upon the emancipation of slaves . " But human prudence forbids , " he says , " that we should engage in a work of such hazard as a general and simultaneous emancipation . " " Immediate emancipation " to him meant " immediate and general famine , " which the products of all the other States even could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave population of nearly 650,000 ; more than half the white population , while in agricultural labor there were four slaves to every free white man . The question thus was more similar to that in the French West Indies than to that in Massachusetts , where the proportion of whites to blacks was 65 to 1 . The other difficulty was the future of the negroes themselves . They must be prepared for their future condition . To expel them all at once from the United States meant " lingering death by diseak , " or as natural " idlers " and " profligates " they would be exposed to the misery of an insufficient subsistence . The plan he proposed in 1796 was to effect the " abolition of slavery without emancipating a single slave . " He objected to Jefferson 's colonization scheme on the ground of the expense , which was five times greater than the revenue of Virginia , and on the ground of the incapacity of " hordes of vagabonds , robbers , and murderers in their still savage state and debased condition " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare or Indian hostility would extirpate them , if outside , their destruction as invaders was almost as certain . To incorporate them into the body politic was a menace to the whites and an impossibility . Some middle course had to be found between the " tyrannical and iniquitous policy which holds so many human creatures in a state  | of grievous bondage and that which would turn loose a numerous starving and enraged banditti upon the innocent descendants of their former oppressors . " Tucker 's plan , consequently , was partly made up from Jefferson 's and partly from those of other States . After the adoption of the plan , ( 1 ) every female born and her issue were to be free , but were to remain with the family as servants for twenty-eight years and then to receive appropriate freedom dues for a start in life , being treated during their servitude in all respects as white servants and apprentices ; ( 2 ) civil slavery was to be retained , office-holding , action as an attorney , juror or witness except in cases between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twenty-one-year lease were to be prohibited . Nor were they to keep or bear arms , except under legal limitations ; nor to marry a white ; nor be executors or administrators ; nor be capable of making a will or acting as trustees ; nor of maintaining any real action . This was a compromise with prejudice , but with an object . The privileges were to be enlarged as occasion demanded , and the personal rights and property of the servants , though limited , were to be protected by law . " By denying them , " said Tucker , " the most valuable privileges which civil government affords I wish to render it their interest to seek those privileges in some other climate . " He seems to have had Spanish territory in view , and hoped the cutting off of ambition , power of resentment , and landed property would be sufficient to induce emigration as a substitute for colonization . This plan was based upon a deduction from Jefferson 's theory of inalienable rights and natural equality ; that no property could exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over another , " said Tucker , " is neither founded in nature nor in sound policy . It can not extend to those not in being . No man can be deprived of what he doth not possess . " He estimated that no male would be fully emancipated for forty-five years and that it would take over a century to complete the process . Not for forty years would the slave population diminish ; on the contrary for thirty years it would increase , and after sixty years one-third of the number of then-existing slaves would remain , while the bound blacks under twenty-eight years would equal the original number of slaves . This plan was elaborated and published , together  | with a dissertation upon slavery , in the appendix to his commentaries on Blackstone , and as a separate pamphlet in 1796 ; but although widely read it bore no fruit . The time was not yet , and the proposed disposition of the negro element , as in Jefferson 's plan , was sufficient to defeat its acceptance . It is interesting that he looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it naturally arose , servitude . This was both logical and possible if the emigration of the freedmen would have certainly been forced by the restrictions and economic law , but this was the doubtful feature . Many Virginians on the failure of these plans turned their hopes toward the project of the African Colonization Society to establish the colony of Liberia , and lent their earnest support to insuring its successful inception and continuance . Many slaves were manumitted by their owners on the promise that they would become colonists , and many more were freed by will on this specific condition . In some cases they refused this alternative and chose to remain slaves rather than be deported to Africa . Some even escaped from the decks of vessels leaving Baltimore and made their way back to Virginia to become slaves . The success of the colonization movement which finally resulted in the formation of the African Colonization Society was largely due to the suggestions and aid of Jefferson , Monroe , Mercer , Randolph , Bushrod Washington and other Virginians , supported by several acts of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the instance of Robert Goodloe Harper , that the society received Federal countenance and became a general , instead of a local , movement . It represented a Southern , as well as a Northern , movement toward emancipation , combining with the christianization of Africans a step toward the solution of the negro problem . Maryland , Virginia , and North Carolina were not behind other States like New York and Pennsylvania in direct aid or encouragement through State societies . An act of the Virginia legislature in 1850 appropriated $30,000 annually for five years to transport free negroes to Liberia through the Virginia Colonization Society . In 1853 a Colonization Board was appointed , with a like appropriation for five years , to be raised by bequests and a tax of $1.00 each on free negroes between twenty-one and forty-five years old . Even in  | later years , after the war , Virginia gave one of her bravest soldiers , the Right Rev. Charles Clifton Penick , to labor efficiently as a missionary and Episcopal Bishop among these freedmen at Cape Palmas , and not least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia-born slave , James S. Payne . The third plan for emancipation , distinctly formulated and proposed in the Virginia Assembly of 1831-32 , was that of Thomas Jefferson Randolph , a nephew of Jefferson . It was a result of the exciting circumstances surrounding the insurrection of Nat . Turner . Says Dew in his review of the famous debate on the subject in that year : " Consternation and dismay all through the State ? rumors of disaffections , plots and insurrections and even massacres , frightened the timid and occasioned in the minds of many even in the lower parts of Virginia anxiety to remove this monstrous evil . Plans for partial and total emancipation were earnestly pressed upon the attention of the legislature . " Never before had the subject of emancipation been seriously discussed in any of the legislatures of our Southern slave-holding country . Some persons looked to the Colonization Society . Some were disposed to strike at the root of the evil and to call upon the General Government to extirpate the curse . " But State pride , " he continues , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutional action she had ever been foremost to resist . " A resort to the legislature of the State was at last forced . : The Legislature , " he says , " was composed of an unusually large number of young and inexperienced men , " and this , together with the fact that " no enlarged , wise or practical plan of operations was proposed by the abolitionists , " contributed toward defeat . The debate , however , was eloquent and long sustained , a great number of speakers appearing in it , and " day after day multitudes thronged the capital " to hear it . The Assembly " in its zeal for the discussion set aside all prudential considerations , " such as the possible effect of incendiary utterances that might make the slave believe his lot one of injustice and cruelty and so give him the excuse of a revolt , or might encourage further aggressions by the abolitionists . " Regardless of this , " says Dew , " the Assembly openly and publicly debated the subject before the world " acrd the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be perfectly  | agreed in the necessity of removal in case of emancipation . Three propositions were brought forward : 1 . Deportation of the whole mass to Africa was urged by the members of the lower counties , who said it might be there made a means of Christianizing the heathen . The objections raised to this were ? first , cost , slaves representing one-third of the wealth of the State and half that of lower Virginia , and , valued at $200 each , would require a first outlay of $94,000,000 , and second , the claim that land values depended on slavery . 2 . Deportation and colonization in Africa only of the increase which at that time was about 6,000 a year was proposed by those who thought the profit of selling slaves to the Southwest was an encouragement to the retention of the system . This of course would find no general support , as value and transportation would cost the State ' $1,380,000 a year , while the domestic slave trade accomplished the same result as far as removal was concerned without cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only denied the master 's property right according to the principle part us sequitur yentrem , but put upon him the obligation of raising and maintaining the child till of age at eighteen or twenty-one years . The assumption was that the labor of the child after twelve or fourteen years would offset the cost of the preceding years . The proposition was to emancipate all born after 1840 and that the freedman should earn and pay his own transportation from America . To do this he was to be hired out after becoming of age till he accumulated enough for his passage . The plan was harshly criticised . Dew says , " Scarcely any of the legislature , we believe not even the author himself , entirely approved of this plan . " The failure of the Virginia abolitionists to agree , and to combine for any length of time upon a single definite or practicable plan strengthened the forces of their opponents and caused their final defeat by a small majority . Will was not wanting , but method unhappily was . The effect of this failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the negro , slave or free , was an incubus hopelessly irremovable ; and on the part of Northern abolitionists , now in the first freshness of their zeal , an aggressiveness that inflamed resentment and prevented a future calm consideration of the problem .  | To many the debate had shown the slow progress of Virginia in population , " an unerring symptom , " says Dew , " of her want of prosperity and the inefficiency of slave labor . " It was held that slave labor could no longer be truly profitable except in cotton , sugar and such crops . It shut off manufactures and profitable immigration , while it was causing the emigration of some of the best elements of Virginia 's population to new lands in the West and South . White emigration had reached an average of 3,000 persons a year by 1830 . This symptom of over density , now for the first time generally recognized , had become so marked in the next ten years that George Tucker , a professor of Philosophy and Political Economy in the University of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census reports , predicted the early extinction of slavery in Maryland and Virginia and the final progress of extinction Southward based upon economic causes alone , chiefly that of the relation of a dense immobile population to land and subsistance . The distinguished Bishop Meade , of the Episcopal Church , in 1857 went even further in denunciation of the effects of sla4ery . After fifty years of observation and thirty years of travel over the State , conversing with the most intelligent Virginians , he gave as his opinion that slavery injured Virginia 's religious , political , and agricultural interests ; vet , " notwithstanding , " he says , " the cruelties accompanying the African slave trade , the advantage of it has been on the side of the negro temporally and spiritually , yet wasteful agriculture and consequent emigration must he admitted . Large estates cultivated by slaves prevented the establishment of villages , churches , and schools , " and " produced in many sons of Virginia gentlemen the feeling that labor was a disgrace , " yet " among the upper classes , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education in Virginia than in any other State , and slavery brings out more good feelings than bad . " As to emancipation , he said that if it was more to the negroes ' good than to their master 's injury he was sure God would reveal it . Such expressions may be taken as the sentiment of the wellinformed and conservative element .
