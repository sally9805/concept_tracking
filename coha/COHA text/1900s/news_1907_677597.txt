I. , on Tuesday , was unfrocked yesterday , at his own request , by the ceremony provided in the ritual of the Protestant Episcopal Church , Canon 31 , in the Cathedral of the Incarnation at Garden City . The request was made to Bishop Burgess in a long letter mailed from this city on Wednesday night and received by the Bishop yesterday morning . Two presbyters , Archdeacon Henry B. Bryan and the Very Rev.

Hempstead was in a state of excitement yesterday as the result of the scandal .

He preached two sermons , one in the morning and one in tho ' evening , - and both of them were of la hidden valedictory nature . He said in his morning sermon that it was seldom that a man was appreciated ' until he went away .

On Monday , when his wife had left for Hartford , the minister drew his salary for the month of May in advance and drew from the bank what money he had .

It is ' said that he also borrowed $800 from a wealthy member of his church . In the village drug store he was seen on Monday to draw a large roll of bills of large denomination from his pocket .

The result of the scandal on the little community of Hempstead has been to divide sentiment . The minister was very popular and a hard , earnest worker for his parish . Those who offer excuses for him said yesterday that they believed his mind had been affected by the injuries he received In the trolley accident . The others had nothing but condemnation for him , and one or two men declared that had their daughters suffered at the hands of the minister death for him would have been certain . After the meeting of wardens and vestrymen , which lasted all of Wednesday night and continued far into yesterday morning , this statement was given out as coming from the vestry : " Mr. Cooke took charge of St. George 's Pariah five years ago , and has been always a most energetic , earnest , and con ' scientious worker . Under his rectorship the parish has thriven , a parish house has been built , and active church work in many directions never before prOmoted in a parish was inaugurated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed by this totally unexpected calamity and it is at a loss to account for Mr. Cooke 's action . I It is inclined to the belief that Mr. Cooke can not be of sound mind . Three years ago he suffered a severe shock to his system in a trolley collision when in charge of a Sunday school picnic , when he and Mrs. Cooke and several of the children were injured . " He was , during the following - year , given a leave of absence and sent to Europe for rest and the recuperation of his nervous system . While there was no apparent indication of his mind having been affected , he never fully recovered . and remained a highly nervous man . The parish is in the best of condition and is free of debt .
