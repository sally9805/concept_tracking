IN looking out upon the busy life of Holland , one does not look " through a glass darkly . " If so , it is not because the window-glass is not clean . The fondness of the Dutch for window-washing is innate and of ancient origin . Guicciardini , who gave to the world in 1567 his graphic description of the low counties and their people , said the pleasure of walking along the streets of a Netherland town is marred by the danger one continually runs of being sprinkled by the pumps with which the servant girls wash the windows . But that was in the good old times of long ago . Now the servant girls do not wash the windows , at least not in the cities . Here the windows are attended to by a company ? that is , one of many companies , for there are so many that they now add to their signs and business cards the date of organization . When I first saw one of their carts loaded with ladders of various lengths and pushed by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten their brushes . But in a few days I saw one of these ladders deftly hoisted in front of my window , and before the thought of fire and rescue formed itself in my mind , a white-coated man was washing my window . He did it well and quickly . Quickly , of course , for the company received only two ( Dutch ) cents for that wash , and of that amount the workman has only a share . For this reason , and because of the lively competition , the carts of the " Glasenwascherij " companies flit rapidly from place to place . A householder subscribes for the services of these windowwashers , securing a visit once a month or more frequently , if he desires , and pays two cents a window , large or small , first story or fifth . In Holland , as well as in other parts of Europe , the method of subscribing for a service that is somewhat regular is quite common ; and if you wish to provide for a contingency that may happen , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by insurance , be it the breaking of a window or an attack of whooping-cough . My window is not only clean , but is provided with " spies , " sometimes called " busy-bodies , " as the outside mirrors are named . My battery of spies enables me to see at a glance what is transpiring up the street and down the street , as well as who is at the door , by merely sitting at the window . The second house on the right is a public-school building , one part of which is the district police station , and now and then an image is caught in the mirror of some malefactor brought to judgment , attended by the usual crowd of curious idlers . It is a veritable judgment . The inspector at once has a preliminary hearing , a sort of grand-jury trial , and dismisses the prisoner , imposes the fine , or , if the charge be serious and well-founded , remands him for trial . Should the culprit be found guilty of some minor misdemeanor , a slight imprisonment is imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time is spent in prison , the days of serving the sentence is optional , provided the offender is a man of property or can furnish adequate security . One of the common offenses is the failure to observe the sign that is posted at the beginning of some of the streets : " It is forbidden to drive in here . " In passing , it might be said that this forbidding notice does not signify , as some writers on Holland have asserted , that the leaning houses threatening to fall make the street dangerous . It simply means that the traffic is so great that  |p619  vehicles can not easily pass , and hence to avoid blockades all teams must go in the same direction . It is unfortunate that people ignorant of the language of a country should undertake to enlighten others regarding the habits and customs of that country . The mythical cleanliness of the town of Broek owes its origin to the wrong translation of the simple sign on the bridge at the entrance to the town ? " Stapfoets rijden . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bridge . " To the imaginative describer of this fabulous village it signified that here the streets are so clean that you can not take your horse through the town , but must go around it . Broek is clean . So is every Dutch town . Opposite my window is a letter-box , a two-storied one , the lower being for parcels , while the upper part is the receptacle for letters . It is just around the corner . All letter-boxes seem to be in nooks and corners , affording a convenient blind , behind which the servant girls read in safety the postal cards that were given them to mail . Postal cards are in great demand in Holland . A mistake in addressing one is not expensive , for an uncanceled postal card is redeemed for the value of the paper , while a spoiled envelope is hopelessly lost . There is nothing which so strikes terror to a Dutchman 's heart as loss , and with the hope of gain he will venture much . A HAPPY SOLUTION OF THE TRANSFER QUESTION He ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postage stamps , calling at business houses at regular intervals to supply their demands for a commission of one-half of one per cent ; he will stand at street corners and transfer stations and sell street-car tickets , receiving as his profits the difference between wholesale and retail prices . The car lines rather encourage this business . The hawkers frequently suggests the idea of riding , and travel has increased through their efforts . There was a custom in Amsterdam ? possibly now in disuse since the electric company controls the transit system ? of not giving transfers , but by paying an additional one-fourth fare the passenger would receive a coupon that would entitle him to a trip on any intersecting line or a return on the same line at any time during the day of issue . This was a happy solution of the transfer question . The natural thrift of the Dutchman suggests many ways for making money . He is found in all of the recognized vocations and trades , every possible variety of trade and every imaginable differentiation thereof . It would be far easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The catalogue would be : Change his religion , cheat , and give up smoking . To stop smoking would be like giving up breathing . He smokes at all times and in all places ? no , not quite all ; never in church , though one writer at least has said so , and not in the marriage hall of the municipal building . Why should he not smoke ? He enjoys it , and never interferes with any other person 's enjoyment . EVERY MALE SMOKES FROM INFANCY I have been trying to find out at what age boys begin to smoke . It is one of the things that has attracted attention here since the genial Thackeray sketched the three small plump Dutch boys smoking their big cigars on the little Dutch steamer . They all smoke cigars . The artists in the future , in depicting Dutch life , must omit the traditional pipe and substitute in its place the more prosaic cigar . But when do the boys begin ? Nothing but death stops them . I have seen a father and his family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling his cigar like a practical smoker , and boys on their way to the primary school doing full justice to a good-sized cigar . But when do the boys begin ? Perhaps it is with them as the lifting the dress is with the misses , it comes natural , and it is as difficult to point to the exact time for that as it is to specify when spring begins .  |p620  The streets of Holland are usually wet . When it is not raining , the streetcleaners are earning their wages , in part , by sprinkling them . Thus it is necessary for the ladies to lift their skirts in crossing , and as it is hard to tell just when the girl becomes a lady , the former gives herself the benefit of all doubt and begins in time . The girl just in her teens clutches at her dress as soon as she feels the first rain drops or crosses a street , and the little tot , whose dress barely comes to her knees , tries to save her flounces . I have watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl old enough to leave the perambulator who was too small to imagine that her skirts might not be soiled by the wet . To pull the skirt aside , to give it a gentle lift , comes instinctively . So it is with the boy 's smoking . Between the letter-box and my window there passes a good part of Dutch life , and the little that is not in the procession is suggested by some counterpart . Even history can not be forgotten , for I look out upon streets whose names are taken from men who took part in the struggle for independence ? a struggle that illumines the annals of northern Europe ; a struggle that kept alive in adverse times the sacred fire of freedom . From this contest Spain was so weakened that the Armada was not invincible , and England escaped a defeat that would have given to the world 's map a different set of boundary lines and would possibly have exterminated Protestantism . THE NATIONAL , CHARACTER REVEALED BY HISTORY An uneqaul war like that waged by Holland against Philip of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national character of the people ? a character that was in a large measure shaped by their geographic environment . Foreigners have invaded their land and swayed for a time its destinies , but their leaving was like the passing of a horrible nightmare ? it left no influence upon life or habits . When the Frisian vowed that his race should be free as long as the wind blows out of the clouds and the world stands , he thought of political freedom . But there is a destiny spelled out in the dikes and dunes that insures a grander freedom than immunity from serfdom ? a freedom from the tainting taste for foreign foibles . Since the land on which these people live is new , their history can not be ancient , and with great definiteness it can be followed from the Batavia of Caeesar down to the Nederland of Wilhelmina . We may begin with Charles the Great , who , mindful of his Brabant ancestry , left to the Batavians over whom he was called upon to rule their native customs and gave to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of centralization was successful in the hands of a capable ruler , and the local chieftain vested with the title of deputy , count , or duke , answerable to the head of the state for his tribute money or his army , laid the foundations of Holland 's greatness . The dukes and the counts of the Netherlands were not slow in realizing that their wealth grew with the increased prosperity of their subjects , and encouraged them to gather into villages , and there , combining forces and capital , brought into existence manufactures of such excellence that the lowlands supplied the people of the neighboring countries with the products of mill and loom . These communities became little republics . They were made up of guilds recognized and protected by the authorities , since they contributed to the prosperity coveted by these authorities . In the course of time the guilds deputed delegates to meet in council , and their deliberations were passed on through representatives who , in assemblies , assisted in the general government . Thus the Netherlands became gradually familiar with government by representation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizons wore bounded by the walls of their own towns , and the narrowing processes of such a pent-up existence brought about a certain intolerance toward one  |p621  another , but did not interfere with their united stand against a common foe . Philip the Good obtained by inheritance the two provinces of Flanders and Artois ; he purchased Namur ; he usurped the Duchy of Brabant , and he dispossessed his cousin Jacqueline of Holland , Zealand , Hainault , and Friesland . His dominion extended from the foot of the Alps to the German Ocean , and comprised what was then the wealthiest part of northern Europe . The Netherlands at this time had reached the heights of its prosperity and the full enjoyment of its chartered liberties . The sovereign had his authority . The nobles had their place in the council ; but the municipal authorities , though checked by these two forces , had a substantial influence over both . In the assemblies of the estates the authority of the prince was , in his absence , represented by the stadthouder . When the Netherlands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution as well as a convenient substitute . When grants of money were asked , the nobles voted on the request . The cities , if they had received instructions to do so , bargained as to the grant ; if not , they adjourned to consult their constituency . The ingrained habit of municipal isolation explains why the general liberties of the Netherlands were imperiled , why the larger part of the country was ultimately ruined , and why the war of independence was conducted with so much risk and difficulty , even in the face of the most serious perils . We sympathize with William the Silent when he waited in feverish anxiety for the vote of funds sufficient to pay his needy soldiers , and applaud his patriotism when he sold his family silver to meet urgent demands . We are tempted to condemn as narrow and inefficient such insistence upon the prerogatives of local authorities . But when we see the beneficial results that come from our system of township , county , and state government , each independent of all others of its class and subservient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system passed through the fires of the Dutch revolution and sustained the shock of civil strife . SUCCESSFUL ROVERS CE THE DEEP In another respect we see in the political fate of the Netherlands the effect of local conditions . Owing to the absence of nearly all kinds of winter food for animals , it was difficult to keep stock in good condition for slaughtering ; thus the consumption of salted fish was enormous . The fisheries of the German Ocean became a mine of wealth and served as the nursery of the Dutch navy , of those amphibious mariners who struck the first blow for Dutch independence and became the ancestors of that succession of brave sea captains who crushed the maritifne supremacy of Spain , founded the Batavian empire of Holland in the tropics , engaged in an unequal struggle with England , and sustained for a century the reputation of Holland after its real commercial greatness had declined . Because of the clever skippers ever available and the demand for greater opportunities in which Dutch energy might display itself , voyages of discovery became popular , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flew to the breezes in the south and distant east . Spitzbergen and Barentz Sea were of Dutch discovery , Van Dieman 's Land originally belonged to Holland , and the Dutch East India Company for many years monopolized the Oriental trade . Coming down to the present day , many of those who go down to the sea in ships are comforted to know , when the winds roar and the waves run high , that their vessel 's crew are Dutch , and that there is in command the skillful , cautious Van der See , Bonjer , Potjer , or Roggeveen . " This is a hurricane , " you may say . " A bit of a blow , " is the reassuring reply of the captain . The ship will turn turtle , you think ; " A slight roll , " says he . Attentive to his duties , he has no time to be loquacious . He  |p622  claims no credit for smooth seas , nor declares any weather the worst . He is true to his trust and , knowing that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident of a safe voyage . The descendants of some of the oldtime mariners to the icy North or to India 's coral strand may now be poling a boat along the canal that crosses my street . Their ships are less ambitious , their journeys are not so romantic , and their cargoes may have less of value ; but they are adding , each in his own way , to Holland 's greatness . This greatness may be called dwarfed in its proportions , but Holland is truly great in her industry , perseverance , and in the spirit of her people . It is this spirit that dares to contest with the sea for supremacy as it dared the haughty Spaniard . It rests in the heart that never falters and lightens burdens that to others would be crushing . THE WONDERFUL CANALS This canal at my corner , whose busy traffic is reflected in my friendly mirror , is one of the many which divide Amsterdam into hundreds of trapezoids and furnish cheap and commodious avenues for the transport of every conceivable article of commerce gathered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the cargoes and starting places of the vessels which are pushed along these canals ? literally pushed ? for tug service is expensive and the restricted possibilities for tacking renders the sail useless . In pushing , the boatman walks to the prow of the boat , thrusts a long pole in the water , then facing the stern , and with his shoulder against the free end of the pole , he literally kicks the boat from under himself as he apparently walks toward the stern . When he risks walking overboard he withdraws the pole and repeats the process , going from side to side for purposes of steering in case only one is poling . It is a slow and tedious method of propulsion . Surely the saying , " It 's a good thing , push it along , " must have originated in Holland . Here nearly every - thing is pushed , and the number of pushcarts is far in excess of the number of vehicles for horses . The delivery carts are pushed ; small peripatetic shops seem impelled by a magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ; vegetables enough to stock a market are bowled along from street to street ; and then the fish ? smoked and pickled , fresh or dried , all sorts , sizes , and conditions , alive or dead . The purchaser makes her selection , and the vendor proceeds to prepare the fish for the pan . To the credit of Holland it must be said that a man is not allowed to use dogs to aid in the work of propulsion through the streets . It is also astonishing to note the variety of goods which are offered for sale from these carts : hardware and tinware , even including small stoves ; books , day-books , and ledgers ; pens , ink , and paper ; glassware , lamp chimneys , cups and saucers ; shoes , hats , clothes , old and new , and in fact the only things omitted are medicines and coffins . The dealers in rags , bones , and old iron pick up every imaginable bit of rubbish , and after deciphering its use and burnishing it up a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some brother peddler . I watched from my window two sons of Israel inspecting each other 's load . It was a painstaking process . I could not hear what was said , but I could see that one fondly handled a few yards of discarded dress trimming . An offer was evidently made and refused ; then perhaps others ? a diminution possibly of a cent on the part of the one and a corresponding increase by the other . But to no avail . They separated . However , the longing to buy or the desire to own finally got the better of one , so he stopped and raised his offer , which was accepted and the important deal made . I could see the amount paid ; it was twelve cents ; but then one can not estimate the pleasure which the dealing gave . THE LONE FISHERMAN But to return to the canal , though if a canal is wanted it is not necessary to turn ; one can go straight ahead . But to/ return to the subject . Testy Voltaire on leaving Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could not have said it before leaving , for there are canals everywhere ? canals large enough to float an ocean steamer and canals so small that they barely admit the boat in which the milkmaid , usually a man , goes out to milk . But I have never seen a canal too large or too small for the fisherman 's line . Along the bank of every one , small boys and large boys may be seen waiting for a bite or " a glorious nibble . " I have watched hundreds of persons thus engaged and I have seen as many fish in duly authenticated baskets , but I have never seen a fish in its proper juxtaposition with respect to the fisherman . I have set on the bank beside the patient waiter , and as the cork trembled just a little he would say , with a wise look , " That 's a cat " or " That 's a flat . " He did not know , but his surmise was as pleasurable as knowing , and as he lifted the baitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told you so . " Surely the lone fisherman was a Dutchman . First and foremost , the canals are drains , except in rare instances ; the traffic-carrying is incidental . In the country , since most of the land is below the level of the sea , the soil must be drained before it can be cultivated . Ditches are dug , into which the water runs ; then , as these ditches become full , the water is pumped into others having higher banks ; then from the latter into others still higher , until finally sea-level is reached , and the outflowing tide carries the water oceanward . The ordinary laws of nature are reversed . Here the drainage is from a lower to a higher level . In the early steps the water is lifted by wind power , but soon the volume becomes so great and such a large area of land is interested in its prompt handling that the state erects a pumping station and a trusted official sees to it that the water in his canal does not remain above its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these drains become waterways . Their banks , made of sandy earth , require reinforcement ; they must be faced with stone or fortified by piles large or small . In the case of the larger streams , these banks become dikes , and both stone and piles are needed in order to keep the water within the bounds . There is not a stone quarry in Holland , yet it has more stonework to the square mile than any other country in the world . Its forests are not sufficient to furnish the inhabitants with fuel ; still it has millions of great tree trunks wholly underground , driven in to serve as building foundations or hold in check the washing waters . The great dikes along the North Sea , on both sides of the River Maas , skirting the Rhine and the Zuyder Zee , are faced with piles as close together as they can be driven , each one of which cost four dollars to put in place . They are backed up by dressed German basalt or Norwegian granite . If Napoleon claimed Holland because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Rhine , Norway and Germany might demand a reward for holding it . It is always fascinating to watch a piledriver ; to see it swing a great log erect and into place , and then with stroke after stroke drive it home . I inspected the building operations ; saw the men , provided with high-top boots , clearing away the foundations . A steam pump was industriously striving to keep the water out and the pile-driver was thumping away . One morning the entire foundation was full of water , and a second pump was called into action . At last rows of piles were in place , rows like the teeth of a comb ; but the pump could not stop . The tops of the piles were cut off at the same height ; tenons cut on them and great horizontal beams mortised to them . The space between these beams is filled with sand and the whole is covered with heavy flooring , but the pump kept up its monotonous throbbing . On this floor the brick walls are erected , and soon there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will the pumping cease ? Never . Under the building there is a catch-basin , and whenever it becomes full it must be emp/ tied ; and this I suspect will be very often , for the canal at its side is six feet higher than the basement floor . No wonder that Diderot was surprised that the Dutchmen ever dared to go to sleep . In Holland an architect must be a hydraulician as well , and every contract has a safety clause allowing extra payment for each pile in excess of the stipulated number . Practically all of the houses of Amsterdam rest on piles . This gave rise to the remark of Erasmus : " I know a city in which the people live like rooks , in the tops of trees . " THE DUTCH HOUSE Of course these piles never reach solid ground , and at any time they may conclude to go deeper , either individually or in concert . This causes the houses in time to lean , and unfortunately they do not all take the same direction . There seems to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old streets one is startled at the angles which the house fronts make with the vertical . Some lean forward , as if impatient to start in a race across the city ; others rear backward , like an unwilling criminal dragged to justice ; some lean together like conspirators , while others show an inclination to separate , as though they were school-girls fresh from a quarrel . A stranger 's first impulse is to to exclaim , " Surely these houses will some day fall . " The Hollander will promptly answer , " But they never do . " The heavy material ? tile ? used for covering the houses makes it necessary to have steep roofs ; hence , in order not to waste valuable space in high attics , the roofs all extend in the direction of the length of the house , placing a gable on the front and on the rear . Projecting from the comb of practically every front gable there is a covered beam carrying a heavy hook on which a pulley can be hung . This is of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this pulley and the heavy furniture hoisted or lowered at will . In the strict sense of the word , flats are not common , but in the larger cities the majority of the houses are four-storied and accommodate two families , one occupying the two lower floors and the other the two upper floors . Thus all of these houses have two front doors , one opening directly into a hallway attached to the lower apartment , while the other is at the bottom of a stairway whose upper end is the hall of the apartment two stories up . The upper house is called bovenhuis , from boveii , above . It is not a cow-stable , as some have thought , from bos , bovis , etc. , the Latin for cow . In classic Leyden , Latin signs are quite common . There a room offered for the occupancy of a student is never indicated by the ordinary sign " Kammer to huur , " " Room for rent , " but in its stead the Latin equivalent , " Cubicula locanda . " The long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of furniture is carried up ; but by having a wide window in the center of the front on each story , the heavier pieces can be hoisted as mentioned . This obviates the necessity for having wide , easy stairs ; and , since they would require so much space , narrow stairs are the rule . As in many of the European countries , there is a tax on windows , not that there is any objection to windows , but because they are taken as an exponent of the magnitude , hence value , of the house . The use of the wide window as an exit for furniture diminishes the necessity for more than one window , and the annual payment of tax to the city is correspondingly diminished . In this case necessity serves as a virtue . THE DUTCH HOUSEMAID Frequently the doubling up of families in a single house is a great convenience . Every morning all of the loose rugs in a house must be shaken . For this service two strong girls are needed ; hence if a family keeps only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking . The intimacy between the two families may be very  |p627  slight , but they will always be ready to unite against dirt , their common foe . This carpet-shaking is done on the sidewalk , and the work furnishes quite a pleasing sight . In fact , nearly every outdoor occupation in which the Dutch girls engage presents an agreeable spectacle . These prim maids are dressed in striped gingham and wear a dainty cap . They look as though they were members of a great army whose uniform is fixed and invariable . It is true that there is an option as to the kind of stripes selected , and the shape of the cap may differ ; so does the uniform of the various branches of an army . In Holland we notice a fondness for uniform . The postman is uniformed , of course ; then , too , the policeman ; also the fireman , who always carries a rope for emergencies . The shop porters have a distinctive dress , and so has the runner for the bank ; but to the tourist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver-corded men , wearing cocked hats and sometimes knee breeches , walk beside the hearse , follow it , and accompany each carriage as footmen . After burial , these men distribute notices of the demise to such acquaintances of the deceased as may live in the city . Near the other end of the vista of life is marriage , and the passing of carriages in small processions , each having at its head one containing a lady wearing a white veil , and a young man conscious of the event , and driven by a coachman with the usual white boutonniere , and drawn by horses whose bridles were decked with white ribbon , suggest a wedding ceremony . In the larger cities parties thus led are observed to be more frequent on one day of the week than on others , and a single query will reveal the fact that there is one day on which second and third class marriage ceremonies are performed . It is a sensible provision to arrange as many events as possible by classes . It fixes a sort of limit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a street-car salary from trying to live up to an automobile standard . MARRIAGE CEREMONIES In the case of weddings , the class does not determine the grade of husband or wife produced . It is solely a question as to the amount of the fee required , and the fee is fixed by the amount of time given to the ceremony ? that is , in the second class the ceremony is individual , while in the third a score or more are married at once . I assisted ? literally assisted ? at ceremonies of these two classes . The members of the city council take their turns at these functions . On the day appointed , the brides , grooms , and their friends assemble in a large room in the city hall . The officer takes his place upon the platform , and a clerk at a table picks up the papers previously executed and calls out the names of the groom and the bride . They stand up to acknowledge their identity ; then their witnesses are called upon to rise . All the parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer arises and , asking the brides and the grooms to stand up , he proceeds to discourse upon the duties of the wife , the privileges of the husband , and the sacredness of matrimony , closing with the question , " Will you give your consent to the union about to be entered upon , abide by the laws , and live solely for one another ? " To this there is in chorus the answer , " Yes . " Whereupon he strikes the table with a gavel , saying , " I pronounce you man and wife . " The symbolism of the gavel , so important in Europe on all formal occasions , doubtless in this case points to the forging of chains that bind a contract . This is further strengthened by the retention in legal terminology of the Latin word for chain in certain judicial decrees affecting married couples . The second-class ceremonies are taken up individually . Each party is ushered into a room set aside for the purpose , one after another , and the ritual repeated for each . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the civil ceremony some go to church to pass through the religious rit/ ual , but all go forth to dinner . This is given by the bride 's parents , by friends of the contracting parties , or at a restaurant , where each guest adjusts his score . It is a merry , happy day . No drunken carousing , no boisterous chiavari . There is but little senseless romance in the courtship ; no thriftless waste in trousseaus that poorly fit the daily life ; but , realizing that partnership has been entered upon , the battle of life is taken up in the consciousness that each is a contributing member of the firm and is in part the custodian of the other 's happiness . No one must think that the Dutchman 's stolidity congeals the springs of love or that his practical nature can not harbor sentiment . At frequent intervals during the past twelve years I have found a resting place in front of the mirrors , reflecting the busy life of Amsterdam . It was more than a place of rest ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the recollection that a decade ago I made a photograph of the dear old face and form that soon after left vacant the arm-chair opposite which Mevrouw now sits in sad loneliness . THE MUNICIPAL PLAYGROUNDS Over the bridge at our corner is a playground which belongs to the city and is maintained by it for the use of the children . Even during vacation , the teachers of the various schools take their children in turn to one of these grounds , where they can enjoy the many games there provided or try their skill with the different pieces of gymnastic apparatus . In Amsterdam the playing of the school children is looked upon with reverence , and even the busy money-makers on ' Change turn over the historic Exchange Building to the unrestricted use of the children during the afternoons of the third week in August . This is done to commemorate the saving of the city on one occasion , when the children at play discovered the approaching Spaniards and gave the alarm . These municipal playgrounds seem to serve as a convenient place in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural to childhood , and its interdiction at this period is but postponing the outbreak of pent-up energies . Again , this combination of play with gymnastics puts at a discount the senseless toys that amuse but do not entertain with profit to the mind or body . The school-houses , being municipal buildings , are put to various uses . They are utilized as polling places . Elections are not wholly devoid of excitement , though the torchlight processions are not deemed of value in imparting the principles of civic government . Before the date set for election , there is sent to every voter a ballot bearing the names of all the candidates in his district . He eliminates at his leisure the names of the persons for whom he does not wish to vote , and on the day appointed visits the polls . After identification and the assurance that all of the prerequisites have been complied with , he deposits his ballot . In preparing this ballot at home , he is uninfluenced by the pressure of the candidates , and is also free from the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision that designates certain city officers as " wethouders , " holders of the law or constitution . The very name emphasizes the importance of their trust and suggests that any dereliction means a failure to carry a burden as well as a betrayal of a trust . To observe the law is natural to a Dutchman , though he protests against nature in his daily war with the sea . His existence in many instances has demanded obedience to a call to strengthen a dike or make it higher , to prevent the water from following the law of gravity impelling it to seek its level . He joins his force to that of others to prevent disastrous overflows and day by day gives an affirmative answer to the question , " Am I my brother 's keeper ? " While law-abiding , he sees to it that no laws are enacted that are impractical to enforce , and , above all , that his rights as an individual are not encroached upon . In no land is so high an estimate placed  |p629  upon personal liberty as in Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational system . Free schools had their beginning in the Netherlands , and yet compulsory education has never found favor there , because its enforcement would mean the placing over the delinquent child an authority superior to that of the parent . BEGGARS ARE NEVER SEEN IN HOLLAND The children bereft of parents are well taken care of in this land . Orphan asylums are abundant and their conduct is beyond reproach . When we see passing by the boy with the two-colored suit ? half red and half black , with the dividing line apparently cutting him in twain ? we are apt to think it cruel to place upon the unfortunate such a conspicuous badge proclaiming his dependence ; but it is a feature of economic administration . When the boys are sent out on errands or allowed a vacation , they are sure to return , for by their unmistakable uniform they are known , and it is a punishable offense to harbor an inmate of an asylum or aid in his escape . Homes for the aged are seen in every city , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not drive out the home in the Luisen Gasse . There are no doubt beggars in the Holland cities , but they are never seen . The only semblance to one I ever saw was an old man who stood all day long by the door of a dentist . He had evidently learned how relieved one feels upon leaving the chair of torture , and so he stood there to receive the coins dropped into his hand as a sort of thankoffering . When the Dutch made of their country an ark of refuge for all whom other lands oppressed , the Jews came in numbers , and , finding here opportunities for their skill in trade and commerce , they remained and added greatly to the prosperity of the home of their adoption . They not only contributed to the nation 's wealth , but they contributed more nobly by precept and example to the great work of caring for the poor . On this subject alone a book could be written . So deeply is the question of local administration of charitable funds and the alleviation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they preferred rather to see a ministry fall than yield to the governmental demand for governmental direction of charities . THE PAWNBROKING SHOPS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE MUNICIPALITIES Where else can one find an organization similar to the Society of General Welfare ? This society , with a membership taken from all classes , has for its purpose the general advancement of prosperity , and seeks to promote the intellectual , moral , and social condition of the people by fostering education , by ennobling their concept of life , by increasing the earning capacity of the wageearner , and by enabling him to better enjoy the fruits of his labor . In the hundred and twenty years of its existence it has spread abroad good , popular , and cheap books , improved the schools , rewarded deeds of valor , instituted popular lectures , and finally became such a recognized instrument for good that the government on more than one occasion sought the aid and advice of the society , and its usefulness so appeals to the people at large that one person out of four hundred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that in all the world there is no charitable organization that enjoys such a widespread membership . Does any other country maintain by private subscription colonies in which poor families are placed and aided to support themselves by cultivating a plot of ground given them at a small rental ? Can any nation boast of pawn-broking establishments created by law and administered by the municipalities ? And we would seek in vain for larger per capita deposits in the postal savings bank than we find in Holland . We can do well to repeat the words of Louis XIV : " Have no fear for Amsterdam . I firmly  |p630  believe Providence will save her because of her benevolence to the poor . " The perambulator passing by suggests the joy its occupant brought to the home of which it is now a part . Its appearance was regarded by all relatives and friends as a very happy event . In some parts of Holland the dwelling which a little stranger has thus mysteriously entered possesses , by an old law , peculiar privileges and immunities . No outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which a son or daughter has been added . It is secure from legal executions , from duns and bailiffs ; and soldiers , even in time of war , can not be quartered on the premises . THE DUTCH ARE THE SECOND LARGEST HOLDER OF AMERICAN SECURITIES Across the canal that passes my corner is a building into and out of which men are constantly passing . It is an unpretentious house , quite like its residential neighbors . It is only upon coming near that the brass door-plate can tell you that here a banking business is conducted .  |p631  If you will enter , you will see but little to suggest business activity and nothing that is sumptuous in the way of furnishing . In the high board partition are many windows with closed shutters having above a sign stating its functions . After selecting the one that promises the service you require , you approach , the shutters open , and in whatever language you find most convenient state your errand . In a time that seems long to one accustomed to the rush of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering how this can be the great institution that takes such a large share in the world 's transactions . Express your wonder to your consul , and he will tell you how one of its officers just left with an invoice covering a shipment of a million dollars ' worth of bonds to the United States , and how he would not be surprised if a similar visit should be made every day of the week . He could tell you that the Dutch are the second largest holders of American securities , and that governments seldom make loans until the Amsterdam bankers are consulted regarding the terms proposed . The Bank of Amsterdam was founded in 1609 , for the purpose of issuing guaranteed certificates , which are known in our day as bank notes . Against these notes coin was held , at one time reaching the enormous sum of $18o,000,000 . The business world was so confident of the solvency of the bank that these certificates were universally at a premium . The bank was under the management of the Amsterdam corporation , the chiefs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of the amount stated by the managers . It should be mentioned that this institution antedated the Bank of England by nearly a century . GAUGING THE WATER LEVEL Prom my window I can see in the canal , against its walled face , a board projecting above the water . With its black horizontal lines and figures it looks like a giant thermometer without the tube of mercury . At the top are the letters A. P. , and the numbers have minus signs . If one watches the water level , one will observe that clay by day there is a slight fluctuation in the point reached by the water 's surface . A single question would elicit the information that this is a gauge , that the letters A. P. signify the bench-mark of , Amsterdam , or the zero to which all water levels are referred , and that the minus sign indicates that the water thus recorded is below this zero . When you first learn that the water upon which you are looking is below the level of the sea you shudder ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than the ocean that beats against its shores you trgmble . There are many such gauges placed in the canals of Holland , and , being connected by precise levels , the markings on all are exact in reference to the Amsterdam zero . Since a large number of smaller canals are emptied by wind pumps into each larger and higher one , the pumping at each transfer station can not be unlimited , for then water might be put into a canal more rapidly than it could be pumped out . Then , too , the final canals emptying into the sea have their discharge limited by the height of the tide at their mouths . Thus ' it is necessary that at each station the height of water should have a fixed and defined limit . Then the man in charge of each station is told that he must not pump after the water in the receiving canal has reached a certain height , and that the water in the lower canal should be kept below a certain level ? that is , if it rises above that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be seen that a local engineer might be embarrassed by conflicting orders . He may be forbidden to pour water into one canal because it is ready to overflow , and know at the same time that the lower canal is dangerously full . Fortunately for him , he is not called upon to worry about this . The latter condition had already been observed by the district inspector , and notices served that pumping into this lower canal should cease at once . The canals still lower might thereby be in danger of overflow , but that would cause  |p632  the pumps still lower down to stop until the individual farmers would be forced to throw their wind pumps out of gear . This might cause some fields to become submerged , but the principle is observed that it is better for the water to rise gently over a few fields than to have a large canal burst its banks , and the rushing waters endanger life as well as property . This entire question of drainage , the conduct of river waters to the sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Water Affairs . So important is this department that it might be called the Ministry of Interior Defense and Internal Expansion . As you ride along in the cars you sometimes see windmills so small that you are inclined to think they are toys . Not so . They are sentinels . With vane outstretched it is always in the wind , and is ready to , respond just as soon as it is thrown into gear . This is accomplished by a wooden float on the surface of the water immediately under it . The rising water lifts the float , and when it reaches a height which threatens to submerge the surrounding fields the machine is thrown into gear , and the revolving wings warn the farmer to start his pump and keep it going until his , truthful ally coming to rest tells him that the danger is past . DRIVING OUT THE SEA Just outside of Amsterdam there was , years ago , an inland sea over which vessels sailed , and on which at one time a fleet of seventy vessels gave battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the waters of the lake into the very streets of Amsterdam . They swept over fields , and covered the opposing dikes , and even bridges . On Christmas day a fierce east wind arose and hurled the waters of the lake back again , and did not rest until a part of Leyden was inundated . An entire year was consumed in freeing the submerged land , and great losses resulted from the overflow . This was the final provocation . The challenge was accepted , and the battle was to be to the death . An encircling dike was constructed , with a large canal on its outer face . Into this great pumps , lifting a thousand cubic feet at each stroke , poured the water of the lake into the encircling canal . After thirty-nine months the commission charged with this work made the laconic report , , " The lake is dry , " and the medal they issued in commemoration of the event contained in Latin the inscription : " Haarlem Lake , after having for centuries assailed the surrounding fields , to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of machinery , has returned to Holland its 44,280 acres of invaded land . " These acres are now occupied by about twelve thousand people , and their products are the choicest of the land . In this vast plain , so recently the foraging ground of crabs , lobsters , and eels , straight roads are bordered with feathery-topped trees such as Hobbema painted ; substantial and even elegant farm-houses are seen on every hand ; throughout the commune there are police , cemeteries , fire companies ? all the appliances of Dutch civilization ? as well organized as in any of the older districts . The commission is quite pardonable when , after recounting the material benefit resulting to the state , it says : " But this is not all ; we have driven forever from the bosom of our country a most dangerous enemy ; we have at the same time augmented the means for defending our capital in time of war . We have conquered a province in combat without tears and without blood , where science and genius took the place of generals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still within the borders of Holland thousands of acres of first-rate mud aching to contribute toward the making of Dutch cheese for the foreign markets , but their existence is smothered out by the same thousands of acres of overlying brackish water . There are also many Dutch fingers itching to feel  |p633  the guilders that would come in exchange for the cheeses thus produced . In time the government will set about to relieve the aching and the itching , and the Zuyder Zee , passing into history like the Haarlem Lake , will place seven hundred square miles at the disposal of the Dutch farmers . The soil thus rescued will , for a time , give out a leaden cloud of fever and ague which no steam pump yet invented can lift away , but which will be worked off -- by Dutch patience and quinine . EVERYBODY IN HOLLAND LOVES FLOWERS In the world of horticulture Haarlem and tulips are synonymous . It is here that the air is filled with a delicious perfume and the eye charmed by the sight of acres of hyacinths or tulips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the brightest colors in their designs , laid down by mother earth for her own housekeeping . Here are seen tulips uncolored , fine , and superfine ; monsters , hybrids , and thieves classified into a thousand orders of nobility and elegance ; tinted with all the shades of color conceivable ; spotted , striped , and speckled with leaves fringed , waved , and festooned ; decorated with medals of silver and gold ; distinguished by the names of artists , generals , and statesmen ; characterized by bold and loving adjectives recalling crossings , adventures , and triumphs ? all leaving a sweet confusion in the mind of beautiful images and pleasant thoughts . Everybody in Holland loves flowers . The winter is long and bleak , so when spring comes nature breaks forth in beauteous rejoicing , and man looks with gladness upon the evidence that summer is near . Upon the banks of our canal there is every Thursday a flower market , and as I look out I see a man admiring with wistful gaze the potted plants and flowers before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a diamondcutter . The wheel he carries is the revolving disk against which he presses the little gem that mocks him with its brightness and defies him with the impossibility of its possession . For him the seasons pass without change or chance , the days come and go , the hours follow in an unbroken repetition of wistful work , and life , creeping darkly on , knows no rest until its end has come . To one who makes a rapid run through Holland there comes a feeling of disappointment . He sees less of the amphibious element than he had expected ; the people move too slowly to justify the claims made for their attainments , and there is a dearth of the quaint costumes of which he had heard so much . But for the person with eyes open to the beauties of art , mind keen to grasp the effects of environment upon character , and heart responsive to efforts put forth for the amelioration of sorrow and suffering , no land under the sun possesses so much of interest or gives so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladness , and the fleetest agencies of transportation , in taking me thither , would move too slowly were it not that , on stepping aboard one of the ships of N. A. S. M. , the captain 's greeting calls to mind the fact that I am under the flag of Holland . In leaving , my eyes look with a sentiment of respect and tenderness upon the flower-decked windows , the silver helmets , the livid sea , the downs , and the windmills that bristle over the landscape and swing their arms as if in adieu . There is a feeling of depression as the gables , masts , and steeples fall behind . The gathering haze of distance softens the outlines of things material , and there cone the visions of Rembrandt , Erasmus , Boerhave , Grotius , Barentz , William of Orange , gracious Wilhelmina , and all the beautiful and noble images of that glorious , modest , and austere country . But , like the days of sojourn , these visions , too , pass away , but memory brings cheer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ToT WEERSIENS. "  |p634
