txt Revolt against the Aldrich bill took a new form to-day , when Senator William Alden Smith of Michigan , in his maiden speech , made the flat declaration that the proposed legislation Is not only vicious , but that it would force the United States into Government ownership of railroads , and at the same time give the railroads a voice in the dictation of legislation . An Administration Senator , Beveridge , upheld his oontenttons . Senator Beveridge Interrogated Aldrich until the latter nearly lost his temper . The serious development , however , is the rebellion of the majority against the Aldrich measure . Nelson began it and Smith followed . Now Beveridge has thrown in his influence with the malcontents . There is also a growing opposition among Western Senators . The Democrats to-night have hopes , if the Republican opposition holds together , of either defeating the measure or causing its promoters some anxious moments , " Instead of creating a. market for securities , " said Senator Smith , " It will prevent the real foundation of one . It will lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coming within the purlieus of this legislative act . " might mean Government Ownership . The Senator declared that one of the most prominent financiers and bankers in New York had urged him to raise his voice against the " iniquitous clause " in the Aldrich measure which gave preference to certain bonds while decrying others . This man referred specially to the omission of Philippine Railroad bonds from those favored . " This man Is in earnest , " said the Senator . " He says , ' For God 's sake , do n't discriminate against our bonds . It would be the worst black eye ever administered to our whole financial system . ' I am Inclined to side with him . " Let me point out to the Senator from Rhode Island that when your currency is based on railroad bonds you are in a dangerous position . You may be forced to foreclose on the property these bonds represent in order to protect your curreacy ... In , this case you are forced into the operation of railroads ; you are compelled to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme . This is not a fantastic picture . We little thought that ' when we voted funds for the St. Louis Exposition we would hale a Government official taking tickets at the door . " Impossible to Fix Values . He then showed that out of $6,000,000,000 of railroad bonds in the United States less than $2,000.000,000 would be available for use under the provisions of the bill . This , he said , would be discrimination of the grossest kind , and would inflate the prices of certain bonds at the expense of others . Then he called attention to the fact that it would be almost impossibig to fix the value of such bonds . " The twentieth section of the so-called railroad act covers that completely , " retorted Aldrich . " I differ with that statement , " said Smith with emphasis . " You know the letter written by the Inter-State Commerce Commission in reply to your inquiry said there was no machinery under the Government by which these values can be ascertained . " He denounced the absolute power placed with the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be eligible for hypothecation as collateral for currency issues . He also charged that the bill would retard transportation development , because a road would be compelled to wait five years for the Government indorsement . " This measure would put a complete damper on railroad construction , " said the Senator . Fears Undue Railroad Influence . The Senator said that with the National Treasury filled with railroad securities , the railroad men would be in a position to call a halt on legislation and enforce their demand by manipulation of their properties . " I am not in favor of inviting railroad and quasi public corporations to take a hand in National politics , " said Smith , " As a rule , they are sufficiently active in this regard . " Aldrich made a brief reply to Smith . An interesting three-cornered debate ensued between Aldrich , Smith , and Beveridge , which was interrupted by Bailey . The Texas Senator asked if it were not true that the Secretary of the Treasury at the present time , without warrant in law , is accepting railroad securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit it . Owen introduced a resolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury to furnish revised figures of the receipts and expenditures of the Sub-Treasuries throughout the country . AUTOI STS JEER VICTIM . Women In Car Laugh at Woman That Was Struck and Badly Injured . Shouting with laughter , three women in a large touring car urged their two men companions to put on all speed after the car had struck and seriously injured Mrs. ' Caroline Felisen of Putnam Avenue , Brooklyn , while she was crossing Flush ' ing Road , near Junction Avenue , in Coro ' na , Queens Borough , yesterday afternoon . She called to the automobilists to stop . Instead , the women only laughed and shouted taunting remarks at her . Mrs. Felisen was carried back to her aunt 's home , where it was found that one of her legs was broken , and that she ' was badly cut and bruised about the body .
