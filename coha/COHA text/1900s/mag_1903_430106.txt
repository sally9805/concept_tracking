 | FRENCH history tells us that when playthings were wanted for the young Dauphin , Colbert. the great minister of Louis XIV. , seeing that other countries excelled in their manufacture , imported costly toys from foreign countries , and that such an insult to home trade aroused vehement protest from the French manufacturers of toys . And we can imagine that throughout the whole course of Colbert 's administration the manufacturers and workmen grasped many an opportunity to condemn his policy of importing foreign productions and foreign artisans . For , protectionist though he was , Colbert knew that to place France in the foremost rank of artproducing countries , her artisans must first attain a high standard of taste , and their taste he stimulated by importing from far and near specimens of the best products of the many branches of art industries . However the artisans of his own day may have abused him , the French art workers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had only cause to thank Colbert for having raised the art manufactures of France to the highest level . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sevres factory , woodcarvers , metal - workers , jewelers , printers , and bookbinders , soon found that French wares had the whole civilized world for a market , and to-day the French manufacturer of art products is still being benefited by Colbert 's seventeenth-century educational policy . America has never had her Colbert , but men of discernment can see in the proclivities of certain of our rich men to form art collections an incalculable benefit to the American artisans and art manufacturers of the future . For they see that art patrons like Mr. Walters , of Baltimore ; Mr. Layton , of Milwaukee ; Mr. Corcoran , of Washington ; Mr. Searles , in San Francisco ; Messrs . Morgan and Vanderbilt , of New York , and hundreds of others who have donated small collections to art galleries like the Art Institute in Chicago , the art academies of Philadelphia and Cincinnati , and the art museums of New York and Boston , in their act of obtaining masterpieces of art of the past from Europe are performing the same salutary function of educating public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. MARQUAND . By John S. Sargent . ( Presented to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by a number of gentlemen . It now hangs in the Marquand room. )  | And the Congressmen who see in these art patrons only the enemy of the American producer , and seek to curtail their importations by a high tariff , simply prove themselves to be shortsighted politicians for whom the art workers of the next generation will have nothing but scorn . For every wood carving , every ivory , every bronze , and every painting that such pa trons are debarred from purchasing because of a prohibitory tariff is an incalculable loss to the generations of art workers to come . It is , moreover , a laughable feature of the situation that the very men our Congressmen suppose they are " protecting " by this high tariff ? the art workers ? are the very ones who protest against such nonsense . Our artists are only too . anxious to have the standard of art taste in America elevated by having the fine specimens of art brought into this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importing . It will be seen , therefore , from this educational point of view , that although the Marquand sale ( which took place in New York last month and occasions this brief paper ) was simply the auctioning of the household effects of a private citizen , it had a national significance . for sooner or later every one of the two thousand articles disposed of may become an object-lesson for American art workers . A word or two of comment and the bare mention of some of these treasures may give the reader a suggestive conception of what made up the contents of the house of a patron of the fine arts of whom Russell Sturgis said , in the catalogue introduction : " He bought like an Italian prince of the Renaissance . He collected for his own delight and for the enjoyment of his many friends . A noble Van Dyck portrait appealed to him , and so did a Persian vase. ? . . . ( In his house ) " It was not really confusion ; it was profusion . The splendor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tranquil sweetness of another . " First and foremost . the English portraits call for mention . Typical examples of Reynolds , Raeburn , Romney , Hoppner , and Russell held  | their own though flanked by rich Renaissance tapestry , Persian tiles , and Roman glass . It may be remarked that historical portraits of this kind may be viewed as ethnological data , for we thus have preserved for us national types ; not as they might he in the wax effigies of museums of science . hut caught in the very act , as it were . of every-day pose and expression . Herr Conried , the theatrical manager , has recently said that " a national theater should be the linquisite supreme court ; it should be the final appeal on questions of etiquette . " Similarly does a gallery of portraits ( as in the National Gallery in London ) become a supreme court of bearing , not only indicating the deportment of , our own time . but the carriage . of bygone centuries . The Chesterfields that otherwise would simply exist in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the artist 's canvas vividly before us . So that a painting like Romney 's " Portrait of Mrs. Wells , " the eighteenth-century actress , has a documental value as well as an aesthetic value . The very charming pose of the figure , leaning forward and looking at us with an almost childlike frankness , is in its way as perfect an example of grace as are the Tanagra figurines . We may consider this portrait as typifying the bearing of the refined woman par excellence of the eighteenth century . But equally precious as human documents are the bust portraits of " Charles Lamb , " by Raeburn. and of " Young Shelly , " by Hoppner . It was no slight matter to be able to gaze on the frank faces of these two great lights in English literature , to see them as they appeared in the freshness of their youth . The student of literature , apt to picture Lamb in the bent senility portrayed in the Maclise portrait ( where he is seated before a table on which are two candlesticks ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the early age of thirty .  | Artistically considered , " the portrait of the Countess of Nottingham by Sir Joshua Reynolds was perhaps the finest in the collection . Nothing could be more suave in outline than this profile , beautiful like a classic cameo . " Dedham Vale , " by John Constable , one of his greatest landscapes , is at first sight disappointing . The foreground is uninteresting , the cows poorly painted ; but the middle distance is superb in its pearly grays , and it was far and away the landscape gem of the Marquand collection . But there were fair examples of " Old Crome , " Rousseau , Corot , Decamps , and Troyon ; several Turner water colors. very modern in their atmospheric effect ; and a number of American landscapes by men of the older school , as Cole , Kensett , and R. Swain Gifford . One of the very precious things in the collection was the " Madonna and Child , " by Luca della Robbia , made from such common clay as bricks are made of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ china plates , yet an altogether fascinating creation . The  | figure of the child is as well-nigh perfect as a Raphael painting or a Michael Angelo marble , and the whole group is charming in sentiment . This , and the della Robbia Medallion of a Young Man , " and a baby 's figure by the modern ceramist , Duquesnoy , indicated what possibilities there are in this much-neglected but now about to be revived branch of the arts . It is not every day in the year that an American has the chance to see even the slightest example of Limoges enamels and it is a red-letter day indeed when he can see an authenticated example of the master in enamels , Leonard Limousin , as he saw in the superb , , Screen or Retable for an Altar " ? twenty-one figures drawn with a Botticelli grace and rich in reticent blues , red , and gold , that Mr. Marquand in a happy hour had secured for this country . George H. Boughton 's art is not in itself of such a quality as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his subjects always interest , and there is a rural charm about his Golden Afternoon , Luccombe Chine , Isle of Wight " ( which hung in the Metropolitan Museum for some years ) , and a human interest in his " Marvell 's Last Visit to Milton , " that can not be gainsaid . Although Mr. Marquand formed his collection of antiques entirely from foreign sources , as needs must be , America yielding little to speak of in that department ( save a luminous window by John La Farge ) , in his collection of paintings he did not ignore American productions , for , out of sixty-five artists represented , eighteen were Americans . Still , it is to be regretted that among the oil paintings there were not examples of La Farge , William M. Hunt , George Inness , Winslow Homer , Dewing , and Thayer . Abbey was , however , well represented by his charming water color , , , Mariana e Measure for Measure . " The composition is not without flaws , ? the Gothic cabinet is made too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pigments lack the quality of transparent aquarelle , but Mariana 's pose is most happy , and the picturesqueness of the scene , and the details , knowingly wrought out , as in all of Abbey 's work , make the picture a scholarly and a deservedly popular one . There were painter-etchings by Whistler , Rem176 THE AMERICAN MONTHL  | brandt , Zorn , Haden , and Herkomer , and reproductive etchings by Rajon , Waltner , and Macbeth , and engravings in stipple by Bartolozzi , Tompkins , Burke , and Caroline Watson . Lack of space prevents detailed mention of the Hispano-Moresque platters , the Japanese lacquers , bronzes , ivories , and pottery , examples of Chippendale furniture , exquisite Greek and Roman and Spanish glass , antique Dutch and English silver . perfect Wedgwood cups , and colorful Dresden and Delft china ; Greek coins , ancient gold jewelry , cameos and intaglios , snuffboxes , watches , and other cabinet objects ; Persian tiles , embroideries and textiles , Oriental rugs , and many other articles that go to make up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ages that are the desideratum of the art connoisseur . As Mr. Marquand was a charter member of the Grolier Club , it was not a surprise to find among his prints and books some precious examples of the graphic arts . Among the mezzotints were John R. Smith 's superb print of " Mrs. Carnac. " after Sir Joshua Reynolds , which brought , as the catalogue tells us , ? 1,218 at the Edgcumbe sale ? the highest price yet recorded for a mezzotint portrait . A print of Lady Catherine Pelham Clinton and one of Mrs. Stanhope were both after Reynolds , as was the sparkling print of Lady Charles Spencer , engraved by W. Dickinson . Besides these and other examples of the " old masters " of mezzotint , MacArdell , C. Turner , James and Thomas - Watson , and Cousin . there was an example of a modern master , Frank Short , The , Mouth of the Thames . " after J. M. W. Turner . Examples of paintings , engravings . tapestries , glass , ceramics , etc. , when gathered together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told the visitor very forcibly how attractive the houses of the rich may become if furnished by the treasures selected from the rich " finds " of antique art . Even visitors who could not have comprehended one-tenth of the intrinsic value of the objects must have felt that the mellow canvases of the English school , the colorful Limoges enamels , the beautiful reliefs of the Renaissance , contained a charm akin to the language of Shakespeare or the melodies of Each and Haydn . But Mr. Marquand 's beneficence upon the American art worker was by no means wholly the indirect one that accrues from the distribution throughout the country of his collection sold last month . His memory demands an inscription in the hall of fame of art patrons because of his interest in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , of which he was president from 1889 to the time of his death , 1902 , and to which he presented the superb collection of old masters which hangs in Gallery No. 6 , designated as " The Marquand Room . " Here is Rembrandt 's superfine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of " James Stuart , Duke of Richmond and Lenox , " vivid portraits by Frans Hals , Velasquez , and Terburg , and valuable examples of Van Eyck , Metsu , Cuyp , and Van der Meer of Delft . There are , besides , in the sculpture halls and in other galleries rare art objects donated by Mr. Marquand , that attest his concern for the welfare of the museum . Henry Gurdon Marquand was born in New York , April 11 , 1819 , he was educated at Pittsfield , Mass. , and was for twenty years manager of his brother 's real-estate interests , and later , for ten years , a banker . He was president of the Iron Mountain Railroad . Besides his gifts to the Metropolitan Museum , he presented a chapel and ( with Robert Bonner ) a gymnasium to Princeton University ; with his brother , he gave a pavilion to Bellevue Hospital .
