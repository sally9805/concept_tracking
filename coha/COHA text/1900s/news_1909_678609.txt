txt If Dr. Coox was inclined to chaff the reporters who intercepted him on the steamer at the Skaw , the northernmost point of Denmark , he should have bethought him that his statements would result in fooling the- world , which is just now disposed to consider them , and him , seriously . Yet in one of his two statements here reproduced he must have been fooling the reporters : Thete is nothing to see at the pole but ice , ice , ice ; no water , only lee . There were more holes here than at the 87th degree , which shows there is a movement ' and drift here , but this and other observations I made afterward when I got more settled . My answer to all doubters is : " If you do not believe my story go have a look at the . pole yourself . I will show you the way . I have buried a small brass tube under a stone where the flag stands . In that brass tube is to be found a short statement about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook said he found a stone in a sea of floating ice and far from shore under which to bury his memorial . Our own report mentions merely a " small brass tube which I have burled under the flag . " But even so it is incredible that Dr. Cook should presume that the brass tube and the flag would now mark the location of the pole , or that the drifting pack should not have melted and split apart in'the arctic Summer , sending his brass tube to the bottom . Then , too , Dr. COOK apparently reaffirmed the statement of his original dispatch , that the temperature at one stage of his journey descended to 83 degrees below zero , stating it this time " minus 83 degrees centigrade . " This he corrected yesterday to minus 83 degrees Fahrenheit . Eighty-three degrees below even the Fahrenheit zero would be below the freezing point of alcohol ; the exposure of human eyes in such a temperature would quickly congeal them in their sockets . Dr. Cook must have said these things I jocularly . Jocularity is dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his more sober statements will doubtless follow .
