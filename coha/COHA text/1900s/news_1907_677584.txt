txt Josiah Quincy , ex-Mayor of Boston . now a bankrupt , told to-day a strange story of his connection with the persons involved in the great Trust Company of America bond robbery , or as much of it as be thought fit to make public at this time . The chapters that were related , covering in substantial detail the events of the four days preceding the crisis and the day of the arrest of Douglas , form one of the most remarkable developments of a criminal case that Is perhaps without precedent in American finance . Broken in spirit and health as well as in fortune , the man who was once a lead- ' ing Democratic figure of New England . gave an account of things that made him a victim of circumstances in his temporary connection with Oliver M. Dennett and William 0 . Douglas , but there remained when he was done to-night some chinks to be filled . Mr. Quincy frankly admitted this and promised more when it might appear what references to him were contained in the confessions of Dennett and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that he had to say from one end of the day to the other was said in the light of his original remarkable statement to newspaper men who sought him out : " It must be obvious to you gentlemen that I know more about this matter than has appeared thus far . " Talked of 81,000,000 Theft . . But as to the conspiracy of Douglas and Dennett to rob the Trust Company to the extent to which it was revealed to him in personal meetings with one of the principals as far . back as Wednesday of last week and by subsequent interviews with them that were separated hardly by hours from the time of the exposure of last Saturday morning , Mr. Quincy was explicit . And these assertions of what Mr. Dennett told him placed the total amount of the bonds stolen at figures far in execss of any of those which have previously appeared . In fact , the first version that Mr. Quincy received from Dennett bad it that $1,000,000 of bonds had been taken . Later on this amount was reduced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy , now that it is known that nearly $200,000 of bonds had been taken prior to the time when detection seemed assured , that $400,000 were taken on Friday . when Douglas was living in expectation of making his final break the following day , and another $50.000 on the Saturday morning of the exposure . Incidentally Mr. Quincy cleared another point that has been figuring in the case pretty largely thus far . He admitted frankly that he was the man to whom the rumors had referred , which coup'ed to the Trust Company of America case the failure of the Seventh National Bank , six years ago this Summer . For be was a director of the Seventh National Bank , brought in there as a member of the syndicate which Perry Heath and Fletcher had organized . His resignation antsdated by some months the failure . There was another Bostonian in that case whose memory has lingered in Wall Street 's mind . He was Harry Bates , Josiah Quincy 's financial nemesis , but Bates has been dead two years , and what appears of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present . There seems now no other man " higher up , " save the present self-explained victim of circumstances . Mr. @they 's First Statement . Mr. Quincy was early at his office at 15 State Street this morning and received New York reporters who came to him with certain information , pointing to some positive connection between himself and the men concerned in the Trust Company of America robbery . He talked briefly to these men , said hardly more than the words quoted above , and then n'ent into : conference with his counsel , Col. William A. Gaston , now the active head of the Democratic State machine here , and the active man in the Boston traction system . Col. Gaston , Josiah Quincy , and President Roosevelt were all at Harvard together , and  --  the two men first mentioned have been firm - friends for years through personal and social associations . At noon Mr. Quincy gave out this statement , but agreed to receive reporters later on , when more had been heard /Tom New 1 ork : . " The little information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York is given an altogether exaggerated importance in the press this morning . : Same eight years ago I had a very slight acquaintance with Mr. Dennett as cashier cf the Beacon Trust Company here . I never saw him or knew anything of him from that time until he called binwelf to ' my recollection at the Manhattan Club on Wednesday morning , April 17 , when he Tasked me if I was practicing law and would consider taking up a matter about - which he desired to consult me . I listened ' to what he had to say , both then and later In the afternoon , as the situation of which ale gave me a general outline , which he did without mentioning any names , either of Institutions or individuals or driminally implicating himself , was evidently of a serious nature . I spent the next two days , Thursday and Friday , in Boston . " On Saturday I met Mr. Dennett again et the club and informed him that I had // BOND THEFT PLOT TOLD TO QUINCY // decided that I would not accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I stated that if he desired I would turn It over to my brother-in-law , Mr. Robertson Honey , who I knew sometimes took criminal cases , and this was subsequently done . I have no relations . whatever with the Trust Company of American , and I have absolutely no information , even if I considered myself professionally free to give it , which would throw any further . light on the defalcation . " When He First Knew Dennett . When the reporters had returned Mr. Quincy explained that ho and his counsel agreed that no formal statement would be issued other than the one at noon , but he was willing in an informal way to tell his side of the story from the beginning . In the first place , he said , his acquaintance with Dennett was confined absolutely to the incident of eight years ago , when Quincy was Mayor of Boston and Densrintt was the cashier of the Beacon Trust Company . It was Bates who brought them together at that time ; Bates , who was so close to Quincy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of his Mayoralty he left a pile of notes signed in blank for Bates to fill out as he needed them . Bates did so and some of the notes appear in the Quincy bankruptcy schedules . The moving incident of the Dennett-Quincy meeting was the placing of some paper of a concern In which Bates and the Mayor were interested in the Beacon Trust Company . Denying absolutely that he had seen Dennett or so much as remembered the existence of such an individual , Mr. Quincy jumped from the Beacon Trust episode down to Tuesday of last week , when he returned to New York , where his wife and child had been living for five weeks or more . It was to attend the Bryan banquet in Brooklyn that the trip was made , and , arriving at the Grand Central Station at 6 o'clock , instead of going to his apartment at 128 Central Park South to dress , he went to the Manhattan Club , of which he had long been a member . There awaited him a telephone message from 0 . M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some matters of business . " Mr. Quincy left word for Dennett to call him up at the apartment the next morning . Dennett did so , remarking , according to Mr. Quincy to-day , when the Bostonian said that he did not remember his wouldbe client : " You will remember me when you see me . " Dennett Tells Him of Theft . An ' appointment was arranged at the Manhattan Club , where Mr. Quincy was reminded of the former acquaintance in Boston . Then , according to Mr. Quincy 's story , Dennett told him that he had a friend who had gotten away with a very large amount of bonds from a trust company of which he was an official , mentioning $1,000,000 as an approximate statement of the sum . Some of the bonds had been placed by Dennett under the impieesion that they had been honestly obtained from the father-in-law of the unnamed friend and it was only recently that Dennett discovered the commission of a theft . So ran the story . Mr. Quincy heard and was interested , both in it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said so to-day . , No Suggestion of Further Thefts . But Dennett continued , according to Mr. Quincy . There was no danger of detection before May 1 , and some of the bonds were in a position where they could be returned ; also some of the money that had been obtained on others . Would Mr. Quincy accept a retainer to act as counsel for his friend ? The result was more conversation , but Mr. Quincy declared to-day that there was no suggestion in it of any future stealings which might bring the total amount up to so large a figure that negotiations could be undertaken . In fact , he was on the lookout against such insinuations , and when he ' nail told of his care Mr. Quincy added : ? ' Even if I had been knave enough to have suggested such a thing . I hope that there is not any one who would put me down as so big a fool . " That was the end of the interview . Mr. Quincy went downtown having made an i appointment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , he said to-day , was a member of one of the largest firms in New York , and this lawyer told him to be on guard against any proposition that might involve a suggestion of committing a felony . Thus doubly warned , Mr. Quincy went back to see Dennett about his friend . ' There was more talk and a third appointment was made for Saturday morning , Mr. Quincy returning to Boston on Wednesday night and going back to New York again on a late afternoon train on Friday . ? It was 10:15 o'clock on Saturday , according to Mr. Quincy , when he met Dennett downtown . Where this meeting took place was one of the things that he would not say yesterday , but he exhibited surprise when his attention was called to the fact that this meeting was held just twenty-five minutes before Douglas , with the last 530.000 of bonds , left his cage in the Trust Company of America to make his escape . Tells Him on Saturday Game is Up . The conversation at the Saturday morning interview turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of having it go on until May 1 . Dennett said that auditors had been put into the company the night before in connection with the merger of the Trust Company of America and the Colonial Trust Company and the game was up . But President Thorne was in the country , Dennett thought , and Mr. Quincy was unable to understand why Mr. Thorne happened to coins back to town on Saturday morning . He was as much surprised about that as he was at the fact that Douglas left the trust company at 10:40 o'clock . whereas he and Dennett went into conference on his own statement at 10:15 o'clock . Points He Will Discuss Later . Mr. Quincy would not discuss to-day the detail of the Saturday morning meeting with Dennett more than to say that Dennett told him his friend was in imminent danger , and pressed him to accept a retainer , even offering bills of large denominations . This Mr. Quincy declined . but he did not leave Dennett for good at that time , inasmuch as he admitted today that Saturday afternoon saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detail . Mr. Quincy 's attentionewas called to the inference likely to be made that Douglas , having gone to Dennett immediately upon his departure from the trust company with the additional $50,000 of bonds , would have been present at the afternoon conference . Mr. Quincy did not question this inference , but said that it was plain that there was something yet unexplained on that line which he would discuss , if at all , after the full confessions of Douglas  --  and Dennett were . known . But what Mr. Quincy did say to-day was that he declined to act as counsel in the course of the Saturday afternoon interview , and advised that Dennett 's friend retain Robertson Honey , who sometimes took criminal cases . Honey , as has already been stated , is Mr. Quincy 's brotherin-law . Honey was retained , but just when the time came when Mr. Quincy ceased to consult and Honey took charge as counsel for Douglas the former would not say to-day . That is another point remaining still to be cleared up . After that , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kept in touch " with the situation , according to his statement yesterday . He learned early on Sunday morning of the arrest of Douglas , but from what sources he would not say . There had never been any intention of flight , but that Douglas would stay and face the music . It was Sunday morning also when Mr. Quincy heard that Douglas had made a confession . Nor had the day passed before Mr. Quincy and an official of the trust company were in conference , Mr. Quincy explaining his connection with the matter to the entire satisfaction of this official , according to Mr. Quincy 's story to-day . Mr. Quincy would n't say what official it was whom he saw or what brought them together . On Monday last Mr. Quincy came bank to Boston and within a day or two communicated with Col. Gaston , his counsel . Mr. Quincy 's family also moved back to this city on Monday . The only remaining development of interest to-day was information from New York that William F. Sheehan , counsel or trust company one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Mr. Quincy has been in touch with Mr. Honey , since ' his return from New York . ACCUSED , MEN TALK . Douglas and Dennett Make Long Statements to District Attorney . Statements were made yesterday in the District Attorney 's office by W. 0 . Douglas and Oliver M. Dennett , the two men Implicated in. the bond robbery , from the Trust Company of America . Dennett 's statement was a long one . No information was given out about what the two said . The trust company declared , through its President , Oakleigh Thorne , that it had washed its hands of the affair and that any further steps in the matter would be left to the District Attorney . Douglas was taken to the office of As- , sistant District Attorney Murphy as soon as he . came from the Tombs . President Thorne and the prisoner 's lawyer , Robertson Honey , were also present , and after a conference of about half an hour Douglas was led back to the Tombs . s Dennett was taken to Mr. O'Connor 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent fors and Dennett was dictating to him all the morning . Forbes J. Hennessey , his lawyer , was present , and Mr. Murphy went in and out of the room , but did not stay the whole time . Lunch was sent to the prisoner in the District Attorney 's office , and he did not finish telling all he had to say until 4 o'clock . It is believed that he was going through the history of his business career , and that some of his revelations were complete surprises to Mr. Jerome . When Dennett had finished Douglas was brought back and proceeded to give his version of the affair . It was nothing like as long as that of Dennett , and was over in an hour . Mr. Jerome took the strictest precautions to prevent anyone giving out any information of what had been said . He himself departed by the afternoon train to his country home near Lakeville , where he will stay till Monday . Company Repeats Loss Is S140,000 . Though no official denial was made yesterday of the statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500,000 ; President Thorne repeated that the actual loss of the trust company would not exceed $140,000 . Probably some of the bonds taken before the final coup , when Douglas took $400,000 worth , were restored by Douglas after they had served his turn as collateral for a short period . Other bonds were recovered a day or two after the robbery had been discovered . Mow large that amount was is not known . The one - hundred - and-forty-thousanddollar loss is made up of $77,000 actually paid out for the recovery of bonds and $63,000 due on bonds belonging to the company , which are still in the hands of brokers until it can be judicially determined who should bear the loss of the sums lent upon them as collateral . It is believed that when the game was up and Douglas made his big haul as many of the bonds as possible were hypothecated , and it is understood that about all Douglas told Oakleigh Thorne after he was arrested was where these securities could be located . It is possible that same interesting information on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is pretty well known that until the prisoners were taken over to Mr. Murphy 's office yesterday neither of them had " squealed . " ' Oakleigh Thorne declared yesterday that so far the exact number of bonds which had been taken had not been determined , and that his only interest was in the result of the whole business . He had an informal conference with the other officials of the trust company in the afternoon and then went off to Milibrook , N. Y. , on a fishing trip until Monday . As a matter of fact , a firm of chartered accountants is going through the boolcs and the securities of the company . So far the State Department of Banking has done nothing . The Trust Company informed the department on Monday that it had called in an outside firm to audit the accounts . Until that report has been presented the State Department will take no action . Bank Department 's Plan . It developed yesterday , however , that Superintendent of Banks Keep is considering a very important step . He is thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by the trust companies of the State . They run up to enormous figures . No inspection of these funds has been made in the last eleven years , and there has been practically nothing to prevent a dishonest company taking securities from its trust funds and using them as collateral to bolster up the banking side of its business . The trust companies are supposed to report annually on their trust funds to the courts , but practically there has been no supervision of them for years . Supt. Keep 's step has nothing to do with the trouble in the Trust Company of America , and it is by a mere coincidence that he was in the city yesterday in connection with his proposed scheme . At Dennett 's office , at 42 Wall Street , the detectives were in charge all day . Two chairs were drawn against the door in the corridor . and a Pinkerton kept guard . In his search the other day . Assistant District Attorney Murphy found a letter book which has proved of great value in the examination of the prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make further search in the office . Robertson Honey , attorney for Douglas , ' refused to state yesterday how he came to be retained He said he hail not been asked by Josiah Quincy of Boston to take the case , but by a lawyer who was not in criminal practice and who recommended him as familiar with that branch of the law . When he was asked whether Douglas had written to Mr. Quincy to request him to act as his attorney he replied that he believed that Mr. Quincy had been approached in the matter as well as several other lawyers , but he afterward qualified his admission by saying that he only derived his knowledge from the newspapers . POOLROOM ' MAN INDICTED . But Special Grand Jury Does n't Name the Mysterious " Sen. G. " The Special Grand Jury empaneled for April found indictments yesterday against Edward A. Fisher , Thomas R. Keator , J. Parke Robinson , and Rooert H. Davis , a member of the Metropolitan Turf Association , charging them with maintaining a poolroom . The indictments grew out of the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 47 Broadway and 108 and 112 Fulton Street were raided recently by Third Deputy Police Commissioner Hanson acting with members of the District Attorney 's staff .
