 |p685  A VERY interesting subject for the social philosopher to investigate is found in the evolution of courtesy-titles among the nations of the West . In the days when Rome was truly Roman and before it had become hybrid and cosmopolitan , such a thing as prefixing a title to a name was quite unknown . The meanest slave in addressing the proudest patrician would call him by his nomen ; and , as in Russia to-day , no one thought of this practice as involving any suggestion of familiarity or of disrespect . And , indeed , when examined in the abstract , this was natural enough . A man 's name is given to him in order to distinguish him from other men . It is a convenient label . Why . then , should he not be called by it tout court ? Courtesy-titles came in with the Empire when the sycophancy of the courtier sought for artificial distinctions in social usage . It was not long before the Emperor began to receive titles equivalent to the English " Lord , " " Tour Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mightiness " and " Tour Grace . ' Then , after the principle had been once established , it was extended to the formal usage of all classes , until at last we find the Romans evolving various modes of polite address which find their exact parallel in our modern titles of courtesy . Thus , the poet Martial apologizes to an acquaintance because on meeting him one morning " I spoke to you accidentally by your own name and forgot to call you ' Mister ' " ( do/nine ) . Flom the second century on . it became more and more essential for persons of breeding in speaking to others to use the various prefixes which in their modified forms are adopted by all the peoples of the West who have felt the influence of Roman custom . Don , Dona , Senor , Senora , Monsieur , Madame , Mademoiselle , Sir , Mister ( Master ) . Mrs. ( Mistress ) , Miss ? these and other verbal marks of personal respect are all descended directly . even though not always etymologically , from the titles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Now in every country except our own . there is in this matter of courtesy-titles no difference between the usage of the most highly cultivated and that of the masses of the people . If anything , indeed , the man of the people in other countries observes the requirements of established custom rather more carefully than do his superiors , at least in his intercourse with them . He addresses them as they are entitled to be addressed by accepted usage . He never thinks of inventing any new titles of his own for them , nor has he any feeling about giving them their social due . If he be a German or an Englishman he even takes a certain pleasure in rolling out a sonorous " Excellenz " or an eternally recurrent " Sir . " This is because he is a believer in the claims of class and in whatever is established , and he likes in whatever he does or says to fit into the existing scheme of things . In the colonial period of American history , the case was much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted to men who belonged to the aristocratic section of English society and who in consequence brought with them all the forms and customs and observances of the class to which they themselves belonged . Moreover , this was quite as true of Puritanic Massachusetts as of Cavalier Virginia ; and indeed in Massachusetts the colonists were perhaps even more tenacious of such class distinctions as existed than were the less formal and more easygoing Southerners . They illustrated the well-known truth that at heart there is no essential difference between the Englishman who is a Whig and the Englishman who is a Tory . so far as concerns the innate conservatism of their actions . Hence today , Massachusetts is the only state in the whole Union whose Governor is by law " His Excellency " and Lieutenant-Governor His Honor , " just as it is the only state whose official proclamations end with that good old formula which smacks of English dignity ? " God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ! " This general observance of titular eti-  |p686  quette as understood and practised in the mother-country. survived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the English people . The traditional feeling was strong enough to find official expression at the time when our Constitution was adopted . for many of the framers of this instrument sought in it to bestow upon the President the title of " IIigh Mightiness ' ? a title which it is said that Washington himself desired . But by that time a change was slowly becoming perceptible in the temper of the American people . The leaven of republicanism in its strictest sense had begun to work . A certain scorn of foreign example . a certain restlessness and resentment under even the slightest restraint , a touch of lawlessness perhaps . and a growing passion for an independence which should he more than political , stirred the masses of the people . They were feeling the exhilaration of power , and they chafed as much under conventional restraint as they had formerly chafed under political injustice . American independence was already beginning to express itself as American irreverence . Yet it is interesting to remember that if our President to-day has not the legal right to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which belongs to a mere ambassador was thought too paltry for the ruler of the triumphant young Republic ; while " His HighMightiness. " which was the title adopted by the Stadtholder of Holland , was opposed by many patriots for a similar reason . The American President , if he was going to have any title at all , deserved a better one than that officially given to a Dutchmn ' The influence of the French Revolution and the rise of a Jacobin party in this country completed in popular sentiment the change which was still in embryo when Washington was inaugurated President . From 1793 to 1816 a wave of radicalism . of iconoclasm , of rampant rudeness. swept over almost the entire nation . The American people ceased to speak in modulated tones and began to yawp . It was the period of the Whisky Rebellion , of enthusiasm for all the excesses of the Parisian sans-culottes , of Citizen Genet 's astonishingly impudent defiance of Washington . the period of Jefferson 's intriguing , of the Embargo , and finally of the war with England which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American to abjure the conventions inherited from England , even though they included many of the ordinary decencies of life . The Great Unwashed began to reign ; and when Jefferson , though himself a thorough aristocrat in his thought as in his mode of life , hitched his horse to a stump and went up to the Capitol on foot to be inaugurated , he was ostentatiously sympathizing with that contempt of form which was becoming almost a religion with the masses . The Middle West , still raw and rough . was beginning to be felt ; and the typical American of that period always appears to me as a raw-boned , unshaven , vociferous . brawling creature , redolent of onions , and thrusting aside with his cowhide boots everything that belonged to the refinements of an older civilization which to him seemed only senseless or ridiculous . As with the centurion in Persius , what he already knew was enough for him to know ; and his formula was the formula of false democracy . as good as you ! " rather than the formula of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as I. " Later , a certain slyness and smugness , as of the huckster and small trader , were superadded : but down to the time of the Civil War . the American people as a whole were pretty thoroughly devoid of the graces and amenities of life as these were elsewhere known . Chroniclers like Marrvat and Mrs. Trollops and Dickens who have left enduring pictures of the manners which they found here . were of course malicious in stressing all the most unlovely phases of our social life ; yet after due allowance has been made for their unfriendliness , there can be no doubt at all that they set down substantially the truth . Just how- titles of courtesy fared during this long period of aggressive incivility it is not my purpose to consider here . Indeed , to do so would be to write a volume . nor after all would it be very satisfactory . Everything was so heterogeneous , and there were such infinite varieties of local usage , as to make an orderly analysis impossible . Suffice it to say that pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the board with the great  |p687  mass of our population . In the small communities especially . courtesy-titles. save in exceptional cases , were discarded altogether . often by an unconscious instinct that sought equality in everything , sometimes through a sort of defiant anxiety to prove by sheer offensiveness that no man had any claim to especial consideration as against another . The social spirit of the Jacksonian Epoch was that displayed by the citizen whom Martin Chuzzlewit encountered at the dinner-table of a river steamer and who sucked his knife for a moment in his tobacco-stained mouth before making a cut with it at the butter . It was shown by the Western boors who habitually spoke of Mrs. Trollope as " the English old woman- " ; and by the Chesterfield of Cincinnati who , when President Jackson visited that town in 18228 just after the death of Mrs. Jackson . greeted the distinguished soldier with " There goes Jackson ' Where 's his wife ? " It was seen in the abrogation of all modes of speech that savored of inequality of social conditions , substituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant . " and " old man " ( later " boss " ) for " master . " Just a little touch of it enters into Daniel Webster 's famous letter to the Chevalier Hiilsemann ; and traces of it unfortunately survive in the " shirt-sleeve diplomacy ' ' of very recent times . That was a long while ago . Since then . the great war has shaken our institutions into something like a definite system . Vast fortunes have been made ; we are gaining a knowledge of elegance and perhaps a taste for it ; and there is coming into existence the beginning of a system of class distinction . We are slowly establishing all over again for ourselves a new set of usages that are unlike those of any other people . As yet it is all indefinite and unsettled ; vet the curious observer may at least set down some notes for future use when the evolution shall have proceeded somewhat further . It is interesting to note that the American aversion to titles has been , in the main . consistently directed against those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frith inherited rank or place or family Titles of nobility , of course , have been especially tabooed and held up to a real or an affected ridicule . But the same thing was for a while almost as true of the minor titles of courtesy such as " Mr. " or " Esquire , " which in their way also set off the person to whom they were applied as apart from Tom , Dick and Harry . On the other hand , titles that were earned or that might be supposed to have been earned by actual achievement , were not , even in the middle of this century , disliked ; in fact , they were very much approved . And this was consistent enough . The feeling was the true American feeling of respect for the man who do ( s things . who himself is somebody . It fitly supplements the dislike of inherited distinction , which is distinction based upon what some one else has done . Hence Americans have looked kindly upon military titles , upon professional titles and upon political titles . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . they were sought and won ; and though they have been misappropriated and ludicrously abused , the original feeling in their favor was not only respectable but commendable . ' Colonel , " " Major . " " Judge , " " Doctor , " " Professor , " " Governor " and " Commissioner , " may or may not have any especial meaning in a given case . The Colonel may , to be sure . be a veteran of many battles . but he is more likely to have been at some period of his career a militia officer , or to have held an honorary appointment upon a governor 's staff . Or perhaps . especially in the South , he may never have had any martial experience at all . but the title may be meant as a recognition of general eminence . I am informed that in Georgia . for instance , any one who has attained to a high position in the practice of law and who does not happen to have secured the designation of " Judge " receives by general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Major " may have at some remote period of his career been only a drum-major ; the " Marshal " a census-taker ; the " Judge " a justice of the peace : the " Doctor " a dentist or a veterinary : the " Professor " a teacher in a local school or possibly a boxing-master , an aeronaut or a barber : and the " Commissioner " a school-commissioner ; yet none the less , the fondness for these titles springs less from an Old World love of  |p688  precedence than from a New World admiration of achievement . In other words , we have gone back to that primitive stage when titles were based upon service rather than upon birth , when the Duke was the general ( dur ) , and the Baron the stout manat-arms ( barn ) . when the Chamberlain performed household duties , when the Master of Horse and the Constable were actually in charge of the royal stables , and when the Chancellor sat behind a latticed screen ( cancan ) and did the work of an accountant . To-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent introduction of much of the external pomp and circumstance of a privileged class , the American people is beginning dimly to recognize the claims of such a class as those are understood elsewhere . Democratic simplicity is rapidly departing from the national life . When Dickens visited the United States in 1840 , he noted the fact that while in New York he saw , during his whole stay there , only one carriage driven by a man in liver -- a very lonely , unhappy-looking importation . Now , even the cabmen on the public stands get themselves up in a shabby imitation of their liveried congeners . All the employes of the great corporations such as railway and steamboat companies are made to wear a distinctive chess ; policemen , firemen , messenger-boys. hotel-attendants and elevator-men are uniformed : waiters are compelled to shave . Everywhere about us we see personal service marked by some kind of badge , and in a thousand ways the popular mind is habituated to the thought of class and caste , not long ago so foreign to it . It would be strange if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end affect the manner and the bearing of one man toward another , and if the recognition of all these distinctive divisions did not influence the forms of speech that are in vogue among us . Democratic theory can not long hold out in , me particular sphere after it has given place to undemocratic reality in every other . Just at present , then , we are working out the problem of how to make our colloquial usages fit in with what is essentially to us a brand-new social order . The attempts to solve the problem are still very crude ; for though the matter is superficially a very trifling one , it in reality goes down pretty deep into human nature , and it touches the seat of long-standing prejudice and national tradition . The man in the street , the man who needs to please . or at least not to offend , so that he may live and prosper , has come to feel that he must be compliant , that he must admit in his very speech an inequality of condition which in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no choice . Ile must become externally a respecter of persons , a thing which few Americans are naturally apt to be . So his attempts at doing what he knows to be inevitable usually represent a curious and oftentimes amusing compromise . It is a compromise between the desirability of using the Old World forms which plainly mark the difference between superior and inferior , and the American distaste for any such distinction whatsoever . And the compromise is effected , on the part of the majority of our population , by a resort to modes of address which may be held on the one hand to imply respect , and on the other hand not to impair the self-esteem and independence of the one who uses them . These modes of address are characteristically American , for they are drawn nearly always from the vocabulary of localities where they have always been employed , though not with the same implications which they are now supposed to bear . In other words , the sometimes friendly , sometimes jocular and sometimes neutral expressions of the village community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mining-camp are all being pressed into service as being titles by which a certain degree of deference may be implied without any concomitant suggestion of servility . The result is an extraordinary combination from every point of view , and is interesting alike to the social observer . to the collector of Americanisms and to the serious student of the American character . Of course , when the name of the person spoken to is known , the proper prefix is not a matter of any special doubt . No one to-day , outside of very small and very rustic communities , objects to giving any one the title ' Mr .. ' ' at least in speaking to him . There may , however , he some half-conscious dislike even for this neces-  |p689  sity , and I think there really is , else why to Americans almost universally drop the " Mr. " in speaking at ' a person ? Why do they mention any one and every one , from the President down , by his last name only or by a nickname ? Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoice to write of " McKinley " and " Bryan " and " Roosevelt " and " Platt " and " Lodge " without the courteous prefix that would make even an attack upon those gentlemen more effective in conveying the impression of moderation and self-restraint . And in private life it is just as true . The stable-boy , the laborer , the clerk , the employb of every grade , will almost invariably he heard describing his employer and his employer 's friends by their last names . It really sounds as though in doing so he were soothing his own feelings for having had to show in their presence the verbal symbols of respect . refreshing himself , as it were , by an assertion in private of his own equality . While the prefix " Mr. " is before our minds . it may be well to mention one curious use of it which prevails in certain parts of New England , more particularly in Connecticut ? a use which seems to make the prefix indicative almost of a certain disrespect in the mind of persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population is almost wholly made up of native Americans , so that a resident of foreign birth is a rarity . Now the natives all address each other by their first names or by local nicknames , and they form almost one family in the intimacy of their intercourse . But if there happens to have settled among them a stray Irishman or a German , the natives will not , even after many years , quite feel that he is one of them , that he belongs , so to speak , to their guild . He participates in all their festivities , and enters into their life completely , and he treats them with the same familiarity which they display toward one another . The delicate nuance of feeling which separates him from his neighbors in their consciousness is indicated by this one thing alone : that they almost invariably give him the prefix which they withhold from one another , styling him ' ' Mr. O'Brien " or " Mr. Muller . " And this is obviously not done because they view hint with a respect which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own number , for in their heart of hearts they look clown upon him as an alien and a foreigner . They call him " Mr. " through a more or less unconscious instinct which compels them in some way or other to set him off as one who has no real identity with them . Reverting to our main proposition , it may be said that it is not in the forms of address applied to persons whose names are known to the speaker that any particular difficulty arises . The complication begins when it is necessary to address a stranger , to call his attention suddenly , or to answer his questioning in such a way as to convey a shade of deference or at least to avoid a shade of disrespect . There is a strongly rooted American dislike to the use of the word " sir . " I do not suppose that one American in a million could give any reason whatsoever for this dislike , because the historical origin of it is unknown to the masses . In reality , however , the avoidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has descended to us from the days of feudalism. because it has all sorts of aristocratic associations , and because even to-day in England its use implies the essential inferiority of the person who uses it . As a title , it smacks of knights and baronets . As a form of address , it means that the person to whom it is applied is the superior and perhaps the master of the one who applies it to him . Consequently , the man in the street . if he wishes to attract the attention of any one who appears to be a person of consideration , will not accost him as " sir , " nor will he readily say " Yes , sir , " in answer to his questions . And vet he must call him something if he wishes to make a good impression . And here is just where we begin to observe the compromise of which I have already spoken ? a compromise which is effected in various ways according to the age and apparent station of the person addressed , and the age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least-educated section of the community , the word " boss " is getting to be perhaps the most frequent of these native titles of ours . To a newsboy or a boot-black  |p690  or the driver of a " night-hawk " or a daylabocer , " boss " connotes a certain magnificence and power and general eminence that make it in such a mind extremely flattering . A boss is always a man who is at the head of something or other ? of a gang of laborers , of a big manufacturing establishment or of a business house . At any rate , he is the head man , the man to be looked up to and to take orders from . and therefore the title is a complimentary one , while it does not compromise the person who uses it ; since the followers of a boss of any kind are his voluntary followers , and it is understood that he is their chief only for so long a time as they choose to accept his control or so long as he continues to " boss the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a political title ; and although it is used by many as a term of opprobrium , there is no doubt that with the masses it is a title of honor because with it go power and responsibility and the notoriety which . cy ith the majority of men stands for fame . Indeed , a friend of mine has very . cleverly suggested that " boss " in political parlance is the exact equivalent of the Latin word priaeeps as employed by Cicero in his comments on the political intrigues of ancient Home . Therefore , we find that there are several million Americans who if they wish to call your attention in a respectful may will do so with the introductory ejaculation , " Say , boss ! " and will answer your questions with " Yes , boss , " or " No , boss . " In the vocabulary of the newsboy and of the boot black these forms represent the highest possible degree of deference . If your appearance fails quite to come up to the standard of one who is entitled to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , mister ! " while if it . is not worth while to be ceremonious at all , you will be greeted simply as " Young feller " if you are under fifty , or , if of uncertain age , as " sully . " Some one may object , with reference to what has been said above as to the American dislike to " sir , " that in the South and West almost every sentence is punctuated with that word , and this is true . Yet its use in this way belongs to an entirely different category of usage . It is a mere trick of speech and it is not given to one person and withheld from another , but is universally employed without any intention or implication on the part of the speaker . The reason for its use in the two sections of the country just named has been a matter of speculation for many years . the prevailing opinion being that it is the child of the debating society . the public meeting and the political assembly , all so popular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at first a purely parliamentary piece of phrasing . A. much less probable theory ascribes it to an imitation of the perpetually recurring " monsieur " in French and dating from the days when everything French was intensely popular in this country : but a sufficient objection to this theory is found in the fact that the frequent use of " sir " prevails only in those sections to which the French influence never really penetrated but which have remained troth in custom and in population almost purely Anglo-Saxon . There is a stratum of our population of a class more intelligent than the class which uses " boss " as a title of courtesy . Its members are even more sensitive about appearing to accept a position of inferiority , while on the other hand they are still more anxious to avoid offense . These are the persons who are apt to select the titles which sprang up iu the rural districts , and of these titles the most popular are " neighbor " and " friend . " To inc mind there is something cruder about these than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of respect , because they imply affinity and even equality . " Neighbor. ' is a thoroughly New England Iornm. and had its original habitat in Connecticut , in western Massachusetts and in Vermont . As used in its early home , it was a friendly and rather natural term to use , savoring strongly of the small community all of whose inhabitants were closely allied by the fact of their collective isolation and their mutual dependence on one another . When one hears it , however , in a great city and upon the lips of an entire stranger , it is utterly grotesque . I do not think that it has become grafted upon the urban vocabulary of any class : and when a person in a city is found using it , investigation will generally show that he is a new-comer . Not long ago , calling at the box-office of a theater for two tickets that I had ordered , I was  |p691  thus addressed by the man who gave them to me : " Here 's your tickets , neighbor . " It seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I took a look at the man and then inquired whether lie was from Bridgeport , Connecticut , and lie answered with a great deal of surprise that he was . I was rather surprised myself that I had hit the truth so exactly ; but his Fairfield County manner was unmistakable . Of " friend , " very much the same thing may be said as of " neighbor " ; except that it is used by persons who occupy a slightly higher social stratum than that which belongs to those who call you " neighbor . " " Friend " is generally applied to you by some one who would like to drop any and every kind of title and call you simply by your name , but who is a little uncertain of how you would take such an unmistakable familiarity . He does not quite venture to drop all formality , yet he wishes to get a little nearer to you than if he were to prefix " Mr. " to your name ; and so he calls you " friend . " The persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter-writing , beginning their epistles with " Friend Brown , " for example . This form is not so rural as " neighbor , " but is best characterized as provincial ; and it is very common among a certain class of people living in the larger inland cities . such as Buffalo and Pittsburg , and in the Middle West Mr. Cleveland 's rather celebrated letter in which he spoke of marriage as one grand sweet song " began by addressing the person to whom it was written as " Friend So-and-So " ? which is about what one would have expected from him at that particular period of his career . There are a number of more strictly localized forms of address which play a less important part in the intercourse of Americans with one another . " Cap " is sporadically employed in various parts of the country , chiefly by small hotel-keepers and proprietors of livery-stables . It is supposed to represent a combination of geniality tempered by courtesy ? the former shown in the abbreviation and the second in the employment of the military title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use " Cap " ; only they bestow it with somewhat less profusion and only upon those whose appearance is somewhat professional . " Doc " is also applied quite generally , even in large cities , to druggists , as distinguished from physicians , and in this sense it has a greater currency and among a more numerous class than " Cap . " In certain parts of the West " pard " and sometimes , more seriously , the unabbreviated " partner , " represent an equivalent of the Eastern " neighbor " and " friend " " Stranger " is still fairly common in portions of the Southwest and West , but it is dying out little by little , except among the writers of dialect stories . In addressing ladies , and especially in calling their attention when their names are not known , there is very little range of usage . Outside of the larger cities , " madam " is seldom heard in the mouths of the multitude , and there seems to be a very general shyness about using any title whatsoever . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its way , because it means that those who possess it are afraid lest their manner of speaking to a woman may not be-sufficiently respectful . In an emergency , however , the casual man will call out , " Say , Mrs. ! " or " Say . Miss ! " according to his instantaneously formed theory of the status ( it the lady in question . The difficulty . however , of drawing this delicate distill ( ' tmn has led to a general use in cities of the cautious compromise found in " lady , " which one hears perhaps oftenest in the public conveyances. where the formulas . This way , lady , " and " Step lively , lady , " are kept going all day long . Among persons of education and a fair degree of cultivation ( which is a very different thing ) , the American aversion to titles is not consciously felt though its presence is perhaps perceptible in a certain carelessness and looseness in their employment . Thus , the number of Americans who accurately discriminate in their use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small one and when it comes about that an American has any occasion to address a person who possesses a foreign title , he usually makes some odd mistake in doing so . One might write an interesting essay on the American attitude toward foreign titles of nobility ; but the essence of the whole thing has
