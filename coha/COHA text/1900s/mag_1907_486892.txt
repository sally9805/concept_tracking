tion of prices and credit which led to this autumn 's crash . A similar prediction , made at exactly this time in 1893 , , bv- , Secretar-y -- -Carlisler - and forecasting the revenue of the first half of 1894 , turned out an over-estimate by the subAtantial sum of- forty million dollars . Novemberalone , , as reported on in the monthly bulletin of last Thursday , shows a decrease of $10,000,000 from the revenue last year . These facts ought to be seriously impressed on the mind of Congress , in laying plans for future public expenditure . - Iii a time like this it is inevitable that the old qUack-notions about currency should be trotted out . Last Monday a bill was introduced to " base " money upon : cotton- In the prolific days of 1893-96 there was a great crop of these " basing " plans . Iron in the mines , coal in sight , hay in bales , etc. , were proposed as the - true - security on which to issue currency . The simplest way , of course , is that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " your currency on nothing , and just issue greenbacks to fill every pocket . But this is , to overlook one important difference between the present condition of- the Treasury and that of 1893 . Then the government was short of funds ; but today it has more than $200,000,000 of surplus . If greenbacks were " issued , " they could only be in payment of government obligations or purchases of some kind ; they are not tossed out of the window to the crowd , as Mr : Watson seems to suppose . With over $200,000,900 to the good , the Treasury would look foolish to put out promises to pay . For the same reason , it looked foolish in putting out bonds and 3 per ' cent . certificates . ? ' President Roosevelt could do no other than comply with the request of the Governor of Nevada that Federal troops be sent to Goldfield . If a sovereign State can not protect itself from dorneatic violence , the Constitution makes it the duty ofethe Government at Washington to come to slid . The reproach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the indignant officers of the Western Miners ' ' Federation that there is really no trouble at Goldfield ; that the sheriff has not Called for assistance . But blunt Gen Film-Stein has . information that the sheriff is ' himself a member of the Fedora-lion : , and would do nothing to interfere with its pleasant habit of setting itself UP above the law . Moreover , Gov . Sparks et ; iy specific and detailed in recounting the acts . of - intimidation and violence committed by the- Federation . In view of his appeal , there was nothing for the President to do but order the troops to ' - go td the scene ; and he deseivei praise - for " the ' Promptness and Vigor with which he set about rescuing Nevada from terrorism and possible bloodshed . Here is no question of State rights , or usurpation of power ; only a case of putting down lawlessness . The Rivers and Harbors Congress at Washington last week was notable for the absence of sectional pressure and insistence upon particular local projects . Vice-President Fairbanks , Secretary Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Rivers and Harbors have all emphasized the need for considering the question of waterways improvement in its larger aspects . " A policy , not a project , " was Mr. Root 's happy way of expressing the idea . If within the next twenty years we are to have a comprehensive system of developed waterways , these should come as the result of a consistent plan , and not a mere combination of a multitude of log-rolling projects which merely happen to dovetail together . This year 's meeting , by its clear statement of this fact , may have opened a new chapter in the history of this branch of our national activity . While a good deal has been accomplished in recent years toward systematizing our river and harbor expenditures , this has been in spite of the efforts of those interested in improvements , rather than because of them . The representatives , official and unofficial , from each locality have been working for one or two pieces of work , and if these were proeided for , the rest of the waterways budget might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attitude of this year 's Rivers and Harbors Congress may be due in part to the realization that the right way is to begin at the other end . Once the country is convinced of the wisdom of liberal and continued appropriations for its waterways , the deserving projects will be attended to as a matter of course . It is now generally understood that both in respect to the handling of traffic and the maintenance of reasonable rates , we have long trusted too much to the railways . Instead of keeping our water-routes in condition to provide effective competition with the railroads , and , in periods of exceptional expansion like that of the past decade , to take care of the additional traffic in a natural way , we left them to the tender mercies of Congressmen who , while they did a great deal , in the aggregate , did not always do the things that were needed . To-day we need water transportation so badly that , as James J. Hill said to the waterways delegates , " You may be assured of the hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterways of the country . " The proposal to have the Federal government license , automobile driverg comes before Congress for the first time in the form- of a bill drafted by the counsel of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers and the chairman of the Legislative Committee of the American Automobile Association , - It is not proposed to create a separate class of Federally licensed cars , but merely to allow those already taking out permits in the State of ownership , to obtain . certificates entitling them to make interstate journeys . The Federal government is appealed to , therefore , not to save the automobilist from over-drastic State laws , but to spare him the vexation of having to take out new licenses in every State he visits . The State legislation , as the author of the proposed law acknowledges in a recent compilation of the various automobile statutes , " on the whole has been fair and reasonable , and seldom do we find evidence of hostility carried to excess in any of the legislative enactments " But the States are not hospitable to the automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume , is crossed by so many automobiles as that between New York and New Jersey , yet New Jersey is inflexible in refusing to give credit to her next-door neighbor 's licenses . The State laws differ widely in their requirements . Some States require all cars to be equipped with mufflers , some do not . Some allow cities , counties , and villages to make regulations of their own , some prohibit local legislation . A New York owner may keep the registration numbers of other States fastened to the rear of his machine ; a Massachusetts owner at home must remove all but that of his own commonwealth . A motor bicycle is an automobile in Indiana , though a traction engine is not ; both are automobiles in New Jersey , neither in New York . And so it goes . It is not at all unlikely , in view of the history of other legislation , that the mere drafting and introduction of the Federal bill will help on the cause of uniform legislation , its clauses being used as models before Congress has approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law committee of the Automobile Club of America , " that this will eventually form the basis for homogeneous legislation throughout the Union . " Altogether aside from the Constitutional obstacles , it is very much better that such uniformity should come through voluntary cooperation of the States than through the too familiar short-cut of Federal intervention . Statistics show that 96,724 immigrants returned to Europe during November , 55,000 more than a year ago . Never before has labor been so mobile . If what we are seeing now , the peompt departure of surplus labor when there is an industrial depression , is to become the rule , the intensity of future periods of suffering in any given country is certain to be much diminished . In our present crisis , this loss of workmen is doing much to mitigate the inevitable distress of the coming winter . Moreover , if matters dmprove , labor will begin to flow back next spring as quickly as it is leaving now . Of course , labor leaders will not be altogether pleased by this demonstration that labor is becoming more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to organize and maintaan strong unions . Their ideal is a state so controlled that no one can come in without a permit from them , and no one leave , and that trades may be so regulated after the manner of the guilds of medimval days that only a small number of apprentices can be accepted each year . In this way they would see to it that wages were regulated , and that there was " work enough to go around . " The leaders ' influence has for years been in the direction of keeping labor at dts given task and opposing the introduction of machinery or anything that would tend to displace workingmen and cause them to turn their hands to something else Obviously , if 500,000 or more workmen are going to bolt every time there is a financial crisis , and settle elsewhere , or go into other lines of employment , this little plan is going to be spoiled . Oklahoma has already given so many evidences of enterprise , ingenuity , and courage of convictions that we are not surprised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Senator Clarence Davis of Bristow is drafting a bill which by implication , we presume , takes the dementia Americana from the catalogue of forms of insanity . This is all very well in itself , but can a free people , brought up on the unwritten law , get along without any such refuge in the future ? Will not adroit criminal lawyers presently invent a new unwritten law which is milder yet ? Having legally exempted one species of homicide from the penalties of the law , is there any guarantee that the rest of its prohibition will remain unaffected ? The doctrine of the unwritten law , as we customarily have it , is overladen with noble sentiment . It turns to its own purposes a resentment which is common to right-feeling persons But at bottom it is merely an assertion of that right of private vengeance which civilized society has spent some centuries in trying to abrogate completely . Much may be said on the text that if juries remain unwilling to convict criminals of a certain class , it is best that the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion , however , that the whole problem is disposed of by extending the statutory definition of " justifiable homicide , " we have no sympathy . The death of Oscar II . of Sweden has naturally been made a text for reference to almost the only event that came to cloud the last years of an otherwise happy reign . Yet it is an open question whether the peace of the Scandinavian peninsula and of Europe has not profited by the fact that Norway chose to break the partnership with Sweden while the aged monarch was still on the throne . In the crisis that followed Norway 's declaration of independence the personality of Oscar II . made it apparent from the beginning that , so far as in his power lay , war should not follow the break-up of the Union . How deeply the King took that event to heart he did not hesitate officially to declare to his former Norwegian subjects , and to the world in general . It is no reflection on the new Swedish monarch to believe that , had the separation been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement could scarcely have been effected in so peaceable a manner A young king , however discredited in present days may be the doctrine of the divine right of kings , would have hesitated before allowing so serious a diminution of his prestige , and , as he might have regarded it , even of his rights On the other hand , the Norwegians , however irksome the Swedish connection had become to them , could not but find in the personality of Oscar II , and the fact of his long reign over them , a powerful counsel towards moderation . Chamberlain and his fellow-protectionists in England have made much of the " Imperial " nature of their schemes , yet , strange to say , it is the greatest Imperialists who have given them the blackest eye . Lord Curzon , both while Viceroy of India and since , has been distinctly hostile to their tariff plans ; and now comes Lord Ciomer utterly to condemn them . In a. recent speech before the Unionist Free Trade Club , he argued strongly that a protectionist policy would be fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , a large amount of " dormant Anglophobia " in the world , and it would be the pitch of folly to arouse this , by tariff taxes , in " the counting-house of every foreign merchant and manufacturer . " Lord Cromer had no objection to hearing " the Imperialist drum , " but " my contention , " he declared , " is that if the instrument is properly attuned , it will give forth a free trade and not a protectionist or preferential note . " With all his authority and power of statement , he threw himself against the Chamberlain proposals , toyed with by Mr. Balfour , and urged that , both on patriotic and party grounds , they now he " laid on the shelf . " The whole speech was a stunning blow to the English protectionists , and they are still reeling under it . Another sister-nation , as Mr. Kipling would call it , has joined the family circle of the British Empire . Orange River Colony , formerly the Orange Free State , has just held her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ago , and the newly elected Parliament is to assemble shortly before Christmas . Out of a total of 38 members in the lower house , the Dutch party has elected 30 , the Constitutionalists , or British party , have 4 , and the Independent party the same number . The Orange River Colony Ministerial bench will look even more like " the Boer general staff " than is the case in the Transvaal , where the British element is far more numerous . The colony 's almost exclusively agricultural interests make the political issues small in number . The two principal ones concern the school system and the colony 's attitude towards the working of the intercolonial railways . Premier and Colonial Secretary Fischer is to have among his colleagues Gens . Hertzog and De Wet . The latter , who is to be Minister of Agriculture , would seem more fitted by his war experiences for some such post as Minister of Ways and Communications . The French Academy is so frequently spoken of as a sort of post-graduate club where forty immortals loll about and pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character as a bureau for the encouragement of national endeavor is often forgotten . On November 22 the Academy held its annual distribution of prizes . These rewards are of two kinds , for literary achievement and for " virtue , " specifically , the so-called prix de vertu . This year there was distributed the sum of 189,000 francs in prizes ranging from 10,000 to 300 francs , to about 100 beneficiaries . Such a number of rewards conferred every year constitutes a very definite form of encouragement in a country where official recognition is highly regarded and a small sum of money goes tar . The customary discourse accompanying the distribution of the prix de vertu was delivered by Maurice Barr6s . The Academy has a quiet delight in selecting its youngest members and most recently reformed enemies of established order , to pronounce formal eulogies on morals , patriotism , religion , and the like . In the case of M. Barres , it is true that he turned over his new leaf some time ago , and has become prominent as a champion of the simple virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Un Homme libre " and " Le Jardin de Rer  --  nice " present the two leading prizes for " virtue , " of 300 francs each , to the parents of a peasant family of nineteen and of twenty-one children . - " Such mothers , " said M.
