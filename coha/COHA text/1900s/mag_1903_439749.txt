I SUPPOSE it is the real demand for an article that leads to its counterfeit , otherwise the counterfeit would stand a poor show . The growing demand for nature-books within the past few years has called forth a very large crop of these books , good , bad , and indifferent , books on our flowers , our birds , our animals , our butterflies , our ferns , our trees ; books of animal stories , animal romances , nature-study books , and what not . There is a long list of them . Some of these books , a very small number , are valuable contributions to our natural history literature . Some are written to meet a fancied popular demand . The current is setting that way ; these writers seem to say to themselves , Let us take advantage of it , and float into public favor and into pecuniary profit with a nature-book . The popular love for stories is also catered to , and the two loves , the love of nature and the love of fiction , are sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles G. D. Roberts 's Kindred of the Wild , Mr. William Davenport Hulbert 's Forest Neighbors , Mr. Thompson Seton 's Wild Animals I Have Known , and the Rev. William J. Long 's School of the Woods . Only the last two writers seem to seek to profit by the popular love for the sensational and theimprobable , Mr. Long , in this respect , quite throwing Mr. Thompson Seton in the shade . It is Mr. Long 's book , more than any of the others , that justifies the phrase " Sham Natural History , " and it is to it and to Mr. Thompson Seton 's Wild Animals I Alone Have Known , if I may be allowed playfully to amend his title to correspond with the facts , that I shall devote the major part of this article . But before I proceed with this discussion , let me briefly speak of the books that have lately appeared in this field that are real contributions to the literature of the subjects of which they treat . All of Mr. Bradford Torrey 's bird studies merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and charm . They are the product of a shy , gentle , alert , birdlike nature , dwelling fondly , lovingly , searchingly , upon our songsters and the scenes amid which they live . Mrs. Fannie Hardy Eckstorm 's Bird Book and her work on the Woodpeckers are fresh , original , and stimulating productions . Mr. Leander S. Keyser 's Birds of the Rockies tells me just what I want to know about the Western birds , ? their place in the landscape and in the season , and how they agree with and differ from our Eastern species . Mr. Keyser belongs to the // noble order of walkers and trampers , and is a true observer and bird-lover . Florence Merriam 's ( now Mrs. Bailey ) books on Western bird life and Mr , . Frank M. Chapman 's various publications , apart from their strict scientific value , afford a genuine pleasure to all nature - lovers . Mr. Ernest Ingersoll has been writing gracefully and entertainingly upon the lives of our birds and wild animals for more than twenty years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another book that I have read with genuine pleasure is Mr. Dallas Lore Sharp 's Wild Life near Home , ? book full of charm and of real observation ; the fruit of a deep and abiding love of Nature , and of power to paint her as she is . How delightful his sketch of the possum , and how true ! Mr. Sharp is quite sure the possum does . not faint when he " plays possum , " as some naturalists have urged : " A creature that will deliberately walk into a trap , spring it , eat the bait , then calmly lie clown and sleep until the trapper comes , has no nerves . I used to catch a possum , now and then , in the box-trap sot for rabbits . It is a delicate task to take a rabbit from such a trap , for , give him a crack of chance and away he bolts to freedom . Open the lid carefully when there is a possum inside , and you will find the old follow curled up , with a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake the trap and he rouses yawningly , with a mildly injured air , offended at your rudeness , and wanting to know wily you should wake an innocent possum from so safe and comfortable a bed . He blinks at you inquiringly , and says , ' Please , sir , if you will be so kind as to shut the door and go away , I will finish my nap . ' And while he is saying it , before your very eyes , off to sleep he goes . " Of all the nature - books of recent years , I look upon Mr. Sharp 's as the best ; but in reading it , one is keenly aware of the danger that is always lurk-ing near the essay naturalist , ? lurking near me as well as Mr. Sharp , ? the danger of making too much of what wo see and describe , ? of putting in too much sentiment , too much literature , ? in short , of valuing these things more for the literary effects we can get out of them than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He always forgets White , and remembers only nature . His eye is single . He tells the thing for what it is . He is entirely serious . He reports directly upon what he sees and knows without any other motive than telling the truth . There is never more than a twinkle of humor in his pages , and never one word of style for its own sake . Who in our clay would be content to write with the same moderation and self-denial ? Yet it is just these sane , sincere , moderaie books that live . In Mr. Charles 0 . D. Roberts 's Kindred of the Wild one finds much to admire and commend , and but little to take exception to . The volume is in many ways the most brilliant collection of animal stories that has appeared . It reaches a high order of literary merit . Many of the descriptive passages in it of winter in the Canadian woods are of great beauty . The story called A Treason of Nature , describing the betrayal and death of a bull moose by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most striking and effective . True it is that all the animals whose lives are portrayed ? tine bear , the panther , the lynx , the hare , the moose , and others ? are simply lnunan beings disguised as animals ; they think , feel , plan , suffer , as we do ; in fact , exhibit almost the entire human psychology . But in other respects they follow closely the facts of natural history , and the reader is not deceived ; he knows where ho stands . Of course it is mainly guesswork how far our psychology applies to the lower animals . That they experience many of our emotions there on be no doubt , but that they have intellee- 300 Real and Sham tual and reasoning processes like our own , except in a very rudimentary form , admits of grave doubt . But I need not go into that vexed subject here . They are certainly in any broad generalization our kin , and Mr. Roberts 's book is well named and well done . ? Yet I question his right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he does in his story of the panther , and then on a nudge from the panther roll down a snowy incline into the water , I have tried all sorts of tricks with the porcupine and made all sorts of assaults upon him , at different times , and I have never yet seen him oceanic the globular form Mr. Roberts describes . It would not be the best form for him to assume , because it would partly expose his vulnerable under side . The one thing the porcupine seems bent upon doing at all times is to keep right side up with care . His attitude of defense is crouching close to the ground , head drawn in and pressed down , the circular shield of large quills upon his back opened and extended as far as possible , and the tail stretched back rigid and held close upon the ground . Now come on , he says , if you want to . The tail is his weapon of active defense ; with it he strikes up like lightning , and drives the quills into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spears , Mr. Roberts paints the porcupine without taking any liberties with the creature 's known habits . He paints one characteristic of the porcupine as felicitously as Mr. Sharp paints one of the possum : " As the porcupine made his resolute way through the woods , the manner of his going differed from that of all the other kindreds of the wild . He went not furtively . He had no particular objection to making a noise . He did not consider it necessary to stop every little while , stiffen himself to a monument of immobility , cast wary glances about the gloom , and sniff the air for the taint of enemies . He did not care who knew . Natural History . of his coming , and he did not greatly care who came , Behind his panoply of biting spears he felt himself secure , and in that security he moved as if he held in fee the whole green , shadowy , perilous , woodland world . " ? The father of the animal story as we have it to-day was doubtless Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deer , forever killed all taste for venison in many of his readers . The story of the hunt is given from the standpoint of the deer , and is , I think , the most beautiful and ' effective animal story yet written in this country . It is true in the real sense of the word . The lino between fact and fiction is never crossed . Neither does Mr. William Davenport Hulbert cross this lino in his Forest Neighbors , wherein we have the life stories of the porcupine , the lynx , the beaver , the loon , the trout , made by a man who has known these creatures in the woods of northern Michigan from his boyhood . The sketches are sympathetically done , and the writer 's invention is called into play without the reader 's credulity ever being overtaxed . But in Mr. Thompson Seton 's Wild Animals I : Have Known , and in the recent work of his awkward imitator , the Rev , William J. Long , I am bound to say that the line between fact and fiction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce the reader to cross , too , and to work such a spell upon him that he shall not know that he has crossed and is in the land of make-believe . Mr. Thompson Seton says in capital letters that his stories are true , and it is this emphatic assertion that makes the judicious grieve . True as romance , true in their artistic effects , true in their power to entertain the young reader , they certainly are ; but true as natural history they as certainly are not . Are we to believe that Mr. Thompson Seton , in his few years of roaming in the West , has penetrated farther into the secrets of animal life than all the observers who have gone be- ' fore him ? There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record , that I am aware of , that match his . Gilbert White , Charles St. John , Waterton , Wallace , Darwin , Jefferies , and others in England , all expert students and observers ; Bates in South America , Audubon roaming the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains of California and in the wilds of Alaska have nothing to report that conies within gunshot of what appear to be Mr. Thompson Seton 's daily experiences . Such dogs , wolves , foxes , rabbits , mustangs , crows , as he has known , it is safe to say , no other person in the world has ever known . Fact and fiction are so deftly blended in his work that only a real woodsman can separate them . For instance , take his story of the fox . Every hunter knows that the fox , when pursued by the hound , will of ten resort to devices that look like cunning tricks to confuse and mislead the dog . How far these devices are the result of calculation we do not know , but hunters generally look upon them as such . Thus a fox hotly pursued will run through a flock of sheep . This dodge probably delays the hound a little , but it does not often enable the fox to shake him . Mr. Thompson Seton goes several better , and makes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hundred yards . Of course no fox ever did that . Again , the fox will sometimes take to the railroad track , and walk upon the rail , doubtless with the vague notion of eluding his pursuers . Mr. Thompson Seton makes his fox so very foxy that he deliberately lures the hounds upon a long trestle whore he knows they will be just in time to inset and be killed by a passing train , as they are . The presumption is that the fox had a watch and a time-table about his person . But such are the ways of romancers . The incident of the mother fox coming near the farmhouse at night to rescue her young , and , finding him held by a chain , digging a hole and burying the chain , thinking she had thus set him free , is very touching and pretty , and : night well he true . It shows how limited the wit of the fox really is . But , finding herself unable to liberate her offspring , that she should then bring him poison is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal stories of Mr. Thompson Seton that I have read the same liberties are taken with facts . In his story of the rabbit , Raggylug , he says : " Those who do not know the animals well may think I have humanized them , but those who have lived so near them as to know something of their ways and their minds will not think so . " This is the old trick of the romancer : he swears his tale is true , because he knows his reader Wants this assurance ; it makes the thing taste better . But those who know the animals are just the Ones Mr. Thompson Seton can not fool . Any country boy knows that the rabbit takes no account of barbed wire fences or of briers and brambles as a means of punishing the dog that is pursuing him . If these things were universal , it is possible that in the course of long generations rabbits might learn to interpose them between themselves and their enemies , possible , but not probable . Or take his story of the crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? how much of century , there is very little . In the first place , that these natural lenders among the fowls of the air over appear I have no evidence . I have known crows almost as intimately as I have hens from my boyhood , and I have seen no evidence of it with them . For forty years I have seen crows in winter , in different parts of the country , passing to and fro between their rookeries and their feeding grounds , and I have never seen anything like leadership among them . They leave their roosting places at daybreak and disperse north and south 302 Real and Sham or east and west to their feeding grounds , going in loose , straggling bands and silently , except in early spring and when they first leave their rookeries ; and they return at night in the same way , flying low if it is stormy and windy , and high if it is calm , rising up or sheering off if they see a gunner or other suspicious object , but making no sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally sharp and do not need to be warned . They are all on the alert . When feeding , they do post it sentry , and he caws when danger approaches , and takes to wing . They do not dart into a bush when pursued by a kingbird or a purple martin ; they are not afraid of a hawk ; they can not count six , though such traditions exist ( Silver Spot could count thirty ! ) ; they do not caw when you stand under them in winter to turn their course ; they do not drill their young ; they do not flock together in June ; they can not worry a fox into giving up half his dinner ; they do not , so far as we know , have perpetual son-tries ; they have no calls that , we can be sure , answer to our words , " Mount , " " Bunch , " " Scatter , " " Descend , " " Form line , " " Forage , " ? on these and other points my observations differ radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the summer the different families keep pretty well together . You may see the old ones with their young foraging about the fields , the young of ten being fed by their parents . It may be permissible to say that the old are teaching the young how to forage ; they are certainly setting them an example , as the mother hen or mother turkey is setting her brood an example when site leads them about the fields . The cat brings her kitten a mouse , but does she teach Mtn how to deal with the mouse ? Does he need to be taught From my boyhood I have seen that yearly meeting of the crows in September or October , on a high grassy hill or a wooded ridge . Apparently all the Natural History . crows over a largo area assemble at these times ; you may see them coming , singly or in loose bands , from all directions to the iendezvous , till there are hundreds of them together . They make black an acre or two of ground . At intervals they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cawing at once . Then to the ground again or to the treetops , as the case may be ; then , wheeling in the air , they send forth the voice of the multitude . What does it all mean ? Ask our romancers ; they can tell you , I can not . It is the meeting of the clan after the scattering of the breeding season , and they seem to celebrate the event . The crow is gregarious , he is social , he seems to have a strong community feeling ; he will act as sentinel for the safety of his fellows . I have never seen crows quarrel over their food , or act greedy . Indeed , I am half persuaded that in hard times in winter they willingly share their food with one another . Birds of prey will rend one another over their food ; even buzzards will make some show of maul- , ing one another with their wings ; but I have yet to see anything of the kind with that gentle freebooter , the crow . What their various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caw-aw , memo that one hears in spring and stunmer , like the voice of authority or command , what does it mean ? I never could find out . It is doubtless from the male . A crow will utter it while sitting alone on the fence in the pasture , as well as when flying through the air . The crow 's cry of alarm is easily distinguished ; all the other birds and wild creatures know it , and the hunter who is stalking his game is apt to swear when he hears it . I have heard two crows in the spring , seated on a limb close together , give utterance to very many curious , guttural , gurgling , ventriloquial sounds . What were they saying ? It was probably some form of the language of love . One very cold winter 's morning after a fall of nearly two feet of snow , as I came out of my door , three crows were perched in an apple tree but a few rods away . One of them uttered a peculiar caw as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not the usual high-keyed note of alarm . It may have meant " Look out ! " yet it seemed to mo like the asking of alms : " Here we are , three hungry neighbors of yours ; give us food . " So I soon brought out the entrails and legs of a chicken , and placed them upon the snow . The crows very soon discovered what I had done , and with the usual suspicious lifting of the wings approached and devoured the food or carried it away . But there was not the least strife or dispute among them over the food . Indeed , each seemed ready to give precedence to the other . In fact , the crow is a courtly , fine-mannered bird . Yet suspicion is his dominant trait . Anything that looks like design puts him on his guard . He suspects a trap . A string stretched over and around a cornfield will often keep him away . His wit is not cheep , but it is quick , and ever on the alert . Since Mr. Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did he not warn him at the outset against asking any questions about the literal truth of his stories ? Why did he not say that their groundwork was fact and their finish was fiction , and that if the reader find them entertaining , and that if they increase his love for , and his interest in , our wild neighbors , it were enough ? It is always an artist 's privilege to heighten or deepen natural effects . He may paint us a more beautiful woman , or a moro beautiful horse , or a more beautiful landscape , than we ever saw ; we are not deceived even though he outdo nature . We know where we stand and where he stands ; we know that this is the power of art . But when he paints a portrait , or an actual scene , or event , we expect him to be true to the facts of the case . Again , lie may add all the charm his style can impart to the sub- ject , and we are not deceived ; the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . Mr. Thompson Seton 's stories are artistic and pleasing , but lie insists upon it that they are true to the fact , and that this is the best way to write natural history . " I believe , " he says in his preface , " that natural history has lost much by the vague general treatment that is so common , " Hence he will make it specific and individual . Very good ; but do not put upon our human credulity a greater burden than it can bear . His story of the pacing mustang is very clever and spirited , but the endurance of the horse is simply past belief . What would not one give for the real facts of the case ; how interesting they would he , no matter how much they fell short of this highly colored account ! There should be nothing equivocal about sketches of this kind ; even a child should know when the writer is giving him facts and when he is giving him ' fiction , as he does when Mr. Thompson Seton makes his animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real woodsman can separate the true from the false . Mr. Thompson Seton constantly aims to convey the idea to his reader that the will creatures drill and instruct their young , even punishing them at times for disobedience to orders . His imitator , the Rev. Mr. Long , quite outdoes him ' n this line , going so far as to call his last book the School of the Woods . Mr. Long doubtless got the hint of his ridiculous book from Mr. Thompson Se ton 's story of the crow , wherein he speaks of a certain old pine woods as the crows ' fortre'ss and college : " Here they find security in numbers and in lofty yet sheltered perches , and here they begin their schooling and are taught all the secrets of success in crow life , and in crow life the least failure does not simply mean begin again . It means death . " Nov the idea was a false one before Mr. Long appropriated it , and it has been pushed to such length deleted material . Real and S/cane it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mock natural history , is misleading the minds of many readers . No pleasure to the reader , no moral inculcated , can justify the dissemination of false notions of nature , or of anything else , and the writer who seeks to palm off his own silly inventions as real observations is bound sooner or later to come to grief . There is a school of the woods , as I have said , just as much as there is a church of the woods , or a parliament of the woods , or a society of united charities of the woods , and no more ; there is nothing in the dealings of animals with their young that in the remotest way suggests human instruction and discipline . The young of all the wild creatures do instinctively what their parents do and did . They do not have to be taught ; they are taught by nature from the start . The bird sings at the proper age , and builds its nest , and takes its appropriate food , without any hint at all from its parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hen as readily as when hatched by a duck , and dive , and stalk insects , and wash themselves just as their mothers did . Young chickens and young turkeys understand the various calls and signals of their mothers the first time they hear or see them . At the mother 's alarm note they squat ' ; at hor call to food they come , on the first day as on the tenth . The habits of cleanliness of the nestlings are established from the first hour of their lives . When a bird comes to build its first nest and to roar its first brood , it knows how to proceed as well as it does years later , or as its parents did before it . The fox is afraid of a trap before he has had any experience with traps , and the hare thumps upon time ground at the sight.of anything strange and unusual whether its mates be within hearing or not . It is true that the crows and the jays might be called the spies and informers of the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their cries , but who shall presume to say that they have been instructed in this vocation ? Mr , Long would have us believe that the crows teach their young to fly . Does the rooster teach its young to crow , or the cock grouse teach the young males to drum ? No bird teaches its young to fly . They fly instinctively when their wings are strong enough . I have often thought that the parent birds sometimes withheld food for the purpose of inducing their young to leave the nest , perching near by with it in their beaks and calling impatiently . no common clove will undoubtedly push its fully fledged young off the dovecot to make them use their wings . At a certain ago young birds and young mice and squirrels and rabbits will leave their nests when disturbed , whether their parents are within bearing or not . Young hawks and young crows will launch out boldly into the air when they see or feel you shinning up the tree that holds their nest . Fear is instinctive in the young of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would persuade us that young birds and animals are strangers to this feeling till their parents have taught them what to fear . Every farm boy knows that when old Brindle hides her calf in the woods , and he is sent to look it up when it is only a few hours old , that it is " as wild as a deer , " as we say , and will charge him desperately with a loud agonized bleat . Had the old cow taught her young to be afraid of what she herself was not afraid ? So with the human kind . Does the mother teach her baby to be afraid of strangers ? When I was a small boy I remember being afraid of the first soaring hawk I had ever seen , and I ran and hid behind the fence . What Mr. Long and Mr. Thompson Soton reatas parental obedience is simply obedience to instinct , and of course in this direction alone safety lies , and there is no departure from it , as Mr. Long seeks to show in his story of 306 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and the young are filled with the same impulse . Is it to be supposed that our white-footed mouse has taught her young to cling to her teats , when the plough throws out her nest , and thus bo carried away by her ? When ( lid she drill them ? Was it by word of command or by pinches and nudges ? Are we to believe that the partridge teaches her just hatched brood to squat motionless upon the ground , or to stick their heads under loaves at a signal from her when a man or a ( log appears ? There they sit as it suddenly turned to stone while she blusters about and seeks to load you away from the spot . Who taught her to try to play her confidence game upon you , to feign lameness , a broken wing , a broken leg , or utter paralysis ? her parents before her ? How interesting it would have been to have surprised them in their rehearsal ! Nearly all the ground builders among our song birds try the same tactics when driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who was their teacher ? The other day a lady told no she thought she had heard a robin in the summer teaching its young to sing . But , I said , the young do not sing till the following year , and then only the males . If they are taught , why do n't the females sing ? Is the singing school only for boys ? It was not so when I was a youth . Eternal vigilance is the price of life among the birds and the lower animals , and then they probably seldom die ill their beds , as we say . They are like the people of a city in a state of siego , or like an arnw moving through , or encamped in , an enemy 's country . They are surrounded by scalpers and sharpshooters ; yea , their camp is invaded by them . Guns , traps , snares , nets , snakes , weasels , cats , foxes , hawks , bloodsuckers , bone crushers , ? foes in the air , in the bush , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foes by night , foes that stalk , that glide , that swoop ; foes that go by Natural History . sight , that go by scent , that waylay , that spring from ambush , ? how can they escape the fearful and the tragic , from the noose ill his power to the hate in her timidity ; from the fox with his speed and cunning to the mouse that he hunts in its meadow burrow ? They can not and they do not escape , and if Mr. Long had learned his lesson outside of his study , he might have found it out . Mr. Long often describes , with an extra show of exactness and particularity , incidents he has seen ill the lives of the wood folk that no Man ever saw or ever will see . Ho would make us believe that in the Northern woods ( ho does not name the spot ) it is often difficult to frighten the moose out of your way ; he says that they get in the way of your canoe in the water , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frighten them off ; and that the boars are so tame that they stand in the path before you and dispute the right of way with you , but that if you look hard enough at them they may clamber up the rocks and look down upon you as you pass ! We know that even the musk ox in the Arctic barren lands , that has never soon or known inan , is wary and hard to approach . Mr. Long 's book reads like that of a man who has really never been to the woods , but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read ill Forest r ( nd Stream , or in other sporting journals . Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book ; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end . He describes how on one occasion his attention was arrested by a curious sound among the bushes on the side of a hill . Ho could not make out what was coming . But let me give the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munchausen of our nature-writers : " It was not a bear shaking down the ripe beechnuts ? not heavy enough for that , yet too heavy for the feet of any proWler of the woods to make on . his stealthy hunting . Pr-r-r-mish , swish I tlawmp/ deleted material deleted material of the unusual life secrets of a score of animals and birds . " We are not , therefore , to regard him as playing with natural history material for the amusement of his reader , or , like Mr. Thomp8011Seton , seeking to make up an artistic whole out of bits and fragments of the lives of the animals , gathered here and there , and heightened and intensified by a fertile fancy , but as an actual recorder of what he has seen and known . What the " life secrets " are that lie claims to have discovered , any competent reader can see . They are all the inventions of Mr. Long . Of the real secrets of wild life , I do not find a trace in his volume . The only other book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beasts of the Field , and here he is for the most part the same false prophet that he is in the School of the Woods . His statements are rarely convincing ; rarely do they have the verisimilitude of real observations . His air is that of a witness who is trying to mislead the jury , What discoveries he has made ! Among others , that the red squirrel has cheek pockets in which lie can carry half a dozen chestnuts at a time has he really never seen a red squirrel , or does he not know him from a chipmunk ? There is probably not a natural history museum in the land that would not pay a fine sum for a red squirrel with pouches in his cheeks . What fun the fishermen and hunters and farmers must have with Mr. Long ! Some fisherman along the.eoast told him that the fox catches crabs by trailing his brush over the water as is bait ; the crab seizes it , whereupon the fox springs away and jerks the crab to land . Mr. Long hopes to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him still more gullible . He told him how one morning he made the discovery that a fox was in his hencoop killing his chick- ens . Approaching cautiously he closed the opening and had the fox a prisoner . On entering the coop a few moments later , what was his surprise to find one ( lead pullet and a dead fox beside it . He concluded the thief had tumbled down from the roost and broken his neck . He laid both the fox and his victim on a box outside the door . A minute later both fox and pullet were gone ! The fox was only " playing possum , " and when he left he took his chicken with him ! He knew of a black fox that played the same trick . A boy caught it in a trap , and found it in the morning apparently ( lead and frozen stiff , He carried it home in triumph over his shoulder . ( Of course the fox had suppressed its animal heat also ! ) removed the trap from the frozen leg , stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned his attention away for a moment , " he had a dazed vision of a flying black animal that seemed to perch an instant on the log fence and vanish among the spruces . " Could credulity any further go ? It seems to me that Mr , Long 's story of how an old fox captures chickens roosting beyond his reach in a tree does go a little further . The fox simply runs around the tree , going faster and faster , " jumping and clacking his teeth , " and the chickens in trying to follow him with their eyes get dizzy and tumble off the roost ! Mr. Long gives this as if it might have been his own observation , but doubtless some old farmer has " soaked " him with it . How the old humorist must have chuckled in his sleeve ! I have read of an owl in South Africa which the natives believe can be made to twist its head off by a person walking round and round it . The curious bird follows you with his eyes , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes one or two better than that of our Natural History Mfinclutusen !
