A little more than eighteen months ago we briefly characterized the illustrated quarto volume of Michael Myers Shoemaker , ' Palaces , Prisons , and Resting-Places of Mary , Queen of Scots , ' from the London edition . The work has now been placed in the hands of G. P. Putnam 's Sons for American disposal . The inexpensive " Fireside Edition " of Dickens 's Works ( London . Chapman &; Hall , New York : H. Frowde ) progresses apace with ' Master Humphrey 's Clock , ' ' Bleak House , ' Little Dorrit , " Our Mutual Friend , ' ' Great Expectations , ' ' The Uncommercial Traveller , ' and ' Christmas Stories ' In this group of volumes we take leave of Cattermole and Phiz , and make acquaintance with a younger set of designers , like Marcus Stone and .

Not all of these works are now readable except as curiosities , collectors will value them chiefly for the plates . We spoke last week of T Y Crowell &; Co ' s twelve-volume edition of Fielding 's Works , and it is now exactly matched by Smollett 's , at a price remarkably cheap considering the excellent quality of the typography and the presentable binding . As before , Dr G H. Maynadier furnishes the special introductions . Each volume has a full-page frontispiece design . The same house sends us three volumes of a duodecimo " Astor Edition of Poets , " below the dollar mark in price , but more than respectable in appearance and execution . The chance combination is odd , for ' The Canterbury Tales , ' with a brief introduction by Professor Lounsbury , and ' The Faerie Queene , ' which Professor Trent expounds , are accompanied by the Poetical Works of Alice and Phoebe Cary , whom a single generation has effectually consigned to forgetfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several volumes of the estimable Cary sisters , and has even edited it with occasional notice of MS variants .

Balzac , rim  --  e , Gautier , Flaubert , Daudet , Manpassant , we can do no more than enumerate them . Paper , print , and binding are here all that is needful , each volume contains a portrait , and an introduction by a competent hand . The publishers are Messrs . Putnam .

FitzGerald 's ' Polonius , ' on the other hand , published by the Scott-Thaw Co. , is a squarish little volume , rubricateu , and gayly bound in tan and gold . This form of the collection of " wise saws and modern instances " is decidedly to be commended . FitzGerald 's ' Omar ' reappears in the elegant " Thumb-Nail Series " ( but it is not so small as that ) of the Century Company , along with Goldsmith 's ' She Stoops to Conquer , ' and Jowett 's version of Plato 's ' Apology of Socrates ' and ' Crito ' and the closing scene of the Thwdo ' , friendly little volumes of irreproachable typography and charming covers stamped with appropriate de-signs Finally , the Dent-Macmillan " Temple Classics " shall bring up the Lilliputian rear with Browning 's Pippa Passes , and Other Dramatic Poems ' of the forties , Howell 's Familiar Letters , ' in three volumes , the ' Verba Christi , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bede 's ' Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation ' Mr. Peter Newell still further illustrates " Lewis Carroll " in the handsome volume , ' The Hunting of the Snark , and Other Poems and Verses , ' just issued by the Harpers For what pertains to the title verse and to that of " Sylvie and Bruno , " we think our American humorist has succeeded in emphasizing the dreary character of those extravagances Still , his best designs fall in the earliest section , beginning with a very skilful and graceful Imaginative conception of the vanishing before the BooJum ( p. 40 ) , and a real artist is discernible behind his comic mask in the " Riddle of the Fishes " ( p 198 ) . With these deserves to be mentioned the group before the hearth , " Rest your old bones " ( p. 148 ) . Fairly droll are the Knight Mayor ( p. 70 ) , the procession of nursery maids ( p 112 ) , and " How shall I be a Poet ? " ( D. 132 ) .

Wessels Co ) . It is the kind of book commonly known as " suitable for presentation , " as its . forty-eight full-page plates , many of them of much artistic interest , sufficiently indicate . The writing has not . however , been done in any perfunctory way , for Mrs. Tooley has made careful and extensive research , and has expressed the results in a clear and natural style . The James H West Co , Boston , publishes for John Snyder an amusing skit , ' The Wind Trust , a Possible Prophecy , ' for which , strangely enough , . Dr. E. E. Hale writes a brief introduction . It would seem that Dr. Hale must have avoided prejudice , after the manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective system has had no doughtier apologist than Dr Hale , while Mr Snyder 's gay adventure is from first to last a satire on that system , and not merely a satire on that particulai excrescence of the system called a Trust . The title obviously suggests its drift to any person who has the perspicacity which a grindstone is not beyond We are told of the origin , development , and ultimate collapse of the " Istamboul Corporation for the Control of the Wind " There is much excellent fooling which but thinly veils a serious purpose , viz , to excite contempt for the usurpation by a few of advantages that belong to all . The fable is well managed for the most part , but less effectively in the concluding than in the introductory and middle parts . Some of the most palpable hits are incidental , touching our imperialism and related follies on their sorest spots . Our notice of Prof. James A. Woodburn 's ' Political Parties and Party Problems in the United States ' ( Putnams ) has been much too long delayed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Government , ' the present volume is a useful , though not a great , contribution to the literature of American politics .

The first , comprising about one-half of the whole , is a rapid survey of party history , in which the beginnings of the several parties and the course of those of lesser importance are sketched with particular clearness The second part ? " American Party Machinery and How It Works " is a clear and practical account of the " machine " in actual operation . No one can touch this field without showing large indebtedness to Mr Bryce , but Professor Woodburn has evidently taken the trouble to study the matter at first hand , and his abundant illustrations of the good and the bad are often fresh as well as typical .

A sociological study of a Boston factory district by Mr. R. F. Phelps , who held a " South End House Fellowship at Harvard University , " has just been published by that association . It embodies the results of a two years ' personal investigation of the industrial conditions in these factories , the housing of the operatives , and the determining factors in the choice of homes. - The conclusion is that , " along with our Better Dwelling Societies , we should have a society for the encouragement of suburban residence for the poor  --  such a society having a central bureau where information may be obtained as to good and convenient localities for the homes of workingmen outside of the crowded city limits .

At the annual meeting , October 15 , of the Wisconsin State Historical Society , the titles in its library were 248,050 , of which 10,584 were accessions within the last ten months Its invested funds are only $44,199 , but it receives from the State $20,000 yearly , with other assistance . Half the expense of keeping its grand building in order and open for use is paid by the University ( to which it has become indispensable ) for shelf room , books , lecture rooms , and reading-room . For further help to the University the Society will urge the next Legislature to build a north wing to its library as originally planned , over against that on the south , which is now filled with book stacks in six stories . The seventeenth volume of the Society 's Historical Collections , completing the treatment of the French regime , is in the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1855 , a reprint of which has been authorized by the Legislature , will be issued in the near future We record here the fact that the public library in Madison has received $50 , - 000 from Mr. Carnegie , and various other Wisconsin establishments as much or more , his gifts to eleven libraries in eleven other Wisconsin cities during the last year aggregating $142,000 Several libraries also have just been founded by private citizens , so that already only three cities ( with a census of 3,000 ) in the State remain destitute of a book treasury free to all comers . ? Monumental is the word that may fitly be applied to Prof Edward Arber 's reissue of the Term Catalogues , the first volume of which has just been printed . It covers the years 1668 to 1682 , and its large type and generous page are a delight to the eye .

The work will be completed in three volumes , and certainly makes a most important addition to our bibliographical equipment , in a style of editing , too , that places it on a very high plane of performance . Dodd , Mead &; Co. are Professor Arber 's representatives in this country . ? We made brief reference the other day to Mr. Charles Francis Adams 's recent discussion of the battles of Marathon and Salamis in papers which are printed in the ' Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society ' for May and June , the fruit of his tour in Egypt and Greece last spring He criticises severely the " Father of History , " but uses no stronger language than others who are very grateful to Herodotus for what he tells , though they recognize clearly the truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern methods . Mr. Adams seems to agree with Professor Goodwin in holding that the battle of Salamis was fought at the entrance to the bay ; but his expressions are not fully clear , and he assigns to the Persian fleet at the beginning of the conflict a position farther to the northwest than is claimed for it even by some scholars who yet believe that the battle was begun in the bay rather than at its entrance , The observations of a layman with Mr Adams 's interest and experience in the arts of history and of war , who views the fields of these battles without the prejudices formed by a long study of rather vague authorities , are bound to be suggestive and stimulating , but the positive results are seldom great . Mr. Adams twice calls attention to the principle , often forgotten by historians , that " an army moves on its belly " , but Herodotus himself was much interested in the care taken to provide sufficient supplies for the army of Xerxes Mr Adams was deeply impressed " with the military and naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation " Of the battle of Marathon , he takes no extreme view , but he attaches high importance to Salamis . " If Marathon was the Bunker Hill of the Greek resistance to Asia , Salamis was assuredly its Yorktown , " and " not until the fall of Constantinople , more than nineteen centuries later , was the work of that memorable day undone " ? Professor Richardson 's ' Vacation Days in Greece ' ( Scribners ) must not be confounded with the books which all travellers , in the enthusiasm of their new experiences , are tempted to write after a vacation visit to Greece This collection , not wholly unfamiliar to our readers , gives for the general public accounts of visits made to parts of Greece which are seldom visited by the ordinary scholars ly traveller , not to speak of the tour-ist , who never sees them .

Most of the chapters are reprinted with slight changes from weekly or monthly periodicals , but the last chapter , on Dalmatia , seems to be published here for the first time This and the chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a fine old-fashioned flavor to the title of a recent publication by the American Unitarian Assodiation , Boston , ' Pioneers of Religious Liberty in America ? Being the Great and Thursday Lectures delivered in Boston in nineteen hundred and three ' Dr. S. A.

" If this statement is correct , the late 0 . B Frothingham was much mistaken , and many have been led astray by him . In his biography of Theodore Parker he represents his father , Dr N L. Frothingham , as laying violent hands on the Thursday Lecture to prevent the further enjoyment of its opportunities by Theodore Parker . He says that the lecture died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made , but without success . Be the facts as they may , it may well be doubted if before or since Theodore Parker 's sermon the Thursday Lecture has been more honored in the observance than in these eleven lectures on well-chosen subjects , every one handled in an attractive manner , several of them by writers of special competence for their particular themes . Such , for example , are Edwin D Mead , who writes of " William Brewster and the Independents " ; Williston Walker , who writes of " Thomas Hooker and the Principle of Congregational Independency " , W. W Fenn , who writes of Dr. Charming , Washington Gladden , who writes of Bushnell Mr. Mead is never content with history that does not yield a lesson for the present time , and he draws out one here with much less complacency than Daniel Webster contemplating the appearance of Brewster at a New England Society dinner . Dr. Eliot 's lecture on Phillips Brooks brings out in clear relief some generally neglected features of the great bishop 's life . ? Without preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-selected photographs , ' The Heart of Japan , ' by Clarence Ludlow Brownell ( McClure , Phillips &; Co. ) , will disappoint readers seeking original knowledge of the country and people from one who might be supposed , from the title of his work , to be intimately and profoundly acquainted with the sub ; ect in hand . The sub-title , " Glimpses of Life and Nature , far from the Traveller 's Track . in the Land of the Rising Sun , " leads to great expectations . The author is a Fellow of the Society of Arts and the Royal Geographical Society , and member of the Japan Society of London . He has apparently been in Japan , and perhaps engaged in work and in residence there , for he talks about " our life on the west coast , " and even mentions the provinces of Etchiu and Echizen He gives pleasant glimpses of Japanese life in the interior and the ports , spelling his native words correctly , and using common phrases to express proper names , e. g , Kono Hito ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , it is a little curious that most if not all the local color in his word pictures is little else than a transference , with literary garnishing , of what has already been written and seen by the eyes of the authors of ' The Mikado 's Empire , ' of ' Nato , ' and of the contributors to the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan . The literary dressing does not and can not cover up the original features of other writers . The author , having read well and reproduced with some literary decorations what has already been written by English and American residents and students , writes genially and attractively about gods , missionaries , earthquakes , trade , flowers , village life , and the ways of foreigners and natives . Like so many writers of the Sir Edwin Arnold type , he exaggerates , even to caricature , the honorific element in Japanese conversation . This is a delightful book to read for an hour , but its matter , while professing to be fact and experience , as no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan the impression of fiction . ? The Tree Book , ' by Mary Bowles Jarvis ( John Lane ) , is the third volume of the " Country Handbooks Series . " It consists of a few notes on trees obviously collected from the encyclopedia and put together with little attempt at system . The trees are not grouped in families , the ash being placed next the mountain ash , as though they were related ; the chapter on forestry , advertised as " practical . " is made up of vague statistics and even more vague advice . " According to forest fancies of all ages , " writes Miss Jarvis , " the moon has much to do with the growth and prosperity of the trees . To do their best , they , with all other plants bearing fruit above ground , must be set out in the light of the moon But if the timber is to ' dure , ' it must be felled in the dark and waste end of the month " Miss Jarvis makes no attempt to supplement this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How to Distinguish the Trees " is rather literary than scientific To greet the inquirer with the information that the Stone Pine is , " in age , flowing and griceful , " is to leave him much where he was . The photographs , which are numerous , are too im pressionistic to be useful . One who knows a leafless walnut from a leafless sycamore will like these pretty groups ; one who does not , will learn nothing from Miss Jarvis The statement on page 101 that English ivy can not be grown out of doors in America is refuted by the experience of many Americans , who find that , at any rate south of New York , it flourishes out of doors , and covers a wall more quickly than in England if well looked after in the first winters after transplanting . Miss Jarvis seems to think that on " Arbor Day " every American is moved by an irresistible impulse to plant a tree  --  an amiable delusion very flattering to us . A " series " of any kind always raises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question more than ever unanswerable if all the " Country Handbooks " are written in the belated , drawing-room-table style of Miss Jarvis ? Mr H. Noel Williams , after writing the lives of Mine . Hammier and Mme de Pompadour , turns his attention to an earlier century . His ' Madame de Montespan ' ( Scribners ) is a large and beautifully printed book , which abounds with photogravures . We need not repeat the considerations that are urged in the preface to justify the publication of this biography , since it finds its best justification in the author 's familiarity with good sources and his impartiality of treatment . No little sympathy has been lavished on Mme. de Montespan from the belief that she was a victim of Louis XIV . ' s undoubted callousness . Such sympathy , however , is undeserved To the world the manner in which a habson of twelve years ' standing was terminated may well have seemed abrupt if not crude But in 1682 the world did not know that Mme de Montespan , besides resorting to quacks and magicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We say nothing either to extenuate or condemn her jealousy of Mme. de Maintenon , for that is a large question . It is enough to explain the King 's action that he should have known of the connection between his mistress and people like La Voisin , Lesage , and Guibourg Mr. Williams lays no claim to original research in the matter of the alrambt e . Lrdente and the poisoning cases , but he has at least made himself familiar with the researches of M. Ravaisson and M. Funck-Brentano The charities of Mme de Montespan in her later years were very probably suggested by a genuine repentance  --  like those of Mme de Longueville At the same time , the former had blots upon her career beside which the offences of Mme de Longueville seem peccadillos . We may be quite willing to forget her arrogance and her treatment of La Vallieze The things which we can not forget are her intercourse with the sorcerers , extended as it was over a period of nearly twenty years , and her personal participation in the horrors of the " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without any special prepossession in favor of Mme. de Montespan . He also shows , and this is a much more difficult matter , a good deal of sang frond in his judgment of Mme. de Main-tenon . After all , the best thing which can be said of this book is that it is sincerely designed to be an historical essay , and is not prompted by a love of scandal . Mr. Williams 's researches , though not profound , may be called adequate . He presents in an agreeable form the most recent opinions which have been reached in France regarding the role of Mme. de Montespan at the court of Louis XIV . PALGRAVE 'S BANK RATE . Bank Rate and the Money Market in England . France , Germany , Holland , and Belgium , 1844-1900 . By R. H. Inglis Pal-grave E. P. Dutton &; Co 1903 . It is now thirty years since Walter Bagehot published his ' Lombard Street , ' a book whose extraordinary merits were at once perceived , and which has become almost as classical as the ' Wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no dissent , but his views of the duty of the Bank of England concerning the maintenance of the gold reserve were vigorously controverted He showed that it was of cardinal importance to maintain a great banking reserve , that " whether the times of adversity are well met or ill met , depends far more on this than on any other single circumstance " He insisted that , under the peculiar conditions developed during a long history , the Bank had come to hold the ultimate cash reserve of the country ; that it had become the " Bankers ' Bank . " It followed that the responsibility of the directors was of a very different nature from that of the directors of an ordinary bank , and that it was their duty to maintain a very much greater reserve ; and he proved that , whether the directors liked it or not , the solvency of the Bank itself depended on their maintaining this reserve It is , perhaps , not too much to say that Bagehot 's argument was so conclusive as to cause financial men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . However , as we have intimated , Bagehot 's conclusions were very offensive to some of - the directors of the bank . Mr Hankey , a banker of great experience , declared that the Economist ( in which Bagehot 's views were published ) had put forth " the most mischievous doctrine ever broached in the monetary or banking world in this country , viz , that it is the proper function of the Bank of England to keep money available at all times to supply the demands of bankers who have rendered their own assets unavailable . " Mr. Hankey said that the Bank would bear its full share of any drain , and that it should hold its banking deposits in the most available securities , reserving generally about one-third in cash , but he denied that it was either expedient or practicable for the Bank to keep money unemployed to meet the demands of those who found themselves embarrassed in times of panic . To this Bagehot replied simply that ' the reserve of the Bank must be used , or , at least , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringency ; otherwise the Bank would fail Were it to stand aloof and let other banks fail , it , too , would be carried down Its depositors would rush to get out their money , and when its cash was gone , its " available securities " would be useless . It could not realize on them ; it could not sell even consols , because no one would have any money to buy them with It is difficult to believe that the directors of the Bank were not gradually influenced by Bagehot 's unanswerable arguments , and It is probably the common impression , both In England and here , that the Bank maintains a greater reserve than formerly This impression is not confirmed by Mr. Pal-grave 's book . The comparatively violent fluctuations in the discount rate or the Bank led him to investigate minutely the methods pursued in its management , with results which are not reassuring , and may even justify some uneasiness . The reserve of the Bank is smaller in Proportion to its own liabilities than it was forty or fifty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other banks . It is provided by the Bank Act of-1844 that , as other banks in England and Wales cease to issue notes , the Bank may increase its own issue to the extent of two-thirds of the amount retired , and these new notes are issued against securities , not gold . Since 1880 these securities have been increased by ? 3,175,000 . In 1879 the notes issued were about ? 49,000,000 , and the gold about ? 34,000,000 . In 1902 the issue of notes was ? 316,000 more and the gold held ? 2,858,000 less The number of banks , or banking offices , in the country has increased from probably less than 1,000 in 1b45 to 6,700 at present , all depending ultimately on the reserve of the Bank ; and the great increase in the Scotch and Irish circulation , as Mr. Palgrave shows , causes large demands on the reserve . It is obvious that a small reserve implies severe fluctuations in the rate of discount The amount of the reserve will be watched anxiously , not only by the Bank directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declines there is no other way to restore it but to diminish loans by charging more for them . Such fluctuations , Mr Palgrave shows , are injurious to trade , and especially to trade carried on with conservative methods . Ho observes : " Great instability in the rate of discount is a very prejudicial thing to the interests of commerce , and hence to those of banking . The close competition between one country and another renders it a far greater danger to our business now than previously . A supply of capital at a fairly low rate , and at a rate which may be expected to remain tolerably constant , is as important to trade as a steady supply of food and other necessaries of life to every one , and of the materials on which he operates to the manufacturer . Instability in the rate for money tends to render the results of trade more uncer Lain than they otherwise would be , and is sufficient even to prevent business enterprises from being entertained which otherwise might be carried out to the advantage of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of discount has been at the Bank of France and at the Bank of Holland than in this country . Nearly the same may be said of the rates in Belgium and in Germany , although in Germany a hig:ier rate has been charged than in this country , in the three other countries named the rates have not only been more equable , but they have been lower . " The great interest taken in the weekly return of the Bank is explained by these remarks The relation of reserve to liabilities , and the probable demands on the reserve , form the basis of most of those calculations which are continually being made by men engaged in business as to the movement of the Bank rate of discount . It is reasonable to expect that the form of the Bank statement should steadily improve , that it should convey more and more information to the public . Unfortunately , a different policy has been adopted . No figures are now published of sev eral details , such as the temporary advances made by the Bank , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balances kept by bankers with the Bank both in London and in the provinces What gives these omissions a sinister aspect is the fact that they are of comparatively recent occurrence Up to the time when Bagehot wrote , and for a year or two after his book appeared , a great deal more information used to be given After 1875 , the amounts of the bills discounted and of the temporary advances , which had been uniformly given from 1844 downwards , no longer appear , and since 1877 the London bankers ' balances have been altogether left out . Hence , as Mr. Palgrave says , since 1878 down to the present time " bankers are absolutely ignorant of matters which are of the highest importance to them Every bank knows , Of course , its own balance , and occasionally the amount of that of one or two of its neighbors , but there is no general knowledge of the amount of the collective balances of the bankers standing to their credit at the Rank of England as a whole . " The enormous extension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened , and that every available source of knowledge should be utilized . The private banks have recognized these conditions . When Mr Palgrave began his inquiries , in 1877 , he was told that it was impossible to ascertain the details of the operations of the banks . No private bank then published its accounts ; now their practice is more enlightened . That the Bank of England should have adopted the policy of giving less information than formerly makes it doubtful if Bagehot 's arguments and warnings have been so effective as has been generally supposed .
