txt A brisk discussion has been started in the columns of The London Spectator by a lively letter from a lady , presumably young , " A Returned South African , " in which she criticised good naturedly but very unfavorably the life of the girls in England as compared with her own , at home , ? specially the general inefficiency of the former contrasted with the varied duties and capabilities of the " Colonials . " One of the women who challenges her judgment sustains her argument by an account of her own experience and occupations . If she is a fair specimen of the " middle class , " with a family income of $2,400 to $4,800 a year , American girls in the same sort of family may envy her accomplishments . Here is a ' list of some of them , which she says are " fewer than those of many of my friends and acquaintances . " She is " a needlewoman " who has " turned out a considerable number of socks . " She " took lessons from a laundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that sort , including shirts and collars , for a small army of brothers . " She has the " St. John 's Ambulance Medal , taking also the South Kensington certificates in hygiene and physiology , " and has " been able to do practically all the nursing in " her home . She " can make jams and pickles and pickle hams and bacon , &c.,"; and " can trim a hat . " She " can not make a dress , " but knows " several women who make all the clothing for themselves and their children . " " With every ' Spring clean ' that comes around , " she says , " I varnish and paint and enamel , and so does every woman that I know . " These varied capabilities have not been acqtilred , nor are they practiced , at the expense of either physical or mental diversions : I have my recreations equally with the Colonial woman . I ride , dance , cycle , play tennis , photograph , and know how to handle a golf club , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance . I like a good novel , too , in English or French ; German and Italian , also , when leisure permits . The South African lady has found In her sojourn but one instance of an English girl who had saved money for travel . To which her critic would reply that there are hundreds of Englishwomen less well paid than their Colonial sisters laying aside money laboriously , month by month , for a glimpse one day at some " promised land . " But just as the Colonial visits England , the " Old Country , " the Englishwoman 's desire Is toward the lands yet more ancient than her own  --  the lands that have made history and hold its treasures . " Classes " are not so distinctly defined in our land as in England , and it would not be easy to determine to what group this lady , who , very fitly , signs herself " Housekeeper , " would , on this side , be assigned . We believe there are numerous American women , married or unmarried , whose energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of these qualities may differ . In any case , we are confident that our readers will agree with us that the picture presented by the correspondent of The Spectator Is wholesome and delightful .
