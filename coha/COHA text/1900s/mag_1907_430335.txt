 | SOMEWHERE between one and eighty-seven years ago , when you were a boy ( that is , of course , if you were n't a girl ) , you and Fatty Jones and Pug-nose Perkins , on those happy but infrequent days when the teacher did n't keep you after school , used to go out in the vacant lot behind your house and play baseball . And that was baseball ! Three old cat was the name of that particular breed of the Great American Game . Why three old cat nobody knows ? or if anybody does , he has omitted to tell me . However , out in the back lot you 'd go , you and Fatty Jones and Pub nose Perkins , taking with you from the woodshed the utensils necessary for the sport . You did n't use a regular , turned , hickory bat . Oh , dear me , no ! Those were all well enough for dude kids like Algernon Dalrymple , whose father owned the shirtfactory down by the railroad crossing , and who lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could n't see into the lawn-parties they gave there until you 'd dug a hole through with your pocket-knife and fingers . Dude bats were all well enough for dude kids like him , but you and Fatty and Pug-nose were different . I should hope so ! Though of course , if some one had come along and offered you a bat like that , you might have taken it ? possibly . But as long as no one did , you kept right on using a shingle whittled down to a handle on one end ; and when Algernon and his dude bat came around , you chased them off home contemptuously . And for a ball you would n't have one of those nice , white , hard things that would hit you on the ends of the fingers and make the joints swell up so your mother would have to button your suspenders for you in the morning . You used a chunk of rubber wrapped up in twine . Of course the twine would keep unwinding , and coming off every once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . And , at that , it was a lot better ball than those dude ones ? though of course , if the same some one had chanced to come around and offer you one of those horsehide-covered ones But what 's the use ? Nobody came .  | Well , Fatty Jones would choose to be " in " ; and as he was the biggest and could lick both Pub nose and yourself , you could find no adequate grounds upon which to dispute his choice . Then Pug-nose would elect to " catch , " and as Pug-nose , in turn , could lick you , you would , with as much grace as you could muster , take the ball and walk out to the pitcher 's box . Once there , you would spit on your hand and rub it in the dirt and then wipe it off on the seat of your trousers . Just why you did this would have been difficult for you to explain . Had anyone inquired your reasons , you would merely have superciliously and pityingly remarked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone right on putting yourself in line with wearing your Sunday pants for everyday just that much sooner . Then Fatty would insouciantly wave his bat and admonish you to give him " a good one , " while Pug-nose , at catch , would squat upon his haunches and make meaningful faces at you . Whereat you would contort yourself into an attitude that would suddenly remove three buttons , and let fly . Maybe the ball would go over the stone that stood for home-plate . Maybe it would go gyrating off into the scenery somewhere and thereby win many caustic remarks upon your ability from Pug-nose , whose painful duty it was to chase it . Or maybe it would hit Fatty under the ear , making it a " dead ball " and giving him -a chance to make one run and an opportunity while he was making that one run to tell you that , as a ball-player , your aged grandmother could skin you forty ways , and to opine caustically that jackstones and stick-knife and ring-arounda-rosy were more in your line . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ' t is not a stingy game , this three old cat ) , you would happen to catch a pop fly that got snarled up in your fingers before you could drop it , or maybe you 'd " nail " a " foul , " or possibly Fatty , in a misguided effort to swipe the ball when it was ten or fifteen feet over his head , would strike out . And then you 'd all move up one . Then Pug-nose would be in for thirty or forty trips to the first ( and only ) base and back , while you retrieved the wild balls that Fatty threw . And at length some inadvertence on the part of Pug-nose would move you all up once again , and you would be in , and Fatty catch and Pug-nose pitch . At last your chance had come , and you would brace back your shoulders proudly and brandish the shingle and lay for a good one , while Fatty , squatting behind the plate as warily as his embonpoint would permit , would make faces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be busily engaged in unctuously putting large chunks of the vacant lot on the most used portion of his trousers . Pug-nose , at length , contorts himself almost as well as you yourself could , and sends in a hot one . You can see that it 's going at least three feet beyond the plate , so you  | stand in silent , haughty unconcern and let it go by . " Strike , you gump ! " veils Fatty as he , to the surprise of all , including himself , manages to catch it . " Any , what 's the matter with you ? " you inquire coldly . " Sure it was a strike , wa' n't it , Fatty ? " demands Pug-nose , running up from the pitcher 's box . " Betcher life , " assures Fatty . " It come right over the plate . " " If it had n't , " asserts Pug-nose argumentatively , " Fatty could n't ' a ' caught it . Could yer , Fatty ? " Fatty wavers for a moment between injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally , giving way in favor of the last , admits that Pugnose 's argument is sound . Whereat you protest loudly that they are trying to skin you , and that you guess you know whether it was a strike or not , and that if that 's the way they 're going to play , you 'll go home . At which they both make faces at you and say insultingly : " Yaaaa ! Cry-baby ! Yaaaa ! Yaaaa ! " You thereupon become exceeding wroth and make a few caustic comments anent personal appearance and breeding , and ask Fatty if he remembers the time his mother caught him in the preserve closet and inquire as to who was the cry-baby them . And you inquire of Pug-nose if he , in turn , can remember how , just because his first pair of shoes with heels on ' em tripped him and caused him to slide downstairs on one ear , he yelled so the neighbors came on from three houses in every direction to find out what the matter was . The memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to do , are excellent , and the situation becomes a bit strained . But at length a compromise is effected on the grounds of calling it a strike , and the game goes on . Pug-nose contorts himself again , and this time you soak at the ball , for if they are going to call everything a strike no matter whether it is or not , you might as well get something for your time and trouble . Much to your surprise your bat hits the ball , and it goes sailing through the air high above Pugnose 's head . It takes you at least seven seconds to realize that you 've hit it , and another seven to remember that it is now your duty to run to first base and back before Pug-nose can get the ball and return it to Fatty . Accordingly you cast the bat behind you and start off for the base like a dog with a can tied to its tail . You reach it , and turn for the back journey . There is great excitement . Fatty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and Pug-nose , with the ball clasped affectionately in his right fist , is making valiant efforts to overtake you on the return trip . Seeing that his efforts are to prove fruitless , he stops and throws the ball to Fatty . By some fell chance , he gets the right direction and the right distance , as well ; and you ( for you have been watching him over your shoulder ) make up your mind that it is time to slide .  | As on one memorable occasion , when you elected this method of saving the game , you wore off all your forehead , one eyebrow , and a large section of your upper lip , you decide that this time you will select a sitting posture as one better adapted to the exigencies . Thus it is that the last eight feet of the run are covered with dessicated patches that the toil-hardened maternal fingers had sewed on with loving care and linen thread . And , as Fatty misses the ball anyway , you proudly rise and grab your bat and stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anxious eye over the horizon to see if there are any of the other sex about , or liable to be about . At length Pug-nose , who is getting tired , pitches you an easy one . You swing on it and land hard with the shingle . Away goes the ball . On and on it soars , and on , while you and Fatty and Pug-nose stand and watch it . In a beautiful parabola it flies . And then ? Bing ! Right in the middle of the Peets ' parlor window ( plate glass , too ! ) it hits , and " Cra-a-a-ash ! " goes the pane , and " O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-h ! ! ! ! " yells some one inside , and you and Fatty and Pug-nose turn and skedaddle for the woodshed . And that finishes the game for the day ; though , to be sure , there is an aftermath that ends in your respective fathers dividing an expense of three dollars and a half , and you and Fatty and Pug-nose sleeping face down for a couple of nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? not the sleeping face down . ) That was baseball as she should be played ! That was fun ! There was real enjoyment in that sort of thing ( for there were aftermaths to but few games ) , and healthfulness . And so there was , too , in the later games that you used to have of " Choose up sides " where you 'd all get together and elect captains ; and then the captains would take a bat and throw it from one to the other and then clasp hands on it , alternately , and the man who would be able to grip it last would have first choice . And you 'd have three bases and regular hats and balls , and you 'd play until your folks sent over to remind you that you had to go down to the store and get a loaf of bread and some herrings and a pound of cheese and some pickles and a bar of soap and a pound of Mocha and Java mixed and a lot of other things that you invariably forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? uniforms ! And they had  | plenty of dirt on ' em , and large letters on the bosoms , and short sleeves to the shirts . And you 'd pull the peak of your cap down over one eye and cast an eagle-gaze across at the grand stand where all the girls were and stroll carelessly up and down with your head thrown back . and your arms crossed on your breast and a little mud smooched on one cheek-bone and an expression of savage concern upon your visage , as though the fate of several nations and thirty or forty dependencies rested upon your sharp and scraggy shoulders . You were a regular ball-player then . And you could . almost hear ( " almost , " I said ) the tall , statuesque blonde in the third row , there , say to her escort , as she bent upon you soft , blue eves : " Oh , Jack , do look at that distingue fellow there ? the fine-looking one with the broad shoulders . Is n't he a perfect specimen of young American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you would swell up so that you 'd have to undo at least three more buttons in order to keep from strangling to death . In reality she was probably remarking : " Gee ! look at the skinny guy with the dirty- face . Every time I get my lamps focused on him , I wanter holler , ' Cash ! ' Ai n't he the limit ! " But you did n't know that ; and so it was really just as well as if she had said that which you felt she did . Ah , Youth ! Youth ! What comforting self-confidence ! What vast vanity ! What inspiring egotism ! Without it , where would you be ? It may make other people extremely tired ; but it gives you the nerve and the stamina and the perseverance and the confidence to dare and to do .. But where was I ? Oh , yes ? at college baseball . That , too , was good for you . It cultivated self-reliance , quickness of decision , self-control , resourcefulness , strength . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profited by both ? at least , I hope you did . If you did n't , it 's your own fault . And now we come to professional baseball , the amusement of the masses , the business of the players . It 's a gigantic thing , this professional baseball . There are two big leagues and two hundred smaller ones . They have presidents and vicepresidents and officials and umpires and rules and exceptions to rules and exceptions to exceptions , and they own property and they hire players at salaries that are three or  | four times as great as those of congressmen and judges and seven or eight times as great as those of college presidents and similar well-meaning plugs and almost as great as those of good horse-jockeys and chauffeurs . And every day , when there is a game , all the big newspapers put out bulletins giving the score by innings . And messenger-boys with telegrams to deliver and business men with important engagements to keep and truck-drivers and policemen and firemen and loafers and people who ought to know better all gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid automatons of Chicago , who never lived in that city and never want to , are winning from the hired help of New York , who have been gathered and garnered from Maine to California , from Dan to Beersheba , to push for their payers , and who would work just as willingly for Boston or Detroit as they do for their present employers should circumstances , or higher pay , so decree . It is with professional baseball that the game ceases to become a matter of personal pride and becomes merely a question of civic supremacy . There is as much difference between professional baseball players and amateur baseball players as between Hessians and minute-men . But people who have never known minute-men can not be blamed for liking Hessians . The Great American Game is popular , vastly so ; and as long as it is conducted honestly ; and honorably ( as it generally is ) and amuses the people ( as it generally does ) one might run the risk of being deemed captious if one deplored its existence on grounds of professionalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody has . There 's scarce a man with soul so dead That he ne'er to himself hath said , " My grandmother shall die to-day , And I 'll go see the Giants play . " And the grandmother gag worked very well , too , in the days of your youth ; and you could have her very ill a couple of times before you were finally compelled to exterminate her . But when you grew older , you had to invent other things . Once in a while you could be sick yourself , if you prepared for it judiciously by mooning around the office a couple of days before the game , complaining that you did n't feel well and that you just knew that you were coming down with grippe . And then , on the day in question , you could have your wife call up your employer on the ' phone about eleven o'clock and tell him that you had been trying to come down to the office all the morning and were so eager to get to your work that they had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were suffering terribly with pains in the small of the back and cold feet and spots before the eyes and had a temperature of a hundred and eleven degrees Fahrenheit , but that the doctor thought you 'd be able to get down to work on the next day if you stayed at home and had a complete rest , although of course he could n't tell definitely until your case had developed a little further . And then in the afternoon you 'd sneak off for the Polo Grounds , keeping a weathereye peeled in case you should chance to meet some one from the office ; and whenever you saw an old man with a silk hat on , you 'd duck around a corner and hide there until he was out of sight . You go up to the grounds in the subway , or maybe the elevated ( they run each other a very close race for second place ) , and all the way up you stand wedged a bit more closely than the laws of nature allow , be-  | tween a fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes in them with the point of an umbrella , and an imported American of the common , or garden , variety , commonly known as " guinea , " who seems to have pretty well cornered the smell market and who finds your feet a much more comfortable place to stand on than the floor . And on either side of you are complaining juveniles who eat large , venerable , squashy peaches and then drop the parts for which they have no use in the cuffs of your trousers . At length , after about six or seven eons have elapsed , the guard shoves his face in at the door at the end of the car and gives an imitation of a man with a hare-lip and a split palate in the throes of chronic indigestion . Then everybody begins all at once to try to climb up your back . Some one kicks you on the shin . Some one else tries industriously to step on that part of your feet that is n't already occupied by the common , or garden , American , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car who does n't seem to be in a hurry . Somebody else sticks an - angular elbow like a brass knuckle into your left eye , and yet another somebody prods you a couple of times in the small of the back with something that feels like one of those things that are used to settle protruding cobblestones . And at length you are swished out upon a platform , somewhere , to find yourself teetering along in a turgid torrent of turbulent , tempestuous humanity . After a while you come to long enough to hand your money to a man behind a little window who thrusts a ticket into your face and tells you to " git out o ' de way an ' give de odder guys a chancet " ? a thing which you could n't help doing if you wanted to . And then once again into the vortex . Your next lucid interval finds you sitting on the soft side of a hard board , in the sun , and trying to keep out of the way of a stampede of people who seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else .  | And then , after another interval , things begin to calm down a bit and at last you feel that you can drop your haggard , harried expression and let your face rest once more . You look about to find on your left a fat man with a nearPanama hat and a newspaper , and on your right an ardentlooking youth with a perfervid necktie and a cigarette that smells like a Chinese jossstick . Suddenly a swirl of excited comment turns all eyes to the diamond , and you let yours go with the rest . The game is about to start . A small , lumpy man , in civilian clothes save for the mask he wears , tosses a gleaming white sphere out to the pitcher . The latter spits on his hand , rubs his palm in the dirt , caresses the ball ( just as you yourself used to do in those other days agone ) and then , curling himself up like a dissolute bed-spring , throws . The sphere flashes through the air , the batsman , drawing back powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball lands in the catcher 's mit with a dull thump , and the lumpy umpire yells , " Strike ! " The catcher throws the ball back to the pitcher , and they do the same thing over again , with the exception that this time the umpire yells , " Ball one ! " At length the man at the bat manages to land one of his vicious swings on the now nondescript-colored sphere , and away it goes , with the right-fielder after it like a dog after a stick . And while the batsman runs around the bases the spectators all stand up and yell . Oh , . it is most ex-citing ! The right-fielder overtakes the ball while the runner is doing an Empire State Express over third base and running so fast he ca n't see the blocksignals . And the rightfielder throws to the center-fielder and the center-fielder throws home , the ball reaching the catcher 's hands just as the runner gets to the plate . " Out , " says the umpire . " Wot ! ! " demands the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the runner belongs . " Out , I said , " returns the umpire truculently . " See ? " This is all the bleachers need . " Robber ! " they yell . " Thief ! " " Dub ! " " Crook ! " " I seen it myself ! He was safe as a choich ! Gee , he cou' n't ' a ' be'n no safer ' f he 'd stayed home ! Thief ! Yaaaaaa ! " Meanwhile the runner has brushed the dust from himself and retired to the bench . He gets his pay just the same , so what does he care ? And the captain of the home team , after making , purely for form 's sake , a perfunctory complaint , subsides ; for he , too , gets paid just the same , so what does he care ? And the umpire gets paid just the same no matter what he decided , so , again , what does he care ? In fact , nobody seems to care much except the bleachers . The uninitiated might naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most runs are made , but this is not so . Quite to  | the contrary , the best game is that in which the fewest runs are made . And so the batters step up only to be struck out ; and on the third strike-out , the sides change . My , but it 's exciting ! And so it goes on and on and on , and then , finally , one of the White Socks , or the Red Heads , or whatever they are , hits the ball with a good , left-handed wallop . And away it goes , while the long-legged , hungrylooking batsman hikes off for first base as though there were money waiting there for him . Then some one else manages to get his bat in the way of the ball ; and off he starts for first , while the man formerly on that much-desired spot ( who has , in the interval of two strikes and two balls , managed to land safe on second after a twenty-foot slide on his sternum ) prances gaily off to third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to second ere the left-fielder can retrieve the horsehide globule . A third man comes up to the plate . And then something happens . And the man beside you gets up and hops up and down and soaks you on the ear with his newspaper and yells : " Goo ' boy ! H'rav ! Yah ! Yah ! Geewhatasoak ! Run , y ' ice-wagon , run ! Fineandandy ! Yowl Yow= . Heeeeeeeeeeee-yah ! " And the petulant youth with the hectic scarf and the industrious cigarette cries , gentlemanly , " Raw ! Raw ! Well struck , Cassidy ! " And everyone jumps up and begins to howl and shriek an wave frantic arms , and finally some whirling dervish behind you lams you over the head with a two-by-four joist and crams your hat down over your eyes . By the time you get it up where you can look out from under , everybody is  | walking over you to get out . For the American public is always in a hurry . It is in a hurry to get where it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it came for . It is in a hurry to get home again . And , for that matter , it is in a hurry to get away from home almost as soon as it 's gotten there . The only thing which Americans do n't hurry over is paying bills . Then comes another hour of catch-ascatch-can traveling , and at about six thirty you get home with your clothes torn , your disposition ruined , your hat smashed and a nose that would do credit to a Keeley Cure freshman . Oh , it 's a great game , is baseball ! By and by , when I get another grandmother , I 'm going again .
