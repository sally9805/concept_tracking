Eight years ago , after giving place to George William Curtis 's last words to the readers of this Magazine , the Editor , speaking fur the publishers , the readers , and the Magazine itself , said Good-By to the old " Easy Chair . " Since that time the department has been discontinued , both publishers and readers having the regard which a bereaved family entertains towards " the empty chair . " Mr. Curtis , though not its first occupant , made the " Easy Chair " peculiarly his own through his individual charm of manner and the characteristic qualities of his mind and heart . But there were other charms associated with that old department germane to its conception , and suggested by its very name ; and these occasion regret beyond that felt for the absent master ? a regret for the department itself . In reviving the Easy Chair " it is our good fortune that we are able to commit the new department to the man who , of all living writers , is the fit master to conduct it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts and affections of readers. ? THE EDITOR . IT is not generally known that after forty-two years of constant use the aged and honored movable which now again finds itself put back in its old place was stored in the warehouse of a certain safe-deposit company , in the winter of 1892 . The event which had then vacated the chair is still an near as to be full of a pathos tenderly personal to all readers of this Magazine , and may not he lightly mentioned in any travesty of the facts by one who has been thought of for the empty place . He now , before putting on the mask and mimic editorial robes ? for it was never the real editor who sat in the Easy Chair , except for that brief hour when he took it to pay his deep-thought and deep-felt tribute to its last occupant ? stands with bowed face and uncovered head in that bravest and gentlest presence which , while it abode with us here , we knew as George William Curtis . I It was of course in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor had the Easy Chair stored , and when the unreal editor went the other day to take it out of storage , he found it without trouble , in one of those vast rooms where the more valuable furniture and bric-h-brac are guarded in a special tutelage . If instinct had not taught him he would have known it by its homely fashion , which the first unreal editor had suggested when he described it as an " old red-backed Easy Chair , that has long been an ornament of our dingy office . " That unreality was Mr. Donald G. Mitchell , the graceful and gracioua Tic Marvel , dear to the old hearts that are still young for his Dream Life and his Reveries of a Bachelor , and never unreal in anything but his pretence of being the real editor of the Magazine . In this disguise he feigned that he had " a way of throwing " himself back in the Easy Chair , " and indulging in an easy and careless overlook of the gossiping papers of the day , and in such chit-chat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town talk , while it relieved greatly the monotony of his office hours . " Not " bent on choosing mere gossip , " he promised to be " on the watch for such topics or incidents as " seemed really important and suggestive , and to set them " down with all that gloss , and that happy lack of sequence , which make everyday talk so much better than every-day writing . " While the actual unreality stood thinking how perfectly the theory and practice of the Easy Chair for hard upon fifty years had been forecast in these words , and while the warehouse agent stood waiting his pleasure , the Easy Chair fetched a long , deep sigh . Sigh one must call the sound , but it was rather like that soft complaint of the woody fibres in a table which disembodied spirits are about to visit , and which continues to exhale from it till their peculiar vocabulary detaches itself in a staccato of muffled taps . No one who has heard that sound can mistake another for it , and the unreal editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animate presence . " How long have I been here ? " it asked , like one wakened from a deep sleep . " About eight years , " said the unreal editor . " Ah , I remember , " murmured the Easy Chair , and as the unreal editor bent forward to pluck away certain sprays of foliage that clung to its old red back , it demanded , " What is that ? " " Some bits of holly and mistletoe . " " Yes , " the Easy Chair softly murmured again . " The last essay he wrote in me was about Christmas . I have not forgotten one word of it all : how it began , how it went on , and how it ended ! In the very promise of the year appears the hectic of its decay ... The question that we have to ask , forecasting in these summer days the coming of Christmas which already shines afar off , is this : whether while we praise Christmas as a day of general joy we take care to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Timminses ' . A modest couple make themselves miserable and spend all their little earnings in order to give a dinner to people for whom they do not care , and who do not care for them . . . Christmas is made miserable to the Timminses because they feel that they must spend lavishly and buy gifts like their richer neighbors ... You can not buy Christmas at the shops , and a sign of friendly sympathy costs little . Should not the extravagance of Christmas cause every honest man and woman practically to protest by refusing to yield to the extravagance I ' There ! " the Easy Chair broke off from quoting , " that was Curtis ' . The sweet and reasonable mood , the righteous conscience incarnate in the studied art , the charming literary allusion for the sake of the unliterary lesson , the genial philosophy ' not too good For human nature 's daily food , ' the wisdom alike of the closet and the market-place , the large patience and the undying hopefulness ! Do you think , " said the Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected of it , " that you are fit to take his place ? " In evasion of this hard question the unreal editor temporized with the effect of not having heard it . " I believe that he and Mr. Mitchell were the only writers of your papers till Mr. Alden wrote the last i " The Easy Chair responded dryly , " You forget Mr. Aldrich . " " I I do , I am the only pebble on the shore of time that does or will , " retorted the unreal editor . " But he wrote you for only two months . I well remember what a pleasure he had in it . And he knew how to make his readers share his pleasure ! Still it was Mr. Mitchell who invented you , and it was Curtis who characterized you beyond all the rest . " " For a while , " said the Easy Chair , with autobiographical relish , " they wrote me together , but it was not long before Mr. Mitchell left off , and Curtis kept on alone , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " the Chair returned to the challenge the editor would have evaded , " that you are fit to take his place ? " " Honestly , " said the unreal editor , " I do n't . If I can not make the place my own , I had better leave you in storage . Even if I could keep it his place , do you think that it would be well ? He fulfilled himself , and no one valued and revered him more than T for what he did and was ; but that does n't seem to me a good reason to go on fulfilling him . " Whether the Easy Chair was daunted by this reply , and chose to ignore it , or whether it lied not heeded the unreal editor 's words , it said musingly , as if considering some objections to the candidata : " He had his naillennial hopes as well as you . In his youth he trusted in a time ' When the common-sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in ewe , And the kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end he never lost that faith . As he wrote in one of my best papers , the famous paper on Brook Farm , Bound fast by the brazen age , we can see that the way back to the age of gold lies through justice , which will substitute co-operation for competition . ' He expected the world to be made over in the image of heaven some time , but meantime he was glad to help make it even a little better and pleasanter than he found it . He was ready to tighten a loose screw here and there , to pour a drop of oil on the rusty machinery , to mend a broken wheel . He was not above putting a patch on a rift where a whiff of infernal air came up from the Bottomless Pit ? " " And I also believe in alleviations , " the unreal editor interrupted . " I love justice , but charity is far better than nothing ; and it would be abominable not to do all we can because we can not at once do everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compromises , en attendant the millennium . Let us accept the provisional , the makeshift . He who came on Christmas day , and whose mission , as every Christmas day comes to remind us , was the brotherhood , the freedom , the equality of men , did not He warn us against hastily putting new wine into old bottles ? To get the new bottles ready is slow work : that kind of bottle must grow ; it can not he made ; and in the mean time let us keep our latest vintages in the vat till we have some vessel proof against their fermentation . I know that the hope of any such vessel is usually mocked as mere optimism , but I think optimism is as wise and true as pessimism , or is at least as well founded ; and since the one can no more establish itself as final truth than the other , it is better to have optimism . That was always the philosophy of the Easy Chair , and I do not know why that should be changed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence which neither the Easy Chair nor the unreal editor broke for a while . Then the Chair suggested , " I suppose that there is not much change in Christmas , at any rate ? " " No , " said the unreal editor ; " it goes on pretty much as it used . The Timminses who give tiresome little dinners , which they can not afford to dull people who do n't want them , are still alive and miserably bent on heaping reluctant beneficiaries with undesired favors , and spoiling the simple pleasure of the time ' with the activities of their fatuous vanity . Or perhaps you think I ought to bring a hopeful mind even to the Timminses ? " " I do n't see why not , " said the Easy Chair . " They are not the architects of their own personalities . " " Ah , take care , take care ! " cried the unreal editor . " You will be saying next that we are the creatures of our environment ; that the Timminses would bewiser and better if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that comes to ! " " No , I am in no danger of that , " retorted the Easy Chair . " The Timminses are no such victims of the conditions . They are of that vast moderately moneyed class who can perfectly well behave with sense if they will . Nobody above them or below them asks them to be foolish and wasteful . " " And just now you were making excuses for them ! " " I said they were not the architects of their own personalities ; but nevertheless they are masters of themselves . They are really free to leave off giving little dinners any day they think so . It should be the moralist 's business to teach them to think so . " " And that was what Curtis gladly made his business , " the unreal editor somewhat sadly confessed , with an unspoken regret for his own difference . More than once it had seemed to him in considering that rare nature that he differed from most reformers chiefly in loving the right rather than in hating the wrong ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pitying and accounting for the wrong as an ancient use corrupted into an abuse . Involuntarily the words of the real editor in that beautiful tribute to the high soul they were praising came to the unreal editor 's lips , and he quoted aloud to the Easy Chair : " His love of goodness was a passion . He would fain have seen all that was , fair and good , and he strove to find it so ; and finding it otherwise , he strove to make it so . . . With no heart for satire , the discord that fell upon his sensitive ear made itself felt in his dauntless comment upon social shams and falsehoods . . But he was a lover of peace , and .. as he was the ideal gentleman , the ideal citizen , he was also the ideal reformer , without eccentricity or exaggeration . However high his ideal , it never parted company with good sense . He never wanted better bread than could be made of wheat , but the wheat must be kept good and sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off , " that he did not hurry the unripe grain to the hopper . He would not have sent all the horses at once to the abattoir because they made the city noisy and noiaome , but would first have waited till there were automobiles enough to supply their place . " The Easy Chair caught at the word . " Automobiles ? " it echoed . " Ah , I forgot how long you have been stored , " said the unreal editor , and he explained as well as he could the new mode of motion , and how already , with its soft rubber goloshes , the automobile had everywhere stolen a march upon the iron heels of the horses in the city avenues . He fancied the Easy Chair did not understand , quite , from the intelligent air with which it eagerly quitted the subject . " And the town , as my dear old inventor loved to call it , what is now the conversation of the town ' ? " " Well , you know , that is an embarrassing topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the conversation of the town ' is so largely political , just now . " " Yes , yes . It is still doubtful whether President Cleveland or President Harrison will be re-elected . " " President 01 ? " the unreal editor began , but politely arrested himself , perceiving how far the poor Easy Chair was in arrears with its political history . " I think we had better leave all this branch of the inquiry for another time . You used to be very much interested in Snt heti cal matters ? " " Yes ; far more than in politics . I suppose they are still talking of Realism and Romanticism ? Ts Ibsen still a palpitant question ? I imagine Zola and Tolstoy and Mr. Hardy and Mr. James , and those Spanish novelists you were so fond of , hold their own ? " " My poor Easy Chair , I think we had better change the subject again ! I despair of making you understand how wholly these writers are forgotten . The cry is now for historical romances , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you heard nothing of ? But no matter ! Perhaps in another year no one else will have heard of them . In the mean time these books prosper upon a simple formula of bloodshed and arch-heroism in either sex , and history Bottomwise translated out of all likeness to human events beyond the pre cedent of any former literary success or succession . None of them can last , but no one can foretell how long their kind will last . " The Easy Chair seemed dazed , but recovered itself with the hopefulness characteristic of it . " But the stage , which was beginning to provide itself with a literary drama worthy the best times ? the stage is still keeping its lofty level ? With the plays of Mr. Pinero , Mr. Henry Arthur Jones , Mr. Oscar Wilde , Mr. Bronson Howard , Mr. Bernard Shaw , and their sort , not to mention Ibsen , and Sudan-mum , and the other great Continentals , it must still offer a brilliant intellectual experience to the theatregoer , in spite of the prevalence of the historical novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy Chair a glance of amusement , but then he hesitated , and went on in a more sobered strain than he had meant to use . You wo n't be surprised , " he said , " to hear that the theatre has yielded its facile heart to the historical novel , and that this in several dramatizations is preparing itself to flourish on the stage . But I 'm hound to say that though the playwrights you 've mentioned are not presently in the force of old days , they are still alive to people the scene with their realities when the arch-heroes-and-heroines have had their day and ceased to be . ' And I must n't leave you with an impression of our unrelieved imbecility in fiction . There never was a more imbecile time , perhaps ; but it has had its moments of good sense . Mr. Robert Grant , in his Unleavened Bread , has made a success worthy of the signal quality of one of the truest studies of our civilization ; Mr. James has just put together a group of his incomparable short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical novels , will remain to testify that we had some taste left for what was best in letters ; and against a night as cheerless for the friend of serious fiction as any that ever was there has risen in the name of Mrs. Edith Wharton a star of literary conscience and artistic ideal , pure , clear , serene . There are people ? not the multitudinous polloi who glut themselves with addled history and bloody fable ? there are people who still love the charming truth EDITOR 'S EASY CHAIR . of Miss Wilkins and Miss Jewett ; and who increasingly enjoy the unique quality of George Ade in portraying life . There are people who understand that in The Action and the Word Mr. Brander Matthews has given us a novel of manners which I will not cheapen by saying it outvalues all the neohistorical romances put together . There are people ? " " Come , come ! " said the Easy Chair . " This is n't such a bad time to live in , after all , it appears . But for a supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find to say of Christmas ? What sermon could you preach on that hackneyed theme which would please the fancy and gladden the heart of the readers of a Christmas number , where you should make your first appearance in the Easy Chair ? " III To himself the unreal editor had to own that this was a poser . In his heart he was sick of Christmas : not of the dear and high event , the greatest in the memory of the world , which it records and embodies , but the stale and wearisome Christmas of the Christmas presents , purchased in rage and bestowed in despair ; the Christmas of Christmas fiction ; the Christmas of heavy Christmas dinners and indigestions ; the Christmas of all superfluity and surfeit and sentimentality ; the Christmas of the Timminces and the Tiny Tims . But while he thought of these , by operation of the divine law which renders all things sensible by their opposites , he thought of the other kinds of Christmas which can never weary or disgust : the Christmas of the little children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he addressed himself to the Easy Chair with unexpected and surprising courage . " Why should that be so very difficult ? " he demanded . " If you look at it rightly , Christmas is always full of inspiration ; and songs as well as sermons will flow from it till time shall be no more . The trouble with us is that we think it is for the pleasure of opulent and elderly people , for whom there can be no pleasures , but only habits . They are used to having everything , and as joy dwells in novelty , it has ceased to be for them in Christmas gifts and giving , and all manner of Christmas conventions . But for the young to whom these things arc new , and for the poor to whom they arc rare , Christmas and Christmasing are sources of perennial happiness . All that you have to do is to guard yourself from growing rich and from growing old , and then the delight of Christmas is yours forever . It is not difficult ; it is very simple ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a literal way , you can by a little trying keep yourself young and poor in spirit . Then you can always rejoice with the innocent and riot with the destitute . " I once knew a father , " the unreal editor continued , " a most doting and devoted lather , who , when he bent over the beds of his children to bid them goodnight , and found them high sorrowful and cloyed , ' as the little ones are apt to be after a hard day 's pleasure , used to bid them ' Think about Christmas . ' If he offered this counsel on the night , say , of the 26th of December , and they had to look forward to a whole year before their hopes of consolation could possibly find fruition , they had ( as they afterwards confessed to him ) a sense of fatuity if not of mocking in it . Es-en on the Fourth of July , after the last cracker had been fired , and the last roman candle spent , they owned that they had never been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vague regrets . It was not till the following Thanksgiving that they succeeded in thinking about Christmas with anything like the entire cheerfulness expected of them . " In the mean time their fond father never took the least comfort in thinking about Christmas himself in any of his hours of depression . As the holiday drew near these rather thickened upon him ; and when on Christmas eve he had piously filled the children 's stockings at the chimney , and had hung their presents , neatly labelled , on the Christmas tree , he wished to lie down under it and die , so heavy was his heart with the memories of other Christmas eves , now become Portions and parcels of the dreadful past . ' " " I do n't see any application in this homily , " said the Easy Chair , " or only an application disastrous to your imaginable postulate that Christmas is a beneficent and consolatory factor in our lives . " " That is because you have not allowed me to conclude , " the unreal editor protested , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would so willingly allow you to do , " and " laughed and shook " as if it had been " Rabelais 's easy chair . " The unreal editor thought it bast to ignore the untimely attempt at wit . " The difficulty in this case , both with the father and the children , was largely temperamental ; but it was chiefly because of a defect in their way of thinking about Christmas . It was a very ancient error , by no means peculiar to this amiable family , and it consisted in thinking about Christmas with reference to one 's self instead of others . " " Is n't that rather banal ? " the Easy Chair asked . " Not at all banal , " said the unreal editor , resisting an impulse to do the Easy Chair some sort of violence . At the same time he made his reflection that if preachers were criticised in that way to their faces , there would shortly he very few saints left in the pulpit . He gave himself a few moments to recover his temper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all , it means anything but one 's own pleasure . Up to the first Christmas day the whole world had supposed that it could be happy selfishly , and its children still suppose so . But there is really no such thing as selfish , as personal happiness . " " Tolstoy , " the Easy Chair noted . " Yes , Tolstoy , " the unreal editor retorted . " He more than any other has brought us back to the knowledge of this truth which came into the world with Christmas , perhaps because he , more than any other , has tried to think and to live Christianity . When once you have got this vital truth into your mind , the whole universe is luminously filled with the possibilities of impersonal , unselfish happiness . The joy of living is suddenly expanded to the dimensions of humanity , and you can go on taking your pleasure as long as there is one unfriended soul and body in the world . " It is well to realize this at all times , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in this truth that the worship of Christ begins . Now , too , is the best time to give the Divine Word form in deed , to translate love into charity . I do not mean only the material charity that expresses itself in turkeys and plum puddings for the poor , but also that spiritual charity which takes thought how so to amend the sorrowful conditions of civilization that poverty , which is the antithesis of fraternity , shall abound less and less . Now is the time , now is the time , Now is the hour of golden prime , ' for asking one 's self , not how much one has given in goods or moneys during the past year , but how much one has given in thought and will to remove forever the wrong and shame of hopeless need ; and to consider what one may do in the coming year to help put the poor lastingly beyond the need of help . " To despair of somehow , sometime doing this is to sin against the light of Christmas day , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If on no other day of all the three hundred and sixty-five , we must on this day renew our faith in justice , which is the highest mercy . " The Easy Chair no longer interrupted , and the unreal editor , having made his point , went on after the manner of preachers , when they are also editors , to make it over again , and to repeat himself pitilessly , unsparingly . He did not observe that the Easy Chair had shrunk forward until all its leathern seat was wrinkled , and its carven top was bent over its old red back . When he stopped at last , the warehouse agent asked in whisper : " What do you want done with it , sir ? " " Oh , " said the unreal editor , " send it back to Franklin Square ; " and then , with a sudden realization of the fact , he softly added , " Do n't wake it . "                   @ @
