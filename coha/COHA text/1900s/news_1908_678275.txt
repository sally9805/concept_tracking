txt Hearings on the proposed revision of the tariff were begun by the House Committee on Ways and Means this morning . Schedule A , relating to oils , drugs , paints , chemicals , and allied products , formed the subject of the day 's session and will occupy the corn-mittee probably for several days to come . Twelve out of the nineteen members were on hand , eight Republicans and four Democrats . It was evident at the outset that the committee would hear more pleas for a higher tariff on particular goods than for the reduction of the existing rates . Chairman Payne presided , with Representative John Dalzell , the inveterate standpatter , beside him , and their cheerfulness was obviously increased as the day wore on . I Sixteen business men were represented and eleven made speeches , more than half asking for a higher rate . Of the witnesses who appeared in be-half of a lower tariff , the principal argument was made by Albert Plaut , repro- , sentative of Lehn &; Fink , the big New I York firm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York , a glue importer . Pirat Plea For More Duties . The trend of the testimony that the committee was to receive was indicated clearly at the outset in . the plaa of John F. Queeny of the Monsato Chemical Cornpany of St. Louis , a firm engaged In the manufacture of coal tar products . He asked that these products be taken tram the free list and put on the schedule under a duty of 21 , ( , cents a pound . Only in this way , he said , could his factory , which the present tariff has kept closed for two years , compete with the cheaper raw products obtained abroad . Mr. Queeny was followed by two wit- ' nesses of his own persuasion . They were Stewart Chaplain and John E. Pennock , representing the Semet-Solvay Company of Syracuse , N. Y. , manufacturers of coke and its by-products . They asked that the crude or primary coal tar products be Med-eta-of Jim free list antrunbjected to a duty of one-half a cent a gallon , that pitch be taxed one-quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taxed 7 cents a gallon and that benzol 00 per cent . pure be taxed 40 cents . Much amusement was caused ! n the committee by the admissions extracted from the advocates of higher tariff by Representatives Underwood of Alabama and later by Bourke Cockran of New York . Mr. Underwood led the Syracuse manufacturers to admit that under the present law the retort coke ovens used in extracting the by-products under consideration had increased in the past twelve years from 400 to 3,000 , and that no difficulty was experienced in finding a profitable market for the whole output . Even the Republicans Laughed . " As your by-products are the crude materials of other industries , " asked Mr. Underwood of Mr. Chaplain , " would not the real effect of still higher protection for your already prosperous business mean simply the hedging in of these other manufacturers ? " The answer was a hesitating negative . " Then , " said Mr. Underwood . " exactly what do you expect to get by further protection ? " The Syracuse dealer 's embarrassment was so apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " he said at last , " we would have a wider market and would make more at it . " The Republican members of the committee joined the Democrats in open laughter at this confession . George R. Bower of the Henry Bower Chemical Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia asked that the tariff on the ingredients used in the manufacture of fertilizers be increased by the imposition of specific instead of ad valorem duties . He admitted to Mr. Underwood that all of these materials were already profitably manufactured in this country . The real advantage from further protection would be still greater profits . " Then where will the Government 's revenue come from in a system that you suggest be prohibitive : " asked Mr. Underwood . " Well , " replied the witness , " there are some things that ca n't be made in this country , and the revenue can come from them . But there is not any use in letting through things we can make , ourselves . " Drug Trade Not Helped . Albert Plaut 's argument was in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that it was so high now , with its 25 per cent . rate on medical chemicals , that no such drugs were imported . It served neither purpose mentioned in the title of the bill , he said , because it supplied no revenue to the Government and did not encourage local enterprise . " There are fewer manufacturing chemists to-day than there were twenty years ago , " said Mr. Plaut . " That business has stood still in every respect except the financial side of it . The industry is in the hands of a few men , who are so amply protected by the tariff that they have no incentive to experiment for the betterment of their chemicals . " The price is now fixed arbitrarily , without reference to the cost of production . It is the result of a calculation based on the selling price abroad , plus the duty . That total is only reduced sufficiently to avoid tempting the foreign dealer into the American market . A reduction of the present rite to 15 per cent . would force the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for the difference in the standard of living obtaining in this country and abroad . " - Mr. Plaut said that the'American mann- , // ASK HIGHER TARIFF AT FIRST HEARING // facturer could not plead the high wages of his workmen in his behalf , as few of them received more than $2 per day . He said that strychnine that sells in London and Canada at 32 cents brings 55 cents in this country . Cockran Gains an Admission . Then N. B. Arnold of the Keystone Varnish Company of Brooklyn , Chairman of the National Tariff Revision Committee of the Varnish Makers , rushed to the defense of the existing tariff schedule , and Bourke Cockran took up the role of interlocutor . Mr. Arnold said the varnish men were entirely satisfied with the 35 per cent . rate now accorded them , and wanted everything kept as it was , In reply to a question he declared that the American manufacturers , without any protection , would be perfectly able to compete with the foreign product on their merits , though to a later question from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tariff were reduced much below 25 per cent . " We fight the foreign trade on its merits , " he said , " and we sell abroad at a profit . The tariff does not force us to dump our surplus into foreign countries at a loss . Why , I have sold machines that were bringing $20 in this country for - $3.7.10 in South Africa , , smiling . " You have been very illuminating . " F. T. Walsh of Boston and H. S. Wardner of New Jersey were the other two who asked for lower rates . Among the seekers after still further tariff favors was Harry Mohun , an attorney representing cocoanut oil manufacturers , who asked for a duty on cocoanut oil to enable American manufacturers to make the oil from the Philippine nuts , all of which , he said , was now shipped for manufacture to foreign countries . E. H. Dyer of the paint manufacturers of St. Louis also asked further protection on the crude oils and pigments made by his constituents .
