txt Chief Judge ALTON B. PARKER made a Very interesting and pertinent address to the Georgia State Bar Association on Friday . It is needless to say that if it was pertinent , it was not pertinent to any phase of current politics , and had no even remote bearing on the possibility of the speaker becoming a candidate for the Presidency . That is not Judge PArikEn 's conception of what the Georgia bar expected of him or of what propriety permitted . He chose for his subject the phrase adopted in the Constitution of the United States for the first time in the Fifth Amendment . and repeated with somewhat different context in the Fourteenth Amendment , due process of law . " It is worth noting that in the first of these passages of the Constitution the provision that " no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law , " was intended as a restriction on the Federal Government . It was one of eleven amendments pr , inosed at the first session of the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution proposing the amendments declared that they wt re due to the desire of the conventions of a number of the States . that " further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added , " " in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of the powers ? ' of the new Government . And the Supreme Court distinctly decided that the first ten of these amendments " were not intended to limit the powers of the State Governments in respect to their own people , but to operate on the National Government alone . " On the other hand it is plain that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to apply to the State Governments the restrictions which the Fifth Amendment had previously placed on the National Government . On this point the statement of Judge PARTiEll is particularly interesting . He says : At no time in the history of this country could thiQ amendment have been adopted prior to the so-called reconstruction period : and if it were not now a part of the Constitution , it is net probable that it could be incorporated into that instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been then understood to confer upon Congress the power to enforce the restrictions on State powers contained in the amendment , and upon the Supreme Court power to set aside provisions of a State Constitution or statute which in the judgment of that court abridge the privileges or imMunities of citizens of the United States , deprive any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law , or deny to any person within the jurisdiction of the State equal protection of the laws  --  thereby placing the essential rights of life , liberty , and property under the ultimate protection of the Nation. , I liovernment . Beyond all question support was obtained for the adoption of that amendment upon the supposition that its sole purpose was to benefit ti ; , c.dorcd rie  --  e , which at that time needed protection against unfriendly action in the State where they were resident . The amendment was designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that are enjoyed by white persons . This allusion to the probable temper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It amounts to the expression of an opinion that the real purpose of the Nation in adopting the amendment was a temporary one . which has practically passed away , and that the amendment is liable to a construction which , had it been foreseen , would have prevented its adoption even then . Such an opinion it is open to any one to form , and no one probably more clearly than Judge PARK ER would see that it is in the nature of pure speculation . Its immediate and logical effect is to convey the impression that in cases arising under this amendment to the Constitution Judge PARKER does not expect the Supreme Court to be guided by a too literal interpretation of the words of the amendment or to impose on State Governments further restrictions than are absolutely necessary . That is an ingenious view . In the light of recent action by the court it is a reasonable one . and is another indication of the curious plasticity of even the most rigid provisions of the law under a written Constitution applied to representative government .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
