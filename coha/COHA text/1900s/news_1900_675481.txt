txt Senator Marcus A. Hanna was in high good humor all day to-day . He spent most of the day at the Hotel Walton , and talked freely , but said little . He gave little time to the contested election cases . The committee attended to that , and he had weightier matters to deal with . lie acted as though he had settled the great question of the Vice Presidency , and was relieved of all further worry . " Yes , " he said in reply to a cross-fire of questions about . the nomination , " I see that Senator Allison met Platt and Bliss and others at New York . That was quite natural when he was on his way there and I traveled with him on the train . He rattler expected he would run against such old acquaintances . I really could not guess what he wanted to see them for , or whether he had an understanding that he should meet them . I would like awfully well , you know , to know just what occurred if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned ? " It would be interesting to know just how they felt in regard to that matter . Bliss is not a candidate , you know , and he could give the opinion of an outsider . I wonder whether he will support Wood-ruff ? " " A great deal of sympathy , " it was suggested , " is felt to-day for Woodruff on account of the manner in which you killed his boom yesterday . " " Oh , Woodruff 's all right , but in what I said I merely reflected what I know to be the sentiment of Republican delegates generally . If Woodruff is to be Vice President , and possibly President , this is not his year . I did n't mean to be harsh or offensive , but the truth- might as well out at once and thus end the gentleman 's agony . " Senator Allison has not anticipated Saturday night and sent you that promised telegram in regard to his decision about something ? " was asked . " How sharply you boys do seize upon little things ; " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dignified and deliberate in all his move exits , and he is not likely to send a hurry message about anything . " ' " What do you think of the Republican row in New York , and how will it affect the election ? " " Why , have they a row there ? I had n't heard of it . I fancy there is no more row than always obtains among partywho look after their fences . I hve had , my own little affairs , you know , but ' I believe Ohio is in the Republican column , and ? that it will stay there . " " Is it necessary for Republican success that-New York should have the candidate for Vice President ? " " NO sectional or State question has anything to do with Republican Snccess . Alaska were a State and the nomination for Vice President were given to Dawson City . we would win all the same . New York is not in doubt . If it were the mistakes of Democrats would discount any little row there might be among Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been named for the Vice Presidency , leaving Allison and Bliss out of the question , just about the finest-looking combination of favorite sons that ever came before a convention ? " " Now you have asked a question which I can answer . Any one of them would be a pretty and graceful picture in the big chair which is the throne of the Senate . If we were looking merely for a presiding officer of the body of which I have the honor to be an humble part we could not make a mistake by taking any one of them ; but you must remember that we are to nominate a possible President , and even some of the finest fellows in the world would hardly claim that they size up to the requirement . " " ' We have the President . The Vice Presidential contest stands out single and alone , uncomplicated , as it usually is , by the intense feeling and disappointment which often follows in the wake of defeated candidates for the nomination for President . It is unhampered by promises or desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vice Presidential nomination should be made a serious question , and a man chosen who will at least detract in no way from the weight and dignity of the contest , and who would , if possible , give the country an Administration equally as good as that of if he should by any mishap to the President ascend to the first place . That is the whole matter in a nutshell . " I have my , preferences . The President has his . Each will hope that the convention may indorse his choice . But all other good Republicans have each their favorite and will hope and work for his success . No one , no matter what his position , has any one to thrust upon the convention against its majority sentiment . Now let 's talk about the weather . As the farmers say , this is a beautiful corn shower . " To all questions about platform Senator Hanna repeated his former expression that the platform has already been written on the utterances of the President and the acts of the Republicans in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
