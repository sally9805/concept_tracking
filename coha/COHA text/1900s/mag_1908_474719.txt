SOME time ago I reread this play , for the first time after many years , amid the scenes of its enactment . Standing on the hill brow over the traditional prison of Socrates , I had on my right the hill Museion and , beyond the intervening shadow filled ravines and sun swept uplands , the long , vast , purple blue mass of Hymettos , at the north seeming to break upon Pentelicon , at the south falling slowly to the plain of Marathon . To my left , Phaleron gleamed whitely against the dark blue of a wind troubled sea ; the Piraeus lay more southerly , cloudily pale brown ; beyond , from the Bay of Salamis , the smoke of a Panhellenios steamer rose , hung , serpentinely trailed eastward , looking like a mourning banner hung upon the pale blue ramparts of the Argive mountains . In front of me , the sheer eastern ascent of the Acropolis , temple crowned , superb ; on the northeastern slope the Dionysiac theatre and the Odeion of Herodes Atticus drowned in velvet purple shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nymphs ; between these , the isolate , symmetrical beauty of the Theseion , and a great part of Athens . The day was hot , and at that hour of noon few wayfarers were abroad . For a time I had been idly watching the wild and ragged figure of a wandering Epirote on the broad white dusty road which winds upward from the Olympieion and forks to right and left of the Pnyx , at the junction where a dishevelled tavern inaptly named /bacptirqc commands the two ways . My companion had drawn my attention to the man . Evidently famished , he snatched at any garbage by the wayside that could possibly break the edge of hunger . Beyond the tavern he disappeared from sight , but not long after we caught a glimpse of him on the Areopagus , his tattered , picturesque figure silhouetted against the sky , close to the spot traditionally held to be that vol .. CXVT. ? No. 696. - 11 3where Orestes obtained absolution for the murder of lily twumestra . That glimpse was one not to he forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man was evidently cursing and railing , as with outstretched arms he shook his clenched fists , now upward to where the Wall of Themistocles overhangs the rude grottos of Pan and Apollo , as though imprecating the white immortal serenity of the Parthenon , now towards the humming gray brown city beneath and beyond him . The same thought occurred to us both . My companion , an Athenian and an accomplished Shakespearian scholar , asked me what was in my mind . " That line in Timon of Athens , " I answered , " where Timon , confronted by Alcibiades and Phrynia and Timandra , cries out in bitter anger , " Yes , I too was thinking of Timon , " he said , " but of a line still more apposite , I fancy ? that when he is savagely eating a root while he is railing at Apemantus , and snarls out : It seemed strange to me to sit there , between blue Hymettos and the azure Saronie Gulf , with the Parthenon overlooking all Athens before me , and discuss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the problem of one of the lesser known plays of our English Shakespeare . Not that Shakespeare is an unfamiliar name iu the Athens of to-day . A play that always draws hundreds of eager auditors is Pcopatos Kai Ioaltra ( Romeo and Juliet ) , and the uneducated as well as the educated throng to see 0 FILT0p0C rnc BEVETME ( The Merchant of Venice ) . When , last spring , 0 BualArvc Ala ( King Lear ) was given , every part of the chief theatre in Athens was full . " There is a clue , " I said to my companion , that day I speak of ? " there is a clue to Timon in a single brief but pregnant statement . The whole problem is revealed in it . " My friend pondered a minute or two , and then with a smile remarked : " Just so : and what we have been stating and agreeing upon gives me the clue to that clue . It is in that bitter and moving third scene in the fourth act , is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not agree with me that when Timon gives that clue in is oblique ' it is Shakespeare speaking for himself , while in T am Misanthropos , and hate mankind , ' it is Shakespeare the dramatist who speaks . . . that is , he who sees and he who speaks through another mind and another nature than his own ? ' ' Truly , " All is oblique " is the keynote to the sad and wild music , now in grand harmonies , now in fierce and blatant , almost insanely fantastic discords , of this strange and perplexing play , Timon of Athens . Strange because it reveals to us the most proud , powerful , and joyous writer of our nation in the throes of weariness and disillusion , almost in the final degringolade of despair . Perplexing , because , though all but unquestionably written in his magnificent maturity , just before , or contemporaneously with , or immediately after Macbeth , Othello , and Lear , it lacks the continuity of constructive technique and ; lie con-tinnily of fused emotion and imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three marvellous plays . To deepen the perplexity , there are continuously frequent lines , many passages , whole pages even , which in metrical infelicity and startling lesion in dramatic craft all but compel the Shakespearian student to the conviction that these bewildering lapses are due to the mechanical art of a far inferior playwright . " All is oblique " : does it not sound a basic note that has already been heard echoing through Macbeth , through Othello , through Lear ? It is the lamentation of the old king : it is the nocturnal storm in the darkness of the heart of Dcsdemona 's passionate lord ; it is the implicit plea in the shaken mind of the Thane of Cawdor , listening to Lilith beside him and to the ancient Serpent within him . Above all , it is the continual tidal monotone below the long tempestuous surge and seething calms of Hamlet . The same mind , perplexed by the veiled tragicomedy of the human soul and its possible yet almost paralyzingly incredible destiny , sighs , in the shapers and colored speech of imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , . . . " or through the mouth of Claudio in Measure for Measure , in the superb lyrical meditation beginning , " Ay , but to die and go we know not where , . . " or in that speech of the Third Servant to Flavius in the second scene of the fourth act of Timon of Athens : Coleridge recognized this kinship of Tinton with Hamlet when he spoke of the later play as " an after-vibration " of its great predecessor . Other critics have been even more daring , and some have said that because of this or that metrical test Timon of Athens must have been written in the period of hear ; or that because of this or that intellectual test it must have been written in the ferment of a tempestuous adolescence ; or that because of this or that spiritual test it must have followed the sombre bitterness of Lear and the tragical gloom of Macbeth , . or that by the law of suspense and reaction it must have been the backward stumbling in the dark before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Tempest . But one of the ablest of Shakespearian critics has already in this series written so wisely of this inferential method that T may be excused for repeating Mr. Watts - Duntnn 's words , from his admirable essay on Hamlet : " In the metrical test in Shakespearian criticism there may be something if the investigations are not pursued too far , fur it is true , no doubt , that metre is a fine art -- true , no doubt , that there are thousands of new things to be learned by the poet in the exercise of that art as he passes through life , and , consequently , that what to him may have seemed good metre as a boy may seem had metre at maturity , after he has made a thorough study of the great masters of the art . Keats 's case is a notable instance of this ; so is Tennyson 's . But the test is a very unsafe one . As regards , however , evolving a spiritual order for Shakespeare 's plays , this seems to me a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And as , in this connection , the same acute and always suggestive critic has , in the same essay , also indicated the too prevalent tendency to ignore the difference between the dramatist and the lyrist , I may further quote these few words : " Does any one really think that such a man i. a. , the Shakespeare we know by the intuitive interpretation of significant facts wrote plays to bring out his thoughts and emotions as they arose ? To think so is to ignore the difference between the dramatist and the lyrist , who sings because he must win sympathy for his joys and pains , must sing or die . The dramatic instinct being to give sympathy and not to ask it , the dramatist has no great need of expression unless the need comes from the outside . The external need was , with Shakespeare , the need of ' getting a living ! . . . Such a career makes it impossible to say , either from the metrical movement of his utterances or from their tone , This belongs to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that the characters of Hamlet , of Timon , and of King Lear are simply studies of insanity . The same argument wntild include Othello , Macbeth , and a score of other famous personages . If they are insane , it is with that terrible madness of the soul when it is in revolt against the tyranny of mortal things ? of the body , of time and circumstance , of tradition and convention , of truth naked and wonderful , and of palpable and futile illusion . It is that cosmic madness which has uttered itself through many mouths , from Ecclesiastes to Nietzsche . The whirling insanity of Lear can rise to become the lyric agony of all human disillusion , and " Blow , blow , thou winter wind , " rings in the cars of all of us as a terrible and universal chorus . In Lear , in Hamlet , in Timon , there is the same ground tone that carries up through the wild surge of this play MisanthroposOnly , as it happens , we do not always discern what is the weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the deep and terrible laughter of a heart filled with the iconoclastic wrath of a divine pity , the infinite yearning of fraternal sorrow , and the titanic humor of a mind which perceives every link in the vast and complicated chain of cause and effect . In a sense these three plays are passionate protests against " the insanity of things , " that madness from the individual to the many , or from the many to the individual , which invites and compels the clash of complex fatalities . In a sense , only ; for more and more the Shakespearian student , the student of the man and the sources of his genius , as well as the reflection of both in the mirrors of imagination , becomes chary of " reading into " the " stage motives " of the great dramatist philosophical and symbolical preconceptions and intentions which possibly he never entertained . " Things more excellent than every image , " says Iamblichus , " are expressed through images . " And it may well be that the Imagination , that supreme maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes of genius , suddenly and spontaneously , what to the rest of us may seem premeditated in intent and deliberate in expression . There must , of course , be in genius a virgin world , a new and unexploited world compact of deep knowledge and the clear air of a great mind and the swift and wide movement of spiritual intuition ; but the outcome may be sudden as lightning , as unexpected , with all the finality of austere thought , with all the economy of deliberation . Ab " the Poet " in Timon of Athens says : And we gauge this " inspired " utterance by what intuitively we feel to be its essential truth : we may scorn the flint , or ignore the latent miracle of fire , but we can not deny the bright flame when circumstance has flashed it out before our eyes . In the wise words of the wise Emerson , the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report ; it is genius only that realizes and adds . It has been urged that Timon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice is not authentic throughout . A recent German critic has even demonstrated to his own satisfaction that this play is not Shakespeare 's at all , but the work of Heywood , with passages " lifted " from Bishop Hall and others , and possibly from the great poet himself , somehow surreptitiously . That need not be argued . Read , even in the frantic imprecatory rhetoric of Timon in his bitter ecstasy , the sudden magic of these lines on " the yellow slave and common pestilence of man-kind ? Gold " : Read these and a score of other lines and passages that might as readily be selected , and " the authentic voice " will sound imperative above all pedantic theorizing . And there is , of course , one passage where the inmost genius of Shakespeare speaks in revelation and noblest music , those last words of Timon that we hear before Alcibiades and the Senators of Athens learn from a soldier that anthem sounding requiem , For that matter , if mere quality of music be a test , as indeed it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely " delicate air " in Act IV. , Scene III. , Much has been written of the metrical irregularities , banalities , and even pre-longed collapses noticeable in Timon of Athens . These have been adduced to prove that so great a poet as Shakespeare , and Shakespeare in his maturity , could not have committed this t ? se-majesM against his art , against his genius . It is open to doubt if Shakespeare much considered the niceties of his art when writing in the rough , when reshaping and revising the work of others . He had all the divine recklessness of that great image of nature outlined in a famous prose-poem of Turgenieff . To quote again from Mr. Wafts-Dunton 's I armlet essay . . " exactly as Nature works does that other great artist work the great illogical artist Shakespeare . " There is a surer and higher test : that of the fundamental conception , the formative basic thought . " It is not metres , " says Emerson , " but a metre-making argument that makes a poem ? a thought so passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an animal , it has an architecture of its own , and adorns nature with a new thing . The thought and the form are equal in the order of time , but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form . " I am aware of all , or nearly all , that has been written critically of Tinton of Athens , from Johnson to Coleridge ( who does not show his wonted comprehensive insight in comparing Timon and Ifogarth 's " Rake 's Progress " ) , to Mr. Fleay , who devolves upon ingenuity the incommunicable attributes of imaginative insight and intellectual intuition ; from Dr. Brandes and the Teutonic many and undesired to Mr. Guerrois , to Mr. Boas , to chat impartial and scrupulous Amer-ken editor , Dr. Rolfe .. In all there seems to me too much dalliance with the temptation to prove and disprove . It is true that the Folio version printed by Hemminge and Condell some seven years after Shakespeare 's death is a most corrupt text , and grossly printed . It is true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by an inferior hand . It is true that it is not the invention of Shakespeare . It is true that there is much to he said for the supposition that Shakespeare found or was given an incompetent original , and worked on the shapeless mass to make it a pre- . sentable play . There is much to be said also for the supposition that he himself wrote it in the rough , nobly and greatly where moved , recklessly or weariedly or indifferently ( as many a novelist writes his crude drafts , to him useful and significant , to others formless and even ' barren in suggestion ) where not so moved , and then laid the play aside , and that it was loosely rewritten and augmented later by a hired hand or an ambitious novice or fellow playwright . Again , there is much to be said for the supposition that it is really the work of an unpractised but not incompetent unknown author ( for none of whom we know , writing at the time when Timon was presumably composed , can be accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare , and in the overlooking of which , while still taken with the idea of its production on the stage , the great poet-dramatist every here and there interpolated a line or passage or part . scene from the pure gold of hisown inexhaustible mint . It was no lesser man who wrote the lines already quoted , or who in the turbulence of rhetoric could rise to such Miltonic vision and cadence as , it could be no other than the master poet , the poet of Hamlet , who wrote those lines spoken by Timon to the Senators when dimly he feels the shadow of death coming towards his outwearied body and agonized soul , These are " costly " words . " But Homer 's words " ( again I quote Emerson ) " are as costly and admirable to Homer as Agamemnon 's victories are to Agamemnon . " But is there not much to be said for the supposition that T1111012 , of Athens is , with all its faults and demerits , substantially ? the work of Shakespeare ? We know his amazing heedlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in judging of the authenticity of a work of imagination we have to allow more for the probabilities that make for conviction than for the probabilities that make for negation . Parts of this play may well not be his , or put together crudely after his death from rough hints or halting inference , as , for example , all that immediately follows the last of the great music in the fifth act , ending with " Timon hath dune his reign . " But in the essential conception , in the poetical ground-swell , in the actual and central dramatic achievement of Timon of Athens , surely we have the genuine sign-manual of our greatest , of one who had come to profound weariness and lassitude and darkness of spirit down the giant stairs of Hamlet and Macbeth and Lear , and by inward ways of sorrow and disillusion unknown to us , and had not yet " stepped westward " in rymbeline , or seen the white vision of Imogen , or heard the aerial music of The Tempest .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
