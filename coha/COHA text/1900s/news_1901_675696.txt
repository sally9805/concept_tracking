txt rested . They were accused , respectively . with being the proprietor , bartender , and . housekeeper . All the prisoners were held under $500 bail for examination on next Tuesday . One raid was made in Capt . Cooney 's precinct , the West Thirty-seventh Street Station . Shortly before 1 o'clock four men entered the station ' house and handed to Capt . Cooney a warrant calling for the arrest of one Henry Bush in a Raines law hotel known as The Elite . The Captain , accompanied by Detectives Michaels and Coughlin and two policemen , started for the house . Bush could not be found , but Louis Elsmer of 454 Fourth Avenue . a representative of the Committee of Fifteen , pointed out George Howard , a clerk , and demanded his arrest . Capt . Cooney placed him under arrest . 1-loward was locked up charged with violating Section 322 of the Penal Code , relating to disorderly houses. , Elsmer wanted the Captain to clean out the hotel , but Capt . Cooney refused , saying he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Additional raids were made by the Committee of Fifteen between midnight and 1 o'clock this morning . A dozen or more places were visited . Most of them were in the Tenderloin . A few were along the Bowery . The places visited were mostly concert halls and caf  --  s . The proprietor in most cases or his manager , a bartender or two , and in some instances a doorkeeper , were arrested . Every place visited was thronged with men and women , and there - was more or less excitement , but it quickly passed away when the inmates of the places found they were not wanted . The raids , like all managed by the Committee of Fifteen , were made on warrants issued by Justice Jerome . Robert , Grier Monroe seemed to be the moving spirit , and he was assisted by several " volunteers , " a lot of McCullagh 's detectives , and the police in the precincts where the places were situated . In the Tenderloin most of the men the Committee wanted to arrest had been tipped by somebody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessfully and with not half the prisoners expected , Justice Jerome held court in the Thirtieth Street Station . He demanded information as to who had done the tipping . Col. Robert Grier Monroe . who had headed the raiders , said he did not know of any one having left the station after he and his companions , agents of the committee , had appeared there . He said he had the Sergeant lock the doors , and that the only people who could have left the place were two newspaper men . It was proved later that these two had not gone further than the station steps . The Justice asked Sergt. Carson if he knew of anybody leaving . Carson replied that he was certain no one had gone out , as the door had been held fast by the doorman . But somebody did leave the station after Sergt. Carson had ordered the doors locked to listen to Col. Monroe read the warrants he had . The man who slipped out was a , " ward " detective . As he did so there was some confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array in front of the Sergeant 's desk , while the committee 's men thronged around the sides of the room . When the detective reached the street he met . another officer in plain clothes . This other is a cousin of one of the keepers of disorderly resorts in the Tenderloin . The two spoke together for a minute . Then they ran toward Sixth Avenue . Where they went could not be learned . but when the raiders reached the avenue a few minutes later they found that their coming had been announced , although most unusual means had been adopted to keep any one from finding out about the plans for the night . Had they delayed their departure from the station just a few minutes longer than they did , it is doubtful ? whether they would have gotten the pris  --  oners they did . .. iat , 41.114,0e .. Terome was indignant . He . said 6i ... would-investigate the matter to the bottom and that he already had aaclue.to the , , name of the man who had given The infermation . Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by ten or twelve of their detectives , appeared at the station shortly before midnight and handed to Sergeant Carson the warrants for alleged proprietors of various notorious disorderly resorts in the neighborhood . A platoon of ten policemen was ordered out to assist the Colonel and his deputies . This formidable array , after the tipster had slipped out , as told above , proceeded to score on one of the greatest failures in the way of a night 's work that has yet been credited to the committee . The places raided were the Haymarket , Thirtieth Street and Sixth Avenue ; Empire , Bohemia , and Cairo . all in West Twentyninth Street . and the Alhambra , in West Twenty-eighth Street . Under the name of Bohemia two houses were entered , the second adjoining the restaurant and caf ? , and consisting of bedrooms . It was claimed by the committee 's representatives that this was connected with the restaurant . One feature of the night 's adventures was the encounter between one of the committee 's representatives and Edward Glennon , a detective attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name among those who know the district as being the real head of police affairs there . ? When the body of raiders marched from the station to the Haymarket Glennon was inside the resort . He gave evidence of surprise when the doors were ordered opened and Col. Monroe entered . The latter forthwith commanded his followers from the station to prevent any one inside from getting out . regardless of all excuses . This order was followed by the wildest confusion . Women screamed , and scores of men , clad in dress suits for the most part , looked anxiously toward the raiders . Some of them approached the raid leaders and told sad tales about their wives and children at home , about how they had just dropped in to see what kind of a place it was , never knowing , really , that it was disorderly . Meanwhile Glennon viewed the scene for a minute or two in silence , not appearing anxious to get out himself . Finally he went up to one of the head raiders and said : " Look here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools of the police ? You have n't a right to keep all these folks in here , I tell you . You only have warrants for two men . It is illegal for you to keep the rest of these men and women shut up in this way . " Then followed an argument . Glennon won . The committee 's men ordered the doors opened . Meanwhile they had arrested one of the men for whom they had warrants . He was William Graham . known as the - bouncer " of the place . He said he was a " manager of balls . parties , and picnics ' ? and that he lived at 482 Sixth Avenue . The other warrant for an attach ? of the Haymarket was for Edward Cory , the proprietor , whose name is in front of the building . He could not be found . The raiders searched the house thoroughly from top to bottom . This done , they left the Haymarket . That resort had not been raided before since Capt . Chapman made his famous onslaught on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody he found therein , proprietor , bartenders , visitors , and all . When last night 's raid was over the leader of the orchestra started up his tune anew , but few of the guests who had been allowed to go out would return . Some of them had lingered around the door to see what would happen . but the - ones that were persuaded to re-enter were so few that they could be counted on one 's fingers . To Twenty-ninth Street the committee 's men went . They struck the Cairo first . This place . too , had had an interval of peace for years . It was packed to the doors when Mr. Monroe appeared . At the sight of him and his followers there were cries of " the cops ! " Then men and women tumbled over each other in their efforts to get out . No attempt was made to stop them , except long enough to see that the persons for whom there were warrants were not among them . The only arrest made here was that of Patrick Shea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came next . There a like scene took place . Hank Johnson was arrested and locked up on the charge of assisting in the running of a disorderly house . At the Empire not a prisoner was made . There were few people in the place , and it was learned that the proprietor and his associates had been " tipped off . " After the Empire the raiders went across the street and into the house adjoining the Bohemia , which , it was claimed , was associated with that resort . Here they arrested Etta Howard , who said she was the housekeeper . At the Alhambra Demetrius Recopoulis , John H. Mason . and Bettie Syford were arON THE EAST SIDE , Alderman Fleck Furiously Indignant at His Arrest  --  More " Tipping Off . " The biggest catch. : of last night 's raid was Alderman Frederick F. Fleck , whose place at 106 Bowery. the Manhattan Music Hall , was raided . Three agents of the Fifteen called at the Mulberry Street Station at midnight and handed a bunch of warrants to Sergt. Hearley . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warrants . The squad , headed by the Fifteen 's agents , marched down the Bowery . A large crowd followed on the heels of the policemen . The latter mounted guard at the doors of the music hall . and the sixty or more pa trons within began to get excited . A woman dashed lip stairs and called to Alderman Frederick F. Fleck , the owner of the place , the t something ? ? was doin ' " clown sitars . He ran down and was arrested . The warrants also called for Julius Frank ; forty-tour years old , a waiter , of 349 East Thirtieth Street , and he was arrested . The two were taken to the station . Max J orr:sch of 118 Bowery , a pawn broker , at once bailed them out in $500 each . Simultan-:ously a raid was made on the Empire Concert Hall , at 253 Bowery , by Capt . Wal.eh and a squad of his men from the Eldridge Street Station . They were guided by George W. Mc.rgan , a Secretary of the Fifteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , of 253 Bowery ; James Cunningham , thirty-six years old , of 226 Second Avenue , the cashier , and Sam Wise , alias Kid White , a bartender , of 269 Bowery. were arrested . The charge against Alderman Fleck and Manager Iba was maintaining a disorderly house . and against their employes , aiding and abetting the same . Alderman Fleck was furious when arrested . He abused the complainant for the committee , Edward C. Beecher , calling him names . " You are a dog , a dirty dog . " he said . " You accuse me of running a disorderly house . These policemen know me for twenty years . They never heard of me doing a disorderly thing . I 'll give a certified check right here , right now , for $1,000 . If it ai n't good in the morning . I 'll cut my throat . " Charles J. Fay . a lawyer for the fifteen , called at the Fifth Street Station at midnight . He found Sergt. Place in charge . Five men were sent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 110 Third Avenue . The only person there was the woman named Mary MeGurk in the warrants . She was arrested . She gave her name at the station as Susan Kelly , forty-five years old , housekeeper . 339 ' West Thirty-seventh Street . She was accused of aiding and abetting a disorderly house . Charles Miller , an agent for the Committee , told Capt . Diamond that the place had been tipped off . Yes " exclaimed Policeman Woodbridge , " and you 're the guy that did the tipping . You was sitting in the place when we pinched it . " Miller ' then explained to Lawyer Fay that he had been in the place , knowing a raid was to take place . He wanted to be on ' hand . Five minutes before the police arrived , he said he saw the assistant manager hurriedly confer with the manager and then both dashed out . The house. , keeper was the only person named in the warrants present when the r ? . olice got there . Lawyer Fay called up Justice Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped off The Merrimac . Capt . Diamond then went to the telephone and insisted that-if any tipping had been done it was not from his station .
