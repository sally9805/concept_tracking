The Civil Service Commissioners are at it again , sticking their noses into other people 's business . It is true , Francis E. Baker ; United States Circuit Judge for Indiana , violated one of the Federal laws he was sworn to enforce by making postal clerks pay 5 per cent . of their salary to the Republican campaign fund of 1902 ; but when he has enforced so many laws , ca n't he break one now and then just by way of aiding the glorious Republican party ? Folks may think that there was something mean and contemptible in making a poor postal clerk ' borrow money to pay over his $30 or $50 , but Judge Baker and George W. Plunkitt see the thing in a different light . They know it is far better that every least clerk should go into debt than that their respective parties should be defeated , and they are naturally not willing to let a little thing like the law stand in their way . As it their action were not mean enough in itself , the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slur on the judge and a very worthy law by saying that the statute of limitations is the " only defence which can be opposed to the charge " ! Well , why should it not be ? Is n't it on the statute-books " Have n't Congressman Lucius Littauer , the New York canal ring , and a host of other lights , including at least one insurance president , got out of trouble by resorting to it in time of need ? The report of H. H Schwartz , special agent of the Government Land Office sent to investigate entries on the Shoshone forest reserve in Idaho , should be published and distributed as ' The Land Grafter 's Hand-Book . ' It covers an even one hundred claims in one township ; and its brief paragraphs , ending always with the refrain , " has never lived on the land , " show the wide range of infection from the land-grabbing fever that has raged throughout the West . At the head of Mr. Schwartz 's list marked " Exhibit A " is this brief statement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the general manager of the 0 . R. &; N. Co. , and resides and has his headquarters at Portland , Ore . He has never lived on the land . " At the head of the list marked " Exhibit B " ? including thirty members of the " Slate Creek Settlers ' Association " ? is the name of James Boaz , claiming land in section 17 , who is a saloonkeeper of Wallace , Idaho . He " has never resided on the claim . " A milliner , a dentist , an en-mayor , a " train butcher , " a carpenter , a cigarmaker , 1 a j policeman , a dance-hall proprietor , a lawyer , a railway conductor , a millm in , a miner , and so on , to the end of the last ? apparently no one was free from 4. e danger .

Anybody could have foreseen that the demand for an 18,000-ton battleship would speedily be followed by the cry that we must have one of 19,000 tons lest the nation be subjugated by the Philistines . We confess to a little surprise , however , at finding that the demand for the 20,000-ton vessel has already begun . It has been started by Commander Bradley " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Institute , to which he gives the humorous title , " Compromiseless Ships " He is satisfied that in a 20,000-ton war vessel no compromise between armor , guns , and machinery ' would be necessary . His ideal battleship will have " sufficient speed , sufficient , armament , and sufficient power to whip any ship of any probable enemy . " So it might , for about one year , or until England and France had launched vessels of a similar type or of 21,000 tons . This game will not stop because Commander Fiske is satisfied with his 20,000-ton vessel . Admiral Dewey is already insisting on an 18,000-ton boat because England and France would go our last creations of 16,000 tons one better . If we did not know Commander Fiske 's excellent reputation as a scientific officer , we should be tempted to regard his paper as a charming bit of sarcasm , particularly as he plans for a speed . of only eighteen knots . Yet one of the reasons why our two new battleships , the Mississippi and Idaho , are declared obsolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only seventeen knots , and they can not keep up with their consorts . Not content with his slap at the big-navy boomers by his praise of our coast defences , Secretary Taft proposes to take sharp issue with his chief in the matter of army promotions  --  if Washington dispatches are to be trusted . The President , it will be remembered , wishes to have officers advanced not by seniority as at present , but by selecting for advancement the brightest men and the hardest workers in their grades . His public declarations to this effect have done a good deal to unsettle the army . and have brought about a very warm discussion which has revealed the opposition of a great majority of the army officers . They are convinced that no method of selecting can be devised which will not sooner or later be improperly influenced by politics , nepotism , or social entanglements . Secretary Taft appears now to have come to their point of view , and to lean to the plan , long advocated in these columns , of weeding out the drones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not selection , but elimination , is what the army needs . Time has shown that AssistantaS'ecretary Roosevelt was all wrong in his efforts to remedy the naval engineering situation ; it is to be hoped that he will in this case defer to the judgment of his Secretary of War . After all , it seems that American fishermen do care whether or not Newfoundland furnishes them bait . It will be recalled that , over a year ago , Senator Lodge , in discussing a possible retaliatory measure against us for our failure to ratify the Hay-Bond treaty , asserted stoutly that American fishermen could get all the bait they wanted at Gloucester and Eastport , and keep it on ice . Now , however , when the Gloucester men are actually at Bonne Bay without bait , and when Newfoundland is emphasizing her determination to seize the vessel of any captain who violates the provisions of the " bait law , " we see Son-in-law Gardner , the Senator 's special envoy in the House of Representatives from Gloucester , posting off to Washington to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Premier Bond to complain that Newfoundland had for fourteen years been giving the United States greater privileges than England herself enjoyed without any reciprocal advantage . Of course , that was but evidence of our tariff wall 's skilful construction , When a benefit could flow in unobstructed , and yet meet an air-tight valve when it tried to flow out , the contrivance was admirable . But when the beneficent inflow is checked there is a great row . The " Convention of 1818 " is appealed to , and Secretary Root is asked to see if something can not be done . Now is the time for Senator Lodge to start his great bait-refrigerating plant . Along with the annual bankers ' convention , delegates of the country 's trust companies and savings banks meet for separate discussions , and the topic which last week at once came up at Washington was the danger involved in the present lax law and supervision governing those institutions . Safeguarding of fiduciary business is expected from New York State as it is not from a score of other States where banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can be said that trust companies of this State , holding eight hundred million dollars of demand deposits , are allowed by law to invest deposited money in ways by law forbidden to a bank ( real estate and stocks , for instance , without restriction ) , and that no requirement of any cash reserve is Made by law , then it is easy to guess what may be the situation in the younger sections of the country . The committee reporting pointed out that in four States ? Ohio , Arkansas , Tennessee , and Virginia  --  there is actually no supervision of trust companies . It is a very grave question how far supervision in many other States is worthy of the name . The president of the trust company convention , while not endorsing the plan of Federal incorporation , declared emphatically : " I do want to go on record as advocating frequent and rigid official examination , whether State or Federal . " The convention had much to say of the Federal charter plan , to which Secretary Shaw drew particular attention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers from these companies , he proposed to give them " the privilege of incorporating under Federal law , with corresponding supervision " ; and he argued that " if such right were extended , the more conservative would probably avail themselves thereof , and this would compel others to cultivate conservatism . " The force of this argument did not appeal to us very strongly , since the companies thus incorporating would certainly have to give up very broad powers for privileges much more limited . In the case of the national banks , the exclusive right to circulate notes was an inducement to Federal incorporation , and , as a rule , the powers of the banks remained as they were under the old State charters . But whether the Federal plan is feasible or not , we do not consider it a solution of existing problems . What is needed is strict and careful revision of the State laws governing these institutions , and equally strict enforcement of public supervision . If this is not obtained in all re ions where the operations of this type of companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reckoning in good season , and it will be one to remember . The mist astonishing thing about the publiq attitude on this question is that any one with the faintest knowledge of our banking experience in 1837 and 1857 shOuld for an instant imagine the present system to be safe . At the close of August , when money could still be borrowed at the very IOW rars which had prevailed for a twelve- m nth , the New York bank position was ti+ weakest , and the surplus reserve the lowest , reached at that date in a dot6en years . Although the cash in our city banks was $54,000,000 below th ) , e preceding year , loans were $45 , - 000,000 greater ; easy credit had absorbed , in one or another type of enterprise , an exceptionally large part of the market 's ready capital . The approach of harvest-time , with the trade requirements consequent on the huge crops , foreshadowed extremely large Imo terior demands for money . The expectation has proved correct . For the first time in three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The interior 's demands have drained away money from the New York bank reserve . The 25 per cent . ratio of that reserve to deposit liabilities has been kept good only by drawing gold from Europe , at a rate of exchange which hardly warranted such imports , and , apparently , by some jugglery with the statements . Day-to-day loans in Wall Street have gone as high as 8 per cent. , and now bring 6 ? the highest rate for the season since the severe strain of 1902 . ? Rhode Island is promised a lively political campaign this autumn . The Democrats have nominated for Governor Dr. Lucius F. C. Garvin , who held , the office for two terms , but who was swept out by the Republican tidal wave of last year . His popularity is proved by his two successes in a State normally Republican , and by the fact that in 1904 he was defeated by only 856 votes , while Roosevelt 's plurality was 16,706 . He appeals to the electorate of Rhode Island as a man who is - virile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a champion of Constitutional reform . His campaigns , though dignified , have always been vigorous . In public meetings and in open letters he has fearlessly denounced the corruptionists who have made the politics of his State a cesspool . He has pointed out the malign alliance between the Republican ring and the traction interests that have fastened upon Rhode Island like a leech . Above all , he has , in season and out of season , labored for the one reform which is pregnant with all others , a new Constitution . Under the present antiquated instrument , a score of little rotten borougbs return a majority of the State Senate and block all legislation which is hostile to the ring . The Governor , without the power of veto , is almost helpless . The most that he can do is to rouse public sentiment through his messages and addresses . Mr. William M Ivins 's nomination by the Republicans of this city , - viewed in itself , would have made it at least possible to retrieve a situation grown well-nigh desperate . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance with municipal affairs , who , in 1886 , was , as an independent Democrat , exposing the inner corruption of Tammany in alliance with certain Republicans , and was ferociously attacked for it by the Tribune , in language which that newspaper would not care to reprint to-day , and which we will not pain it by recalling . But what followed on his nomination shows that the Republicans are not going into the campaign with either seriousness or good faith . Their proceedings in the matter of county and borough nominations have all the appearance of a debonair recklessness , affronting the intelligence of their own party deliberately , in the full purpose of inviting defeat . Not content with spurning Jerome , therein flouting the advice and urgings of Mr. Ivins , the Republican machine has given us in his place Flammer ! And as if to match the Tammany McGowan , it has dug up a Duffy ! This is a farcical business . ' With it the Odell machine abandons the last pretence of earnestness or decency in this canvass . The reasons given for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had declined to make a specifically " anti-Tammany campaign " ! That means simply that he had declined to be silent about Republican bosses and Republican corruption . Mr. Jerome has been consistently an independent candidate for reelection , going directly to the people without first going on his knees to a boss . As we felt from the start , that was a defiance of machine tyranny which the tyrants could not f prgive . They have not dared to attack Jerome openly , but they have set their minions secretly to work to crush him if possible . Mr I-vins 's open letter to the other candidates for Mayor is vigorous and direct His promise to continue in office for his full term , and not to be a candidate for any other place whatever , will . we trust , provoke McClellan into a similar declaration . Mr. Ivins clearly realizes that in accepting a nomination from the Odell-Halpin machine , he has laid himself under grave suspicion among all decent men . His announcement that he will be absolutely-free from boss or party control is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " absolute independence of every organization and individual , " will conduct the city 's business " without regard to partisan considerations , " and will completely ignore " all merely national party " lines , he will give New York what it most needs at present . His challenge to McClellan and Hearst to meet them in public debate is not likely to be accepted . Hearst is not an effective speaker . McClellan will hardly care to defend , on the stump such an appointment as that of Oakley , or to explain how it happens that Murphy in Manhattan , McCarren in Brooklyn , Haffen in th.2 . Bronx , and the most disreputable elements of Greater New York generally are among his enthusiastic supporters . If the Mayor were anxious for a joint debate with any one , he would lose no time in closing with Mr. Coler 's specific charge that he first tried to crush McCarren , as a disreputable politician , and then , finding he could not , fell upon his neck . There is a trite moral to be drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely point out that his shocking end , with its implied confession , is another indictment of the Republican organization in this city and county . That a man of his stamp could ever have been favored with an office at its hands , should have been impossible after his first term in the Board of Aldermen . That he should have actually been Secretary of the Republican County Committee , is plain evidence to what depths the organization has fallen . To men like Cornelius Bliss , Elihu Root , Horace Porter , and a host of others who think the salvation of the Republic depends on their party 's success , this tragedy should come as an appeal to their political conscience . How much farther can their party sink ? How much longer are Odell , Halpin , Gruber , Quigg , and others to stand for the decent Republicans of this city ?

The little band ? flan- gels was , like the fathers , ataMatect by a single desire  --  to save the world from the deceitfulness and peril of riches ; The annual report of the Metropolitan Street Railway system is an interesting test of the practical effect of the Subway on city passenger , traffic . The report of the street railway company for the fiscal year ending with June shows total earnings $596,000 below , last year 's . There are , however , some oddly perplexing facts about this decrease . The Metropolitan 's president points out , to begin with , that the season of heavy snow blockades , which prevailed last winter , crippled earnings seriously . It appears , for instance , that , of this $596,000 shrinkage in earnings , $544,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of December , January , and February , when the blockade was most troublesome ; whereas in June and July passenger earnings actually increased over last year . On the other hand , every one knows that winter is the time when Subway competition would injure the surface lines most seriously , whereas in summer , with the open street cars , the reverse should be expected . Behind all these considerations stands the fact of the amazing increase in total travel over ' city railways since the Subway was completed . If only the earnings for the quarter ended June 30 are taken , it will be found that while the street railway system lost $62,700 in its gross receipts , as compared with 1904 , and the Elevated $547,000 , the Subway earned $1,349,000 . But as the Subway was not open in those months of 1904 , its receipts may all be classed as increase . Deducting the losses on the surface and elevated lines , it is evident that , in that single quarter of the year , some $700,000 more was paid in 5-cent fares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tense , suspicious , and timorous state of mind is displayed by nearly all the participants in the controversy over last May 's threatened war between Germany and France , still raging between Germany , France , and England . Prince Bulow 's interviews , the revelations and comments inspired by Delcasse , the semi-official utterances of the English press , all reveal a most unhappy international jealousy and distrust . The more Prince Billow assumes an air of frankness , the more confident are both English and French that he is but masking his duplicity . The stouter Delcass ? makes his denials , the less are they believed by the German press . British assurances to the German Foreign Office are perfunctorily reported to have been " satisfactory " ; but every member of the German Navy League firmly believes , on the strength of the avowals of the London Times , that England was aching for a chance to Join hands with France and sweep the German fleet from the sea . Thus the chief stock in trade of the statesmanship of either country seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true moral of all this the one which the big-navy boomers of every land are drawing ? It would seem as if there must be a mistake in the report that , according to official returns , only 72,450 Japanese soldiers lost their lives in the war with Russia . Otherwise , some of the lurid war correspondence with which the public has been favored must needs be rewritten . According to this report , but 46,180 Japanese were killed outright , while 10,970 died from wounds , and 15,300 from disease ; and these figures , it must be admitted , stand in proper propartion to one another . But if the losses were no greater , what of all the brigades and divisions wiped out at Mukden ? or of the army carps which is supposed to have fallen at Port Arthur ? Even if we were to allow five wounded for every soldier killed , the total casualties would not be over 276,000 , which is not an exceptionally large figure when the desperate assaults on Port Arthur and the fierce character of the fighting at Nansh'an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly no foreigners who followed the armies will credit these figures . So far as the deaths from disease are concerned , they should be compared to the 5,000 lives sacrificed in ' our summer campaign with only 275,000 men in the field , as against the million or more Japanese who battled for a year and a half under the terrible Mantchurian conditions , to bring out the triumph of the Japanese sanitarnan , s . Should these statistics prove to be correct , the world 's impressions of the struggle will have to be sharply revised , and Japan will- be open to congratulations that the number of loft lives is comparatively small . Also , we shall have to change our ideas about the deadliness of modern weapons .
