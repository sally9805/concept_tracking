txt Miss Inez Milholland is not an English Suffragette , as reported in your paper of to-day . If she be a Suffragette at all , she is very much an American one ; neither has she been In Jail for tier principles , though many people may think she deserves such punishment for her active and effective work for suffrage as well as for child labor and other progressive movements . However , all her activities have been confined to this side of the Atlantic , excepting , perhaps , attending a meeting or demonstration in London , where her parents have for business reasons happened , to live for a number of years , and where she spends part of the Summer holidays . Miss Milholland is an American , her parents are American , and no amount of residence abroad or anywhere else can in the least affect her loyalty or their devotion to this . the land of her birth . JEAN TORRY MILHOLLAND.
