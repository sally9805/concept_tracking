 | THE verdict rendered by a special jury in the Court of King 's Bench in the closing days of last December , in favor of the Taff Vale Railway Company against the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants and their officers . is one of the most important verdicts ever rendered by a British court of justice in a question affecting labor , and it marks an epoch in the history of labor in the United Kingdom . It ranks in importance second only to the passage by Parliament of the trade-union acts and the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act ; there has been no judicial decision of such vital consequence to labor since the judgment of the House of Lords in the celebrated case of Allen verses Flood , which , in the words of the lord high chancellor , " overruled the precedents of 200 years , " and , as expressed by Lord Morris , " overturned the overwhelming judicial opinion of England . " The history of the Taff Vale Railway case is simple . The railway company had a difference with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900. to a strike without the men giving proper notice to terminate their agreements . The men , accompanied by two officers of their union , Holmes and Bell , tried to effect a settlement with the company , but while the company professed itself ready to discuss any matters in dispute with its own employees , it refused to confer with outsiders . The strike lasted for about a fortnight , and was settled through the intervention of the Board of Trade . While the strike was in progress , the railway company applied for an injunction against Bell and Holmes to restrain them from watching and besetting the Cardiff railway station and adjacent property . on the ground that their action was in violation of the seventh section of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act , which made it illegal for men to ; , watch or beset . " The Amalgamated Society vigorously opposed the granting of the writ of injunction , on the ground that as the society was not a corporation or an individual , it could not be sued in a quasi-corporate or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lie . Mr. Justice Farwell refused to entertain this plea , and while he conceded that a trade-union " is neither a corporation , nor an individual , nor a partnership between a number of individuals , " lie held that a trade-union was a corporate body , and as such qualified to sue and to be sued , and that the funds in its possession could be attached in payment of damages for illegal acts committed by its officials . If this dictum were sound . it was one of the most crushing blows ever delivered against tradeunionism . Trade-unionism , instead of being an element of strength to the workingman , would be the means of his undoing , because the logical deduction from Mr. Justice Farwell 's decision was that trade-unions were responsible for the acts of their members and were liable in damages for any injury done by any member . It must be remembered that British courts had frequently , prior to this injunction , awarded employers damages for the unlawful acts of individual employees ; but the employers had gained nothing by these verdicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to satisfy a verdict , while on the other hand , by making the union responsible , the position of affairs was entirely changed , as many of the unions , ? the Amalgamated Society , for instance , ? have large sums standing to their credit . The Amalgamated Society , therefore , with the material and financial support of trade-unions throughout Great Britain , determined to carry the case to the court above , and it came on for hearing in the Court of Appeals before the master of the rolls and Lord Justices Collins and Sterling , in November , 1900 . The unanimous decision of the court , delivered by the master of the rolls , based on the decisions in Flood versus Allen and the other leading cases , was that a union can not be sued as such . The court pointed out that in the trade-union acts there was no provision empowering a trade-union to sue or to be sued , except in defense of its own property ; and hence it was argued in much detail that it was purposely the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiate between a trade-union and a joint-stock company , or any other corporation , and the injunction was ordered dissolved . This was a substantial victory for the union , especially as they were granted  | costs . Permission was given to the plaintiffs to appeal to the House of Lords , the highest judicial tribunal of the British Empire . The appeal was accordingly taken , and in July last a decision was rendered , the House of Lords overruling the Court of Appeal and sustaining Mr. Justice Farwell in his conclusion that a trade-union was a legal entity , capable of suing and being sued . In moving the bench that the appeal be allowed , the lord chancellor said : In this case , I am content to adopt the judgment of Mr. Justice Farwell , with which I entirely agree , and I can not find any satisfactory answer to that judgment in the judgment of the Court of Appeal which overruled it . If the legislature has created a thing which can own property , which can employ servants , and which can inflict injury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impliedly given power to make it suable in the courts of law for injuries purposely done by its authority and procurance . The House of Lords having decided that a labor union , like any other corporation or individual , might be sued for damages , the Taff Vale Railway Company began suit against the Amalgamated Society for ? 28,000 damages . This suit was decided on December 20 last , and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs , the exact amount of damages to be passed upon later . In summing up , Mr. Justice Wills , before whom the case was heard , said there were three questions to be left to the jury , namely : Whether the defendants had conspired to unlawfully molest and injure the plaintiffs ; whether the defendants had unlawfully persuaded the men to break their contracts ; and whether the defendants had authorized and assisted in carrying on the strike by unlawful means . It was pointed out by Mr. Justice Wills in his charge to the jury that strikes were lawful under the act of 1875 , if the persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted in the concerted action rather than the concert to act by two or more persons to produce a common end , and it might be unlawful in two ways , ? to compass a lawful end by unlawful means , or to compass an unlawful end . In the language of Lord Justice Lindlay , every man was permitted to earn his own living in his own way , and to carry on his business in his own way , provided that he did not violate some special law and did not infringe the rights of other people . Justice Wills maintained that it was clear that there was concerted action between the officials of the society and its members , for the purpose of carrying on the strike or interfering with the business of the plaintiffs , and to induce their workmen to break contracts . Under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 , the statute referred to by Mr. Justice Wills , strikes are made legal within certain limits and provided certain things are done and certain other things left undone . Prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy because they had in concert left their employment . The act of 1875 provided that a combination by two or more persons done in furtherance of a trade dispute between employers and workmen should not be regarded as a conspiracy if the act , committed by one person , would not be punishable as a crime . That is to say , any act legal for one person to do or perform is legal when done in conjunction with other persons . But under the seventh section of that same act , any person who uses violence or intimidation toward another person , who " watches or besets his house or the place where he works , or follows him with two or more persons in a disorderly manner , " is subject to . fine or imprisonment , but " attending " near the house or place where a person resides or works in order merely to obtain or communicate information is not watching or besetting , within the meaning of the act . In other words , workmen might legally maintain a pacific blockade , but might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral suasion to induce a fellowworkman not to work or to seek employment , but if they in any way use coercion to effect the same purpose they immediately render themselves liable to the penalties of the law . The point at issue , of course , in this case was whether the Amalgamated Society , through its agents , had acted within their legal rights when , as the evidence showed , 1,200 men were ordered to picket the Taff Vale Railway Company 's property and premises , and whether , in inducing men to leave their employment , the society had not overstepped the bounds . The verdict of the jury answers both questions in the affirmative . But it goes even one step further . A strike has been the great weapon in the hands of labor to correct grievances . Under the decision of the Court of King 's Bench , in accordance with the dictum of the House of Lords , labor in Great Britain has been substantially told that " you may strike whenever and so often as you please , but your strike will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment you commit an illegal act you render yourself civilly and criminally responsible . " The strike , therefore , instead of becoming a weapon of strength , is a weapon of weakness turned against the striker and his union .
