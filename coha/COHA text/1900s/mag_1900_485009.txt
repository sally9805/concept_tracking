In a dispatch to the Associated Press a few days since , Secretary Gage was quoted as saying that it would be extremely unwise to make a greater reduction of the war tax than $30,000,000 . Continuing the conversation , he said : " When I recommended a reduction of $30 , - 000,000 , I had in mind the inevitable heavy expenditures for the army and navy as well as other departments of the Government The added expense of maintenance of an army of approximately 100,000 instead of 27 , - 000 men , has been shown to be about $70 , - 000,000 a year Our receipts from the war taxes approximate $100,000,000 a year , so , speaking broadly , the proposed reduction of $30,000,000 would leave just about enough special revenues to meet the extraordinary expenses of the army " Mr. Payne , the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means , thinks , on the other hand , that a reduction of $40,000,000 may be made without endangering any public interest , naval , military , or civil . At all events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this step they are to be encouraged and commended for a variety of reasons . In the first place , there was a public understanding at the time when the war tax was enacted that it would continue no longer than the war . It was for a special and unforeseen emergency , and was not to be regarded as a per manent burden on the taxpayers . The war with Spain ended two years ago , but we are now told that the tax was intended to include the consequences of the war as well as the war itself . Undoubtedly it is proper to include in this category all the necessary consequences of the war  --  that is , all pecuniary obligations incurred in carrying it on , including pensions for disabled soldiers and sailors , claims for property taken for public use , and any damages for which the Government should be liable . These are the legitimate consequences of the war and were the only ones contemplated when the war tax was enacted The pacification and policing of Cuba until a government could be established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of the war . But it never was intended to include another war among the consequences of the war with Spain , least of all a war on the other side of the globe for the subjugation of a people who had never done us any wrong If any such intention had been proclaimed or suspected at the time when the tax was enacted , the war in the Philippines would not have received the sanction of one American citizen , either white or black , either in or out of Congress Well , the war exists . Would you allow the army in the Philippines to perish for want of supplies , arms , muni- tions , medicines , recruits , etc ? No , that is not the question before the House The question is whether the pressure which taxation puts upon both Government and people shall be applied in favor of peace or of continued war . If the question were now an open one , if the present war tax were before Congress as a new measure and the people were asked to take $70,000,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Eastern Asia , no such bill could be passed . Ways and means would be found- to put an end to the war at once . Surely no end could be more appropriate to a self-governing and freedom-loving people than that of conferring self-government and freedom on another people who have fallen into our hands by the mere chance of a war with their former oppressors We favor the cutting down of taxes to the barest living expenses of the Government in order to compel those who administer it to lop off all useless expenses , and especially war expenses which have never been sanctioned by the people . A joint resolution of Congress not longer than five lines , offering to the Filipinos the same terms that were given to the Cubans , would end the war and its expenditures of treasure , of blood , and of reputation . There are still other reasons for cutting down the taxes . A surplus in the Treasury makes an easy berth for the Secretary , but it nurses all kinds of jobbery and demoralization , ship subsidies , river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Their name is legion , and they are coming on with eagerness to relieve the Treasury . No surplus will ever be too much for them . The larger the surplus , the more powerful the temptation to the lobby . There is much reason to believe that the Nicaragua Canal Bill itself embraces an enormous money-making scheme , and that it has " joined teams " with the Ship-Subsidy Bill to relieve the Treasury of any money that may be left over during the next ten years . The men who bring forward these schemes can not be beaten by arguments . They can be defeated only by an empty Treasury and by the necessity of public borrowing to satisfy their claims . An issue of bonds always puts the people on inquiry what is done with their money , and makes them angry unless the objects for which it is spent are absolutely necessary for the national honor and welfare . Borrowing for maintaining specie payments was such an object ; borrowing for the war with Spain was considered such by the majority of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new loans since the end of the civil war . If it were forced to borrow in order to pay ship subsidies , or to erect public buildings in out-of-the-way places , or to carry on war in the Philippines , it would soon find a way to avoid those expenses altogether . Therefore , let tax reduction go on merrily . The safety of the republic lies in a lean Treasury . THE ISTHMIAN-CANAL REPORT . It is evident that the able and impartial engineers who have been haves ? tigating for our Government the question of an interoceanic canal , were somewhat embarrassed by the union of two subjects in their instructions . They were to report on an engineering problem They were also to give their opinion on a question of national policy . It was not simply " the most practicable and feasible route " for a canal which they were to determine They were to decide as well where best a canal could be built " under the control , management , and ownership of the United States . " It is clearly the latter consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On engineering and economic grounds pure and simple , the award would have been made to the Panama route . But the Panama Company made no satisfactory proposal for the transfer of their concession and other property to this country , and therefore the Commission had nothing to do but to look elsewhere . The superior natural advantages of the Panama location are frankly set forth in the report . A canal there would be shorter , straighter , cheaper than one through Nicaragua . Having but 300 feet to surmount at the divide , A would need fewer locks There remains the question of distance from our Atlantic and Pacific harbors . Much has been made of this by vociferous advocates of the Nicaragua route They have dwelt on the fact that the distance from San Francisco to New York would be 377 miles greater by Panama than by Nicaragua , to New Orleans 579 miles ; to Liverpool 386 miles . Now , of course , if the canal is to be a part of our " coast line , " as Blame contended , it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearlessly assert that every unnecessary mile between a country and its coast line is a confessed blunder , either of man or nature . But if a canal is to be thought of simply as a channel through which to get ships as speedily and safely as possible , the question becomes one of actual sailing time , not of measured distances on the map . On this point the Commission deal a blow to vulgar prejudice , and let the wind out of much Senatorial oratory , by ouietly remarking that , in the matter of time consumed , the Nicaragua Canal would be only " somewhat " more advantageous than the Panama route to a vessel plying between San Francisco and New York . The reason is that it will require thirty-three hours for a ship to pass through the Nicaragua Canal , while but twelve will suffice at Panama . We think the Commission might have gone somewhat further than this . Gen. Henry I .. Abbot , U. S. A , one of the leading engineers of the world , has made a very close examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic . He finds the relative times of transit to be . by Panama , 10 hours , 50 minutes ; by Nicaragua , 43 hours , 41 minutes . This practically wipes out the difference in sea distance . As Gen. Abbot puts it , " a steamer leaving New York via Panama is really ten hours nearer Honolulu , and less than five hours further from San Francisco , than if she went by way of Nicaragua . ' This is saying nothing of the greater chance of detention , accident , etc. , in the longer and more curving Nicaragua Canal . But it is useless to labor such technical points of engineering and sea-travel , inasmuch as the decision favoring Nicaragua is confessedly made on the score of more facile Government ownership . Even so , the careful Commission qualify their verdict by saying that it is made " assuming that Nicaragua and Costa Rica recognize the value of the canal to themselves , and are prepared to grant concessions on terms which are reasonable and acceptable to the United States " Here , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certain . Nicaragua will insist upon retaining nominal sovereignty over the canal , and will make us pay smartly for any long-term lease carrying with it control of traffic and policing of the canal . She will not hold her property at a lower figure , we may be sure , for having learned from our Commission that she has what the United States is determined to buy at any price In the Commission 's estimate of $200,000,000 cost , nothing is set down for buying a right of way . It is to be hoped that the Nicaraguans will not exact too many millions additional ; but they are certainly in a position to squeeze rich and careless Uncle Sam hard . The French Panama Company seems to have lost its chance through too much trust in logic and lucidity . Its route was demonstrably the best and cheapest , ergo it was nonsense to suppose that the United States would select another All that the Panama people had to do was to sit tight and our Government would come to their terms in the end . What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a canal at Nicaragua ? This would be a sottise to the French mind , and the shrewd Americans would never be guilty of it . So the Panama Company fenced and delayed , and finally , when it took alarm , was not able to make a clear-cut proposal for the sale of its property . The Frenchmen must see now that inter-oceanic canals , when undertaken in pursuance of national policy , are but one illustration more of how little logic has to do in governing the world . The canal is not yet dug . Many preliminaries remain even before the first spadeful of earth can be thrown out , and the Commission estimate that it Will take ten years to build the canal after a beginning is made . We must yet hope that some way will be found to take over the Panama property . A canal two-fifths done already , capable of being finished in six or seven , years at a cost of $50,000,000 or $60,000,000 less ; 9. better natural route , a safer work when completed  --  surely common sense on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of capital which would result if the Panama Canal were to be wholly abandoned now . However that may be , the condition previous to any canal is the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty . Until that be had we can not build or own either canal . It is now the unfinished business in the secret session of the Senate , and should be pressed to a speedy vote . Our honor and our interest alike demand its approval Only by means of it can we hope to see the dreams of Goethe and Humboldt realized , and a great waterway for peaceful commerce ripened between the Atlantic ' and Pacific . THE OVERREACHING OF CUBA . In Swift 's ' Tale of a Tub , ' it will be remembered , the three sons set their wits to work to vitiate their father 's will while still inheriting under it . It forbade them to wear shoulder-knots , or gold lace , or silver fringe , or embroidery on their coats , but , by a little clever manipulation of the language of his last will and testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion at the same time that they professed implicit obedience to the paternal commands . For example , the word meaning fringe meant also broomstick ; doubtless their father meant them to avoid wearing silver broomsticks , and who more scrupulous than they in heeding that injunction ? If they wore embroidery , it was not " in the sense as forbidden by their father , " but only in so far as it was " a commendable custom and of great use to the public " The need of a satirist to lash similar hypocrisy in our dealings with Cuba will soon be urgent . The evidence that the Administration means to juggle with the country 's plighted faith in the matter of a Cuban government is accumulating on every hand . Not once since the war with Spain has one officer of the American Government mentioned the word independence in any official promise to the Cubans . The President 's message refers with marked coldness , and vagueness phenomenal even for hint ' , to the whole subject . Secretary Root , in his annual report , touches upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express doubt of the capacity of the Cubans to govern themselves , and covertly to threaten them if they do not prove ductile to his will . What else can he mean by speaking of the " uncertainty as to the continuance of a market for her ( Cuba 's products " ? Does he intend to begin a tariff war on Cuban sugar and tobacco , if annexation sentiment does not develop as he would like to sec it ? More significant than these negative signs , more tell-tale even than the operations of " the Cuban Company " in the island , is the inspired announcement of the Administration 's programme as made by Mr. Walter Wellman in the Review of Reviews . He professes to speak the mind of Mr. Root and President McKinley , and what he says is fully in line with the " feelers " put - out by many recent diners at the White House , and with the information that comes to us privately from entirely trustworthy sources . In a word , the scheme is to set tip a crippled dependency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . Cuba is to be allowed no army . She may create no navy . She is to enjoy no diplomatic relations with other countries . All her foreign relations will be attended to at Washington . Finally , she will not be permitted to make a public loan . All these essential attributes of sovereignty having been stripped from her , she will be expected to rise up and call us blessed . After having cut off both her arms and one leg , we shall tell her that she is gloriously fitted by our kindness to run an independent career . This is brutal enough , but we do not give Swift his real chance until we undertake to reconcile our conduct with our solemnly pledged word Here is where Mr. Wellman comes out with his little ' Tale of a Tub . ' The " inevitable question " arises , he says , whether such treatment of Cuba as he outlines would be an " honorable redemption " of our pledge . He admits that a great majority of the people both of Cuba and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds that " a minority , " and " among them the President of the United States and his official advisers , " believe that it would be a " keeping of that pledge in a practical and not in a sentiniental sense . " There we have Swift 's Peter , Martin , and Jack over again , flouting their father 's express will , because to do so would be of " great use to the public " We shall not let Mr. Root off with any quibble about " independence . " It is clear as daylight that when Congress declared the island of Cuba to be of right " free and independent , " it had in mind no such miserable shift as Mr. Wellman now says the Secretary of War has planned . Let that go Congress also called the world to witness that it disclaimed any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty , jurisdiction , or control over said island . " Is it no " control " of Cuba to take away its power of defence ? No control to say that it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No control to forbid it to borrow a dollar ? How , if we do these things , are we going to keep our pledge in a " practical sense , " or any other sense ' ? The practical sense , to which Mr. Wellman says the President is so devoted , means to admit that we lied This , we say , is the moral humiliation to which the Administration is planning to subject the country . People have besought the President to make to the Filipinos the same promises we made to the Cubans . His policy is , rather , to shuffle out of the promises we made to the Cubans , and treat them as he is treating the Filipinos . Instead of a nation that fears the one Jehovah , swearing to its own hurt and changing not , he would have us again exhibit to mankind " the incomparable pliancy of a polytheist " The issue is exceeding simple . Do not say that we ought not to have given the pledge  --  we gave it . Do not urge that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we said we would not do it . We dared not enter upon war with Spain without invoking the considerate judgment of mankind , and professing the most unselfish motives We can not now thrust our tongues in our cheeks and say that it was all humbug and hypocrisy Yet the acknowledged intention of the Administration is thus to trifle with our sacred honor . To compass its plans it is trusting partly to luck , partly to time . and more to the deadening of the conscience of the American people For our part , we speak out now , as we shall to the end , to protest against an act which would , on the part of the United States , be one of simple infamy. 1E THE PROPHET NATHAN CAME TO NEW YORK . In the necessary lull which has come in the outer and organized work for the rescue of the city , it is a good time for searching our hearts and asking ourselves if we have really measured the task which lies before us , and our own fitness to undertake it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Brotherhood of St. Andrew , that any reform worth praying and working for must strike deeper than the current talk of politicians and business men would lead us to think they mean to go . We must lay the axe to the root of the tree . We can not cut away vice if we spare the system which creates vice . Is it , in fact , the existence of vice which distresses us , or the mere fact that it flaunts itself in the streets ? Do we repent of our sins , or simply regret their unpleasant consequences ? We fear that a Tacitus , recording the outlook for reform in New York , would say that we were too much like the Roman Emperor in fixing our eyes upon evils instead of , as we should , upon their remedies . It is needful to use great plainness of speech . In the mere matter of determining responsibility for the conditions in our city  --  which make its residents , as Gibbon said of the citizens of Naples , feel that they are living " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been set forth nakedly . A prophet 's fire and fearlessness would be needed to do it . If Nathan were to come to New York and be as unflinching in dealing with us as he was in laying bare the guilt of his king , should we find him prophesying smooth things ? Would he point to Croker or to Platt  - -  miserable spawn of corruption that they both are  --  as the true fount and source of all our misery ? No , he would pierce to underlying causes . He would rebuke the real sinners . If the prophet Nathan came to New York , he would see to it that judgment began at the house of God . He would go to those clergymen who have sought and accepted Croker 's aid in securing legislation  --  good legislation , of course  --  at Albany . He would seek out Platt 's pastor . He would go to the Catholic priests who have taken rich gifts from the Tammany crew  --  known to be blood-money . He would enter those sanctuaries where sit honored members and officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for blackmail or for bribery to Croker and Platt . Before all these unconfessed and unre buked sinners the prophet of God would stand , and , singling out each one with flaming eye and accusatory finger , he would say , " Thou art the man ! " In like manner he would go to every newspaper that crawls in the dust to get police advertising from Croker and Platt , and that makes a tacit league with hell as a part of the contract . He would go to that railroad president who told his friends at dinner that he liked the boss system  --  it was so much simpler to pay over $100,000 to Platt and Croker each in one check and have no more trouble . He would not omit to visit that head of a great insurance company who said , " Pay ? Of course we pay , and to both sides alike . But if I am called on to testify , I shall swear I know nothing about it . " To all of these citizens , to the men of wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the Chamber of Commerce , were there present , though they had done their best to fasten the clutch of Tammany upon the city , the prophet Nathan would sternly say , " Corruption ? Ye are a potent , , cause of it . Reform ? Ye are a part of the thing to be reformed . " Nor would the seer fail to touch with his spear of truth many of the men who are loudest in their cries of horror at Tammany wickedness . How the politician-denouncers of Tammany would shrivel before him ! He would show us that they wished to cast out Crolter only to install in his place seven devils worse than he ; that they cried out on the Tammany prostitution of the police force only so that they might obtain control of it themselves for purposes fully as vile ; that they exclaimed against the revenue from crime and death only because they wanted to see it diverted to their own pockets . Of what we say , the sum is this . We shall get no reform worth the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit where we lie , and can never pull us out . A party , or what calls itself a party , may turn . Tammany out of office ; but if the thing be done in the name of politics , it will be only a passing spasm of virtue , and our last state will soon be worse than our first . Put it down first and foremost that the business we have in hand is a moral reform of the whole community . We have a disease to attend to , not symptoms . It is not an election , but a moral crusade which we are facing in this city . No man . should come forward to engage in it , or be allowed to engage in it , unless he will abjure politics , renounce the devil and all his works , and pluck out an eye or cut off a hand if it offends . We are convinced that the conscience of the city has already been stirred , and can be greatly roused . A mighty movement may result . The politicians will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for those who see clear and think straight to insist upon it , in season and out of season , that the city is to be saved , not by parties or political leaders , but by the application of elementary morals and the plain principles of civic pride and unselfish patriotism .
