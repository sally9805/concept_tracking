txt RESPONSIBILITIES OF BANS DEPOSITORS . Judicial decisions touching matters of business usage are always of interest . Such a decision has just been handed down by the New York Court of Appeals , which is of consequence to bank depositors everywhere . The facts are briefly as follows : A business concern depositing with the Chemical National Bank of this city was victimized by Its confidential clerk , who systematically raised checks and appropriated the excess to his own use . He had charge of the firm 's books , had been accredited to the bank as its representative , and otherwise occupied a relation to it which warranted the bank in assuming that he acted by authority in all that he did . His , manipulation of-checks extended over a period of some two years , during which time the deposit book of the firm was written up twelve times and the vouchers in the shape of paid checks returned . The alterations were very skillfully made , and as they were presented at the bank by the clerk in question it is not surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm brought suit against the bank for the amount of their losses on the raised checks . In this demand they appeared to be protected by old decisions in this State , and got judgments in the lower courts for the amount of their claim . Appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals , which has reversed the courts below and holds that for the depositor to have made no examination of his accounts and no comparison of returned checks with the stubs when such examination would have revealed the alterationg was such negligence as excuses the bank for having paid the raised checks and leaves the depositor no recourse . In a letter addressed to the banks of New York Mr. GEORGE G. WILLIAMS , President of the Chemical Bank , says : Notwithstanding the lack of precautionary system in handling their finances the firm made demand upon this bank to refund to them the amount stolen by their chief ; and strange as it may seem , notwithstanding their negligence , they appeared to be protected by old decisions of some of the courts of this State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the hope of being able to demonstrate to the court that a rule laid down half a century ago does not apply equitably to the changed conditions and largely increased volume of business of the present day . We were fighting , not merely to avoid payment of the money a second time , but with a strong desire to assist in the establishment , by law , of fair business methods . Under the decision the duty of verifying the balance and examining the vouchers returned , and giving notice to the bank of any discrepancies , within a reasonable time , is placed upon all depositors of banks in this State . This is now the law of New York , and bank depositors Will hereafter be under the very proper obligation of doing what should always have been done by them to aid the banks in protecting their interests . This decision settles many questions which have long been in dispute as to the liability of banks for frauds rendered possible by contributory negligence of depositors.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
