txt Lawyer Shay , Who ' Was One of the Hains Counsel , a Tout He Employed , and Two Keepers All in the Toils . Through the early confession of Harry Remington Mercer , now in the Tombs Prison , under indictment Mr grand larceny , District Attorney Jerome foiled a long-planned attempt ' to rescue Mercer from the Tombs late yesterday afternoon , and arrested the four men who are alleged to have arranged for his escape . Incidentally , according to Mr. ? Jerome , it was discovered that the management of the Tombs Prison is woefully lax . One of the men arrested was Joseph A. Shay of 309 Broadway , a lawyer who was associated with John F. in the recent Hains trial . He is charged with aiding and abetting a prisoner charged with a felony to escape from the Tombs . The others are Walter F. Peck , alias Williamson , said to be an agent for Shay in obtaining accident legal business on a contingent fee , and Peter J. Howard of 350 West Fifty-seventh Street and John J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willful neglect of duty in that they did not compel a visitor to the prison to register at the prison gate , as required by law to do . The charge against Howard is the same as that against Shay . Shay was held in $5,000 bail for examination , and the bail was furnished by Dora Freiter of 205 West Thirtieth Street . Peck , or Williamson , who made a full confession , was held as a witness . The two keepers were held In $250 bail for examination . The prisoners were arraigned before Magistrate O'Connor , who sat in the District Attorney 's office for that purpose . Mr. Jerome knew all about the plot beforehand and was prepared for all emergencies . Shay Aided the Attempt . According to Mr. Jerome , Mercer had long been an " ambulance chaser , " that is a lawyer 's agent in the sense described , for Shay . Previous to last October he went into business for himself at 215 Second Avenue , having with him a man who furnished some money to back the enterprise . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . commission on all the money " rnade , r ; : was ' ' : en cases . ? Last year a iMetropolitan Street Railway car ran over a2little girl in Amsterdam ' Avenue . Her father , William F. Hefter , a , Columbus Avenue shoemaker , was besieged by " ambulance chasers , " who urged him to sue , laeiter yielded to the persuasions of Mercer , who arranged to bring suit . The suit was settled for $4,000 , which , it is charged , was paid over by the defendant company to Mereer , without Hefter knowing anything about it . Mercer was arrested in California , extradited , and brought back here for trial . To explain Shay 's interest in getting Mercer out of prison Mr. Jerome told about a certain Hunt case in Albany . This was also a damage suit , and in the course of its prosecution , according to Mr. Jerome , Mercer was sent to Albany to get an affidavit from the motorman of the car . In the affidavit , as presented later in court , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ring the bell , whereas on the witness stand he said he had rung his bell . It was charged that the " n't " was added to the affidavit . The case is now on appeal , and handwriting experts are trying to find out whether the " n't " was put in before or after the affidavit was signed , - For some reason , if not for this , Shay was interested in the escape of Mercer , it is alleged . His actions in the matter are thus told by Mercer in an affidavit made and sworn to last night before Magistrate O'Connor : Mercer 's Story . " On or about the first Sunday of the year Joseph A. Shay , together with a man by the name of Williamson , called to see me at the Tombs Prison . My brother , who is also confined in the Tombs Prison , was standing at the gate . At the same time I was talking to Mr. Shay he overheard all the conversation . Mr. Shay said : " ' I have talked this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge and try to have the bail bond reduced to as low a figure as possible , and I will pay for the bail bond . If this fails . Mr. and I will send Williamson to you , and you do just what Williamson tells you toy ' do : do n't sign any statements and do no talking at the District Attorney 's office ; just trust to us . ' " The next time I saw Mr. Shay was the morning after the verdict in the Haim case . He came to the counsel room , together with a Mr. Cohen of his office , and Mr. Williamson . He told me he had learned that I had been over to the District Attorney 's office , and wanted to know if I made any statements regarding the Hunt case , and if so what they were . I told him very little about this matter . He said to me : " ' For God 's sake , man , keep your mouth shut . We have not had time to do anything for you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over and I will get our heads together , and do n't you worry ; you do just what Williamson tells you to . ' Disguise Taken in Piecemeal . " About ten days ago Mr. Williamson called at the Tombs prison to see me . As near as I. can remember , the conversation was as follows : " ' If you will do just what I tell you to do you will be taken out of here . ' " Tien he agreed to bring in to me a hat , a pair of eyeglasses , an overcoat. time tables to Goldfield , Nev. , and expense money , and said that an auto would be waiting at the Worth Street station of the Subway , and all I had to do was to put the hat on and the eyeglasses and overcoat and walk out of the Tombs and get into the aut. ) and ride away . This conversation was about the same , varying very little , for the next ten days until to-day , when I said to him : " ' Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are protected ? Now that I am going away and will probably never see you again , please tell me who I have to thank for this . ' ' ? He said : ' Well , Ben , you and I can thank Mr. an &; Mr. Shay for getting you out of here , but keep that under your hat . ' " The hat was brought.to me about 12 o'clock last Saturday a week . At the same time ' I was gbin the eyeglasses . The expense money as handed to me this morning . The overcoat was given to me about a quarter of 4 to-day by Williamson . Jerome All Prepared . District Attorney Jerome , who had known from Mercer what was coming and had prepared for it , had a detective waiting at the Tombs gate yesterday to arrest Peck , or Williamson . As soon as he had taken pp the coat to Mercer and had come downhe was seized by the detective in waiting . It was then about 4:20 o'clock . District Attorney Jerome , who had been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown uneasiness , got word that the trap was about to be sprung . Cling to him three of his detectives , he rushed to the door leading into Part I. of General Sessions . Judge Malone in this court was instructing a Jury , so that the doorkeeper did not want to let them in . He was thrown aside , and Mr. Jerome and his three aids ' leaped into an elevator leading to the Bridge of Sighs Into the Tombs Prison . " Do n't let any one come in or go out of this , place until I tell you , " shouted Mr. Jerome to Warden Flynn . He rushed up . to Mercer 's cell on the fifth tier . Mercer was still there . He was taken over to the District Attorney 's office . Automobile in Waiting . Meanwhile detectives had been sent around to the Worth Street Subway Station . There Stood an automobile . The chauffeur. who was arrested , said he had been employed for $5 an hour and did not know . what the job was . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed instructions . He , too , was taken to the District Attorney 's office . The register at the gate of the Tombs was then examined . According to Mr. Jerome , it did not show that Peck or Williamson had signed it when he went up to see Mercer . So the two prison guards were also arrested and taken over to the District Attorney 's office . Detectives were next sent over to 300 Broadway to arrest Shay . He was taken back to the District Attorney 's office and , all parties being present , the inquisition began . Shay , according to Mir ' Jerome , poohpoohed the idea that he had been trying to get Mercer out of the Tombs because he feared the prisoner might tell something about his practices in the Hunt case . He said Mercer  --  he called him " Harry " ? was in " a bad fix , " that he had a wife and two children , and that he had felt sorry for him , so had decided to " go the limit " for nim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madea full eonfession , which corroborated the principal points in Mercer 's story , except the insinuations that there was anything of which Shay had cognizance in the Hunt case which would lead Shay from fear of revelations to help Mercer escape . With regard to the insertion of the " n't " in did n't in the motorman 's affidavit in that case , Willinmson swore that on a conversation with Mercer in his presence Shay said to him : " You know that this case the Hunt case came to my office and I immediately sent Williamson to Investigate such case. ) and if any wrong was committed it is ult to you two investigators of it . " - Williamson swore that on one occasion he met Shay at John F. 's house Just after the Hains trial and went with him from there to see Mercer in the Tombs . The affidavit continued : Shay Talked of . " When we got there to the Tombs I recollect that Shay warned Mercer not to talk to the District Attorney , and said to him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have not had a chance to do anything for you , ' and Shay informed Mercer . in substance , that he and would do what they could to help him now that they were free from the Hains case . " Williamson intimated that Mercer himself , not Shay , planned the escape , and Shay fell in with the plan , contributing $80 toward expenses , adding " I hope you get him away . " At the investigation last night Mr. appeared as counsel for Shay . He was ' questioned ley- District Attorney Jerome , but said that he knew nothing about Mercer 's case , and he was connected vf lth Shay only in the Heins trial . ? On the day after T. Jenkins Hains was acquitted of complicity in the Annis murder ' Mr. Shay announced to reporters in ' his office that he and , because . of their association in the Heins trial together , had decided to form a law partnership as . &; Shay .
