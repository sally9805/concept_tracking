Painters and Sculptors : A Second Series . of Old Masters and New . By Kenyon Cox . 8vo ; 72 illustrations . New York : Duffield &; Co. , $2.50 . Several of these essays have already am peared anonymously in the Nation ; but we see no impropriety in saying that these new excursions of a painter in the field of criticism will be generally welcome ; for , aside-from his specific professional equipment , Mr. Cox commands certain qualities which . are rare in writers about art . Saying clearly and well what he has to say , he eschews mere rhetoric . Disclaiming connoisseurship , his scholarship is adequate , while his insight as a painter , as in the essay on Holbein , at times affords discoveries that the connoisseurs have missed Above all , he is judicious , weighing gingerly his personal admiration , and straining a point to do justice to a colleague , like Leighton , to whom the mode pays scant respect . Indeed , this impartiality amounts at times almost to a foible , depriving certain essays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book lacks the consistency and dignity of the first series , though containing , in the Holbein and Rodin , two of Mr. Cox 's best pieces of criticism . Possibly , the Material covers too wade a range . In the preface , for example , he moots the old dilemma of the artist as critic , arriving at the result that laymen frequently write bad art criticism , a statement that will hardly be disputed ; and that artists , barring mere stylistics , generally write good art criticism , a truth that Mr. Cox himself has notably illustrated for a matter of twenty years . We want , in short , for either class simply a fair field , and no favor  --  a demand so obviously just that it is hardly worth while to put it into a preface . Discussing the Education of an Artist , our author shows himself the candid friend of the modern art school . It is a poor thing , he admits . It teaches practically nothing about painting , and actually nothing about artistic design . But , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since no better substitute is at hand . From the revived practice of mural painting , he hopes for a limited return to the old system of apprenticeship . It seems to us that Mr. Cox fails to strike the real grievance against the art school , which is that it does not even teach what it professes to teach , namely , drawing It does teach is form of lifeless mechanical draughtsmanship which permits the pupil to represent with approximate correctness the contours of any object before him But this is not drawing at all , as artists and even lay critics use the term . To see what fine drawing really is , one need only consult pa , sslin , the essays on the Pollaiuoli , Rembrandt , and Holbein en the present volume . ! Anent the death of Alfred Stevens , Mr. Cox has strung on a slight chronological thread a number of painters of the mode , from Holbem down . The paper is pleasant reading enough , and doubtless served its turn . well in a popular magazine , but hardly seems of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass from this and - other collectanea to such admirable essays . as the Holbein , Rembrandt , and Rodin . The Holbein particularly is a substantial contribution both to connoisseurhip and critieiSm . Mr. Cox ' convincingly attributes Holbein 's curious reversal of form in his later work to the ruling fashion of portraiture in England under the Tudors . We thus find the almost unexampled development from - full chiaroscuro and a rather thick pate to shadowless , thinly painted forms , as flat , except for their exquisite contours , as a queen of cards . How Holbein wrung a triumph out of this tyrannical imposition is Mr. Cox 's theme . He treats also the superlative beauty of Holbein 's enamel , the painterlike qualities of the man , with more thoroughness and sympathy than any predecessor within our knowledge . The essay on Rembrandt , an address on the occasion of the Tercentenary , is so good and comprehensive that we should be glad to see it supersede that in the First Series . The later . study catches more simply the isolated . character of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely fantastic , its passionate absorption in the daily ' drama of light and darkness . its daemonic - manual ability . - The Rodin will seem a " cooling card " to unreserved adorers of this turbulent genius . It seems to us to grasp the fundamental limitation of this art , its lack , possibly its deliberate abnegation , of monumental quality , its exaggeration of its cardinal principle of penumbrage ( admitting the word ) . It is perhaps worth while recalling here that technically Rodin has merely carried into large sculpture a kind ? : f picturesqueness that recurs over and over regain in fine small modelling of all periods . in the figurines of Clodion and Prather , for - example , one may find interesting anticipations of this mode . His innovations are rather temperamental than technical . In a ' certain drastic sensuousness his analogues - are to be found , as we believe he himself admits , in late Gothic sculpture . But in all these matters we refer the reader to Mr. Cox . In him they will find ' that " agreeable leading " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of truth , without missing the more old-fashioned guarantee of a certain austere prothitY . The leading article in the Burlington Magazine for November is an editorial suggestion that the income of the Chantrey Fund for a number of years should be devOted to the completion of the decoration of the houses of Parliament , towards which nothing seems to have been done for many - years . We sympathize with the editor 's feeling that British artists should be able to rise to the task of monumental decoration , Mid that to refuse to give commissions for monumental work until there is a body of trained and experienced decorative painters is to resolve never to go into the water until one has learned to swim . There are in this country , also , those who are so troubled by the errors of inexperience that they prefer to do nothing , and , as in England , they need to be reminded that it is through errors that perfection is finally reached , mad that we shall never have a noble school of monumental art unless our artists are -- constantly afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insuring - of a decorative effect in mural painting is not quite so simple a matter as the editorial writer in the Burlington seems to think . His idea is that " there is a way of insuring that no painter of average capacity shall produce work that is positively undecorative , namely , - by compelling him to work with only a moderate range of tones . " A definite standard of tone is to be fixed , and " all tones lighter than the selected standard may be used , but the introduction of any tone darker than the standard shall disqualify the painting containing it . " Such a restriction might , indeed , prevent some faults , but it would , of course , insure no virtues , and it would often quite uselessly handicap the real decorator . For the true decorator , from Veronese to Tiepolo , has always found the occasional use of nearly pure black , in small quantities , extremely valuable . The kind of breadth and lightness of tone desirable in decoration is not to be attained merely by restricting one 's self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be attained by an intelligent use of all one 's resources , of which black is not the least . And the whole question of tone is , after all , a minor one . It is the question of design that is vital . The frontispiece of the number is a reproduction of a newly rediscovered early picture of Constable 's , Dedham Vale , accompanied by an article by C. J. Holmes . The department of Art in America is occupied , this time , with American subjects , Kenyon Cox writing of the pictures by Winslow Homer in the Metropolitan Museum , and William Walton of New York 's Art Commission . A learned discussion of statues of the Dioscuri , by Giuseppe Culture , is the leading article of the November Bollettino d'Arte . His point of departure is the colossal Dioscur found at Bans twenty years ago , and recently acquired by the Italian State . In all these great images the problem is to reconcile the rather archaic forms of the body with the Alexander-Hellos type of the head . This anachronism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the extant examples are copies of originals of the fourth century . Signor Cultura 's suggestion is that the composite type is of Roman origin , corresponding to the Latin vogue of the Castor and Pollux cult . Greece , he thinks , borrowed the type in turn from her conqueror . This view runs with the prevailing tendency to admit a greater diversity and freedom in the eclectic sculpture of Rome . Arduino Colasanti publishes for the first time a St. Francis receiving the Stigmata , by Gentile da Fabriano . This exquisite early work is in the Fornari collection at Fabriano , where curiously enough exists also an old copy by Giovanni da Paolo of Siena  --  one more evidence of the imitative habits of this uneven painter . In the news section is reported the condemnation , on appeal , of a citizen of Verona for selling the balconies adorning the front of his own house , although these were not on the " inventory of precious objects . " The Court of Appeals ruled that these carvings , having long been shown to all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vested right to beauty . Such incidents make the selling or even the buying of antiques an Italy a fearful trade . But with small fines on a rising market it may presumably be endured . Houghton , Mifflin &; Co have just issued a monograph on Augustus Saint-Gaudens , by Royal Cortissoz , illustrated with photogra- ' vure plates after twenty-four-.of that artist 's works , including almost all his more important statues and a number of his medallions and reliefs . Mr. Cortissoz writes , of the great artist 's - character from personal knowledge and fullness of sympathy , and of his art with much ' insight and discrimination . The only fault to be found , with his essay is a certain lack of incisiveness in his smooth and easy style . He sees rightly what are the qualities of the work he is discussing , but either he does not see very sharply or he is not able to con-. vey in language a definite image of what he sees His portrait is a true one , but it is a trifle blurred . There axeseveral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , printed as descriptions of the plates and apart from the text . Thus the relief of the ' artist 's son , Homer Saint-Gaudens , is described as " one of the earliest medallions he produced , " though it is dated five years later than that of George W. Maynard , reproduced in this volume , . and two or three years later than four other medallions here illustrated . The medallion of C. C. Beaman is said to have been " modelled in the early eighties , " in spite of its exceptionally clear inscription which dates it 1894 . Finally , of the Columbus medal Mr. Cortissoz says : " Of the two designs made by Saint-Gaudens the second was adopted . The reverse of the one abandoned has a special interest , " etc . This is misleading Saint-Gaudens made two designs for the reverse of this medal  --  only one for the obverse  --  and of the two designs for the reverse neither was adopted . The clumsy composition actually used was by another hand . The plates are well executed , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues suffer more in this way than the medallions , as also by the great reduction in scale The book is handsomely printed and . ' got up , and will prove , in spite of the minor errors commented on . a desirable Possession . -A new book by Bernhard Berenson is an event of some importance , and he has now-concluded his series of studies of the Italian schools by issuing " The North Italian Painters of the Renaissance " ( G. P. Putnam 's Sons ) . The book has all the characteristics of its predecessors , but it does not deal with so interesting a subject . Except for Mantegna and Correggio it treats . of hardly any artists approaching the first rank , and instead of showing us why this or that colossus is colossal , Mr. Berenson is , in the main , occupied with showing us why this or that pygmy is no larger . Even as regards his two great men , Mr. Berenson is more anxious to show why they are not the greatest than why they are great . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said that , in a larger view , it matters very little what they did or why they did it . In short , this volume 's importance is that it is the negative end of Mr. Berenson 's demonstration of his theory of art , as its companion volumes were the positive end . He is now dealing with the absence of his three great qualities , tactile values , movement , and space-composition , as he has before dealt with their presence , and the burden is ever the same  --  these are the things that make serious art , and in their absence art ceases to-be serious . Near the end he confesses that color deserves More attention than he has given it , and expresses the hope that some day he may be able to repair the deficiency . His mature views on that element of art can not fail to be interesting , and one hopes that his " some day " may be an early one . At the end there are the usual tables of works - by the artists , considered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual amount of discussion among the experts . Dr. Max Kemmerich 's " Die fruhmittela1-7terliche Portratmalerei in Deutschland brs zur Mitte des 13 . Jahrhunderts " ( Munich : Calwey ) is a carefully written and interesting work from an historical as well as from an artistic point of view , giving a clear and consecutive survey of medieval portrait painting in Germany from the eighth to the middle of the thirteenth century Early portraits of this period , as is evident from those preserved in the few illuminated manuscripts transmitted to us from the time of Charlemagne , lack individuality , the artists aiming chiefly to show by apparel , attitudes , and various attrl-butes the office or rank of the persons portrayed without attempting to delineate marked peculiarities of the features , color , expression of the eyes , and other distinctive characteristics Some improvement in these respects is perceptible about a century later , under Charlemagne 's grandson , Charles the Bald , but the highest development in this direction was attained during the reign of Otto III , in the last decades of the tenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the initiative or influence of these sovereigns , who are here mentioned only for chronological purposes . The author obtains his material almost exclusively from illustrated manuscripts , Bibles , codices , liturgies , and other such sources . The book contains a list of more than 350 portraits of early medieval persons , a number of which are reproduced , and some of them for the first time , thus adding to its attractiveness and value .
