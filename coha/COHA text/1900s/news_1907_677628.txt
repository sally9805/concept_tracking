txt " The Madman 's Will . " Justice Smith Says it Was Written by Williston Fish , Late U.S.A. My attention has just been called to a letter in your issue of June 1 in relation to the will of Charles Lounsbury , published in your issue of April 22 . This letter was read by me in connection with a short after-dinner speech as a paper purporting to be the will of an insane man . At that time I did not know its author . I have since learned that it was written by Mr. Williston Fish , a graduate of West Point , in 1881 , who served in the army until 1887 , and who is now one of the most prominent attorneys of Chicago . Ill . The will first appeared in Harper 's Weekly of Sept. 3 , 1898 . Since the publication in your issue of April 22 I have had over a hundred letters in reference thereto , and the Superintendent of the Cook County Insane Asylum writes me that he has been deluged with letters of inquiry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due credit for this beautiful conception may be given where it belongs , I write this letter .
