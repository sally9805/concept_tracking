IT is a solemn thing to have an audi-ence with such as have power of life and death ? especially in states where the habeas corpus passes for political poison . This thought - went through me as I sat in the presence of His Imperial Highness Sri Paduka Bawa Duli Sultan Hashint Jalil-bil-Alam Akamadin Ibni Almerhum Sri Paduka Manlana Sultan Omar All Saijuclin , the twenty-fifth of his illustrious dynasty in Brunei . I way not have got in all his titles ? he is a modest man , But for these few I have official authority no less than that of H. B. M. Acting Consul at Brunei , a Scot after my own heart ? fond of speculating on cause and effect . There was room for speculation , for my seat had been placed on the Sultan 's right , immediately in front of a long brass smooth-bore muzzle-loading piece of artillery , behind which piece stood a brown gentleman with a turban on his head and a torch in his hand ? said torch being occasionally used for the lighting of cigars . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass piece was or was not loaded . But maybe I am going ahead too fast . Perhaps you have never been to Brunei ? perhaps you do not know that . the Sultan of Brunei is the hereditary Sultan , not merely of all Borneo and the bulk of the present Malay Archipelago , but that his ships dominated the Strait of Malacca , and that the southern states of China once sent him tribute . To-day he stoutly claims dominion over several islands of the Philippine group ? notably those which profess the faith of Islam . The Sultan of Brunei is eighty-three years of age ? at least so he told me . And while he stoops as he walks , he makes the appearance rather of a temporary invalid than of an old man . He seemed pleased when I told him that he might pass for sixty ; and indeed he might , for his face is singularly free from wrinkles . His expression of benevolence suggests the late Leo XIII. ? his smile is engaging , albeit tinged with sadness . His house was ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His ancestors gave the law to a vast Eastern Empire when Europe was but a patchwork of barbarous chiefs ; and when , after centuries , Spanish and Portuguese found their way to the Spice Islands they laid propitiating gifts at the feet of the Borneo Sultan asvassals , humbly begging the right to live within his dominions . Brunei is still the metropolis of native Borneo -- indeed the name Borneo is but a corruption of Brunei , ? yet few maps show the existence of this empire . It is Venice in Borneo ? a city whose streets are water , whose citizens are horn in houses perched on slender piles , whose in and out going is the affair not of sidewalks , but of single-bladed paddles ; where even the market is held afloat in the " Grand Canal , " where the shops are propelled through a fleet of prospective customers . Imagine a Henley week ? innumerable small craft ; dugout canoes , anywhere from a tiny water " perambulator " little larger than a cradle , through the successive sizes capable of holding a full-grown man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state which correspond to those of early Venice . House-boats there are also at Brunei ; but they have a commercial character , are mainly owned by Chinese , who fit them . up as floating stores with showcases and shelves on both sides ? doors wide open . At bow and stern are Malay paddlers , while the proprietor sits at his side entrance offering his wares to the crowd of jostling canoeists , who handle their craft ( we must be just ) with infinitely more grace and good humor than the bulk of our aquatic brethren of Henley or even of the Adirondacks . Brunei offers several advantages over Henley ? for here it is the house-boat that circulates , but with infinite gentleness and good breeding . Am I exaggerating ? Did I not have the ocular proof ; did I not paddle among ten thousand other canoes at the heated moment of market activity , a short while before its close ? Did I hear a single word of profanity ? Did I note a single rude jostling of one boat against another ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , in this Venice of the brown man , courtesy was of the blood ? I tun convinced that the true gentleman originated in Borneo , But I am getting away from the Sultan . His messenger , no less than the lordly Orang Kaya Maharaja di Rajah , had given us notice that his Majesty would receive me at two o'clock on that same afternoon , ? and at two punctually we glided up to the palace steps . Our canoe was of the grandest pattern ? a dugout as to hull , sides built up a trifle , a platform of bamboo by way of deck , and a thatch roof over the whole of it . It was painted white , with a blue streak , and was propelled by six Malays , who squatted on the edge of the gunwale and plied paddles whose blades were as long as their handles . They wore velvet skullcaps ? a head - covering corresponding somewhat to the fez of western Islam . At the palace stairs we were met in state by the Grand Vizier , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highness , shook hands gravely , and then led the way to the throne-room , which was about a hundred yards distant along a covered wooden platform reared upon piles . Now if this lauding-stage suggests the approach to the Doge 's Palace in Venice , my language needs some modification . The royal approach resembled rather the steps which assist a hen in reaching her night lodgings ; it was a broad ladder going up from the water to the imperial platform , and the ascent of this required a certain degree of acrobatic agility . The platform itself was interesting rather than secure . The boards beneath my feet appeared to require nailing here and there , and they rattled ominously ? showed such seams as might have caused a broken leg of a dark night . On either side of the landing were three pieces of antique artillery ? mainly English , to judge by the inscriptions . It was on the tip of my tongue to ask the Lord Chancellor if these pieces had been the fruit of past piracy. ? but this would have sounded personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most imposing building in Brunei , of course . The imperial standard flies over it , and fifty yards from its front door is a little platform standing alone and eon-taining a saluting battery of guns made in Brunei ? for in times past Brunei had a famous foundry . This array of artillery to-day does not , as at Tangiers , serve even the purpose of saluting ; for the British government forbids the importation of gunpowder , and the Sultan therefore can salute no one in the former noisy manner . We walked along the royal platform , or wharf , for perhaps a hundred yards , and then stepped over a heavy beam which we may call the threshold of a house without doors . Here was a large chamber ? at one end rose a gaudy piece of Chinese carving , painted red and yellow and green . It was a square box and the top seemed like that of a heathen shrine . This was the throne , but it was empty . So I concluded that the Sultan would make his appearance later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On either side of this big room were apartments , probably harem and other domestic rooms , in front of which were planted pieces of artillery ? this time of native manufacture . The audience-room itself was about sixty feet long by thirty wide ? the ceiling seemed thirty feet high . At the lower end sat in a row six grandees of the palace ; two of them wore white turbans , green waistcoats , and long white gowns ? advertising the fact that they had been to Mecca and were consequently entitled to more respect than their colleagues . I was presented to each in turn ? shook hands , and was then escorted to the other end of the chamber , where stood the throne . Around this audience - room ran a veranda on which many of the minor aristocracy squatted and watched proceedings with undisguised interest . The Mohammedan of Malay waters differs from his coreligionary of Morocco in permitting himself a frank curiosity touching things of the outside world . In this matter he suggests the Japanese . Indeed in my travels throughout the archipelago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes of the Dutch East Indies , I was much impressed by the degree to which the natives suggested Japan . The Philippines do not constitute an exception . There seems to me a greater gulf between the Japanese and the Chinese than between the Japanese and the natives of Borneo , Java , or Luzon . In the middle of the room ran a long table suggesting the one in the house of Commons which divides the Government from the Opposition . On this table was a very familiar and very cheap reddish cloth such as is found on most tables in German beer-gardens . There was another small round table immediately in front of the gaudy throne , and as we entered I noticed one whom I took to be a venerable Malay janitor arranging something there . This elderly gentleman offered me his hand ? and then he waved us gracefully to the cane chairs at the muzzle of an artillery piece , of which there was one on each side of thethrone , each being guarded by a group of Malays . I sat down as directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was bubbling with curiosity anent many things , and sought my information from my consular neighbor . " Who is the old nut-cracker in the big chair ? " quoth I in a hoarse whisper . " That 's Him ! " returned my mentor , somewhat drily . There was a painful pause . But how was I to have known that this was the great Sultan himself ! I had met many crowned heads in my day . There was the great Moshesh of Basutoland ? a monarch who greeted me in an opera-bat , a war-club , and a pair of spats . King Ja-Ja of West Africa also received me once in state ? but then those two were negroes . Japanese and Siamese royalty have I met , to say nothing of the everyday article current in jaded Europe , but nothing anywhere prepared me for the Sultan of Brunei . He wore a given smoking-cap about eight inches high , on which were worked texts from the Koran . On his feet he wore a pair of yellow gymnasium shoes , and beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown looked in the dim light of the palace as though it had been stained by some brownish juice , there were many spots , but more competent authorities assured me that those spots were ornaments worked upon the white cloth . From his waist down there hung a blue cloth skirt ? the conventional native sarong , and by his side was a spittoon which he used freely . His lips were stained with a reddish juice , possibly of betel-nut , and he was evidently chewing this throughout the audience . But his face was very kindly and his manner dignified . He reminded me of the late President Kruger ; the lines of the mouth were the same , the eyes very similar ? likewise the forehead . Each had the long interval between the nose and lip . But Kruger had the advantage in a strong nose , the key to firmness in a great man , to obstinacy in a narrow one . The Sultan asked me my opinion of Brunei , to which I could safely answer that I thought it one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? and indeed it need not fear comparison with the Thames above Richmond or the Hudson near West Point . Ho himself , having spent all his life amongst his own people , probably anticipated my answer , for he smiled in a gentle manner as though pleased to know that I had enough taste to appreciate the beauty of his capital , and then asked me why the United States did not give back to him the islands of the Philippine Archipelago which were a part of his ancestral estate . While he put this somewhat embarrassing question a Lord Chamberlain approached his master bearing coffee in cups of European proportion and design but Japanese manufacture . Each of us was honored by a cup of exceedingly good coffee ? made after the Turkish fashion ? already sweetened . I needed time in which to formulate an answer that would prevent his artillery from exploding , and at the same time not compromise either Washington or London . So T picked up the cup and signalled for assistance to my official mentor . Fortunately another diversion made its appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigars ? or even cigarettes . They were twelve inches long and shaped like a cheroot or baseball club . The outside was a whitish leaf , a part of the Neepa palm ? the inside was a very gentle and fragrant load of tobacco which looked in quantity sufficient to knock over even a Transvaal Boer . I was about to decline , not being a smoker , when the consul said I must ; so I seized one and while I examined it with curiosity he hurriedly coached me in the matter of Borneo foreign policy . I was not to commit the government of the United States , much lees that of Great Britain . The Sultan of Brunei was by treaty bound to hold foreign intercourse solely through the London government , and , moreover , as to the American islands , they had been ceded by Spain , who in her turn held them by treaty from the Sultan of Sulu . However , at the Sultan 's request , the British representative yielded so far as to permit a direct appeal from Brunei to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this matter I acted only as a messenger of good-will between two mighty peoples . And so here I do solemnly record once more the protest of Imperial Brunei against the American usurpation of several islands adjacent to Borneo ? islands very preciOus to this Mohammedan Emperor , and worse than useless to the United States . In parenthesis it may be well to state here , for the benefit of those who have not cruised in those waters , that Uncle Sam is crowding upon Borneo to an extent little dreamed of by those who originally accepted the surrender of Spain in 1892 . The Island of Taganak , claimed by us , is in the full fairway not more than seventeen miles from Sandakan , the chief port of British North Borneo . It is , like Helgoland at the mouth of the Elbe , of scant use to any one save for lighthouse or military purpose , and obviously should be owned by some government of Borneo . The Island of Tawi Tawi is but thirty-one miles easterly from the northeastern coast-line of British North Borneo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kagayan Sulu is but sixty miles east-northeast from the northeastern end of Sulu . All these islands are claimed by the United States , all are practically within Borneo waters ? all have from time immemorial been accustomed to trade freely with Borneo on the one side and the Philippines on the other ? at least up to the time of American occupation . Soon entered a chamberlain with a huge candlestick , such as one sees on Roman Catholic altars ? it was two feet high and had a base two feet in diameter . On it was a candle about one yard high . As the chamberlain placed this heavy thing before me , he bowed , then prostrated himself before the Sultan , folding his hands and stretching them far above his head . Whether this was an act of worship , whether this candle was a religious emblem , whether the base was intended for holy water , whether the top was intended for Allah or for lighting cigars , I shall never know . To he on the safe side I refused to use it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good tobacco should not come in contact THE LAST OF A GREAT SULTAN . with the smoke of tallow . So 1 lit my long cheroot from a wooden tattle/1 and found that the Sultan had furnished me with one of the most delicious smokes I had ever experienced . Brunei is an immensely picturesque community ? it is one of the very last states in which primitive society may be studied at first hand ; in which justice is administered apparently without any legal machinery ; in which the sovereign rules with apparently no rod heavier than the moral ascendency he enjoys through being the twenty-fifth of his line . There are but four white people in this city of 12,000 Malays , yet no man ever heard of injury offered to any one of them . The natives are warriors , headhunting is the national pastime , the kreess is worn ostentatiously when the Malay moves about , and yet I felt in ' Brunei certainly as secure as in New York or London . Of course now and then the Sultan is compelled to punish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails in all happy Islam countries , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the western edges of New Guinea . He does not waste much time in thumbing learned volumes ? he has none nor needs any . He calls such witnesses as he deems useful , listens to as much of the evidence as he finds interesting , and then , with a quotation from the Koran , passes summary judgment from which there is no appeal save to Allah in the next world . On the Sultan 's table there lay a paper written in English ; it was a certificate to the effect that the British acting consul had received from the Sultan eight gold dollars in order to pay for a buffalo which had been stolen and slaughtered by one of his subjects . Now the thief had committed the indiscretion of permitting himself to be discovered with the incriminating buffalo meat in. his possession . The British consul was appealed to by the owner of the buffalo , who was not a subject of the Sultan , but belonged in the neighboring state of Sarawak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tho case was complicated by the fact that said thief was in the habit of stealing buffalo from Sarawak and of sharing his plunder with the Sultan and his court . Already some fifty buffalo had been traced to this one man . The evidence was so overwhelming that the Sultan was forced to take action , much as he might secretly rejoice in anything which injured his enemy of Sarawak . So he held a grand court of justice and called before hint the thief . " Did you steal this buffalo ? " quoth the Sultan . " No , " answered the man of Brunei . " Then swear it on the Koran , " quoth the Sultan . The Brunei man swore as desired . " There ! " said the Sultan , turning to the consul ; " the man swears on the Koran . He is innocent . Are you satisfied ? can do no more . " So the man was acquitted , for it would never have done to have punished this loyal subject of the Sultan who kept the imperial table supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he acquitted a notorious thief , deemed it politic to do justice in another form . He recognized the fact that a theft had been committed by one of his subjects . Sohe sent down to the British consul sixteen silver dollars ( worth $8 gold ) , which were counted out in my presence , and for which formal receipt was given . This decision pleased all in Brunei ; it satisfied the Malay notion of justice ? the victim received the price of his stolen buffalo . The consul was compelled to regard this as proof that the Sultan was a stern enemy of crime ; the real thief no doubt received a warning to be more careful in future ; the supply of buffalo will not diminish . As we left this interesting ruler , the Lord Chamberlain escorted us to our state barge , and the people stood about respectfully as we paddled away through the crowd of canoes and naked natives . Here is the last of an em-pire whose name is that of the largest island in the world . Dutch and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the Sultan has most to fear is the one from whom he once hoped the most . He is being choked to death economically by the state of Sara-wak , which now controls not only the territory In the south of him , but the very river that passes his door and on whose trade he has depended from earliest times .
