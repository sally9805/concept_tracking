txt Apropos to the suggestion made by Harry Hill and William Edwards , Postmaster at Macon , Ga. , and writer of negro stories , that convict labor be used in building the Pena : - ma Canal , Contractor Oliver , the lowest bidder for the work , was asked his opinion to-day and answered : " I think that it is a capital suggestion , and for my part I would be willing to use all the convict labor the South could furnish , provided proper restrictions were placed about them and sufficient authority to control them as they should be were given to me . I could use from mono to 15,000 convict laborers from the Southern States . . As to what I could pay for their services is a question that would have to be determined , depending upon conditions under which the labor would be leased . There should be no trouble in having enough convict labor to build the canal if the vagrant laws were enforced . " In a special received here from Washington it was stated that Mr. Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering this suggestion . Mr. Oliver has not received the letter . From what can be learned here , unsuccessful bidders and Wall Street bank-. ers , who wanted an opportunity to finance the Panama scheme , are busily engaged with the co ? nmission in an effort to defeat the Oliver-Bangs combination , which is without Wall Street millions ; offering only its 35,000,000 of assets over liabilities . Mr. Oliver is going to Washington on Sunday morning . He continues to receive congratulatory telegrams from every section of the country . He has the indorsement of every bank and the President of every railroad in the South . THE UNEMPLOYED 'S DESPAIR . Hope Gone , F. Knoff Kisses His Family Good-bye and Shoots Himself . Unable to get work of any kind after repeated - efforts and finding his ' children and wife without food for their supper , Frederick Knoff of 534 East 145th Street walked into a bedroom of his flat last night and shot himself in the neck with a revolver . He was removed to Lincoln Hospital and the physicians say he can not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in his long search for work the family 's small reserve melted away in spite of the frugality of ? the wife . On Wednesday , with only a cent in his pocket , Knoff walked downtown , where he bought a paper and then tramped around , footsore and weak , answering help want " ads . " He was unsuccessful and walked home . On Thursday Knott earned 15 cents shoveling snow from pavements . " It is not much , " he said to his wife . " but it will buy bread for the little folks . " Then Knott , his wife said last night , broke down and wept like a child . Yesterday he again tried to get work , but failed . When he returned home last night the last cent was gone and there was : lot/ling to eat . He sat down , picked up his youngest child and fondled it , while the older child , a boy of 5 , stood by his knee . " Poor little ones , you find it hard , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair of the youngest , who is 2 . " Perhaps the world would use you better if papa were dead . " Kissing the children again and again . Knoff , with tears in his eyes , put nis arms around his wife , and , kissing her , repeated : " rerhaps the world would use you better : f I were dead . " Knoff hurried into the bedroom and a moment later his wife heard the report of a t evolver . The woman ran screaming into the room to find her husband unconscious upon the bed with blood on his neck . The neighbors heard the woman 's cries , hurried into the apartment , and then called the police . BACHELORS WERE ALL OUT . No Chance for Rescues When Their Fiathouse Caught Fire .

They failed to get a single response and finally burst in the door of the third floor apartment . There they found that a grate fire had scattered sparks out on to the floor , which had Ignited a rug . The fire was too much for the policemen , to handle , and they turned in an alarm . Although the fire was confined to the apartment in which it originated , the damage amounted to Not a single bachelor returned while the fire was in progress , although almost everybody else in New York blocked Broadway until the reserves had to be summoned from the Tenderloin station . At last Landers and Hunt returned to the station where they reported . " A bachelor 's flat burned . Damage , $1,000 . " Sergt. McCann cheered them up , however . by remarking : " Never mind , boys .
