txt Church Services in Belasco 's Theatre . Dr. William Carter of the Madison Avenue Reformed Church has undertaken a work that should have the hearty support of every Christian in the city , and should be given as wide publicity as possible . Beginning Sunday evening , March 8 , at 8 o'clock , he will hold public services in the Belasco Theatre . Admission , of course , will be free . A chorus of almost 200 voices , including the trained choir of Dr. Carter 's church , is expected to be on the stage . There will also be instrumental music . Dr. Carter hopes to inaugurate a movement that will eventually bring many people of this great city , who do not now go to church for various reasons , into the church . This is a movement that should be encouraged by all people who have the best interests of their fellow-beings and of this great city at heart , and it is hoped that this effort will meet with success and that other churches will follow the lead . Many theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our city are greatly in this minority , but Dr. Carter is doing the practical thing by seeking to remedy conditions , and the editor of THE TIMES will be rendering a public service if he helps the good cause along .
