The Legend of the Bleeding-heart In days of old , when all things in the Wood had speech , there lived within its depths a lone Flax-spinner . She was a bent old creature , and ill to look upon , but all the tongues of all the forest leaves were ever kept a-wagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day they sometimes whisper low among themselves ( because they fain would hold in mind so sweet a tale ) the story of her kindness to the little orphan , Olga . ' T was no slight task the old Flax-spinner took upon herself , the day she brought the helpless child to share the shelter of her thatch . The Oak outside her door held up his arms in solemn protest . " Thou dost but waste thyself , " he said . " Thy benefits will be forgot , thy labours unrequited . For Youth is ever but another title for Ingratitude . " " Nay , friend , " the old Flax-spinner said . " My little Olga will not be ungrateful and forgetful . " All hedged about with loving care , the orphan grew to gracious maidenhood , and felt no lack of father , mother , brother or sister . In every way the old Flax-spinner took their places . But many were the sacrifices that she made to keep her fed and warmly clad , and every time she went without herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down and frowned and shook his head . Then would the old dame hasten to her inner room , and there she pricked herself with her spindle , until a great red drop of her heart 's blood fell into her trembling hand . With witchery of words she blew upon it , and rolled it in her palm , and muttering , turned and turned and turned it . And as the spell was laid upon it , it shrivelled into a tiny round ball like a seed , and she strung it on a thread where were many others like it , saying , " By this she will remember . She will not be ungrateful and forgetful . " So years went by , and Olga grew in goodness and in beauty , and helped the old Flax-spinner in her tasks as blithely and as willingly as if she were indeed her daughter . Every morning she brought water from the spring , gathered the wild fruits of the woods , and spread the linen on the grass to bleach . At such times would the bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oak , " Dost see ? Thou'rt wrong ! Youth is not another title for Ingratitude . " " Thou hast not lived as long as I , " would be the only answer . One day as Olga was wandering by the spring , searching for watercresses , the young Prince of the castle rode by on his prancing charger . A snow-white plume waved in his hat , and a shining silver bugle hung from his shoulder , for he had been following the chase . He was thirsty and tired , and asked for a drink , but there was no cup with which to dip the water from the spring . But Olga caught the drops as they bubbled out from the spring , holding them in the hollow of her beautiful white hands , and reaching up to where he sat , offered him the sparkling water . So gracefully was it done , that the Prince was charmed by her modest manner as well as her lovely face , and baring his head when he had slaked his thirst , he touched the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her name and where she lived . The next day a courier in scarlet and gold stopped at the door of the cottage and invited Olga to the castle . Princesses and royal ladies from all over the realm were to be entertained there , seven days and seven nights . Every night a grand ball was to be given , and Olga was summoned to each of the balls . It was because of her pleasing manner and her great beauty that she had been bidden . The old Flax-spinner courtesied low to the courier and promised that Olga should be at the castle without fail . " But , good dame , " cried Olga , when the courier had gone , " prithee tell me why thou didst make such a promise , knowing full well this gown of tow is all I own . Wouldst have me stand before the Prince in beggar 's garb ? Better to bide at home for aye than be put to shame before such guests . " " Have done , my child ! " the old dame said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Years have I toiled to have it ready , but that is naught . I loved thee as my own . " Then once more the old Flax-spinner went into her inner room , and pricked herself with her spindle till another great red drop of her heart 's blood fell into her trembling hand . With witchery of words she blew upon it , and rolled it in her palm , and muttering , turned and turned and turned it . And as the spell was laid upon it , it shrivelled into a tiny round ball like a seed , and she strung it on to a thread , where were many others like it . Seventy times seven was the number of beads on this strange rosary . When the night of the first ball rolled around , Olga combed her long golden hair and twined it with a wreath of snowy water-lilies , and then she stood before the old dame in her dress of tow . To her wonderment and grief she saw there was no silken robe in waiting , only a string of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the necklace was like a little shrivelled seed , and Olga 's eyes filled with tears of disappointment . " Obey me and all will be well , " said the old woman . " When thou reachest the castle gate clasp one bead in thy fingers and say : " ' For love 's sweet sake , in my hour of need , Blossom and deck me , little seed . ' Straightway right royally shalt thou be clad . But remember carefully the charm . Only to the magic words , ' For love 's sweet sake ' will the necklace give up its treasures . If thou shouldst forget , then thou must be doomed always to wear thy gown of tow . " So Olga sped on her moon-lighted way through the forest until she came to the castle gate . There she paused , and grasping a bead of the strange necklace between her fingers , repeated the old dame 's charm : " For love 's sweet sake , in my hour of need , Blossom and deck me , little seed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seed pod had snapped asunder . A faint perfume surrounded her , rare and subtle as if it had been blown across from some flower of Eden . Olga looked down and found herself enveloped in a robe of such delicate texture , that it seemed soft as a rose-leaf and as airy as pink clouds that sometimes float across the sunset . The water-lilies in her hair had become a coronal of opals . When she entered the great ball-room , the Prince of the castle started up from his throne in amazement . Never before had he seen such a vision of loveliness . " Surely , " said he , " some rose of Paradise hath found a soul and drifted earthward to blossom here . " And all that night he had eyes for none but her . The next night Olga started again to the castle in her dress of tow , and at the gate she grasped the second bead in her fingers , repeating the charm . This time the pale yellow of the daffodils seemed to have woven itself into a cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmer of moon-beams , and her hair held the diamond flashings of a hundred tiny stars . That night the Prince paid her so many compliments and singled her out so often to bestow his favours , that Olga 's head was turned . She tossed it proudly , and quite scorned the thought of the humble cottage which had given her shelter so long . The next day when she had returned to her gown of tow and was no longer a haughty court lady , but only Olga , the Flax-spinner 's maiden , she repined at her lot . Frowning , she carried the water from the spring . Frowning , she gathered the cresses and plucked the woodland fruit . And then she sat all day by the spring , refusing to spread the linen on the grass to bleach . She was discontented with the old life of toil , and pouted crossly because duties called her when she wanted to do nothing but sit idly dreaming of the gay court scenes in which she had taken a bright brief part . The old Flax-spinner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowns , for she had given of her heart 's blood to buy happiness for this maiden she loved , and well she knew there can be no happiness where frowns abide . She felt that her years of sacrifice had been in vain , but when the Oak wagged his head she called back waveringly , " My little Olga will not be ungrateful and forgetful ! " That night outside the castle gate , Olga paused . She had forgotten the charm . The day 's discontent had darkened her memory as storm-clouds darken the sky . But she grasped her necklace imperiously . " Deck me at once ! " she cried in a haughty tone . " Clothe me more beautifully than mortal maid was ever clad before , so that I may find favour in the Prince 's sight and become the bride of the castle ! I would that I were done for ever with the spindle and the distaff ! " But the moon went under a cloud and the wind began to moan around the turrets . The black night hawks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flitted low around her head . " Obey me at once ! " she cried angrily , stamping her foot and jerking at the necklace . But the string broke , and the beads went rolling away in the darkness in every direction and were lost -- all but one , which she held clasped in her hand . Then Olga wept at the castle gate ; wept outside in the night and the darkness , in her peasant 's garb of tow . But after awhile through her sobbing , stole the answering sob of the night wind . " Hush-sh ! " it seemed to say . " Sh-sh ! Never a heart can come to harm , if the lips but speak the old dame 's charm . " The voice of the night wind sounded so much like the voice of the old Flax-spinner , that Olga was startled and looked around wonderingly . Then suddenly she seemed to see the thatched cottage and the bent form of the lonely old woman at the wheel . All the years in which the good dame had befriended her seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one called a thousand kindnesses as with one voice : " How canst thou forget us , Olga ? We were done for love 's sweet sake , and that alone ! " Then was Olga sorry and ashamed that she had been so proud and forgetful , and she wept again . The tears seemed to clear her vision , for now she saw plainly that through no power of her own could she wrest strange favours from fortune . Only the power of the old charm could make them hers . She remembered it then , and holding fast the one bead in her hand , she repeated humbly : " For love 's sweet sake , in my hour of need , Blossom and deck me , little seed . " Lo , as the words left her lips , the moon shone out from behind the clouds above the dark forest . There was a fragrance of lilies all about , and a gossamer gown floated around her , whiter than the whiteness of the fairest lily . It was fine like the finest lace the frost-elves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . On her long golden hair gleamed a coronet of pearls . So beautiful , so dazzling was she as she entered the castle door , that the Prince came down to meet her , and kneeling , kissed her hand and claimed her as his bride . Then came the bishop in his mitre , and led her to the throne , and before them all the Flax-spinner 's maiden was married to the Prince , and made the Princess Olga . Then until the seven days and seven nights were done , the revels lasted in the castle . And in the merriment the old Flax-spinner was again forgotten . Her kindness of the past , her loneliness in the present had no part in the thoughts of the Princess Olga . All night the old Oak , tapping on the thatch , called down , " Thou'rt forgotten ! Thou'rt forgotten ! " But the beads that had rolled away in the darkness , buried themselves in the earth , and took root , and sprang up , as the old woman knew they would do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strange flower , for on every stem hung a row of little bleeding hearts . One day the Princess Olga , seeing them from her window , went down to them in wonderment . " What do you here ? " she cried , for in her forest life she 'd learned all speech of bird and beast and plant . " We bloom for love 's sweet sake , " they answered . " We have sprung from the old Flax-spinner 's gift -- the necklace thou didst break and scatter . From her heart 's best blood she gave it , and her heart still bleeds to think she is forgotten . " Then they began to tell the story of the old dame 's sacrifices , all the seventy times seven that she had made for the sake of the maiden , and Olga grieved as she listened , that she could have been so ungrateful . Then she brought the Prince to hear the story of the strange , strange flowers , and when he had heard , together they went to the lowly cottage and fetched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her days in ease and contentment . " See now , " she whispered to the Oak at parting , but sturdily he held his ground , persisting , " Thou wouldst have been forgotten , save for that miracle of bloom . " And still the flower we call BLEEDING-HEART blooms on by cottage walls and castle gardens , to waken all the world to grateful memories . And ever it doth bring to mind the lonely hearts that bleed because they are forgotten , and all they sacrificed for love 's sweet sake , to give us happiness. ***
