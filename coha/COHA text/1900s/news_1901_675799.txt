txt At Police Headquarters in Mulberry Street yesterday there was every indication that the revelations made regarding police protection of gamblers had had a decided effect . Commissioner Murphy arrived there from his Summer home at Far Rockaway at 9:30 o'clock , but Deputy Commissioner Devery was not seen all day . To every inquiry for information as to his movements the statement was made that he was in Saratoga on his vacation . Denials of complicity in the conspiracy on the part three of the Captains concerned were emphatically made . Commissioner Murphy expressed incredulity re , specting the whole story , but said that he would order an immediate investigation . Under his instructions Inspector Brooks said that he had begun an investigation , into the conduct of the telephone operator who had been on duty at the time of the alleged tips to poolrooms . Commissioner Murphy , immediately upon his arrival , was questioned upon the subject of Mr. Moss 's disclosures . He said that he had received no official communication , but had read the accounts in the morning newspapers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I get through my regular work I will commence an investigation of these charges . " " Have you been in communication with Deputy Commissioner Devery ? " was asked . " No , , ' replied the Commissioner . " As soon . as he comes here I will talk to him . " Will you call him up to your office ? " " Yes . I will , and we will start an investigation . " Will you investigate his conduct also ? " The Commissioner hesitated a moment , then replied : " You know newspaper reporters , when they do n't write shorthand , will make some mistakes . I used to be a compositor myself and know that mistakes can be easily made , and sentences made to read differently than they should . I think that you will find in a few days that these charges will be modified . " " Wo n't it be hard to get at the facts down stairs in the telegraph and telephone bureaus ? " " I suppose it will . I 've read Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think it is a shame that they could n't have thought of this scheme as Moss charges . " It seems to me rather peculiar that Deputy Commissioner Devery could have given the purported order . It is also queer that this order could have been sent out and over the telephone without all the men down stairs knowing about it . You know what human nature is . " " Will you hold Superintendent Brennan of the Telegraph and Telephone Bureau responsible for the matter if the charges are found true ? " - " I will hold every one responsible whom I find responsible . The District Attorney knew a month ago that I would aid him in every way possible and would act with him . I have just given four warrants to Inspector Cortright from the District Attorney , and he will act on them . " Commissioner Murphy , when asked if an outsider could call up a police station on matters not pertaining to police business said that the Captain would stop it . " Then the Captain decides what is police business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioner with ' a smile . " It is funny to me that . Captain who the papers say is the ne who talked over the telephone is the very one the papers united . in having me keep in his present precinct . " A little later the Commissioner made the announcement that he . had given Inspector Brooks orders to institute an investigation in the telegraph bureau . He said that the Inspector was taking sworn statements of the men in the bureau and that they would be forwarded to - the District Attorney . The Commissioner would then ask for a formal investigation and allow the District Attorney to decide what to do . Asked as to Deputy Commissioner Devery 's whereabouts , he said he was at Saratoga. on a short vacation . ' He left on the afternoon of Thursday , I believe , " he said , " and will stay there for some time , coming down every Wednesday to be here for the police trials . I only understand this , you know . " , " Do you think he will hasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see why he should for a few statements made in the morning newspapers . ' The Commissioner was then asked if he considered Mr. Moss 's statements untrue . " Do n't put such words as that in my mouth , " he answered . " I 'm having trouble enough as it is . " Asked concerning the alleged order for Whitney to telephone , he said that no such order would go out unless he gave it . When asked if the men in the telegraph bureau would not recognize an order from Deputy Commissioner Devery , he answered that they would not . BRENNAN MAKES NO DEFENSE . Head of the Police Telephone Bureau Silent While His Superiors Investigate the Charges . Superintendent Michael Brennan , when seen in his office , refused to discuss the alleged collusion on the part of the operators in the telegraph and telephone bureau in the conspiracy , saying that Commissioner Murphy had ordered an investigation , and he would therefore have nothing to say . He explained , however , the methods by which the bureau is conducted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement that no outsiders were allowed to use the police station telephones . Edward H. Murphy , the Assistant Superintendent , who has been away on a vacation , only returned to the city yesterday morning . Superintendent Brennan said that although great care was taken in calling uP a station at the request of a citizen , an apparently reputable person could talk to a Captain on any business . He said that the various societies were permitted to talk freely to Captains- . There is one general switchboard in the office- faced by six men . Each borough has a similar system , and various precincts have connection with one another . Thirteen clerks are employed in the office regularly , seven of whom are on duty from 8 A. M. to 6 P. M. and four ? from 6 P. M. to 12 midnight . Two men are on duty until 8 A. M. from midnight . According to Superintendent Brennan , about 2,000 messages come over the general switchboard each day . Of these some 300 or 400 are official messages , such as department orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all recorded . To the other messages , termed " conversational messages , " no special attention is paid and no record is kept of them . The duty of the operator , the Superintendent said , in case a citizen called up a Captain and wanted to talk to him , was to ? find out if everything was all right , and then make the connection . In the case of such a conversation as is alleged to have taken place with the Captain of the Oak Street Station , the operator would simply have made the connection as requested ' and paid no further attention to the conversation . Assistant Superintendent Murphy emphasized the fact that the operators were too busy to do much besides attend to their regular duties . Superintendent Brennan furnished the following list ? of the employes in - the Telegraph Department : Richard A , Battin , Patrick H. Devery , ' Morris J. Coughlin , Lawrauce Hynes . John J. Loneerman . John J. Mangin , John J. Allenbach , James Campbell , William A. Coleman , Dominic Henry , Francis C. Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( temporary . ) Of these men Hynes , Mangin , Coleman , Murphy , Dunne , and were on duty from 8 A. M. to 6 P. M. on Friday , or during the time of the alleged . telephoning on the part of Mr. Moss 's men . These men were called before Inspector Brooks to make sworn statements . Late yesterday afternoon Inspector Brooks said that he would be unable to finish his investigations until to-morrow morning , and would , therefore , make no statement until that time . ? To all questions put to him he answered : " I have nothing to say now . " DENIALS OF CAPTAINS . Capt . Vredenburgh Thought the Man Who Called by Telephone Was " Faking " ? Capt . Delaney 's Reply . Capt . Watson A. Vredenburgh , in charge of the Oak Street Station and accused of having held a conversation with the Parkhurst , agent over the telephone , immediate-ly thereafter notifying gamblers of a supposed impending raid , when asked what he had to lay yesterday replied : " Yes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person at the other end refusing to give his name , I thought he was ' faking , ' so I said , ' Well , if they have a warrant let them serve it . ' I thought nothing more about the matter until 11 o'clock last night , when I was informed that Mr. Moss had given out a statement about the incident . " All I can say is that not a soul knew what the message was , and for that reason no one from this station could possibly have ' tipped off ' the place . I did not even mention it to the Sergeant at the desk , and there was no one else around . If Mr. Moss ? will bring any one to swear that I ' tipped off ' De Lacey I will give him $1,000 . But I see that he does not say that . He only says it looks suspicious . I did not know that receiving a message over the telephone was suspicious or breaking the law . I did not think anything more about the message for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My officers went to the place every day , and there was no pool selling going on . There was nothing to ' tip off . ' " They say it is strange that Jerome can get evidence and the police can not . But the fact is they hold men on less evidence when it is offered by these raiders than they do in the case of police evidence . They brush aside police evidence against gambling places . " Why , I had three citizens who testified that they had placed bets in the Tiger saloon , but the Magistrate said ' No evidence . ' If Jerome had obtained the same evidence the men would have been held in $1,500 bail each . " My precinct is not perfect . It contains some of the lowest and most dangerous elements in our population . I am here with my men to preserve peace , and we do it . There are betting and bookmaking here and there , but there are no poolrooms , When we drive the poolsellers out they resort to the handbook . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saloon , then in a cigar store . So they dodge about , and when we can catch them we arrest them . " But to return to the subject . I can say emphatically that I did- not ' tip off ' any place . " Capt . John J. Delaney , who on Friday night expressed his surprise at the statements made by Mr. Moss , whom he said he had assisted a number of times in police work , and who denied the allegations made , said yesterday when seen at the East Thirty-fifth Street Station : " I have nothing to add to what I said last night in categorically denying the statement of Superintendent McClintock . What more is there to say ? " At the East Fifth Street Station it was said that Sergt. pchulum was out of the city .
