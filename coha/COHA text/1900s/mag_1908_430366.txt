@#  |p551  As we were walking home one night along the Alameda in Santiago , I suggested to the young English engineer , whom I had just met at dinner , that after his six months in the mines it must seem good to get back to town again . He agreed that it did , but added that after all there was n't much in Santiago for a man like him . He had been buried in a wilderness of snow and rocks , without even a Spanish newspaper to give him a whisper from the world , and he came down from the mountains with emotions not unlike those of a ravening wolf who suddenly finds himself approaching a well-nourished lambchop . And he heaved a great sigh and asked if I knew Buenos Aires . " Buenos Aires ! " he repeated , in that fond enthusiasm which overtakes men who have dined pleasantly and are walking home under the stars together , and as this seemed the proper time for that banality , I said that I supposed that it was the Paris of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , man ! There 's more life in a minute in Buenos Aires than ? why , you talk about Paris ? Buenos Aires is Paris given a kick and told to wake up , that 's what Buenos Aires is ! " He meant , I suppose , not that Buenos Aires is the second Latin city in the world ; not its schools and hospitals and well-kept streets , its convenient troller-lines and excellent newspapers ; not the wheat and cattle that pour thence from the Argentine pampa to help feed the European cities ? but that it supplied with particular effectiveness the needs of a voracious young Saxon who had been spending six hard months in the frozen Andes , trying to keep a lot of  |p552  Chilean rotos from drinking and knifing each other to death . He could see , I dare say , over the trees of that quiet Alameda , beyond the Andean wall which shut in our little Chilean world , the Jockey Club " Hippodrome " on a Sunday afternoon ; the " Corso " in the Avenida Sarmiento with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsetail helmets and cuirassier 's breast-plates of the mounted police shining in the afternoon sun ; the victorias and shimmering parasols flowing through the Recoleta , or the Calle Florida ablaze with lights ; the " Sportsman " at dinner time , crowded with men , with a band booming in the balcony , and on the wall biograph pictures of steeple-chasers and Oriental dancers ; theatres , the opera , possibly some such sailor 's paradise as that vast steelyblue barn of a Casino , with its art nouveau nymphs and sizzling arc lamps , where French chanteuses and Spanish ballerinas and German acrobats and tumblers and English music-hall performers follow one another in dizzy profusion , and a great mob smokes and shouts its comments in every language under the sun . It is -a thumping , cheerful sort of place , this Casino ? about what our Carnegie Music Hall might be if it were turned into a Folies-Bergere . The Five Broadway Girls appeared the night I was there . They wore blonde wigs , to show that they were " Ingles , " and sang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ever heard on sea or land . For an encore one of them threw on a black velvet princesse gown and while the others , aided by parasols and old-fashioned hoop-skirts , ( lanced a comic background , she paraded along the footlights ? " font valoir des lignes plutot appetisantes , " as the reporter of La Divette put it in his review that week , " Je vows dis que c'est a voir " ? and panted for an explanation of why it was that they called her a Gibson Girl . She did not make a very good Gibson Girl , but she looked well in her black dress , nevertheless , and the audience liked it exceedingly . And as she undulated along the footlights to their applause , it struck me that this ? to have one 's drawings sung about by a lady iu a blonde wig , sandwiched in between a Neapolitan cantante and a troupe of international wrestlers , thirty-four degrees south of the Equator before an audience that yelled its approval in three or four languages was what a mere North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have seen , beyond those snowy , silent Andes , the garish front of the " Royal , " which lies round the corner from the Casino and just across from the Opera , so that the ninas and their richly upholstered Mammas may wonder at its lithographs and watch the strange men drifting thither as their carriages wait in line . The orators tell you that South America is the future home of the Latin races , as North America will be the home of the Saxons . In such a place as the " Royal , " and in music halls like it on the East Coast , one feels as though the hard law of competition had already got in its work and driven hither all the spangled ladies who were unable to keep an engagement in Paris or Naples or Madrid , and whose only art is the ability to articulate a few songs and keep a bodice on while continually giving the impression that it is about to fall off . On the little stage of the " Royal " they follow one another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodice and stiff , spangle-encrusted skirt , and with the same wriggling of powdered shoulders and pressing of hands to the heart , rattle off French songs that all sound exactly alike . Chanteuses , diseuses , gommeuses excentriques they ambitiously call themselves , and if they can sing a few words in broken English or German , add an " internarioual " or " cosmopolita . " The audience smokes and stares , cynical , indifferent , scarcely taking the trouble to applaud , and as their foolish little turns are finished they resume their street clothes and return to the boxes that encircle the parquet , there to survey critically , occasionally even to applaud those who come after and now and then to smile at one another across the smoky horseshoe in their curious camaraderie . You will see them again on the French liner going north , in steamer chairs billed to Sao Paulo or Rio , veiled from the ocean sunshine with the solicitude of the real artiste and treated with much half-shy , half-jocular attention by the younger officers .

" triple extrait de chic et de chair , fleuri sur l'asphalte de la grande ville " ? are analyzed with intimate enthusiasm , and their goings and comings chronicled as solemnly as the movements of fleets and armies . Of course there are other things in Buenos Aires . There are , for instance , over a million busy people to a majority of whom , probably , all this means as little as Broadway , in its narrower sense , means to the greater part of New York . And there is the country itself , from which , more or less directly , these people live and of which it is the hub and heart , in a way that no North American city begins to be ; not impassible mountain ranges nor frosty plateau nor miasmic jungle , but level , fertile prairie like Kansas and Nebraska , webbed with railroads and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing country ? in a good year it sends as much to Europe as is sometimes sent from the United States ? and its vast pampa and a climate which , although temperate , provides " green " feed all the year round , make it one of our strong rivals in supplying meat to Europe . Some one hundred and fifty million bushels of wheat were raised on these plains last year . To Europe from the pampa estancias in 1906 went nearly 3,000,000 sheep and over 2,000,000 quarters of beef , in the form of frozen or chilled meat , in addition to some seven thousand tons of " jerked " beef , and some forty thousand sheep and cattle shipped on the hoof . And practically all of the resulting commerce flows to and from the Buenos Aires docks . They are trim , these docks , masonry basins strung with electric cranes as thick as shade trees on a street . Well over a thousand oversea steamships and some three hundred oversea sailing vessels ? thirteen thousand altogether , counting in the coasters ? arrive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their far vaster commerce , give such a picture of the vivid bustle and infinite whispering of the sea . For at home , as you ride down West Street , for instance , all you see is a big bow now and then heaving up above  |p554  the dock-shed and each looks much like another , whether the ship be of seven or twenty thousand tons . But here they stretch out in all their broadside length , with no sheds set between , funnel behind funnel , white bridge towering behind white bridge , as far as one can see , as though very kindly arranged by some municipal Mr. Brangwyn . And one walks along this wonderful street of nations , looking into holds and cabins and forecastle ports as into so many shop windows . Here are Royal Mails from England ? the aristocrats of these seas , which swim up and down across the tropics with music and folks dressing for dinner ; the big German " Cap " boats ? " Cap Ortegal , " " Cap Frio " and the rest ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aperatifs and opera companies and automobiles , and steerages packed with immigrants from Genoa and Marseilles and Barcelona and Bordeaux . One moment the electric cranes are swinging overhead steel bridges in bolted sections out of a Newcastle freighter and you listen to Cockney and Scotch , the next you step plump onto a little island , magically detached from Italy or Spain , or into the smell of Brazilian coffee just from Santos , or of a river boat full of oranges just come down the Parana from Paraguay . These oranges are from the very trees , like enough , which the Dictator Lopez made his people plant when they were fighting the combined armies of Brazil and Uruguay and Argentina . They fought as though they were defending the sacredest principle on earth instead of merely laying down their lives for a gifted young man who had a European education , a French mistress and the idea that he was another Napoleon . For five years they fought until it was almost literally true that there were no men left in Paraguay and nothing in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these to keep their children alive and it was they and the orange trees which saved Paraguay and put it on its feet . At the granaries , taking in cattle or beef , are ships with such names as " Highland Laddie , " " Beacon Grange , " " Tremaine , " and " W istow Hall " ? you can fairly hear their winch engines singing- " The West II ind called : In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly , That bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred peo- pie die . " Here 's " Admiral Gallendraza de Lamouraix , " stout " Baron Bergen " of Antwerp , " Jose Gallart " of Barcelona with the Spanish arms on his funnel and dying the yellow and red of Spain ? ships and flags from all the seven seas , indeed , except from home . There are , as I said , many other things . There are suburbs , where , of a Sunday morning , with bells ringing from the little ivy-covered English church and the little girls tripping to Sunday-school in their dress-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . It seems a long way to Arequipa and La Paz and the mouldering old cathedrals of Peru . One may go out to Hurlingham , and , surrounded by English-speaking people , play tennis and golf and polo , even follow the hounds ; or up to Tigre , on the river , and sail or paddle or watch an eightoared crew . There is a very superior Zoo . A baby elephant was there when I was in Buenos Aires , and as he ryas the first elephant who could claim to be an Argentine , he was very important indeed . His growth and behavior were commented on at length in the newspapers and every sunny afternoon you might see the Hindoo temple and little park in which he and his parents lived , surrounded by critical loungers and children and nurses , with the caps and long veils which , after the French fashion , the polite crianderas wear . As far as the merely material things of a modern city go , Buenos Aires gathers to itself all the South American superlatives . Lima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeiro , with all its beauty , a city of the tropics with all that implies of drowsiness and lethargy . Many of those hundredand-one little marks of the great city it has ? hurrying crowds , sophisticated , uncurious , each unit knowing its own place and moving in its orbit ; tired little milliners ' maids with their hatboxes , quiet regions of wealth , where , occasionally , from mysterious interiors , pale men-servants in livery emerge at the servants ' entrance to blink moodily at the bright sunshine . There are downtown restaurants with chops and steaks in the windows , and beginning actually to have the time-worn , comfortable look of coats worn to their wearers ' shapes and the smell of chop-houses at home . Even the motormen look worried .  |p556  has kept Lima a city of old Spain , set down in a temperate climate and allowed to build a city to suit themselves . The city of Good Airs was founded nearly four centuries ago , but the Buenos Aires of to-day is as new as Chicago . Here , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lamps , trees , newspaper kiosks ? " Le Rire " hanging beside the " Caras v Caretas " ? but where are the boulevardiers ? Here is the musical old tongue of Spain , but the barred windows and fortressed walls and musty cathedrals are long since overgrown and forgotten in a jumble of French facades and art nouveau . Every great city has , however , above these common phenomena , a certain overtone , generally caught by outsiders , although inaudible to its own . And the Buenos Aires that one hears about in other corners of the world , from the man one meets in the steamship smoking-room , the young naval officer who touched there on his first foreign cruise , is always this town of strident pleasure , this Paris d'un coup d pied . It may not connote a very profound nor appreciative observation , but it is quite true , as far as it goes , to that general individuality which differentiates the metropolis from other South American capitals . For here is what might be were a million mixed Latins lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure and display , freed from the intangible dusty weights of an ancient civilization , from the languors of tropical Rio , from the isolation which Of the six million people which Argentina is estimated to contain , probably half were foreign born . Society , in the narrower sense , is limited to some Sixty Families , but there is no such aristocracy of blood as there is in Spanish Peru , no such approxi-@#  |p557  mation to a national literature and music as in Portuguese Brazil . People came to Argentina to make money and they made it , and having done that they flock to the capital to spend it as pleasantly as they can . The typical Bonarense ? whom one 's Argentine friends may , of course , not resemble , any more than all North Americans look like Uncle Sam ? has the air and tastes of the new-rich . He is great on lacquered boots and high collars and the upturned black moustache ? or , by the same token , highly finished complexions and coiffeures ? and a droll sort of pompous ennui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rastoquero . " It was a Parisian , indeed , who coined the word " rastopolis " to suggest to his friends at home his first impressions of Buenos Aires . There is something almost hypnotic in the effect on the Bonarenses of such words as gran , lujo , iwnenso . The races are always that gran reunion sportiva , every bride of a well-known family is one of nuestras bellezas mas renombradas ; when you go to a party you enter al inmenso hall and climb la gran escalera and your hostess is certain to be one of our luiosas senoras . And yet , in spite of all the solemn affectation and ambitious glitter , you never quite miss the feeling of the great , open , wholesome pampa just beyond the city roofs . On your way from the bank to the steamship office , only a step from the stock exchange , you walk through Tattersall 's , between rows of Durhams and Herefords , with pedigrees and prizes hanging on the doors of their pens , and Cockney grooms rubbing them down and hissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk , unless safely boiled , is almost unknown ; here , tiled dairy lunches are  |p558  scattered all over town and people drop in for the little caramel slabs of thrice de 1a-he , just as they spend pennies for slot-machine chocolate at home . There is always good roast beef and steaks , good cream and butter , and the pampa partridges are as cheap as our ordinary chicken . In the busy street with its pastry shops and peluquerias you can almost seem to smell the wind blowing in from the open range ; beyond the smoke and glare of the music hall , freshening and transmuting it , lies always the vision of the pampa , endlessly rich , moist , fertile , immeasurable . And all these lacquered papas and richly upholstered mammas become rather wholesome farmers . or shop-keepers , who have made a quick clean-up of it and are now having their holiday . At their best , they are really quite splendid , at the worst theirs is an amusing and rather exhilarating vulgarity . Nothing so well gathers up and visualizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " Corso , " the Avenida Sarmiento afterward on a bright Sunday afternoon . It is in character that the Jockey Club should be the most widely known social organization of Buenos Aires . The exclusive club is , of course , the " Circulo de Armas , " or " Circulo , " as it is generally called . Only native Argentinians may belong to it and there , to-day , is effected the political manoeuvre of which you read in the papers next week or next month . The Jockey Club , however , is where the stranger is put up , its marble entrance stair and statue of Diana , its luxurious baths and fencing rooms are town show-places , and when Mr. Root came , for instance , it was the Jockey Club and not a club with a commercial or political name which naturally prepared to give the great ball . Its race track , or " Hipodromo , " is in Palermo , at the end of the city 's politest avenue , and thither the city 's torrent pours on a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by much the same collective enthusiasm , with which a purely Spanish population pours toward the bull fight . " . . . From an early hour the Avenida Alvear presented a more than ever animated overture to that great spectacle which unrolled itself in the Hipodromo . In the brilliant sun of an afternoon , golden and gentle , a torrent of vehicles , interminable , rumbling , discharged themselves into the course , covering the Avenue and all its length with movement , reflections and noise . A dull , incessant rumbling broken only by the crack of whips and the hoarse and nervous snorting of automobiles , ravenously pushing their impertinent snouts in between the multitude , of carriages ? vibrated for hours under a cloud of dust raised and spread by the steady stream of vehicles which , fighting for their places , arrived and spread out in kaleidoscopic movement , full of vibrations and prismatic reflections " ? thus the gifted cronista of " El Diario , " in a rolling Castilian which these jerky words can but faintly suggest , the day Mr. Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the turn where the Avenida Alvear curves into the Recoleta , until the lancers and cuirassiers came galloping down the asphalt clearing the way . They poured by at a quick trot ? innumerable young men , one hand on the cane , one twirling upward the eternal black moustache ; lacquered victorias with silver bells on the tongues and Marcelled ladies under shimmering parasols , fighting the way with rickety old hired hacks bearing tourists or on-shore sailors ; many smug family chariots ? Papa and Mamma , overdressed and rather pudgy , with expressionless faces ; facing them , riding backwards , the two little girls , sitting very straight , like expensive dolls , their little legs , bare above halfstockings , doubled under the seat as stiff as any coachman 's . . . . All Buenos Aires poured toward the Hipodromo . Above this swift and restless caravan the spirit of the fiesta floated and laughed in an atmosphere gilded by the autumnal sun . It was a lavish spectacle of contentment , of spirits absorbed for the moment in the coming sport ? regulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " sure-thing " safely tucked away in their pocket . Dreamers of fortune , these , lulled by the music of the trot . And out of the vague intonation of all this multitude there came , here and there , like a breath of fresh air , the glimpses fluttering , elegant , of luxurious carriages carrying radiantly dressed ladies , the luminous note of undulating ribbons and plumes standing out like a spring-like , feminine bouquet against the black mass of those absorbed by the passion of sport . . . . " @#  |p559  grotesquely of a bloodhound , with his domeshaped head and drooping melancholy eves . Beautiful they often were at the same time , and infinitely sad ? even the little girls with their quaintly barbarous tiny diamond earrings and the little boys in patent-leather sailor hats ? until the black they wore seemed naturally to belong to them , as if , in all this new-rich riot , they wandered lonely , sorrowing for the forgotten days of Spain . More often , however , it was but a procession of expensive human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian orange-women fallen into a fortune , crowding four lines deep , in a sort of splendid lacquered chaos . And the young engineer in from the " bush " and the steamship 's under officers fresh from sea , roaming hungrily about in their hired victorias , During the races this army of carriages was lined up along the curb facing the middle of the street , for blocks , with mounted police at intervals like cavalry officers . The instant the races were over this stiff line kaleidoscoped again and everybody pelted away toward the Avenida Sarmiento , there to file round and round between the palms and indulge that passion for staring which is one of the common heritages of city crowds . At rare intervals in this " Corso " passed a group that might have been lifted out of Lima , one of those families ? in black generally ? whose faces were fashioned after the same fine patrician model , with marvellously white skin , vivid black hair and great dark eves with eyebrows that might have been pencilled by a Japanese . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in , too , and tell you afterward ? and I imagine with truth ? that there is nothing quite like it in the world . Before Buenos Aires covered as much ground as it does to-day , the Calle Florida , now the polite downtown shopping street , was the scene of the carriage parade , and , with characteristic conservatism ? as if in New York , carriages should go down from Central Park at twilight and file solemnly through Twenty-third Street ? the " Corso " really ends by crowding through this business street . It is only wide enough for two rows of carriages , one going down and one up , so close together that the occupants might almost shake hands with one another or with the spectators on the sidewalk , and when festooned from end to end with lights , as it was when Mr. Root was there , it glares and sparkles like a ball-room . And in this relentless glare , from the lights overhead , from milliners ' and patisserie windows , the strange procession of faces flows jerkily by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their broughams , tourists and on-shore sailors , quiet , oblivious mothers with their children , the chanteuses from the music halls lolling back in their victorias and lavishing smiles . The young men smile back , with cynical good humor , twirling their black moustachios the while , and the line flows on past the Grand Hotel , the Jockv Club , past the " Sportsman " and into the Avenida again , round and round , till dinner time comes , and it melts away . This witching hour having arrived , what vague premonitory rays of the evening 's possibilities begin to flash up from behind the imminent horizon of food ? Imagine yourself stepping to the newspaper kiosk at the corner of Florida and the Avenida and there running an eye down the column of theatre announcements ? in this " El Diario " of August 17 , for instance , in the closing days of the Buenos Aires season . First of all , of course , is the opera , which means , socially , just what it does at home , except that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in the south equatorial winter ? that is to say , in July and August . German music is not much enjoyed , but all the familiar Italian and French operas are given and the Italian companies generally contain at least a few thrifty singers who are to be heard at the Metropolitan a few months later on . The house is not so large as that vast and gloomy auditorium and the spectacle not so much " grand " as it is pretty ? linda and preciasa , as the South Americans say . Everything , even to the scene-shifters , in their white stockings and powdered wigs , seems arranged to make a neat and well-ordered picture . The two lower tiers of boxes which enclose the parquet in the continental fashion , leaving no place for " standees , " are adorned by members of the Families . The third tier is one black-and-white horseshoe of men ; the fourth , women , most of whom are in street dress , and in the balcony above are herded the encore fiends , hissers and general trouble-makers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more open than those in the Metropolitan and the ladies who ? perhaps because of the Spanish habit of leaving social gayeties to the unmarried ? seem younger than our veteran houris , sit close together facing the rail , much as though they were in the front row of the balcony . Everyone seems to be intimately acquainted with everyone else , the red and gold of the walls mellows and enriches this vivacious horseshoe like the crimson hangings of a portrait gallery , and there is about the whole something at once brilliant and all-in-the-family which is charming to see . After the opera season is over , and often even during it , less ambitious opera may be heard at various theatres in town . The " San Martin , " for instance , announces the opening to-morrow evening of its season of French opera-comique ; in another fortnight , the spring " grand " opera season begins at the Teatro Marconi ? an Italian company and a repertoire of thirty operas ? while even the Opera itself is presently to be turned over to a George Edwardes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , too , on Sunday evening next , the Italian actress , Tina di Lorenzo , begins her Buenos Aires engagement with " Magda . " To-night , at the Odeon ? a theatre filling about the same position as our New Lyceum ? Mme. Suzanne Despres , with Mme. LarparcerieRichepin and a Paris company play " Denise ; " at the Politeama Argentino ? a sort of Hammerstein 's ? Fregoli , the lightningchange man , gives his farewell performance ; at the " Teatro Nacional , " Senor Podesta 's Argentine company presents several one-act Argentine plays ? and so on  |p562  down a variegated list including Italian farce , Spanish zarzuelas , a boy musicalprodigy at Prince George 's Hall , and even a polite indoor circus at the Coliseo Argentino of Mr. Frank Brown . A great fuss is being made , you will observe , over the coming visit of Otero ? direct from Paris , with M. Jacquinet , the famous mimic , and a company picked from the Gvmnase , Vaudeville , Athenee and Capucine . This interesting lady had just sailed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill-boards , in gigantic handwriting , was scrawled the impressive sentence : " .1-e suis parti avec ma corpagnie ? Otero . " When her ship touched at Teneriffe this was changed to " j'arriverai le vingt-trois ? Otero , " and when she reached M-Iontivideo , a night 's journey from the metropolis , all the blank walls and bill-boards bore , above her signature , the single orphic word " Demainl " I had to leave Buenos Aires before the first performance , but I was told afterward ? as a proof of the sophistication of the Bonarenses ? that in spite of her inspired press-agent and a rather sparkling past , La bella Otero 's visit , as far as the general public was concerned , fell quite flat . It is , indeed , not a public altogether easy to please . It finds , of course , much amusement in zarzuelas and Latin farce which would bore a North American audience , and it is satisfied with things which those accustomed to the elaborate finish and attention to detail which characterize New York and London " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acting , would find crude and slovenly . There are the same general differences here that there are , for instance , between the " Merchant of Venice " put on by Mr. Southern and that acted by Novelli . But they have a critical instinct common to Latins , the great Continental artists ? Bernhardt , Coquelin , Relane , Novelli and the like ? are as likely to visit the Argentine as the States , and many who do not come here at all , but are of the first , or all but the first , rank in their own  |p563  country ? like Mme. Despres , for instance , or Tina di Lorenzo , visit Buenos Aires regularly and present there European successes long before they are heard of here . Thus Mme. Despres , who was appearing in the Sardou plays and a French translation of " A Doll 's House , " aroused the greatest interest with some of the plays of Henry Bernstein , none of whose work has vet been seen in this country , in spite of its great success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffened and sharpened by a modern tendency toward realism and the scientific point of view . It shows in literary criticism as well as in political editorials and it prevents the hasty swallowing of a piece of work merely because it happens to be finely finished . " When " ? to quote a typical comment which I ran across in the " Nacion " one day ? " the national scene has become fixed and definite ? and all nations have such scenes ? the time has come to write a work really national and characteristic ?  |p564  one that will live . On the other hand , when the author busies himself in constructing artificial decorations , fanciful and false , whose unreality no one can explain , it is impossible to build anything solid and durable . You will have precious miniatures , painstaking engravings which will delight the quintessential taste of dilittantes , but never those great pieces of work which compel universal admiration .

" Chacabuco " was the decisive battle in which San Martin did for independence in the South what Bolivar did in the North . It was not a very good play , but no worse than our own military dramas , and by changing Chacabuco to Lexington and the Andes to New England farms , it could , I dare say , be transferred to Broadway with average success . The curtain rose on an Andean camp , the snowy Cordilleras in the background , to the right , soldiers sitting round a fire , to the left women working over clothing and bandages and a militant priest hammering on an anvil .

It was not a Belasco sun , but a tolerable one for all that , and there were clouds , too , breaking  |p565  away one after another , and even a tiny marching army silhouetted against them and moving across the horizon like a child 's train of cars . The piece was such a straight appeal to gallery patriotism that the LatinAmerican of our popular misconception would have swallowed it with unthinking avidity , yet it was not so received either by the audience or the critics next day .

It would be very hard to tell the story , following all the threads from the first to the fourth act , because the anecdote , the basis of any dramatic work , has been sacrificed to the exigencies of a brilliant raise en scene . As an historical drama , indeed , it does n't exist , and the solemn matron of history has only lent a few trifles of her household furniture which are juggled into those polychromatic " effects " which satisfy the easy public . . . .

" There are about six million people in Argentina to-day , and well over a million of these ? far too large a number for a city which does little manufacturing and for a country whose chief business is raising cattle and wheat ? are herded in the capital . Of these portenos ? the name by which the inhabitants of Buenos Aires have been known since the days when Argentina was a loose confederation and the inland states were continually combating the pretensions of the " people of the gate " ? nearly onehalf are foreign born .

Of the rest , Austria , Germany and Great Britain each sent between thirty and forty thousand , there were some twenty-six thousand Swiss , 20,000 Belgians and some 127,000 altogether from other corners of the world . There is practically no aboriginal race left in Argentina , and there are almost no negroes ? nothing to correspond to that inert Indian and cliollo mass which forms the bulk of such populations as Bolivia 's and Peru 's , nor to the mulattos and mestizos which so far outnumber the whites of Brazil .

English capital has always been heavily invested in Argentina ? it was the depreciation of Argentine currency following a lavish issue of incontrovertible notes in 1890 which sent Baring Brothers into liquidation ? and to-day the railroads which web the pampa and carry one across the continent to Chile are mostly in British hands . The greater proportion of British colonists live in or near Buenos Aires ? at Hurlingham , for instance , or Belgrano , whence you can see them hurrying into their offices of a morning just as commuters do at home . They have two newspapers , the Standard and Herald ; and the Phoenix Hotel , where some live and the newcomers tarry while getting their bearings , is almost as much a boxed-up fragment of the British Isle as the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at La Guayra . It is worth while , after such a day as I have suggested at the races and theatres , to step down the Calle San Martin the next morning before one 's desayuno enthusiasm has evaporated into the Phoenix lounging room , just to see the British faces and hear the talk , and ? figuratively glancing over the shoulder of some . ruddy old gentleman buried in his morning 's Herald or Slandard ? catch a few reflections from the life of this little transplanted world . They 're reading the home news , of course , for one thing ? " the anxiety felt over Mr. Joseph Chamberlain 's continued indisposition , " specially cabled and double-leaded ; Cambridge 's victory in the University match at Lord 's , the Newmarket Meeting , and Dinnerford 's easy win of the Princess of Wales 's Stakes ; the Henley Regatta ? if the Grand Challenge Cup had to be won by a foreign crew , toward no one would less grudge be felt than toward the Belgians . They 're always raced in the English sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for sport , however , there 's plenty here at home . Sixteen foot-ball matches were played off yesterday ? Belgrano won from Quilines , 2 goals to o ? " a fast game all through , but science conspicuous by its absence . " Alumni beat Belgrano Extra 2 to r in the second round of the cup-tie competition , Estudiantes won from Barracas at Palermo , the feature of the game being the really remarkable goal-keeping of Coe , who went back from forward on account of his had toe . The Captain 's team won from the Secretary 's in the golf match at Lomas ? " The links in tip-top condition and weather fine . " There was racing , both at Hurlingham and Palermo ? a huge crowd at the latter place to see the first of the threeyear-old classics . Sport on the whole fairly good , though " backers ' barkers had a bad time of it . " Segura won from start to finish in grand style and " though the stable connection had n't let her run loose ? as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on Geisha , who ran creditably , but far from brilliantly , and was palpably on the fine side . " Mr. Monsch avers , in the advertising columns , that his is " the only real English restaurant in town , " and he offers as special dishes for this day , Monday , " Roast pork with apple-sauce , boiled leg of mutton with caper sauce and steak and kidney pudding . " Miss Muriel Francis , Typist ? can she be really real ? awaits work at her office , 65 Congallo . The English Book-exchange offers Winston Churchill 's " Coniston " ? the subtle bookseller evidently hoping that many will think this is our Winston ? and Mr. Upton Sinclair 's " Jungle " ? the last word , it seems , since Zola 's " J'Accuse . " Ploughs and disc cultivators , white Wyandottes and Scotch collie pups are recommended and honest Messrs . Coghill and Sidebottom offer ten beautiful Shorthorn bulls , just imported , and three magnificent Suffolk stallions , to which ? conveniently arranged for Spanish readers ? Mr. David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the " reputadas cabanas inglesas de Marquis de Londonderry . " There have been amateur theatricals at Belgrano . All excellent , of course , but Mr. Bookhouse , " as the frog-eater in that exquisitely funny farce , Ici on parle francais , ' was particularly immense . " The Belgrano Ladies ' Mandolin Club thank those who so kindly assisted in the children 's dance and play held on Friday last , but beg to remind the editor that he neglected to mention that " figuring on the stage with becoming prominence were the allegorical personages ? Britannia , John Bull and Uncle Sam . " Mr. J. Mc Gavin Greig sailed yesterday for England on a combined business and pleasure trip . He will be greatly missed by his Belgrano Rugby friends . The daily letter from Montevideo , a night 's journey across the mouth of the great Plata , brings the news that the golfing weather has been wretched . The " first function given by the entertainment society at Victoria Hall was , however , a great success and listened to by a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. H. G. Morton sang " 0 Promise Me " and Mr. Percy Permain of " yours " ? so they speak of each other 's bank of that mighty river ? " certainly a side-splitting comic vocalist of considerable talent , proved a tower of strength and was recalled half a dozen times or more for each song . " Nothing in Buenos Aires interested me so much as its newspapers , and certainly in few things can it face comparison more confidently . Just what the " 189 daily and peri-  |p567  odical newspapers " may be of which the statisticians tell ? " 157 edited in Spanish , 14 in Italian , 2 in French , 6 in English and 8 in German " ? I can not say . The ones you pick up from the newsstand , in addition to the two little sheets already mentioned , which are only valuable for their gossip of the English colony , are La Prensa , La Nacion and El Diario , and possibly El Pais or La Razon . Of these La Prensa is the one best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast or a war on the other side of the world or big news in town , La Prensa 's whistle blows and all the town within earshot knows that something has happened . If you are an Antarctic explorer , a famous scientist , or some other semi-public personage , La Prensa may invite you to occupy during your stay the luxurious apartments provided in its building for such distinguished guests . If you are too poor to employ a doctor you can go to La Prensa 's dispensary . You may take English lessons in its language department or use its library free of expense and if properly acquainted be invited to its concerts and lectures . Like its lesser rival of the West Coast , El Mercurio of Valparaiso and Santiago , La Prensa is the property of a rich family , , which takes as much trouble to maintain the paper 's prestige as it might to develop a new orchid . Its office building , situated on the Avenida de Mayo , only a stone 's throw away from the Calle Florida is fitted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grill-room , the proprietor his private living apartments ? which he @# never uses ? and the presses and all the rest of the equipment follow the latest European and North American ideas . It prints cable news from all over the world and fourteen large pages , the first three of which are want advertisements set in microscopic type . The amount of advertising of this sort reminds one of the New York Herald , whose position , indeed , it rather duplicates among the papers of Buenos Aires . It is the one of which foreigners have always heard , just as the New York Herald is generally the only North American paper which South Americans know about . It is more entertainingly written and far more important editorially than our Herald , however , and although it has less political weight than La Nacion ? which might be compared to the Times ? and is less clever and witty than  |p568  El Diario ? it is the paper most generally read by the man in the street . El Diario is the Buenos Aires Sun . When Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received like a visiting monarch . Editorials headed " Homenaje " acclaimed El ideal Americana . " There were pages of pictures of himself and his family , even those quaint apocryphal anecdotes generally found only in obituaries , and on the fences and blank walls a proclamation exhorted the citizens of Montevideo " to embody in the most solemn and eloquent manner possible , their part of the tribute of homage to the eminent statesman " and " to strike a lofty note of urbanity , " which , it was hoped , would " constitute an expressive demonstration of culture . " When Mr. Root came to the capital of the Argentine there were just as many pictures in the papers , just as much bunting and hundreds of times as many electric lights ; but besides the cruiser that accompanied him , he was met by excursion steamers and a launch full of the Argentine alumni of American colleges , wrapped in oilskins like undergraduates at New London and waving college banners ; the humorous journals published cartoons showing President Roosevelt waving Mr. Root about as his literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of practical good which might be done with the money about to be spent for his entertainment , and some of the papers published polite , but extremely sarcastic editorials , pointing out the decline in the influence of old-fashioned diplomacy and of ambassadors of the old school . " Mr. Root , said El Diario that very afternoon while he was being whirled about town in a cloud of galloping lancers and cuirassiers , " will not search for the basis of his judgment in the . . . honors , exaggerated or not , which our Government bestows upon him . . . . A politician as eminent and as keen as he knows very well that these international alliances are formed solely under the pressure of the needs of commerce and by the stimulus of selfish interests . If he will consult our statistics he will perceive that it is with the European nations that we maintain an interchange of products , the United States being our strong rival . Our cereals and our beef , our hides and wool , have no place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these same articles . . . . Let us receive most kindly , then , our illustrious guest . But if we resist certain tendencies of the Pan-American Congress , and President Roosevelt and his illustrious Minister , let him understand that we do so inspired only by the purest patriotism and the highest interests of our country .. . . Statesmen can no longer shut up in a box , so to speak , the collective thought and interest of a nation ... . Modern means of communication often give greater efficiency to an experienced and practical commercial agent than to a polished ambassador , master of all the arts of Metternich . . . . Let us be sincere ; let us be of our own time ; let us make a diplomacy of real interests , living real life with open lungs . " In these Buenos Aires papers , the Spanish virtuosity in " slinging " words is restrained and sharpened by hard-headed editors and that keener critical sense which charges the atmosphere of a modern sophisticated city . They keep the color and charm without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Diario is the cleverest and most entertaining . It was anti-American during Mr. Root 's stay , carrying out this policy in its news stories as well as editorials , and by filling them full of realistic color and humor , yet never missing a chance to poke fun skilfully at minor details ? the medals some of the reception committee had scraped together , the wonderful hat , " dernier cri , " worn by one of them , the tremendous solemnity assumed by everyone ? it contrived , while being uniformly polite , to throw a light veil of ridicule over the whole proceeding . The New York Sun could not have done it better if conditions had been reversed and it had put all its star reporters on the job . If the Honorable Elihu Root took the trouble to carry a bundle of Buenos Aires papers with him , his dry and quiet humor must have received considerable agreeable stimulant during the Charlestown 's long journey through the Straits . Midway between the news stories and the serious editorials of our papers are the cronicas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly good . In these crozicas , half description and half comment , they can expend that sensibility of which they have so much , and the way they do squander it , is , to the tongue-tied  |p569  Saxon , perennially astonishing . Day after day this " flub-dub " ? to borrow the slang of Park Row ? which our reporters would spend hours of midnight oil upon and probably try to sell to a magazine ? appears , necessarily dashed off at the reporter 's unthinking speed , yet finished " literary , " full of atmosphere and feeling . From such a cronica , the description of the crowd going to the races was quoted . The same reporter 's fine Italian hand , if one is not mistaken , is shown in this Agua Bendita Sin Bendiciones , " ( Holy Water That Gets No Benediction ) , which appeared one afternoon during the week of insistent mists and rain that preceded Mr. Root 's arrival . " Insistente , fastidiosa , casi im placable " ? the slow , clinging rhythm of the words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it seemed as though the breath of the pampa itself was drifting through the lighted streets and one could almost smell the infinite stretches of grass , saturated , blanketed in mists , dripping with rain ? " Insistente , fastidiosa , casi implacable , la lluvia envuelve hate dias la cuidad en la tristeza de su melopea gris " . . . The whole Argentine , it appears , was enveloped in rain . It had lasted days , was likely to last some days to come . " Maldito tiempo ! ' exclaims the city , wet , ill-humored , spattered with mud . .. " Imperceptibly , almost , this purely literary introduction drifts into a practical consideration of the good such a rain will do an agricultural and stock-raising country and ends with the suggestion that if the President should write to the farmers , congratulating them on the temporal , it would be much more sensible and appropriate than most presidential messages . Here in La Nacion is a similar contribution , entitled " La Came es Flaca " ( Meat is Lean ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets during the illumination the night before . " We felt , " he observes , " a certain intimate satisfaction in beholding ' such a fiesta , which seemed to bring nearer to realization that which we have desired for so long , that Buenos Aires should be a great city , not only in population " La carne es flaca . . . " This phrase was made more interesting by being pronounced by a handsome woman in the full vigor of life ? la femme de trente ans de Balzac ' ? who was talking to her companion in front of a shop window , whither they had been swept by the crowd . " And dear ! ' exclaimed her companion . Several people turned to listen , smiling sympathetically , but the two women , absorbed in their own ideas , went on as though no listeners were there . " ' The kilo which cost forty centavos yesterday , I paid fifty for to-day and they say it 's going up still further . ' " My butcher tells me the same thing . Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires ! ' " Which does n't prevent their spending hundreds of thousands on useless things ? at least superfluous ones . " " In the middle of that kaleidoscopic multitude , apparently care-free and satisfied with the present moment , amused and animated by the spectacle , this conversation had a unique interest . No stage manager could put on the theatre stage a piece so saliently true to life , so full of psychological suggestion , and effective because of its very simplicity . For no one could convey to the stage the impression produced by this sudden appearance of household cares in the very midst of the fiesta , in that whirlwind of artificial life . . . " Moralizing on the lesson which certain types of politicians might learn from these women ? who showed how even a thing apparently as simple as housekeeping required constant thought , not to be cast aside even in holiday moments ? our cronista drifts into a consideration of the cost of living in Buenos Aires , the effect of recent strikes and boycotts and the sad phenomenon that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prices of necessities are constantly increasing . On this problem , " he concludes , " the luminous torrents of the streets shed no light . " Nor did it seem likely that the echo of such conversations would ever reach the municipality . And , after despairing somewhat over the fatuity of past legislation , he wishes that a new municipal regime might be established " into whose deliberations might enter two or three administrators like those whom he had listened to the night before in the Calle Florida . " For life in the Argentine capital is not all lights and amusement and rather strident pleasure , and I should convey a wrong im/ pression if , in accenting somewhat the note which differentiates it most obviously from other South American capitals , I should make it seem so . It has none of Lima 's charm of antiquity , none of the land-andwater beauties of Rio but it has something else , made up of graceful compactness and finish , of vigor , sophistication and comfort . There are people who attract , not because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are extremely alive . Cities sometimes do the same . Things are done well in the City of Good Airs . There are good things to eat , comfortable rooms to live in , places where a man can get his exercise and outdoor sport . After the tropics , the gringo feels like a man who has been hopping from foothold to foothold in a swamp and steps at last on solid ground . The creature comforts of a capable , wide-awake , well-arranged city soothingly envelope him . The cochero knows where he wants to go , the waiter knows what he wants to eat . The mounted policeman , in breastplate and horse-tail helmet , rides him back with the rest of the crowd and does it so quietly and with such sophisticated nonchalance that he promptly conceives a passionate admiration for that policeman and his beautiful horse , falls into the communistic pride common to all city dwellers , and is ready to declare that there is no other policeman so fine in the world . The streets are clean and well kept and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are held within decorous maximum and minimum limits of height . Everything is near at hand . The hotel , club , bank , drive , the restaurants and theatres are all within , so to say , feeling distance . And this physical compactness and neatness , this continental glitter and activity , set here , oasis-like , combine to give the whole a certain diminutiveness and cozy intimacy . There 's a " little old Buenos Aires , " too . Italians , Spaniards , French , Argentines , what you will ? here they are , really living out what so many other Latin Americans dream . " Some day " ? so soliloquizes the man across the table , as you sit on a restaurant balcony looking out at the blue Caribbean , or watching the droll pereza moving an inch a minute along a tree trunk or the lazy mestizos drowsing in the sun ? " Some day , somebody 'll step in here and bring these fellows up standing and teach them how to live . They ca n't govern themselves and somebody else must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " At other places and times you hear orators telling what the future will bring ; how this continent is the preordained home of the Latin race , which will pour down from crowded Europe to a new-world reincarnation . Well here it is ? and this is the significantly interesting thing about Buenos Aires ? this prophecy fulfilled . No one has stepped in ? rather all the world has ? not as conquerors , but following the same laws which have brought Italians over to dig our ditches and Scandinavians to our Northwestern wheat-fields . And here is a city , as Latin as Naples or Barcelona , all worked out and swinging along , strong , self-sufficient , and very much alive ? the hint of what all Latin America may some day be . @#
