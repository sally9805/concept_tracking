txt That " the people of the cities are governed much more than the people of the State generally " was the maxim employed by Justice FLEMING of the Court of Special Sessions in fining at Jamaica on Tuesday six " speeding " automobilists $20 each , and two more $25 apiece . The imposition of these fines was contrary to Justice TRUAX 'S decision last week that the city ordinance specifying a maximum fine of $1.0 " superseded " the State Motor Vehicle law , which sets a higher limit . It is Justice Futmixo 's opinion that the ordinance and the law are separately operative , and that automobilists exceeding the speed limit are , therefore , liable to two prosecutions and the exaction of two penalties for the same offense . In this opinion Justice FLEMING had the sanction of his associates , Justices - PORKER and WILRINS , and the general support of COOLEY 'S " Constitutional Limitations , " which says : " The same act may constitute an offense against the State and the municipal corporation , and both may punish without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that certain provisions of the State act of 1904 to the effect that , under specified conditions , penalties in city and town ordinances shall " supersede " those prescribed therein , are somewhat difficult to reconcile with his ruling . To the words , " which penalties shall during the existence of the ordinance , rule , or regulation supersede those specified in Section 6 of this act , " he offers this interpretation : I think those words mean no more than that the ... city , by its ordinances , shall not be kept down to the precise SUMS mentioned in the act , shall remain unaffected by any ordinance in any prosecution by the State , and that such prosecution may be carried on where such law is violated as to speeding beyond the limit fixed by the act where the city has not fixed a different rate of speed in conformity with the provisions of the act . Before imposing the fines , Judge FLEMING told the misdemeanants that , because of Justice TRUAX 'S decision , they had the right to plead not gtfilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a test case . Certainly Judge FLEMING 'S ruling has need of further judicial ponfirmation.
