the material . With almost superhuman foresight , these men pictured the Washington of the century to come : they created wide streets and magnificent avenues , and reserved one half of the city for parks and open spaces , so that its inhabitants might forever be gladdened by the sight of grass and flowers , and turn from the work of man to find a new joy in nature . When , a hundred years ago , the seat of government was transferred from Philadelphia to Washington , the crude city boasted but a few hundred houses , and only one executive department completed and ready for occupancy . All else was faith ; but men who had created a nation were justified in believing they could build a city . How well they builded the world knows . The lump of clay has been ground on the wheel of time and polished by the hand of progress , until its glistening facets make it the centre of that imperial diadem of cities , ? the pride of the New World , the admiration of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once more do honor to the genius of its creators . Most cities are like most individuals , ? we like them if they like us . The place where one has loved , or triumphed , or gained a little measure of fame is always a place of fragrant memories . And it is so when the city is to be regarded as a passing acquaintance , merely , and not as a friend . A good hotel , a delightful dinner , an artistic tea shop ( which is one reason why a much-traveled friend of mine holds Glasgow in grateful recollection ) , are things trivial enough to make us like one city , while things equally trivial cause us to detest the very name of another . But to the stranger as well as to the resident , Washington invites and attracts and fascinates . It is not the garish fascination of Paris , where the brain is seduced through the senses and delirium corrupts reason ; or the grim fascination of London , whose City of Leisure . weight and vastness and murky past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away shuddering at its hid . eousness . Washington has a fascination all her own , ? a fascination so subtle , no delicate , so intangible , and yet so material , that he must be very callous. very indifferent , very soulless , who does not fall captive to her wiles . Paris is the Sapho of cities , to all men all things , but always with the wanton 's light of love in her faithless eye and treacherous smile lurking about her unstable mouth ; London passionately showers her gifts into the laps of her favored lovers ; but Washington is like a woman whose very Presence radiates happiness , whose beauty and grace and charm make the world better for her being ; like a young girl who gives a penny fan to a sick child in a hospital , and leaves with him a memory more brilliant than the gaudy colors on which his tired eyes rest . Nor is it difficult to understand the charm of Washington . The stranger in any other city in America or Europe feels that he is an infinitesimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nobody , and nobody is interested in him , except the policeman . The American city may be spelled Chicago , or New York , or Omaha , on the map , but the name common to them all is business . The stranger whose only occupation is to kill time has no place among men whose moments mean dollars , where all is rush and excitement , where moneymaking is the beginning and end of all things . Go farther afield and you find the same ; for London is not only the capital of the British Empire , but it is one of the greatest manufacturing cities in the world ; and so with Paris and Berlin and Vienna . But Washington , capital city though it be , has not been degraded by the greed of commercialism . As we understand the word , there is no business in Washington ; there are no huge factories to destroy the clearness of tropic. al skies with their clouds of smoke , and // deface white buildings with their soot ; there are no " hands " to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caldron of a stock exchange to brew witches ' broth ; there is no feverishness , no excitement , no turmoil , because the loss of a minute does not mean the loss of a fortune . Washington is not America ; it is itself alone . Washington invites to repose . It is the only city in America where there is really a leisure class . Not only is the climate for the major portion of the year soothing , but the general air of its inhabitants is one of dignified ease , rather than the scrambling , mad anxiety which is the first thing to impress a foreigner when he lands on our shores . The architecture of the city increases this feeling . There are few hideous sky scrapers ; there is a uniformity of color which is restful without being monotonous ; the wide streets , lined with trees and often arched by them , set off and soften the national buildings ; the little parks and circles , embellished with the statue of warrior or statesman and always full of color of tire season 's flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in what would otherwise be the too rigid contour of streets and houses . One maintains a delightful feeling of surprise . In other cities streets are laid out in straight lines and with the regularity of a geometrical problem ; they are simply the way to a place , and as matter of fact as an equation . In Washington a street seemingly straight is as deceptive as a coquette 's mood . The straight street after a few hundred yards runs into a circle from which radiate half a dozen other streets ; the circle , in the early spring redolent with the breath of hyacinths , must be circumnavigated before the continuation of the street can be followed ; and then again after a few hundred yards an avenue cuts in , the angles utilized to make miniature flower gardens , the corners formed by the meeting of the ways giving the architect excellent opportunity to exercise his skill in bold fronts , and making detached houses more common in Washington than in most other cities . It must not be supposed that Washington is the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city did their work well in planting wide avenues and streets , and foreseeing that the infant capital of a struggling confederacy would one day be the seat of government of a mighty nation . But having done that , they let time do the rest . Time slept , but the genius of one man was the magician 's wand to break the spell of somnolency . Alexander Shepherd did for Washington what Baron Haussmann did for Paris . Shepherd found Washington a mudhole , and left it the city of beauty it is to-day . fie . suffered the fate of all reformers , ? he was abused , calumniated , driven forth ; but he has lived long enough to see his vindication , and to hear Washington discussing the propriety of erecting a statue to his honor . Curiously enough , Shepherd unconsciously rendered even a greater service to his beloved city , and gave to his people an object lesson in the benefits to follow from pure autocracy . With the downfall of the Shepherd regime the people of Washington were disfranchised , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage , Washington , the capital , is the only place where the right of suffrage is denied ; where the people have no voice in its affairs ; where they live and thrive under the infliction of " taxation without representation ; " where the rulers owe no allegiance to the people whom they govern , and are possessed of almost autocratic power . Washington has no local legislature , no common council . no board of aldermen . Congress has usurped all of these functions ; to Congress the people of Washington must go if they want a street paved , or a schoolhouse erected , or the police force increased ; and the mandatory of Congress are the Commissioners , two of them civil- 770 Washington : The City of Leisure . fans and one of them an army officer , who are appointed by the President , and who may or may not consult the wishes of the people in the making of his appointments .

There is no political ; cal party to profit from the knavery of contractors or the finding of places for henchmen , no boss to whom universal tribute is paid . Its affairs are honestly and economically administered ; its streets are clean and well lighted ; its policemen polite and conscientious ; its fire department is prompt and reliable ; its rate of taxation one of the lowest in the country ; its public schools have of ten been cited as models ; its care for the preservation of the public health and the protection of the indigent and sick is admirable . Surely there is a suggestion here for other American cities . Its geographical position , its native population , and its climate make Washington a curious contrast to the North and South . On the map it is South ; in manners and thought and ideas it is of the North , yet still bearing the mark of its birth . Its climate in slimmer is tropical , which invites the residents whom business or poverty keeps in the city to open their shutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in front of their houses to catch a passing breath of air . " Stoop life " is a feature of the city , and on any summer evening one may see house after house decorated with its clusters of humanity , young people and old , men and maidens , smoking and talking and flirting ; and as the stars appear , so also appear lemonade and other cooling things . A Washington custom also unique is the habit of its women in going about in summer time hatless . In the cities of southern Europe the woman without a hat , but with a flimsy lace shawl thrown over her head , is familiar enough ; but in Washington even the mantilla is dispensed with It is no unusual sight to see in an open street car , in the evening , the majority of its occupants , women and girls , hatless . They ride in the cars for the air , they go calling or to the theatre , but the hat , after dusk , is left at home . It is a pretty sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of the South , with its rich coloring and eyes that flash and sparkle ; and these young girls and matrons in their light . colored and diaphanous frocks , their faces full of animation and their heads bared , make a picture so attractive and so foreign that for the moment one forgets he is in an American city . There are three great doors in the world , says Kipling , where , if you stand long enough , you shall meet any one you wish . The head of the Suez Canal is one , Clearing Cross Station the second , and the Nyanza Docks the third . There is one place in America where you only have to sit and wait for people to come to you .

It is a stately city , with its wide avenues , its impressive buildings , its tree-lined streets , and statues of the builders of empire at nearly every corner , and the life is governed by its surroundings . It is a city which revolves around the government . One might say the same thing about the world 's other capitals , but the assertion would be only qualifiedly true . Separate London from the circle of government , and it still exists as the centre of art and literature , of science and commerce , of finance and society , ? the heart of the mightiest of empires , the spot on which is focused // the world 's attention ; in fine , the concentrated embodiment of that wonderfully complex and disappointing thing , modern civilization . And so in scarcely lesser degree Paris or Berlin or Vienna . ' rake away the government from Washington , and you would have a city beautiful in the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiring the genius of the men whose prophetic vision was great enough to enable them to lay out a city worthy of the nation it represents , but a city whose glory had departed . In Washington there is no life apart from government and politics : it is our daily bread ; it is the thread which runs through the woof and warp of our lives ; it colors everything . Washington has great scientific collections ; it has the largest library in America , one of the great collections of the world , housed in an edifice the envy of librarians the world over : but these things are a part of the government , and owe their existence to government favor . It would be an idle and profitless speculation to discuss what might be the fate of Washington were the seat of gov-ernment removed to Oklahoma , or some other remote place , but it serves a use-ful purpose to point out that the fate of government might have been different had the seat of government been estab-lished in New York , or Boston , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Fathers of the Republic did , they established the capi-tal where there was no danger of parlia-mentary deliberations being influenced by the mob , or of legislators yielding to the concentrated clamor of the unthink-ing . Had Congress sat in New York dur-ing the blackest days of the civil war , or in Boston during the days of the Elec-toral Commission , or in Louisville when the Senate deadlocked over the Force Bill , or in Denver when the Sherman law was repealed , is it not certain that the local sentiment would have mani- tested itself and left its imprint upon legislation ? Not that Congress by sitting in Washington is remote from the people , but it need not fear the mob , and the most timid legislator is not terrorized by the dread of physical violence or apprehensive of personal safety . For let it be remembered that Washington is the one capital which knows not the mob and has formed no acquaintance with the riot . Call the roll of the nations ' capitals , and there is evoked the cinematograph of troops and police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrill tenor of the Marseillaise , of governments overthrown to placate the Commune , of barricades springing up at every corner , and Anarchy reigning supreme . Washington points with pride to its solitary riot . It remembers the awkward quarter of an hour when the redoubtable Coxey walked across the grass of the Capitol and was promptly arrested by in single policeman ; and with his arrest the " army of the commonwealth " resolved itself into its original unwashed elements . Thus perished in ridicule Washington 's one " riot " ! That Washington moves and has its being around the government is one of the reasons why it is so intensely interesting to the casual visitor . Other cities have things ? buildings and collections and monuments ? to exhibit to the stranger ; their lions are all graven images . Washington has all these and more : it has persons . Its lions are lions of flesh and blood ; lords of the forest , whose gentle mars awake many a responsive echo .

And drink ; and Ah ! the passive Lip I kiss 'd , Hon many Kisses might it take ? and give ! " In Washington , more interesting than White House or Capitol , attractive as they may be , are the men whose roofs they shadow . For in Washington the rulers of the nation for the time being are always in the gaze of the public , and it requires neither introductions nor influence for the humblest citizen to see , frequently to talk with , those who sit in the seats of the mighty . The galleries of Congress are open to all , ? to him who cometh first the first seat is given ; and , unlike the House of Commons , where women are as jealously veiled from the profane eyes of men as they would be in a harem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen , there are galleries reserved for women , which , with the American 's usual chivalrous treatment of women , command a rather better view of the proceedings than those set apart for ' nen only ; but women need not flock by themselves unless they want to , and may sit with their male companions . Or the stranger may see the President walking or driving ; he may even grasp his hand at one of the tri-weekly informal morning receptions ; he may see members of the Cabinet , ambassadors , senators , representatives , admirals , and generals , politicians of high or low degree , enter or leave the White House ; he may study a senatorial kingmaker from the adjoining table of a hotel dining room , or see him smoke his after-dinner cigar in the lobby of his hotel ; he may hear the great man , without whose name no copy of a daily paper is considered complete , crack Ms. joke like any other little man . In Washington everybody is known . The small boys know the President , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being saluted in turn ; the car conductors know the Vice President and the Speaker of the House , and are only too happy to impress the country cousin with their knowledge ; the colored waiter is an abridged Congressional Directory , and the attendants at White House , Capitol , and elsewhere take a pride in pointing out the elect . This is the charm to the stranger , who of course touches only the outer rim , who knows Washington only in the moat superficial way , and who knows nothing of Washington life as it really is . To one who does know its inner life , it has an attraction which no other city in America can equal . It is a city of curious social contrasts . Other cities claim to be cosmopolitan because they have absorbed , but not assimilated , the sweepings of Eu-rope ; but they are no more cosmopolitan than the tower of Babel was an academy of philology . To claim for one Alfieri-can city over another a social pram ' . nonce is a delicate , a foolish thing even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superior to any other ? Yet it will perhaps not be denied by the un-prejudiced observer that the entrance to society is through the check book , and that in every large city where there are several strata of society it is difficult to say which is the highest unless gauged by the cost of its entertainments . In Washington the question admits of no discussion . At the head of society , to make as much or as little of it as he chooses , stands the President , of course , ? in Washington , unlike foreign capi-tals , wives enjoying the same rank as their husbands , ? then the Vice Presi-dent , then the members of the Cabinet in the order of their succession to the presidency , the diplomatic corps , the supreme court , senators , representatives , and so on , down a long list , each official , according to his rank , finding himself neatly labeled in society 's catalogue . But while this officially settles a man 's status in the official world , determines his precedence , makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie shall precede or follow his fiercest ene-my , in Washington , as elsewhere , IIICH rise superior to rank , and fortune is // greater than circumstance . To be a peer of England gives an entr4e into some circles ; the inheritance of one of the old and honored names in American history is an open sesame to many doors . To be a senator is in Washington to command respect and a certain amount of social deference ; it serves as an introduction , but it serves as no more . The introduction secured , what follows depends upon the individual , and more perhaps upon his wife , if he be not a bachelor or a widower . For Washington is the paradise of woman : there she holds greater sway than anywhere else ; there she wields greater influence than falls to the lot of her sisters elsewhere . Tradition asserts ? a tradition still believed in some of the remoter quarters of the Union ? that in the " early days , " a nebulous epoch which has defied the investigations of chronology , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female lobbyist , " synonymous with everything that was young , beautiful , witty , well dressed , good or had as the mood suited her , at whose feet men worshiped and whose cook was deified by the jaded palates of the world-weary , ? this is the picture which has tired more than one youthful imagination in the day when he viewed life through the covers of a yellow-back novel and the mystery of woman was unfathomable . If she ever existed , she has nose become an extinct species , gone to join her male companion , the stories of whose sumptuous dinners , with their inevitable accompaniment of poker , are still pleasant reading for a wet Sunday afternoon . The glory of the lobby has departed . There are lobbyists still , men and women , who eke out a precarious existence , who are so well known and whose trade is recognized as being so disreputable that no one with self-respect may be seen in conversation with them , and whose frayed linen and shiny clothes and contempt of soap do not invite companionship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too raw in his methods . We have not , perhaps , become more moral , but we have become less crude and more scientific . The lobbyist has given place to the " agent , " who sometimes sits on the floor of the House or the Senate , occasionally in the Cabinet , or who exercises his power from afar , and does not even appear in person in Washington . But while this is one phase of Washington , it is too foreign to the purpose of this article to be more titan touched upon . But woman roles , because in Wash-ington everything revolves around the social centre , and society and politics are inseparably interwoven . In other cities society and its diversions , its dinners and its dances , are only the relaxation from the more serious side of life ; in Washing-ton they are part of the general scheme of life . The one recognized leader of society , or the half dozen who may be competing for that title , in New York or Boston or Chicago or elsewhere , may give dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Washington there is no option ; there is a social calendar to be religiously kept and observed , from which there is no escape . Diplomacy , law , and statesmanship must eat at the President 's table during the season ; cads member of the Cabinet must in turn play host to his chief ; birthdays and corona-tions of queens and kings must be duly observed with feasting and dancing ; and threading in and out of this maze are the dinners , large and small , official and semi-official , of diplomatists and secrete , ries and legislators and the host of offi-cials one grade lower , while the after-noons are busy with teas and receptions , until it has become an axiom that in Washington no one really works but so-ciety women and newspaper correspond-ents . Because society constantly needs to be entertained , and always welcomes eagerly to its ranks any person who can provide entertainment , and anathema-tizes the bore , tact and cleverness , bril- 774 Washington The City of Leisure . Nancy and beauty , exercise greater influence in Washington than they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for all , and wealth counts for little . Many men and women whose position and wealth might constitute them prominent in society are simply tolerated , and not welcomed ; and while , to entertain , money is as essential in Washington as it is elsewhere , it is not the open sesame which it is in some other cities . Possibly this may need explanation . The millionaire member of the Senate , whose lavish entertainments are the admiration of his friends and the shaft of envy to his enemies , sloes not because of his millions stand higher in the social scale than his colleague who lives in a hotel , and whose entertaining is confined to the few dinners which it is absolutely incumbent upon him to give during the come of the season . And yet the fact that he does not entertain , that he lives as quietly and modestly as a struggling lawyer or doctor who has yet his name to make , closes no door to him or makes his presence less welcome at any table . And if he is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to being the possessor of an official title he is a man of force and character and intellect , if lie has wife and daughters who are tactful or brilliant or beautiful , he and his family will be welcome to the most exclusive houses , and nobody will think of his poverty ; but if he has nothing to distinguish him , if his women-kind are conventional merely , although the newspapers will frequently report his name at dinners , and the names of his wife and daughters at teas and luncheons , they will be only superficially in society . Washington is the paradise of the poor man with brains . One of the great charms of Washington society , to those who are in it , is that Washington is the only city in the world with an established society where society does not put itself on show for the benefit of the world at large . There is no Metropolitan Opera House or Delmonico 's or Prince 's or Hotel Ritz or the Bristol , as there is in New York or Lon. don or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine out , to see who else h there and to be seen of every one . to place their diamonds and their costumes on exhibition and to have them written about , to be fragments of colored glass in the ever changing kaleidoscope of a life which is always moving , always Ann . ging , always making a new pattern be . fore the last one has fallen into place . Except at the theatre , society in Washing . ton never puts itself on parade . It has no opportunity to do so . There is no fashionable restaurant to be recognized as society 's clearing house , nor is the fashion of public dining cultivated . People who entertain do so in their own houses ; occasionally some function larger than usual may overtax the resources of a private house , and make it necessary to give it in a public hall , or a man may find it more convenient to give a dinner at a hotel rather than at Isis house or club ; but wherever held privacy is insisted upon and maintained . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every guest bears a name distinguished for something , but the public will be given no opportunity to know more than that . There is not even a park or a " Rotten Row " to which society by common consent resorts at a stipulated hour , although Washington is noted for its parks ; there is not even a church parade . It is not that society is more exclusive in Washington than in other cities ; it is partly matter of habit , partly because of indifference . In the old days , the diplomatic corps was regarded as being so far superior to the native Americans that its members formed a colony apart ; they mingled officially and socially , but not intimately , with the barbarians among whom a hard fate and the exigencies of diplomacy compelled them to live ; and conscious of their own greatness , display of any kind was the very last thing // they desired or cultivated . Time has changed the European idea of American society as it has changed American ideas of European manners and morals . The diplomatic corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social code is the only code known ; but while exclusive , while extremely careful whom it admits to its dinner table , it no longer holds itself aloof ; it has long ceased to be merely officially polite , and has become intimate ; it has taken to wife some of our fairest daughters , and it has shown a sympathetic comprehension of our institutions and our prejudices . It has taught us one thing which other cities might heed . It has shown that society can exist without colossal fortunes ; that vulgar display , extravagant and bizarre entertainments , and ostentatious spending of money are merely the signs of the parvenus , whose only hope of attracting attention is by making their money cry out for them . While most of the ambassadors of the Great Powers are provided by their governments with a liberal allowance for entertainments , their obligations to society are rarely paid in the form of large receptions or a " crush ; " dinners succeed each other with such frequency that , in turn , everybody in that charmed circle is host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort , and interesting company . The example of the diplomatic corps has proved contagious , and explains why the best society eschews display as much as possible , and why those great entertainments at which there is such a lavish exhibition of wealth , and which so much delight other cities , are unknown in Washington . Another reason why Washington society avoids notoriety as much as possible is that society in the capital is a very compact entity . Socially Washington is much like a village , where every one knows everybody else , where concealment is quite impossible . Social Washington is a small world , ? so small that its units do not admit of many combinations . The same people meet each other at the teas in the afternoon and at dinners a few hours later , and in the course of a season all society has met so often that most people are bored ; and the host or hostess who can in the waning days produce a novelty , whether man or woman , lion of the forest or cooing dove of the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the young girl whose only charm is her beauty and her freshness , may be sure that none of her invitations will be refused . In fact , if there is CM e drawback to Washington society , it is its circumscription . I recall the remark made to me by a member of the Cabinet a , few years ago . He looked up wearily from his desk one afternoon . " Another Cabinet dinner tonight , " he said , with a sigh . " Has Mr. Secretary Blank such a very bad cook that you dread the ordeal ? " I asked . " No , Blank 's cook will Pass , and Blank serves better wine than some men I might mention ; but we do get so tired of each other and each other 's wives before the season is over . To-night will be the seventh week running I have taken Mrs. Blank in to dinner .

I have no doubt Mrs. Blank thinks just the same thing about me . If we could only break the pairs occasionally , it would lead to an element of novelty ; but there is no escape from the order of precedence , and every time we dine the President I know exactly what I have to look forward to .

In no other capital in the world , in hardly any other city , does money mean so little as it does in the capital of democracy . And these things explain the indifference of society to putting itself on parade . There is nothing to be gained by it ; there is no advantage to follow ; there is not even the triumph which comes from humiliating a rival . The woman whose husband is a millionaire will wear her diamonds and her Paris frocks ; but bitterness is her portion if she presumes on that to set herself above the wife of the man whose only means is his salary , yet whose official position or length of service gives him precedence .

That is why most women who have had long experience in Washington are something more than the wives of their husbands , and become their partners and an active force . That is why one hears a woman say , " We wanted the red-tape committee , " knowing that to be chairman of that committee makes a man famous and feared . That is why a woman has been heard to say , " We wanted the sealing- wax office ; " for great is the power of the commissioner , unlimited his supply of sealing wax , and much court is paid to his wife .

Despite the limitations of Washington society , there is a charm about it not to he found elsewhere , because it escapes the bane of society in every other American city , its narrow provincialism . In New York , as in Chicago and other cities , people are naturally interested in their local surroundings ; their world is the world of their own and the few adjoining streets , and what happens in the rest of the country , or in countries still more remote , is too far removed from their field of vision to have more than the faintest concern for them . Perhaps there is no city quite so provincial as New York , ? due to the fact that the average New Yorker , whether in society or in business , has got into the habit of patronizing the inhabitants of any other city . The New York business man complacently feels that the rest of the country is financed by New York , and must do as New York tells it ; the society man or woman of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , there is no society worthy of the name , and what society does exist is merely a bad imitation of its Neer York prototype . Washington is saved from this feeling , because there is no local pride , and because the diversity of the elements which go to make up society prevents stagnation ; because the whole country , the entire world , is drawn upon , and the topics of conversation are not merely the ordinary gossip of a narrow section of one city , but are the things , sometimes important , sometimes trivial . // holding the attention of the whole world . In any social gathering there will be men and women representing nearly every state of the Union ; naval officers representing no state , but with allegiance to all ; diplomatists to add the savor of the Old World to that of the New ; scientists who have lived very close to Nature in the endeavor to wrest her secrets . A society so made up would perforce perish of inanition if it attempted to live on the small talk that drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk and gossip there are , of course , but with them there is something more substantial . No one in Washington has yet had courage to establish a salon ; the American Madame Roland has yet to make her appearance ; but when she does she will be welcomed by her followers , from whose ranks she can select with discriminating care . Apropos of society , there is a pleasing tradition which has long existed , but which , in the interest of history , I feel compelled reluctantly but ruthlessly to destroy . Tradition asserts that there is an old residential society , composed of native Washingtonians , belonging to the " first families , " admission to which inner and sacred circle is denied to every one except the members of these same first families . It is a sort of Faubourg St. Germain , and like that faubourg its inhabitants turn up their aristocratic noses at their temporary rulers , regarding them generally as sans-culottes . The adventitious advantage of rank is ignored , and only those who can show the sang pur and the quarterings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , women of the Faubourg are aristocratic , with gray hair ; very haughty and very intolerant of progress , with relics of their past estate visible in miniatures of long dead but abnormally handsome husbands , and a few pieces of treasured silver ; and whose retinue always consists of an old colored woman , who was nurse to her mistress 's first-born and presumes upon it , and her equally venerable husband , who does his work very badly , and makes up for it in sentimental philosophy . But , alas , this fabled guartier exists only in the pages of novelists ; like Bohemia , the land of which every one talks , but which no one has yet seen , it defies the discoverers . " The first families " form no distinctive class ; they have long since been merged into society at large ; and while here and there one may find a name which takes one back to the Virginia of the colonies , and recalls the times when Virginians lived in almost feudal state , the tradition of haughty dames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things is a figmett of the imagination , as intangible and impalpable as a negro 's voodoo curse . It has been said that polities and society are inseparably interwoven in Washington , but it might even more accurately be said that society is merely the offshoot of politics . Everything in Washington is political , that is to say official , and officials owe their existence to politicians . Everybody , with few exceptions , is in some way connected with the government ; the exceptions are the people who have discovered the charm of Washington as a winter resort and the newspaper correspondents , and they are more political than the politicians . The motif of existence in Washington is politics , but the game is played on a generous scale . The absence of local politics eliminates the petty schemes which make American politics so wretchedly sordid . In Washington we talk politics morning , noon , and night ; we play politics all the year round ; even at times when the most ardent politicians in other parts of the country have forgotten their schemes we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like gentlemen who may lose a fortune on the turn of a card without betraying an emotion , not like punters who drop their coin with a shudder , and shiver as 778 The Mist . chance goes against them . Across the aisle of House or Senate men battle for party , watchful , alert , bold , giving and asking no quarter , eager to turn everything to their advantage . At night , across the dinner table , the stinging satire of the day , the merciless thrusts , the heat and passion of the moment , are forgotten . Opponents in public , in private men are friends , each appreciating the good qualities of the other , respecting sincerity though regretting a judgment so perverted . " Washington is the city where the big men of little towns come to be disillusioned , " a newspaper writer has said . It is true . The big Mare of the little town comes to Washington expecting that political opponents no more break bread than would a Mohammedan think of worshiping ice the church of the Christian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his whole atmosphere is political , while every one he meets is a part of the government , while politics is as much a part of his life as the blood is a part of the body , and neither can be separated from the other , politics is ignored when he enters the drawing-room . It is a lesson which some men learn quickly , ? they become something more than mere successful politicians ; but itis a lesson which some men are so slow to master that they have ceased to be politicians before they have mastered its rudiments . And Washington is the graveyard of reputations as well as the cradle of fame . I look up once more at the monument to Washington . It stands now veiled in a sea of silvery light , the Potomac , but a hand 's breadth away , a ribbon of uncut velvet , shimmering in blue and silver . until it fines down and is lost in the green of the Virginia hills , ? the monument majestic in its size , colossal in it , proportions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there like a sentinel keeping watch over the city it so jealously loves ; it stands there part of the genius of George Washington , a fragment of his creative force . By day , warmed by the sun , softened by the iridescence of the prismatic colors , it is the Washington of youth and faith and ambition . By night , bathed in fantastic shadow , forbidding , cold , unapproachable , it is the Washington who has put ambition behind him ; who has done his work ; who , secure in the affections of his countrymen , can look with serene vision to the future . Inseparably it links the Washington of the past with the Washington of to-day .
