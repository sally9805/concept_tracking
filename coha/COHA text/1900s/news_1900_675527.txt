txt The Ohio Democrats opened their campaign here today with a meeting in the afternoon at Goodale Park and in the evening at the Goodale Auditorium . W. J. Bryan made speeches at both meetings . The speech at the park meeting was a general review of the , political situation . Declaring that he believed ' the Democratic ticket entitled to the Electoral vote of Ohio , Mr. Bryan said : " Measured by the principles for which the party stands , there ' is every . reason why the people of this State should support our ticket , and if any feel like being restrained by a matter of State pride you should remember that you ' have had Presidents enough for this State to satisfy reasonable pride , and then one term is long enough if a ' man does what he ought to , and if he does not it is too long . Declaring that the Democratic Party had taken no backward step . Mr. Bryan charged that the Republicans had won the campaign of 1896 under the false pretense of wanting international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party was , he said , now trying to make the financial question the paramount issue of the campaign . " The Democratic Party , " he said , " stands to-day for , the principles that drew together 6,500,000 votes in 1896 , but it adds to its platform to cover new questions . " If the laboring man wants arbitration as a means of settling differences between labor and capital he is told by the Republican Party that as long as he has a full meal he does not need anything else . If the laboring man protests against government by injunction the only answer he gets is ' a full dinner pail . ' " My friends , if the Republican Party wants to make its full-dinner-pail argument , let it go into the anthracite coal regions , where the operatives get less than 6250 a year . This morning 's paper contains the statement that the wages paid to miners will in some instances average less than $230 a year . Why , my friends , that will not give the laboring man one full dinner pail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applause . " I. am afraid that when the Republican Party was not looking , the lid of that dinner pail flew off and some coal got into the bucket , and I understand it is coal that weighs nearly twice as much per ton as the law requires , and the Republican Party when it goes to blow it out will have to do it with powder that is sold to the miners at $2.75 a keg , when it is only worth $1.50 . I see in the newspapers , " he said , " that originally the President 's letter contained 20,000 words , but . that it was cut - down. to 18.000 : I . suppose , " , , he .. added , - " . - that the Othee : ? 7,000. *ords were pa , : , l'Ic trustfaue , $1 Lion : but were ' cut'out " " The President says that nobody wants imperialism , " ' said Mr. Bryan , again referring - to- :Mr. - ** and he said in reply : " We point you to the Porto Rican bill . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except upon an imperialistic theory of Government . I challenge you to find in-all the history of the world a power exercised by tyrant or despot more arbitrary than the power ' asserted by the Porto Rican bill . Great applause . . " The President said the other day in his letter that the only opposition that we had in the Philippines came from a part of one tribe . Well , my friends . that is too high a compliment to pay to that one part of that one tribe . To say that a small fraction of people over there could keep in subjection all the rest of the people and then keep an army of 65.000 American soldiers at bay , too , is saying too much . Now , is n't it strange that if a majority of the people in the Philippine Islands wanted our rule , is n't it strange that they have not helped us ? " A monster night meeting was held at the Auditorium ; which was addressed by J. J. Lentz . Mr. . Welty , Charles W. Baker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bryan spoke briefly .
