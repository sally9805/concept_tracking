txt Chairman Payne 's Vigorous Views I am utterly opposed to Mr. Bryan 's plan of Government ownership of railroads . The system -- not a striking success anywhere -- is repugnant to our theory of government . Here a million railroad public officials holding the balance of power at the polls would soon control legislation in the interest of their own class . Government can not run any business as economically as an individual . The increased cost would prove an additional burden to internal commerce , and our last state would be worse than anything we have yet experienced . The proposition involves paternalism and class legislation . His remedy is worse than the disease . In my opinion the rate bill fairly tried and strengthened by amendment wherever experience shows the need of it will accomplish better results with none or the dangers attending Mr. Bryan 's plan .
