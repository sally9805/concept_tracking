 | IT is only a few years ago that the Permanent Court of International Arbitration was founded at The Hague . The prospects of assigning a suitable building to this court were scarcely being-executed when the whole world began to recognize that what had been reached was , in fact , only the first step in the right direction , that of fraternizing the nations . This international , organized co-operation is the fruit of recent years , and is best expressed by the word Internationalism , which , in this way , acquires a new and nobler meaning . Just as every State is an organism and the perfection of this organism is necessary to make that State powerful , so the collective international human interests must become one organism to keep them healthy and to prevent their untimely growth and final degeneration . Those collective international human interests are numerous ; by way of illustration we might mention : Commerce , industry , arts , sciences , education , sanitation , economy and all similar principal interests of social life . All these interests have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lacking . It is true , a semblance of world organization , a faint shadow of what this ought to be , already exists in the International Congresses , but the organization of the latter is so imperfect that one can only deplore the fact that so many of the most eminent men meet to effect so little . If the organization were better , no doubt the world would derive much more benefit from its eminent men . The limited space allowed for this article does not admit of a detailed discussion of all the organizations required . So I shall only point out in a few words what , in my own opinion , these organizations ought to be like , e. g. , in the domain of science . The most eminent men of all countries form academies , one for each science , which should be permanent scientific organizations all over the world . Each academy may be divided into sections , if it comprises cognate branches of science . The various academies may enter in contact with each other concerning questions of common interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment will be discussed further on , in all the countries of the world , and has a permanent central commission . Each academy regulates the International Congresses to be held in the various countries , and collects a complete library of its own scientific branch . The Permanent Central Commission is the executive for these and other affairs . This commission collects its material thru correspondence societies established in the different countries , and gives information of a scientific nature . International statistics and " Sammelforschungen , " which the academy might deem necessary , are executed by the Permanent Central Commission . Prize competitions , the awarding of marks of distinction , the support of private initiative , belong to the work of the academy . If necessary , the academy gives advice to governments . Each academy may establish one or more practical institutes to  | promote study or investigation directly , or to put the results obtained into practice . These practical institutes may be world collections , training schools , laboratories , model institutions and the like . The word " scientific " must here be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of academies will be very considerable , for besides the abstract sciences , the technical and the applied sciences are also comprised by it . It is true that a desire for international organization already exists , and that endeavors have been made to establish regular congresses with permanent bureaus , but the manner in which this has been done as yet has not vet developed that far-reaching power which would have so beneficial an influence on mankind . What I think of primary importance is that these academies shall have great sums of money at their disposal . Where is the money to come from in the long run ? It seems to me that , as in consequence of the growth of civilization less money called " International Academy " ( not university ) , with the express stipulation that it be an unofficial body and have no connection whatever with diplomacy . will be spent on alcohol and war , a small part of the sums thus saved will be sufficient to effect those seeming wonders . By such a world-organization private initiative would by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greatly supported . In fact it is only with such world-organizations that the investigation into the origin , the spread and the cure of tuberculosis , cancer and other diseases could at all be undertaken with some hope of success . Such a permanent congress might be In the beginning at least this will be necessary the possibility is , however , not excluded that in the future it will be necessary to grant certain privileges and some power to such an academy , in consequence of which it might become of some importance in the international government Academy of Pedagogy , Hygiene and Economy , the scheme of which I present in a few words as follows : The International Academy of Pedagogy , Hygiene and Economy consists of : Central commission , delegated members , extraordinary members and congress members . The central commission has the daily control of the academy and represents it to the outside world . It consists of fifteen members , among whom are one central chairman , one central secretary and one central treasurer . The remaining twelve members are divided into three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hygiene and economy . Each of these sections appoints from its number one section chairman and one section secretary . To the central commission is attached a chancery . The central commission takes care of the library and of the publications of the academy . It keeps continually abreast with and gathers all the information about everything which occurs relating to the academy . It prepares all the meetings and congresses . The delegated members are appointed and paid by the government of their respective States . The number of participating states k for the present estimated at fifty-four. and the number of members , which every State may delegate altogether , is to be determined hereafter and estimated here at an average of five members per State . so that a total of 270 delegated members is expected . The International Academy of Pedagogy , Hygiene and Economy can assume extraordinary members to a maximum number of thirty , who are paid by the academy . The different sections will not lack urgent subjects , for , besides the new questions , which occur every year , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When such an academy actually exists  | the need will soon be felt of practical institutes , which may serve , so to say , as training grounds , and where the different measures can be tried and their efficacy tested before they are decreed by the academy . Such practical institutes we have also adopted in our plan . For pedagogy it will be an educational establishment or international school , arranged on the most perfect plan possible , which must serve as a model to others . This school , the number of pupils of which need not necessarily be very great , must , of course , be organized as the academy prescribes it . The pupils collectively will afford material for pedagogical study , which will he of the greatest importance . As early as the year 1880 some of these principles were successfully introduced by P. Robin into the orphanage " Prevost , " at Cempuis , in France . On a somewhat larger scale these principles were applied in the school at Abbotsholme , erected in 1889 by Dr. Cecil Red ( lie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ilsenburg in the Harz in Germany , which institution succeeded to such a degree that an extension was soon required on an estate in Thuringia called " Haubinda . " Their results do not represent it as risky , but are on the contrary a vivid stimulus to imitate them on a very large scale , in order to give another example for the enlightenment of the whole world . For the Institute of Pedagogical Reform in our plan a space is set aside , with woods , meadows and fields . Air and soil are reckoned among the healthiest of the Netherlands . The instruction comprises : 1 . The branches of the elementary school . 2 . The handwork and polytechnics . 3 . The cookery and household school . 4 . The elements of nursing the sick and infants . 5 . Hygiene and sport . 6 . Secondary school . 7 . Commercial school ( shorthand and type-writing ) , The Peace Palace at The Hague . 8 . The first rules of agriculture and horticulture. 9 . Grammar school . 10 . Academy of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religious instruction . Dry theoretical instruction will be avoided as much as possible . Materials for instruction will be derived rather from real life in nature and society than from books . To attain this it is necessary that nature and society he continually at the disposal of the pupil , tho it be only on a small scale . For the Academy of Hygiene such " practical institute " may be composed of various social hygienic establishments , as laboratories , a sanitary farm , etc . As the word hygiene , taken in its widest sense , also comprises the nursing and treatment of the sick , I fancy that such an academy should also have a model hospital by way of a practical institute , on a moderate scale , it is true , but based on the modern principles and methods of medical treatment , having , in the first place , plenty of room and fresh air , so that every patient may undergo open-air treatment , if required . One of the first things which the hos-  | pitals are wanting is generally an extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air for the buildings . Generally there can be no question of open-air treatments , because the hospitals have to put up with limited space of garden and all the money is sacrificed as much as possible to the building and the inventory . Especially for convalescents and nervous patients it is often necessary to procure for them healthy occupation in the open air . A large plot with nurseries is therefore indispensable for the treatment of the sick . The economy of the practical institute will be a workmen 's garden city for about one thousand workmen 's families . Practical experiments can here be made in regard to the problem of workmen 's houses , but at the same time this collective body of one thousand workmen 's families will afford an excellent opportunity for the study of many other questions regarding the workman , as co-operation , life assurance , and so on . It is evident that the international congresses now in existence need not be abolished , but that , on the contrary , they must be maintained , tho , of course , reorganized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what already exists , especially as there will be great need of persons of practical experience , and also because the formation of new organizations , along with those already in existence , would only lead to division and waste of power . Therefore it would be of great practical value if now already a list of the different international societies and congresses which are already in existence could be obtained , and I politely invite all newspapers which should review this article to publish this request of mine , so that in a comparatively short space of time we may have fairly complete data at our disposal . As in every country the ministerial departments and other government buildings are situated as close together as possible so as to be in continual touch with one another , so all the institutions of internationalism should as much as possible be brought together in one group , because these , too , have to assist and complete each other . Considering that The Hague has been chosen by the different nations as the seat of the Permanent Court of International Arbitration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation of Internationalism , superintended by an international board of curators . This Foundation of Internationalism must be a moral body . It must get possession of the grounds on which the international institutions are to be built . To obtain the funds required it contracts a loan . Those grounds must be rather extensive , so that the foundation can the parts it does not require to private persons or toward private ends . The great profits thus obtained go to the Foundation of Internationalism , and it will be impossible for a private person to profit by them . As will be explained later on , the Foundation will thus , in course of time , have considerable sums at its disposal , which it may use advantageously for its own ends . The object of this foundation is in due course to organize on an international basis the different interests of mankind , to found the described academies and to establish the permanent bureaus of the latter . When these organizations have proved beneficial and have become indispensable , many of them will in due time be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this is not the case , however , the foundation will have to defray their expenses . With a view to this it must have considerable capital at its disposal , both now and in the future . How is this to be obtained ? An answer to this question will be given in the following exposition , the principle of which we have adopted in our plan . It is undeniable that the Dutch kingdom and the municipality of The Hague are both closely concerned in the establishment of this Foundation of -Internationalism within their territory . For the founding of some international buildings will considerably raise the value of the surrounding grounds . Now it is only fair that these profits should be used in the cause of internationalism instead of filling the pockets of private persons , as would be the case if the peace palace were built on the site till now assigned to it , viz. , the little , insignificant corner , mentioned above , at one of the extremities of the real estate-speculation society " Zorgvliet. "  | It may be stated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of The Hague are prepared to sell to the Foundation of Internationalism great areas of ground at a very moderate price , for the establishment of the institutions to which I have referred above . As to the remaining grounds , which the foundation does not require for international purposes , this foundation can sell them to private persons and ends at a price considerably raised in consequence of the world buildings being erected in the neighborhood of those grounds by the Foundation of Internationalism . Now , the grounds required for our plan have been chosen in such a way that the World-Capitol ? comprising the palaces and buildings of the various international world institutions , among which that of the Permanent Court of International Arbitration , to be located there on the " Musschenberg " ( Sparrows Hill ) ; that of the Permanent International Congress , proposed by Mr. Bartholdt , and of all other permanent international bodies which are going to follow ? can be realized on grounds belonging to the municipality of The Hague only , and , as domain grounds , to the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a new project for extending e city , and the provisional plans made for this purpose have failed to meet with much approval . Internationalism might at once avail itself of this state of affairs by making a well-devised plan of extension in connection with its own institutions . In this way enormous profits may be secured for the first fifty or one hundred years to come . By mutual agreement on this point between the advocates of internationalism at one side and the government of the State of the Netherlands and of the city of The Hague at the other , invaluable services might be rendered to the world . The grounds selected in our plan border immediately on the old city of The Hague , and are directly connected with the whole world by the electric railway from Scheveningen to Rotterdam . They are the finest part of The Hague , lovely dunes studded with woods and delightful views on all sides . From a hygienic point of view , too , they form the healthiest spot that can be imagined . For some centuries at least they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationalism . According to our plan a new town quarter will be established here , which in itself might be regarded as the World 's Capital , built after a preconceived plan , just as the city of Washington was beforehand projected around its magnificent capitol . And thus this capital will be the material expression of the fraternization of the nations . To realize this plan we need , in the first place , the sympathy and co-operation of the aristocrats of the intellect thruout the world . Each day gives fresh proofs that this sympathy is increasing , and the fear lest we should be striving after a mere Utopia is disappearing more and more and giving place to the conviction that the realization of our plan is possible and greatly desirable . When the great leaders of the world shall have placed themselves at the head of this movement the money will soon be forthcoming , which , in the form of a loan , is to constitute the foundation fund for the establishment of the Institution of Internationalism .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
