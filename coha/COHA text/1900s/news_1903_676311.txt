txt Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling , inv-entor of the Gatling gun , which revolutionized modern warfare , died yesterday afternoon in the home of his son-in-law , Hugh 0 . Pentecost , at 240 West One Hundred and Seventh Street . He had lived to the age of cfghty-four years , but at the time of his death lie was perfecting a few business formalities prior to placing his new motor plow on the market . The company controlling the invention has its headquarters in St. Louis , under the name of the Gatlong Blotor Power Company , and it has been capitalized for $500,000 . ? Until two weeks ago Dr. Gatling was in St. Louis . For three years he bad heart disease , and recently he had the grip , and therefore one of leis sons , living in New York , went to St. Louis to bring him here . The aged , but active , iiiventor , when once more surrounded by the members of his family , gained strength rapidly , and it was with some difficulty that he could be restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , as he had some business to transact with Munn &; Co. , publishers of The Scientific American , and after visiting that firm he returned to the residence of his Bonin-law at about noon . He said he felt tired and he rested without taking luncheon . In the course of the luncheon Mr. Pentecost telephoned from his law office down town to his residence , and his wife went to the telephone in the room in which Dr. Gatling was resting . As soon as Mrs. Pentecost entered ' he room she saw that her father was very ill . He was gasping for breath , and while she raised his head she called for some one to go for a physician . He died in her arms before the physician arrived . Dr. Gatling 's life was replete with interesting incidents . His gun was but one of his inventions . The inventor of the implement of warfare was one of the mildest , kindest men . The idea of the gun arose in his mind not because he thought it could do more destructive work than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he figured , the time being the opening of the civil war , it could be managed by one man , thus relieving the conditions of jeopardizing a vast army to  --  the bullets of the enemy . His life was full of disappointments , but his friends say that he merely laughed at disappointments . The hardest blow came to him fifteen months after he had begun the manufacture of the first gun , when all of his forms , plans , and everything necessary for making the gun were destroyed by fire . Without hesitating a minute , he began again . Another heavy blow came to him when recently the big gun , after the style of the 1Crtipp gun , exploded at Sandy Hook . He maintained that the gull had been overcharged by enemies , who did not want the patent to substitute other Governmental guns . Mr. Gatling was born in Hertford , N. C. , on Sept. 12 , 1818 . His father was a farmer in easy circumstances . Richard was the third . son . When he was in his teens he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his youth he was a clerk and school teacher , and after awhile he went into business on his own .. account . it was while he was a merchant that he busied himself with the ' Screw propeller . He afterward invented a machine for sowing rice , which he adapted later to sawing wheat ' in drills . In 1844 he moved to St. Louis and for a year he worked as a clerk in a dry goods store . While so employed he engaged a skillful mechanic to construct several of his sowing machines . In 1845 he gave up everything else and devoted himself entirely to planhing and getting out his inventions . The idea of the gun was conceived by Mr. Gatling in 1861 . It was not ready for service until the latter portion of 1862 . Its first capacity was 2-50 shoots a minute . Its present capacity , with the aid of electrical propulsion , is 3,000 shots a minute . Dr. Gatling worked at perfecting the gun for nearly thirty years . when he sold his interest to the Colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it to several of the Continental powers . Aside from his ability as an inventor , his friends speak of Dr. Gatling as a student and a philosopher . He studied medicine merely to be able to take care of himself , besides the members of his family . He was led to do that through an incident which brought home the necessity of such a course forcibly to him . He was traveling by boat from Cincinnati to Pittsburg during the Winter of 1845-6 , when he contracted the smallpox . The boat was caught in the ice , and for two weeks he had to be on that boat without medical assistance or even the necessaries of life . As soon as he was cured of the malady . he began the study of medicine and he was graduated as a physician . Dr. Gatling made a great deal of money through his inventions , but he lost heavily by investing in the building of early railroads in the Wrest . He left a widow , a daughter , Ida , and two sons .
