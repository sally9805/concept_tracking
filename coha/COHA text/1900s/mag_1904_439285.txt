IT was when Elder Lincoln was supplying the pulpit of the old Union Meeting-I louse in Franconia . He was a Congregationalist , but was always styled Elder , as was also any clergyman of any denomination ; it Was , and is now , considered there the fit and proper title for a minister . There were three places of worship in the village representing . as many denominations , called colloquially by the residents the Congo , the Freewill , and the Second-Ad , these names being " short " for the Congregationalist , Freewill Baptist , and Second-Adventist churches . The Congregationalists and plain Baptists held their services in the same house of worship , each taking its turn , yearly I think , in providing a clergyman . Elder Lincoln was the choice of the Congos at that time , a dear , simple-hearted old man whom we loved well . We were sitting together , the good Elder and I , on the piazza of the little inn ? it was when uncle Eben kept it ? and talking quietly of many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I know that our conversation at last veered around to the subject of the soul 's immortality , its condition immediately after it left the body , possible probation , and the intermediate state , technically so called . In the midst of this talk I saw an odd look upon the face of the Elder , a sort of whimsical smile , as if he were thinking of something not so grave as the topic of which we talked , and when he spoke , his words seemed strangely irrelevant . " Do you know , " he asked , " who has taken the old mill-house on the Landaff road , the one , you know , where Captain Noyes lived ? " I did not know ; I had heard that somebody had lately moved into the old house , but had not heard the name of the new occupant . " Well , " said the Elder , still with that quaint smile upon his face , " before jolt form any definite opinions upon this subject of the intermediate state you should talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ife would not further , save to tell use that Mrs. Weaver of Bradford had taken the house , that she was an elderly woman , practical l ; alone in the world , anxious to know her new neighbors and to make new friends . It was largely owing to this hint that , soon after our Sunday evening talk , I came to know Mrs. Apollos Weaver , to gain her friendship and confidence , and to hear her strange story . It was not told me all at one time , hat intermittently as the summer days wen ; by . Yet every word of the tale was spoken in the old mill-house , and I never pass ( list ancient brown dwelling , standing high above the road on its steep , grassy bask , with the two tall elms in front , the big lilac bush at the door , and the cinnamon rosebushes straggling down to the road , that I do not think of Mrs. Weaver and her story . It was not in reply to any question of mine that she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I somehow shrank from asking her directly about her theological views and beliefs . I had received a telegram one day relating to a business matter , and as I sat with Mrs. Weaver at the open door of the mill-house , I spoke of it , and of the nervous dread the sight of one of those dull yellow envelopes always brought me . " Yes , " she said , " they ' re scary things , any way you take it ; but sometimes the writing one is worse than getting one . 1 never shall forget , as long as I live , the time I tried and tried , till I thought I should go crazy trying , to put just the right words , and not more than ten of them , into a telegraph to John Netw.n. ) err and over I went with il , saying the words to myself , and trying to pick out something that would sort of break the liews easy , and yet have him sense it within t any mistake : Maria has come back , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lint part of that was too dreadful sudden . ' I tool be surprised to hear Maria is with us now ! ' Oh no , how could Ire help being surprised , and how could I help making him so . ' " For you see , Maria was dead and berried , and had been for three whole weeks ! " John Nelson had stood by her dying lied at the very end ; he 'd been at the funeral , one of the mourners , being her MI , half-brother and her nighest relation . Ile was the last one of the family to view the remains , and had stayed behind with Alit Weaver and one of the neighbors to see the grave filled up . So to hear she was staying with us now would be amazing enough to him , however I could break it or smooth it down . It was amazing to us. and is now to look back at , only we sort of got used to it after a spell , as you do to anything . " Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being only my first husband 's sister , ? I was Mrs. Bliven when I married Mr. ' Weaver , you know , ? but she had lived with us off and on for years , and she 'd been buried from our house . Mr. Weaver 'd been real good about haying her there , though lots of men would n't have been . she belonging , as you might say , to another dispensation , my first husband 's relations . The fact was , she did n't stay to our house long enough at a time for anybody to get tired of her , ? never staved anywheres long enough for that . She was the fittiest , restlessest , change-ablest person I ever saw or heard of ; and never , never quite satisfied . A week in one place was enough , and more than enough , for Maria . She 'd fidget and fuss and walk up and ( limn , and twitch her feet and wiggle her fingers , and make you too nervous for anything , if she had to stay in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So always just as I was going to be afraid Mr. Weaver would get sick of seeing I faria around and haying a distant relation like her at the table every meal , she 'd come down some morning with her carpet-hag in her hand , and say she . guessed she 'd go over to Haverhill and spend a few days with Mrs. Deacon Colby , or she 'd take the cars for Newbury or Fairlee to visit with the Bishops or Captain Sanborn 's folks , and sometimes as far as Littleton to Jane Spooner 's . Then Mr. Weaver and me , we 'd have a nice quiet spell all to ourselves , and just when We were ready for a change and a mite of company and talk , Maria would come traipsing back . Something did n't suit her , and she was n't satisfied , but she 'd always have lots of news to tell , and we were glad to see her . " Off and on , off and on , that was Maria all over , and more of than on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one , I mean , before the time I 'm telling you about ? it was her getting so restless after she 'd been staying three or four days with aunt Ellen Bragg over to Piermont , and starting for Ironic in a driving snowstorm . She got chilled through and through , took lung fever , and only lived about ten days . " We did everything we could for her , had the best doctor in the neighborhood , and nursed her day and night . Mr. Weaver was real kind , she being only a distant relation , but nothing could raise her up , and she died . We had a real nice funeral , Elder Fuller attending it , and we buried her in our own lot next to Mr. Bliven . It seemed dreadful quiet , and so queer to think that this time she 'd gone for good and all , and that she 'd got to stay now where she was , and not keep coming back in her ' restless , changing kind of way whether sire was satisfied or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe Air . Weaver did , too , though he would n't own it . " And here she was , and here was I half crazy over making up a telegraph to tell John Nelson about it . " She 'd been gone just exactly three weeks to a day , she having died the 11th of March , and it being now the second day of April . " I was sitting at the window about ten o'clock in the forenoon peeling potatoes for dinner . I 'd brought them into the sitting-room because it had a better lookout and was lighter and pleasanter in the morning . It was an early spring that . year , though it came out real wintry afterwards , and the grass was starting up , and the buds showing on the trees , and somehow I got thinking about Maria . She tuns always glad when it came round spring , and she could get about more and visit with folks , and I was thinking where she was , and how she could ever stand it with her changing ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I looked out from the window over towards the river and the bridge , and I saw a woman coining . The infinite I saw her I says to myself , She walks something like Maria Bliven . ' She was coming along pretty quick , though not exactly hurrying , and she had somehow a real Bliven way about her . She came straight on in the direction of our house , and the closer she Caine , the more she walked like Maria . I did IA think it son her , of course , but it gave me a queer feeling to see anybody that favored her so much . The window was open , and I got nearer and nearer to it , and at last stretched my head out and stared down the street , a potato in one hand and the knife in the other . The sun was warm when you were out in it , exercising , and I saw the woman untying her bonnet-strings and throwing them back . Dear me ! that was a real Bliven trick . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting pretty nigh now , and the first thing I knew site looked up at the house and nodded her head just as Maria used to when she came home from visiting . Then in a minute I saw her plain as day . It was Maria Bliven , sure enough ; there was no mistaking her . " I see by your face what you are thinking about ; it 's what strikes every soul I ever tell this to . You 're wondering wh , hike this so cool , as if it was III anytIdeg so Touch out of the common . Well , fir , I place , it all happened a good many year , ago , and I 've gone through a heap Things since then , good and bad lad h. enough to wear off some of the remembering . Anti again , somehow , I took it kiwi of cool even then . It appeared to con ie about so natural , just in the mut. , of things , as you might say , and irk what you might have expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? well , you 'll see it yourself I go on ? there was something about Ma ria mid the way she took it , and seemed to expect us to take it , that kept us from getting excited or scared or so dreadful amazed . " Why , what do you think was the first and only single remark I made as she mule in at the door just as she had eol , IC in fifty times before after visiting a spell I says , ' Why , good-morning , Maria , you ' ve come back . ' And she says , ' Gm al-morning , Lyddy ; yes , I have . ' " That was all , outside , I mean , for wo n't deny there was a swimmy feeling in lay head and a choky feeling down is throat , and a sort of trembly feeling all over as I see Maria drop into a chair awl push her bonnet-strings a mite further back . She sat there a few minutes , tutu , recollect just how long , and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appears to me Maria made some remark about its being warm weather for the beginning of April , and that I said ' t was so . Then sometimes I seem to remember that I asked her if she 'd walked all the way got a lift any part of it . But it do n't hardly appear as if I cottld have said such a foolish thing Its that , and anyways , do n't recollect what site answered . But know she got up pretty soon and said she guessed she 'd go up and take off her things , and she went . " There was one potato dished up that day for dinner with the skin on , and it must have been the one I was holding when I first caught sight of Maria down So , / III the nod . So that goes to show I was a deal flustered and upset , after all . The tint Ildng was to tell Mr. Weaver . 1 ir wa , in the barn , and out I went . I did n't stop to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in him whole , right out . ' Folios , ' Isans. all out of breath , ' Maria Bliven 's back . She 's in her bedroom this minute . taking off her things . ' I never ion tiring back to my mind what he said fir , t . Ile look it kind of calm and cool , as Iii ' always took everything that ever hap-'aims ' since I first knew him . And in a minute he told me to go and telegraph to John Nelson . You see , besides John 's being Maria 's nearest relation , he had charge of the little property she 'd left , and so ' t was pretty important hr should know right on ' that she had n ? t left it for ood . " Now I 've got back to where I begun about that telegraph . Well , I sent it , and John came over from Ilanover next day . I ca n't go On in a very regular , straightahrnd with this account now. , but HI tell what went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer any questions you want to ask , as you appear so interested . Everything went on natural and in the old way after the first . Of course , folks found out pretty quick . Bradford ' s a small ; dace now , and ' t was smaller then , and I do n't suppose there was a man , woman , or child there that did III know within twenty-four hours that Maria had mine hark . There was some talk naturally , but not as much as you 'd think . Folks dropped in , and when they ' d see her looking about as she did before she left , and we going on just the same , why , they got used to it themselves , and the talk most stopped . " But though they thought she was the same as she used to be . I knew slur was n't . It 's hard to put it into words to make you understand , but Maria had n't been many hours in the house before I saw she was dreadful changed . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before she left A : was a great hand to tell about all her doings after she 'd been on one of her vis its . She 'd go all over it to Mr. Weaver and me .. 11.1 it was real interesting . Bid she never ' , aid one singh ? word now about anything that had happened since we saw her last , where she 'd been , what she 'd thine . or anything . She and me , we were together by ourselves a great deal , more than ever before , in fact , for somehow the neighbors ihil come in as much as they used to . Maria was always pleasant to tIn ? nt , but though they said she was just the stone as ever , with nothing queer or alarming about her , I saw they ( lid n ? t feel quite at home with her now , and did n't drop in so often . But sit together , she and me , hours at It time as see might , MITI ' one wool of what I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n ? t I ask her , you . say ? Well , I 111/11 ' 1 k 110W . Sel.111 , 10 1111 ? 110 ? , as I think it all over , that I would do it if 1 could only have the chalice again . You would n ? t hardly believe how I wish and wish now it 's too late that I had asked her things I 'm just longing to know about , now Fin growing old and need to look ahead it little , and particular now Mr. Waver 's gone . and 1 ' in so hungry to know something about him , we having lived together most fifty years , you know . But there was something about Maria that kept me from asking . And sometimes I think there was something that kept her from telling . I feel sure she was On the point of making S01111 ' statement S01110- times , but she could III ; the words would n ? t come ; there did n't seem to be any way of putting the inform:11km @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our part of the country . anyway . Dear me , what lots of times I 've heard her begin something this way , ' When I first got there , l ' ? ' Before I come back , I ' ? Oh , how I 'd prick up my ears and most stop breathing to hear ! But she just stop , seem to be a-thinking about something way , way oft and never , never finish her remarks . ' es , I know you wonder I did n ? t question her about things . As I said before , I ca n't hardly explain why I did n't . 1111t there was something about her looks and her ways , something that , spite of her being the old Maria Bliven I had lived in and out with so many years , somehow made her most like a st ran-gee that I could n't take liberties with . " Mr. Weaver and me , of course , we talked about it when we were all by ourselves , mostly at night , when it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the common soineways . Neither OM of no had ever had anything like it happen before to anybody we knew or beard of . Folks who ' d died , generally , ? no , always , I guess , up to this time , ? died for good , and stayed dead . We were brought up Methodists ; we were both professors , and knew our Bibles and the doctrines of the church pretty well . We knew about two fu tures for the soul , ? the joyful , happy one for the good and faithful , and the dreadful one for the wicked . And we 'd always been learnt that to one of these localities the soul went the very minute , or second , it left the body . That there were folks that held different opinions , and thought there was a betwixt and between district where you stayed on the road , where even the good and faithful might rest and take breath before going into the wonderful glory prepared for them , and where the poor , mistaken , or ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of choosing the right , we did n't know that . I never ' d heard of that doctrine then , though a spell after that I hardly heard anything else . " I do n't know as I told you about Elder Janeway from down South somewhere coming to board with us one summer . He was writing a book called Probation , and he had a way of reading out loud what he was writing in a preaching kind of way , so that you could n't help hearing it all , even if you wanted to . And all day long , while I sat sewing or knitting , or went about my work , baking and ironing and all , I 'd hear that solemn , rumbling voice of his going on about the ' place of departed spirits , ' the Scripture proofs of there being such a place , what it was like , how long folks stayed there , and I do n't hi a what all . That was just before I care down with the fever that I most died with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this talk of the Elder 's appeared to run in my mind when I W. : light headed and wandering , and I cl get dreadful excited about it . " But at the time I was telling about I had n't heard this , so Mr. Weaver and I would talk it over , and wonder and guest and suppose . ' Oh , : Folios , ' I whispered one night , ' you do n't presume Maria is a ? ghost ? " No more than you be , ' says Mr. Weaver , trying , to whisper , but not doing it very well , his voice naturally being a bass one . ' Ghosts , ' lie sacs , ' aft all in white , and go about in a creepy way . allowing there are any such things , wIlieli I do n't . " But what else can she be , Folios , ' I says , ' she having died and been buried , and now back again ? Where 's she , or her soul or spirit , been these three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , I do n't know ; Mr. Weaver would say . And he did n't . No more did I. " Where had she come from that morning when she appeared so unexpected as I sat peeling the potatoes ? Not a single soul had seen her , as far as we could find out , before the very minute I catched sight of her at the turn of the road . Folks had been at their windows or doors , or in their yards all along that very road for miles back , and on the two different la /ails that come into the main one there were plenty of houses full of people , but nobody , not one of them , saw her go by . There was Almy Woolett , whose whole business in life was to know who passed her house , and what they did it for . She was at her front window every minute that forenoon , and it looked right out on the road , not fifteen foot back of where first saw Maria , and she never saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , folks have asked me about that , and I ca n't give them a mite of satisfaction . For the life of me I ca n't remember what she had on before she went up to her room ) ) ) ) ) 1 hok MT her things . I 'm certain sure site was wearing what she went away in. for that was a shroud . In those days , n ii know , bodies was laid out in regular 11 , propriate burying things , made for the occasion , instead of being dressed all up like living beings , as they do nowadays . nd Maria did n't come hack in that way , cot I ! night have thought her a ghost sure ) . ) , , igh . Sometimes I seem to recollect Hint she had on something sort of grayish , II ? d Hack or white , but just about the color of those clouds out there , just over the almost the color of nothing , you might say . But there , I ai n't sure , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some-t ping I never ' , I seen her wear before , and she inwer wore again , for when she came downstairs she was dressed in her old 1 ) 111 , , gingham , with a white tic apron . I own up I did look about everywheres I could think of for the things she came in , hut I could n't find them high nor low . Not a sign of them was there in her bedroom , in the closet or chest of drawers , or her little leather trunk , and I 'm certain sure they was n't anywheres in the house when I ransacked for them , and that was n't two hours after Maria came back . " It 's only little specks of things I can tell you about that happened after this , anything , I mean , that had to do with her queer experience . I watched her close , and took notice of the least thing that seemed to bear on that . She complained a good deal of being lonesome , and when I recommended her going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so sorrowful and sad , " There ai n't anybody of my kind here , not a single one ; I 'm all alone in the world . ' And , take it one way , she was . " One day she and me were sitting logether in the kitchen , and one of Billy Lane 's boys came to the door to borrow some saleratus . After he 'd gone , I says to Maria , ' I told you , did n't I , that Billy Lane died last month ? He died of lockjaw , and it came on so sudden and violent he was n't able to tell how he hurt himself . They found a wound on his foot , butdo n't know how it came . ' ' Oh , ' say , Maria , as quiet and natural as you please , ' he told inc he stepped on a rusts ' nail down by the new fence . ' I was just going to speak up quick , and ask how in the world he could have told her that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lid , when she started , put on one of her queer looks , and says , " There , I forgot to stint my blinds , and it 's real sunny , ' and went upstairs . " The first ( lentil that we lied in Bradford after her coming back was little Susan Garret . We ' d heard she was sick , but did /II know she was dangerous , and lucre dreadful surprised when ' Arr . Weaver came in to supper and told us she was dead . I felt sorry for tics . Garret , a Widow with only one other child , and that a sickly boy , lint I must say I was surprised to see how Maria took it to heart . She turned real white , kept twisting her hands together , and sort of moaning out , ' Oh , I wish I 'd knowed she was going , I wish I 'd knowed . If she 'd only wait just a minute for me , ' and crazy , nervy things like that . I had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down , she was so excited like . She did IA calm down right away , and when I heard her say sort of to herself , ' Oh , if I could only a seen her ! ' I says , ' Why , Maria , you can see her . We 'll run right over there now . I guess they 've laid the poor child out by this time , and they 'll let is see the body . ' Such a look as Maria gave me , real scornful , as you might say , as she says , ' That ! see that What good would it do to see that I want to know . ' Why , I tell you it made me feel for a minute as if a body was of no account at all , least-ways in Maria 's opinion . And yet she 'd used hers to come back in anyways ! ' T was quite a spell before she cooled down , and she never explained why it worked her up so , and I 'm sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Susan had gone to the place she herself had conic away from , and wished she had known in time to go back along with her just for company , or again , 120 . ti. , ( it bller/ Nord whether she felt bad because she had Wt had a chance to give the child some advice or directions that would have helped her along on the road that Maria knew and nobody eke probably in all that comity did know , why , I have Wt an idea . " I believe I told you a ways back that after she got home Maria all the time 1101 a kind of look and way as if shod done something she had n't ought to done , or Wati somewhere she had n't any business to be , somehow as if she belonged somewhere else . " In the old days she was n ' ever satisfied long at a time in any place , but she was always pleased to get back , least ways for a spell . But from the minute she came this time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was always sort of listening and watching , as if she expected something to happen , starling at the least bit of noise , and jumping if anybody knocked or even Caine by the gate . She got dreadful white , and so poor she did n't weigh 110 inmai than It child , and such little trifling things worked her up . For instance , we ball heard a spell before , Mr. Weaver and me , that Mr. Tewksbury over at South Newbury was dead , and we believed it , not knowing anything to the contrary . But one day Mr. Weaver came in and he says , Lyddy , you recollect We heard the other day that Silas Tewksbury was dead : ' Well , I met him just now coming over the bridge . ' Maria was in the room , and first thing we knew she gave a kind of screech , and put her two hands together , and she says , ' Oh no , no , no , not another of us ! I thought ' t was only me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they meant . They said it would n't end with me ; they begged me not to try ; and now I'r'e started it , and it wo n't never stop . They 'll all come back , all , every single one of ' cm , ' and she cried and moaned till we Were at our wits ' ends what to do . It was nit till she found out that Mr. Tewksbury had ml ever ( lied at all , but was his brother at White River Junction that was taken off , that she got quiet . " So it went MI , Maria sort of wearing out with worrying and grieving alsint something she could n't seem to tell about except by little hintings and spell . and IIre Weaver and me , we W0111/1 , i11,4 and surmising and talking all alone nigh in whispers . We did n't understand course , but we 'd made up our ' Mink one or kvo points , and agreed on thew . Maria had never been to heaven , we sure or that . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . V-body , even the most discontented and changeablest being ever made , would leave that place of perfect rest and pite , for this lonesome , dying , changing world , now would they r And as for the ( Alter why , I just know certain , certain sure she 'd never been there . That won hl have showed in her face , and her tn. and her ways . If it is one little mite like what I 've always been learnt it is , ? lie minute , one second spent there would alter you so dreadfully you 'd never he recognized again by your highest and dearest . And Maria was a good W0/17:111 , a Christian Woman . Her biggest fault was only her fretting and finding fault , and wanting to change about and find something better . Oh no , no ; wherever Maria Bliven had come from that morning in April it was n't from that place of punishment , we felt sure of that , File . Weaver and me . As I said once before , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead to go to . But from things Maria let drop , and the way she behaved , and our own thinking and studying over it , we began to come to this , that maybe there was a stopping-place on the road before it forked , ? to put it into this world 's sort of talk , ? where bilks could rest and straighten out their beliefs and learn what to expect , bow to look at things , and try and be tried . Last summer I heard a new word , and it shank me hard . Mrs. Deacon Spinner told ow her soh had gone off to learn new Way , i4 farming and gardening and such . She said they bad places nowadays where they learnt boys all that , and they called hein ' Experiment Stations . ' The min- heard that I says to myself , " r hat 's he name ! That 's what the place where ! aria Caine back from , and that Elder I:II/CW:1V knew so much about , had ought m be called , an Experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Ma ? in 's day , I 'd never heard or this name no more than I had of Janeway , and the place or state he was always writing and talking about . ISut. after all , I do n't ' relieve I care to go wet on what ma and pa and all the good folk , of old times held on those subjects . There was n't any mincing matters those days ; ' t was the very best or the very aural for everybody as soon as they departed this life , and no complaints made . ' 111 certain sure any of those ancestors of ! ak , , particular on the Wells side ? that was pa 's , you kow ? would have taken the worst , and been cheerful about it , too , rather than have had the whole plan upset and a half-and-half place interduced . But then , if there ai n't such a locality , where in the world did Maria come from that time ? I tell you , it beats me . " Now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't told you about , that 1 do n't believe I ever told anybody about ; I do n't know as I can tell it 110sy . It is like a sound that comes to you from way , way off , that you think you catch , and then it 's gone . It was just only a word Maria used two or three times alter she came back , a dreadful , dreadful curious word . It was n't like any word I ever heard spoke or read in a book ; ' I was n't anything I can shape out in my mind to bring back now . First time I heard it she was sitting on the doorstep at night , all by herself . It was a nice night with no moon , but thousands of shining little stars , and the sky so sort of dark bluish and way , way off . Maria did III know I was nigh , but I was , and I was peeking at her as she sat there . She looked up right overhead at the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke that word , that curious , singular word . I say she spoke it , and that I heard it , but somehow that do n't make it plain what I mean . Seem ' s if she only meant it , thought it , and I sort of eatched it , felt it ? Oh , that sounds like crazy talk , I know , but I watt do any better . Somehow I knew without using my ears that she was saying or thinking a word , the strangest , meaningest , oh , the curiousest word ! And once she said it in her sleep when I went into her room in the night , and another time as she sat by her ( twit grave in the little burping-ground , and I had followed her there unbeknownst . I tell you , that was n't any word they use in Vermont , or in the roiled Stales , or anywheres in this whole living world . It was a word Maria brought back , I 'm certain sure front ? well , wherever she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Maria those days , growing poorer and poorer , and bleaclieder and bleacheder , and failing up steady as the clays went by . And one day just at dusk , when she and me were sitting by ourselves . I mustered up courage to speak out . Maria , ' I says , ' you do n't appear to be satisfied these times . ' " ' Satisfied ! ' she says , ' course I ai n't . Was I ever satisfied in all my horn days ? Was n't that the trouble with me from the beginning ? Ai n't it that got me into all this dreadful trouble ? Denry , Cleary me , if I 'd only a stayed where ' ? She shut up quick and sudden , looking so mournful and sorry and wore out that I could n't hold in another minute , and I burst out , ' Maria , if you feel that way about it , and I can see myself it 's just killing you , why in the world do n't you ? go back again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but Maria took it real quiet . ' Do n't you suppose I 've thought of that myself 1 ' she says . ' I ai n't thought of much else lately , I tell you . But as far 's I know , and 1 know a lot more than you do about it , there ai n't but just one way to go there , and that , ' she says , speaking kind of low and solemn , ' that is ? the way ? I went before . And I own up , Lyddy , ' says she , ' I 'm secret 0 ' that way , and I scursely dast to do it again . ' Bat , ' I says , getting bolder when I saw she was n't 122 A Dissatified Soul offended at my speaking , ' you say yourself you ai n't sure . Maybe there is some other way of getting back ; there 's that way ? well , that way you came from there , you know . ' " " That 's different , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying over something all the evening , and after she went to her bedroom she was walking about , up and down , up and down , the biggest part of the night . In the morning when it got to be nigh on to seven o'clock , and she not come down , I felt something had happened , and went up to her room . She was n't there . The bed was made up , and everything fixed neat and nice , and she had gone away . " ' Oh , dear , ' I says to Mr. Weaver , that poor thing has started off all alone , weak as she is , to find her way back . ' ' flack where ? ' says Pollos . Just as if I knew . " Mit see both agreed on one point . We could n't do anything . We felt to realize our own ignorance , and that this was a thing Maria most cipher out by herself , or with somebody that was way , way above us to help her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go about my work as if nothing had happened , and I could n't get out of my head for one single minute that poor woman on her curious , lonesoMe travels . Would she find the road ? I kept a-thinking to myself , and was it a hard , dark one like the one everybody else had to go on before they got to the afterwards-life , a valley full of shadows , according to Scripture , with a black , sleep river to ford , a ' swelling flood , ' as the hymn says ? " Well , the day went by somehow , ? most days do , however slow they seem to drag along , ? and the night came on . Though we did n't mean to meddle or interfere in this matter , Mr. Weaver and me , we had asked a few questions of folks who dropped in or went by that day . Maria had been seen by people all along the same road she had come home by that other time , and on both the roads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and white she looked , had offered her a ride , but whichever direct IOU they were going she had always answered the smut thing , that she was n't going their way . It was nigh nine o'clock , and we were juA shutting up the house for the night , when I heard steps outside and the gee . streaked . " I felt in a minute that it was Maria . and I opened the door as quick as I could . There she was trying to get up the step. , and looking just ready to drop and die right there and then . It took Pollos and me boils to get her in and upstairs . It was n't any time for questions , but when Mr. Weaver had gone , and I was getting her to bed , I says , as I sass ' her white face with that dreadful look of disappointeslness , ' You poor thing , you 're all bent out . ' Yes , ' she whispers , her voice most gone she was so wore out , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't but one , ? leastways to go there by , ? and that 's the way I went first-off . I 'd oughter known it . I 'd oughter known it . ' " I could n't bear to see her so sorrowful and troubled , and I said what I could to comfort her by using Scripture words and repeating the promises made there abseil that dark valley and the deep waters , and the help and company provided for the journey . But that mournful look never left her face , and she kept a-whispering , " fluff ' s for once ; not a word about the second time . Mebbe there ai n't any provision for the second time . ' And what could I say ? " I believe I have n't told you how much time the poor woman spent those days in the graveyard , sitting by her own grave . I ca n't get over that , even after all ths , e years , that queer , uncommon sight of a person watching over their own burying place , weeding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I do n't see why , either . I do n't even know whether her body was there . Folks do n't have two , and she 'd brought one back , and was in it now . And , asfar as we could see , it was the very same body she wore when she died , and that we 'd buried next A Dissati4ed , Sorrl 1f3 kt Bliven . Anyway , she appeared to I Le that place , and showed a lot of intertk hi taking care of it . There was n't au , headstone . We had ordered one , but clhad i t come home when she returned , Alit ! we had told Mr. Stevens to keep it a : pelt till we fixed what to do about it . I rctis glad it was n't up . I ca n't think of itovihing that would be more Irving than f ? see your own gravestone with your 11:111Ie and age and day you ( lied , with a consoling verse , all cut out plain on it . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . sweet-Williams on that grave . flit . looked sort of ashamed when she saw I was watching her , and she says , a mite bashful , ' Von know they seas always her favorite posies . ' Whose I ' I asked , just ttt see what she 'd say . But she was so busy fixing the sweet-Williams she did n't rh , any notice . " Maria failed up after this right along , and pretty soon she was that weak she voult n't get as far as the graveyard , hardly even down to the gate . And I says to Mr. Weaver that she need n't worry about finding the way back to where she belonged , for she 'd just go as she went the other time if she did n't flesh up and get a little ruggeder . One day , When I Went into her room , she says to me , Itryddy , I want help , and mebbe I can get it in the old Wily we used to try . You fetch toe the big Bible and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a verse and then you read it out . Mebbe they ' 11 take that way of telling inc what to do , just mebbe . ' " I never approved of that kind of getting help , it always seemed like tempting , Providence , but I felt I must do most anything that would help satisfy that poor woman , and I got the Bible . She opened it , her lean hands shirking , and she laid one of her bony fingers on a passage . I must say it took my breath away when I saw how appropriate it was , how pat it came in . T seas in Ezekiel , and it went this way : He shall not return by the gate whereby he came in . ' " Maria give a sort of cry and laid her head back against the pillow on the big chair she was sitting in . " Phere , there , ' she says , all shaking and weak- , ' I most knew it afore , and now I In certain sure . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so she did . After all , I was n't with her when she went , and it was n't from our house she started . I got run down and ' Mulling from taking care of her and studying how to help her out of her troubles . So : Mr. WeaV ? r wrote to John Nelson , and after a spell it was fixed that he should take Maria over to his house in Hanover . and he did . It was a hard journey for her , so weak as she seas , and she did n't stand it very well . But she had one more journey to take , the one she 'd been dreading so long , and trying to put off . " It was n't so dreadful hard , I guess , after all , for they said she fell asleep at the last like a baby . Just before she went , she says very quiet and calm , all the worry and fret gone out of her voice , she says to John and Harriet , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I guess drosyse oft a mite . And mebbe I 'll be let to go in my sleep . ' Then in a minute she says slow and sleepy , her eyes shut up , ' And if I do , wherever they carry me this time , I guess when I wake up I shall ? be ? . satisfied , ' and she dropped nit . " I guess sire was , for she went for good that time and stayed . She was buried there in Hanover in John 's lot . We all thought ' t was best . It would have been awk'ard about the old grave , you know , whether to open it or not , and what to do about the coffin . So we thought ' t was better to start all over again as if ' t was the first time , with everything bran-new , and nothing second-handed , and we did . But Maria Bliven 's the only person I know that 's got two graves . There 's only one headstone , though , for rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he altering the reading on it a little to suit the occasion . You see , the first time we ' d bad on it aline that was used a good deal on gravestones then , ' Gone for- ever . ' That did n't turn out exactly appropriate , so we had it cut out , and this time we had on ? Elder Fuller put it into our heads ? that Scripture verse , a good deal like Maria 's dying words , though I do n't believe she knew she was quoting when she said it , I shall be satisfied . ' " " Well , " said good Elder Lincoln one July day as see met on the Lisbon road , " have you heard Mrs. Weaver 's account of Maria Bliven 's unexpected return ? " The Elder had been at Streeter Pond fishing for pickerel , for he belonged to that class styled by dear old Jimmy Whitcher " fishin ' ministers . " He had not met with great success that day , but he had been all the morning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodsy , free look which seemed to dissipate shadows , doubts , and dreads . " Yes , " I replied , " I have heard it all . What in the world do you make of it ? " " Well , I do n't make anything of it , " said the Elder . " There 's no conspital , , , moral to that story . Mrs. Weaver did nod make the most of her opportunities . a al we do not gain much new light from bd. account . Old Cephas Janeway , uloi wrote a ponderous work on Prolnil : , , which nobody read , was largely resia /a. sible , I guess , for the feverish dream nf the old woman . But to her it 's all true . real , something that actually happened . And , do you know , somehow 1 alloosi believe it myself as I listen to the homely details , and it brings ' thoughts bum . ' the reaches of our souls . ' " He was silent a minute , then taking op his fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the lid , looked with unseeing eyes at its contents , and said absently , " I ca n't help wishing I had oat Maria after she Caine back . There is just one thing " ? He did not complete sentence , and I saw that his thoughts were far away . With a good-by wool which I know he did not hear , I turned aside , leaving him there in the dusty road .
