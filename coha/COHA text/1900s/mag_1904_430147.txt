 |p465  IN the Louisville jail lies a young man under sentence of death for the murder of William Goebel , who died Governor of Kentucky , four years ago . The prisoner is Caleb Powers . Since his arrest in March , 1900 . Powers has not known an hour of liberty . Three times he has been tried for this crime ; three times convicted ; two of the convictions condemning him to life imprisonment , and the last , condemning him to be hanged . A situation well-nigh hopeless he has faced each day with the unfailing front of hope . Conditions that would have broken  |p466  down ninety-nine out of a hundred of even the most hardened criminals have failed to weaken the courage or undermine the selfcontrol of this young man of thirty-two . When I saw him in the Louisville jail , there was nothing in his appearance or bearing to indicate his long ordeal . He is a fine type of the mountaineer ; tall , slenderly but strongly built , with a clear and open face , an eye that looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a set chin and mouth in which the lines of youth have hardened into grim resolution and endurance . Of his own attitude toward the case he had nothing to say , beyond the simple asseveration of innocence . I had no more to do with the killing of Senator Goebel than you had . They convicted me , not on evidence , but on belief and prejudice ? as they convicted Jim Howard , " he added , with a kindly glance at his companion in the jail , who is under life sentence for the same crime . " I am absolutely innocent of any part in the murder . " Then he went on to tell of the legal and political aspects of the trials . And , as he talked , I found myself forgetting that this man had any interest in the case except as a problem . Never once did he strike the note of personality . I had seen one of his counsel , as he inveighed against the injustice of the prosecution , walk up and down his office with twitching hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Caleb Powers , with the noose dangling above his head , marshaled , in his quiet even tones , the logical facts of the case , admitting here the imprudence of some of his actions , regretting there a step that laid him open to misconstruction , but always insisting upon the potency of the facts that exculpated him , and the inadequacy of the testimony that tended to connect him with the crime . Could a jury be found in your State to convict a defendant on such evidence ? " he asked in conclusion , and awaited the answer with the detached interest of one who has been propounding a hypothetical case . How deeply the bitterness of the Goebel killing has entered into the daily life of Kentucky no outsider can fully realize . The animosities engendered by it have brought about literally scores of fatal quarrels . Business partnerships have been dissolved ; churches have been disrupted ; lifelong friendships have been withered ; families have been split ; there is no locality so remote , no circle so close knit , as to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discusses the Goebel killing literally at peril of his life . At the capital of the State people dare not yet talk freely of it . The spirit which , during the imprisonment of Powers in Frankfort , prompted the persecution of some ladies who sent food to the prisoner , in such petty ways as the ruining of their gardens , the poisoning of their domestic pets , and the inspiring of insulting paragraphs in the local paper , is still alive . Within a few months certain prominent families of the little city were suspected of " talking too much . " No specific threats were made , but their outhouses and barns began to catch fire mysteriously . They ceased from any further expression of opinion on the Powers case . Even in the small matters of social life the bitterness has persevered , and the young wife of Governor Beckham , a woman of charming personality and a member of an old and prominent Kentucky family , was for a long time all but ostracized in a place of which she is , officially , the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emotional and sentimental considerations naturally constituted the Goebel wing of the Democratic party ? its most corrupt element ? Goebel 's political heirs . The demand for revenge was their rallying cry . As recently as the last gubernatorial campaign this was an issue . It has helped to fasten upon Kentucky the rule of the worst , and to put Louisville , the principal city , in the control of a self-perpetuating minority . It has produced and manipulated two great funds , of which no accounting has yet been made : the Goebel detection fund , and the Goebel monument fund collected from office-holders under pressure . It drove from its fellowship for a time the old-line Democrats , the men who upheld the honorable ideals that survived the defeat of the Civil War . Now these older Democrats are coming hack into the fold ; some shamefacedly , some with loud outcry of party loyalty . To speak to them of the famous case is to prod an open sore . When the time comes , they will raise their voices in a last appeal to save Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gist of the cause that has so embittered an entire commonwealth ? To understand it , one must go back to the career of that remarkable politician , William Goebel . Goebel , in 1899 , had established himself as the dictator of the Democratic party . In the previous year he had forced through the Legislature a bill of startling boldness , known as the " Goebel law . " This law vested in a partizan board of three members , elected by the Legislature for a term of four years , the power to canvass the election returns , to adjudicate contests , and to determine which candidate was elected . Practically , it was designed to give to three men , chosen at Goebel 's behest , the governor-making power , and to establish Goebel as absolute dictator of the State . This was the point at which ordinary partizan antagonism deepened into a far more violent feeling . Goebel became personally the object of such hatred as no man of his time had inspired ; perhaps , too , of a more unquestioning loyalty than any member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying was current among the Republicans that he would never live to profit by his own law . " There were five hundred good men in Kentucky ? not hired assassins , but men of standing ? who stood ready to pick a quarrel with Goebel on the street , and kill him , as he killed Sandford , " declares a Kentuckian who thoroughly knows his State . " Knowing this , he kept himself surrounded by a body-guard . " Nor was the opposition of the conservative , old-line Democrats much less keen . Such leading papers as the Louisville Post , the Lexington Herald , and the Louisville Courier Journal attacked the measure with the utmost vehemence , and sounded the warning against what they termed despotism . Later , Goebel , by the methods of which he was master , brought the CourierJournal into line again . " The signing of the Election bill will prove to be the signing of Goebel 's death warrant , " a prominent Democrat wrote in his record at that time , and after the shooting he showed the prophecy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governorship was Goebel 's goal . In the convention following the passage of the Goebel law , he was the weakest of three candidates , yet , by a wonderful combination of force and craft , he secured the nomination . William J. Bryan threw all the power of his influence to Goebel , and it was needed , for the old-line Democrats , charging treachery , nominated a third ticket . In a campaign of unprecedented bitterness , William S. Taylor , the Republican candidate , received a majority of the votes cast . Still , there was the Democratic election board to be heard from . To Goebel 's consternation , his own board confirmed the election of Taylor by a vote of two to one . Goebel appealed from his own board to his own Legislature . He was then State Senator ; the Legislature in both houses was slightly Democratic , and it is a notable feature of his political power that , even in disaster , he held his party in the hollow of his hand . He set on foot a movement to throw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinness of the paper on which the ballots were printed , and declare himself legally the Governor of the State . Kentucky seethed . In many localities active preparations for an armed campaign began . Meetings were held , at which speeches of the most incendiary kind and threats of the most violent description inflamed the people . Letters and telegrams poured in from Kentuckians who had moved away , some of them years before , to Virginia and West Virginia to Ohio , Indiana , Tennessee ; even , in the case of one family , to Massachusetts , volunteering to return with their arms and take their part in a righteous war . A great cry went up from the Republicans ? in which the antiGoebel Democrats joined ? that the stealing of the State must not be permitted ; that Goebel must be kept from the Executive chair , if necessary , at the rifle 's muzzle . The little capital city of Frankfort filled up with the fighting men of both parties . Goebel 's supporters had stocked the municipal buildings with arms , and had men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials had manned the Executive Building as if for a siege . The militia were under arms , ready for instant response to any call . Almost every member of both houses of the Legislature went to the sessions heavily armed . Rumors flew broadcast : the Democrats were preparing to capture the Executive Building by an armed sally : the Republicans had a plot to wipe out the Democratic majority in the Legislature  |p468  by a volley from the gallery ; Governor Taylor was to be shot ; Senator Goebel was to be dynamited ; the State House was to be seized ? blown up ? burned . And so on . Civil war seemed imminent ; almost inevitable . At this point of extreme tension , Caleb Powers , the newly elected Republican Secretary of State , sprang into prominence by organizing and bringing into Frankfort a regiment of men from his own mountain district . This district is strongly Republican . It is a region where men are habituated to the use of the rifle and the revolver ; where the feud has flourished , human life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as it was henceforth to be called , was armed to the teeth . It was well under the control of Powers , who had been at West Point a year and had a natural aptitude for military matters . Ostensibly its purpose was to petition the Legislature , which it had a perfect right to do ; its members had even the right to bear arms ; but it may be imagined that the appearance of hundreds of rifle-bearing men in the State capital at this time had a far from pacific aspect . It may even be inferred that if fighting was to come about , Powers 's men would take a hand in it . This " mountain army " movement focused all eyes upon Caleb Powers as the leader of the Republican element that would fight rather than be ousted . This was to tell heavily against him on the trials . For days there had been casual expression that Senator Goebel was to be killed . This became common talk among the mountaineers . It was as common on Capitol Square as taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's star witnesses , later . Goebel himself appreciated his danger . He went nowhere without one or the other of his body-guard ? Jack Chinn and Eph Lillard , fighting men of the true Kentucky type . When he heard that the mountain men were coming he sent for a friend of Lieutenant-Governor John Marshall , presiding officer of the State Senate in which Goebel was then serving . Take a message from me to Marshall , " said he . " Tell him I understand that there is a scheme to kill off the Democrats in the Legislature . " " If there is any such plot , you know John Marshall would be the last one to have any knowledge of it , " said the man . " Never mind that . Tell him that at the first shot , I 'll kill him , " said Goebel. who already had one killing to his credit . He 's got to take the chances of war . " " Marshall does n't go armed , " replied Marshall 's friend . ' Everybody knows that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kill him , " repeated Goebel doggedly . Marshall never learned of the message until after Goebel 's death . Meantime , with the aid of the others , he had persuaded Powers to send hack his " mountain army , " the well-armed but terrified Legislature having refused to receive its petition . At the time of the shooting of Goebel , there were only a few stragglers from this body left in town . On the morning of January 30 , 1900 , Powers set out for the western part of the State to bring in a body of petitioners of more peaceful aspect . That same day Jim Howard , of Clay County feud fame , came to town with the purpose of asking from Governor Taylor a pardon for the killing of George Baker . That morning ' l aylor was in his office , holding a consultation with his officials and other prominent Republicans . The contest in the Legislature was then going on . As Senator Goebel was on his way across Capitol Square , a shot rang out loud and clear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots which sounded muflied . Senator Goebel half turned and sank to his knees , groaning . Jack Chinn , who was his escort , ran to the Capitol steps , his pistol drawn . Bystanders hurried to the wounded man , and it was found that a bullet had passed through his body in such a way as to ensure a fatal result . Instantly the square filled with armed Democrats . Some one cried out that the shot had been fired from the office adjoining Governor Taylor 's . " Tear the building down and hang every in it , " yelled a voice . There was a wild shout in reply and the mob began to form . It needed but a leader . As it hesitated the militia came down on the double-quick , entered the square , and formed a protective barrier about the Executive Building . Cooler heads among the Democrats now counseled moderation , beseeching the crowd to await some definite word  |p469  from the wounded man . Had Senator Goebel died that day war could not have been averted . But he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriated Democratic majority in the Legislature of the State , with only a hopeless and perfunctory opposition from the Republicans , having thrown out enough ballots to change the result ; and he left the conduct of the State to Lieutenant-Governor Beckham . Taylor and his entire administration ceased to have any official standing . The first murderous resentment had now calmed down to a more definitely and coolly planned revenge . Men were indicted right and left , thirteen in the first lot . Evidence was sought against every man known to have been in the Executive Building when the shot was fired , and one man known not to have been there ? Caleb Powers . Many of the indictments were obtained on evidence so flimsy that the trials were farcical . Gradually the spirit of vengeance began to concentrate upon Governor Taylor , because he was the head of the party , and Caleb Powers , because of his prominence as the leader of the " mountain army . " Hang Taylor and damn the Republican party " became the watchword of the Democrats . Governor Taylor fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kentucky demanded his extradition . Indiana refused it . Never since then has he set foot on Kentucky soil . In the light of subsequent events his judgment seems to have been good . The Powers case shows that if Taylor were caught in Kentucky to-day , nothing on earth could save him from conviction and hanging at the hands of a Democratic court . Baffled of the chief object of their vengeance , the Democrats turned their wrath upon Powers . Against the advice of his friends , including Lieutenant-Governor Marshall , Powers now attempted to escape in the disguise of a militiaman , together with the captain of the Capitol police , who had also been indicted . He was discovered on the train . arrested , and brutally maltreated before being lodged in jail . On him was found a pardon from Governor Taylor for the killing of William Goebel . This was afterward a strong point against him on his trial . It must be understood , however , that under the Kentucky laws a pardon does not imply guilt , and that it is operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similar pardons were issued by Governor Taylor to several others of those indicted for the murder of Goebel . The prosecution 's case was that Howard had been summoned by Governor Taylor to kill Senator Goebel , and that Powers was an accomplice in the plot and arranged for Howard 's admittance to the Secretary of State 's office , whence the shot was fired . Howard , safe in his own Clay County fastnesses , where he could have eluded pursuit for a lifetime , came to Frankfort and gave himself up on learning that he was wanted . Henry Youtsey , the State Auditor 's stenographer , was also charged with complicity and arrested , In the impending legal battle for the conviction of Powers , all the material advantages were on the side of the prosecution . They controlled the machinery of politics down to the very jailers in whose charge the prisoners were . An appropriation of $100,000 had been made by the Legislature as a fund for the detection and prosecution of Senator Goebel 's slayer , and this was placed at the disposal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Colonel Tom C. Campbell , of Cincinnati and New York , was employed . Colonel Campbell 's methods of obtaining testimony and handling juries in criminal cases some years before had so incensed the Ohio public that they led to the famous Hamilton County riots in which the court-house was burned , the jail wrecked , and forty-five people killed ; and Campbell , ( who recently died in New York ) had been obliged to leave the State . The bench was occupied by Judge James E. Cantrill , a Goebel Democrat and a friend of the dead leader . The processes of obtaining jurymen were under the management of Goebel office-holders . Powers 's counsel obtained a change of venue and the trial was held at Georgetown , Scott County , a community almost as strongly Democratic as Frankfort , in the same judicial district . From the first it was apparent that Powers was to be found guilty at any cost . A legal trial he might have ; but a fair trial was beyond all hope . In the matter of Goebel 's slaying there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . One might as well have expected a judicial attitude of mind from the factions in a feud .  |p470  For , at that time , Kentucky was one great political feud . Had conditions been reversed , had the Republicans held the State Government , and had Powers been tried under Republican auspices , there would have been no better chance of justice . No Republican court would ever have convicted Caleb Powers , though his hands had been red with Goebel 's blood . An equitable consideration of the case , was impossible . Powers would be tried by his friends or by his enemies , according as the Republicans or Democrats were in power , and no one doubts that , innocent or guilty , he would be a free man to-day , pardoned by a Republican governor , had that party been successful at the last election . With the selection of the jury , the case against Powers began to take form . While the law does not expressly prescribe it , the customary method of selecting a jury in Kentucky is by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into the wheel , and the Clerk of the Court draws them by lot . For the trial of Powers , however , a special venire was summoned . Judge Cantrill visited the venire in its private room , apart from the court-room , and there , without having administered any oath , and without having informed the defendant or his counsel , none of whom was present , excused , on his own initiative , a number of those summoned . It is charged that nearly all of those excused were Republicans or anti-Goebel Democrats . As the venire , in its original aspect , was strongly representative of the party then in power , it naturally presented , after the Judge 's weeding-out process , an almost homogeneous appearance of Goebel Democracy . When the panel was finally completed its political complexion was as follows : Democrats , 12 ; Republicans , o . Thus the fate of Caleb Powers , Republican leader , at peril of his life for the murder of a Democratic governor , lay with a Democratic jury , presided over by a Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of a magazine article it is impossible to do more than indicate the lines of the heaped-up evidence adduced from scores of witnesses . The prosecution sought to prove these main issues : That Powers had brought the " mountain army " to Frankfort for the purpose of killing Goebel . That Powers had declared his willingness to kill Goebel with his own hand , if necessary . That Powers had endeavored to hire men to kill Goebel . That Powers had arranged ( his " mountain army " and other plans failing ) to leave his office open to the use of Henry Youtsev and Jim Howard , Governor Taylor 's alleged hirelings , who were to do the murder together . Four principal witnesses were called to prove these points . Of these , one afterward admitted that his testimony was procured by improper means ; a second made an affidavit , later , to the effect that counsel for the prosecution had persuaded him to commit perjury , and had paid him for it ; and the other two , indicted for the same crime as Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with halters around their necks . " These two witnesses are now at liberty . Up to the time of this writing neither has been put on trial , but the indictments are kept hanging over them , contrary to the usual procedure in Kentucky . One is or has been in the pay of Goebel 's brother . Taking their evidence at its face value , it would prove only that Powers 's " mountain army " was brought to Frankfort to shoot Goebel ; that Powers had himself expressed his willingness to kill the Democratic leader ; and that Powers had endeavored to hire men to do the murder . It must be remembered always that Goebel 's death was in no way connected with the " mountain army " movement ; and evidence was lacking on the vital point of connecting Caleb Powers with Jim Howard . In a non-political case no jury that ever sat in a box would have convicted on such evidence . One bit of testimony deserves detailed mention as showing the license of the Commonwealth in the matter of witnesses . The prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Secretary of State 's office . George Franklin Weaver , an itinerant barber , testified that just after the shooting he saw a rifle barrel protruding from the window of Caleb Powers 's office . The defense showed beyond contradiction that all that day Weaver was more than 130 miles distant from Frankfort . On complaint of counsel for the defense Weaver was arrested for perjury . He was arraigned by the Commonwealth , a mistrial resulted , and he was promptly  |p471  released on bail . The amount of bail suggested by the Commonwealth is interesting ; it was $200 . This for the offense of perjury against a man on trial for his life . It can hardly be regarded as a discouragement to similar evidence . Weaver was promptly bailed out , continued his wanderings , and has not been heard of since . The verdict was rendered after an hour 's consideration ? the jury fixing the penalty at life imprisonment . But the Court of Appeals found Judge Cantrill 's sweeping instruction to the jury regarding the limits of conspiracy " not only erroneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . A further hint to the lower court was contained in the expressed regret of the Appellate Court that , in a case concerning which so much feeling existed , impartiality should not have been assured by the use of the jury-wheel . Accordingly , on the second trial the jurywheel was used , but with no helpful result to impartiality . The three jury commissioners appointed by the Court for the purpose of selecting the list of qualified jurymen " packed " the wheel . Out of 200 names drawn therefrom only five were those of Republicans . The number , based on the proportion of white Republicans ( negroes do not serve on Kentucky juries ) to Democrats , should have been about seventy . Not enough of this venire qualified to make up a jury . To fill the tally the commissioners went into the neighboring county of Bourbon , on a tour of summons . Three Democratic office-holders of that county , who knew the political affiliations of every family , escorted them . They passed by the houses of Republicans and anti-Goebel Democrats and selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached a group of three citizens of known standing . Their guides indicated two of the group . These two , Goebel Democrats , were summoned ; the third man , a Republican , was left . On the proportion of white Republicans to Democrats in Bourbon County , there should have been more than fifty Republicans among the 167 summoned ; there were only three . Not one of the few Republicans drawn was permitted to serve on the jury as finally selected . The panel was divided as follows : Goebel Democrats , 12 ; Republicans , o . Again judge Cantrill was on the bench . The defense had presented an affidavit protesting him on the ground of animus exhibited toward the prisoners in the first trial . He refused to vacate , and the second trial began under the same conditions as the first . Much that was unimportant in the first trial was now dropped , but no new evidence of weight was introduced by the prosecution . Again testimony was brought out to show Powers 's relations to the mountain army " ; that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used incendiary language ; again the prosecution lacked any evidence connecting Powers with the alleged murderer , Howard . For the defense it was shown that in a meeting of Republicans before the shooting , a speaker had shown a handful of cartridges , saying ' that the only way to end this contest is to explode a few of these over at the Capitol Hotel , " and that Powers had threatened to leave the meeting if further sentiments of that sort were expressed . The defense also impugned the truthfulness of much of the prosecution 's testimony . As before , there was no case against Powers on which , in a non-political trial , any properly constituted jury could have found him guilty . The verdict was the same as in the first trial , and again Powers was condemned to life imprisonment . The defense now attacked Judge Cantrill , asking the Court of Appeals to remove him from the bench . Claim was made that during the first trial his bearing was consistently antagonistic to the prisoner . The fact of his personal and political friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he made written suggestions to the Commonwealth 's attorney during his argument , that he exhibited bias in his dealings with those summoned for jury duty , that he bitterly censured applause in the court for points made by the defense , but permitted it for points made by the prosecution , and that his attitude toward the counsel for Powers was hostile . Judge Cantrill 's own utterances were cited . Just before the second trial he made a speech at Maysville , in support of his candidacy for the United States Senate . In this speech he claimed the gratitude of his party on the ground that if it were not for his decisions as Judge , on the Election bill , the Prison bill . and other important matters , there would not have been a Democrat holding office at  |p472  the capital of the State . In the course of the trial a correspondent for a Democratic newspaper mentioned Judge Cantrill 's angry demeanor toward the defense . His Honor administered a severe rebuke to the reporter , not on the ground that the report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would hurt the Democratic party in the State ! Concerning the opposition papers he had this to say in a charge to the Grand Jury : I do not hesitate to denounce their conduct . . . as the conduct of a lot of lecherous , libelous , cowardly curs that no community ought to tolerate . " In the same document he declared that the officers of your court , including your judge , have been weekly and monthly threatened with assassination for their efforts to discharge their duties . " On this showing the Court of Appeals reversed the finding of the trial court , declaring that judge Cantrill should have vacated the bench on presentation of the affidavit charging prejudice before the second trial . A third trial was ordered . Still Judge Cantrill refused to vacate . He defended his action on the ground that the Appellate Court had split on the question , only the Republican majority voting against him . A new Court of Appeals was soon to be elected . He would await their decision . This was , in substance , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appellate Court of Democratic complexion . The new Court of Appeals , Democratic though it was , affirmed the judgment of its predecessor ; and Judge Cantrill passes out of the case at this point . But the injustice was done . He had committed his court to the conviction of Caleb Powers . After two convictions , certainly Powers must not be acquitted ; Judge Robbins , also a Goebel Democrat , specially appointed by Governor Beckham from the far western part of the State , now assumed the bench . Shortly after , he was appointed a member of the Democratic State Central Committee , but declined to serve . It was a foregone conclusion that the third jury would he made up substantially as were the first and second . Again the jury-wheel was packed ; again , the list having been exhausted , a personally-conducted commission went into Bourbon County to fill the tally , and again the lists were made up almost entirely of the antiPowers faction . One man on the jury finally selected , is pointed to by the prosecution as a Republican . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Goebel 's picture hung in his dining-room ; a Republican in name only . But allowing him to select his own political appellation , the third jury stands : Goebel Democrats , 11 ; Republicans , 1 . After the reversal of the second conviction , the forces of the prosecution awoke to the fact that it was not enough merely to convict Powers on any haphazard evidence . They must advance some testimony that could reasonably be regarded as convincing . Otherwise , they suspected , the Court of Appeals would continue to find reversible error in the decisions of the lower courts . So they produced a new figure , a figure which , in this third trial , bulks so big that it may be regarded as the whole case of the prosecution : the figure of Henry Youtsey . Youtsey had made a confession , after having been convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary for life ; a confession full of the most damning evidence against Caleb Powers . He swore that Powers arranged that the killing of Goebel be done from his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the coast should be clear for Youtsey and Jim Howard ; that he arranged with his brother , John Powers , to hand over the office key to Youtsey ; and that he had previously attempted to get others to kill Goebel for a money reward . Governor Taylor suffered not less than Powers by the testimony of this witness . It was Taylor , he swore , who wrote to Jim Howard , arranging for him to come down from Clay County ; and he , Youtsey , took the letter in shorthand , copied it out , and sent it to Howard . It may be doubted whether even the forces of the prosecution believed that Governor Taylor would dictate to a stenographer a letter whose purport was murder . However , here was evidence on which any jury might convict the accused , if they believed the witness credible and the testimony properly obtained . Who was Henry Youtsey ? At the time of the killing he was a youth of twentythree . Not a man of twenty-three , for he  |p473  was strangely immature . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a desperate character . His boast was that he was the best rifleshot in his county . His favorite occupation was the reading of dime novels . A curious character ; slight , insignificant , furtive ; little known even to those with whom he came in daily official contact . Some flavor of degeneracy emanated from him he was , if not a moral idiot , at least morally stunted . Through political influence he had received an appointment as stenographer to the State Auditor , his office being in the Executive Building , adjoining that of the Secretary of State , Caleb Powers . On his trial the evidence so directly implicated him that he might well have been convicted even before an unbiased jury , had such been obtained instead of the packed panel as in the Powers trial . Seeing that the case was going against him , Youtsey , with the instinct of a child caught in evil , shammed epileptic fits . Later , he smilingly admitted the deception . He admitted also that , on his first trial , he had perjured himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidence in the trial of Powers ; but it has a most important bearing on the credibility of Youtsey 's testimony . Youtsey was imprisoned in the Frankfort jail , conducted by Democratic office-holders . After his sentence , pressure was brought to bear to obtain a confession from him . But Youtsey did n't want to confess . Things were made unpleasant for him . He was put on bread and water for eight consecutive Sundays . No use . The ideals of the dime novel reader involved one good quality , a certain bravado courage . Youtsey 's lips were sealed . He was threatened with floggings ; but the man who could without a quiver endure the excruciating tests for epilepsy  |p474  was not likely to shrink from a mere prison whipping . They put a ball and chain on his ankle . It was bothersome , but the prisoner soon learned to adjust himself to the burden with the least possible discomfort . Now came the wellremembered " torrid spell " when for a fortnight or more central Kentucky grilled in a temperature ranging from 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to the boiler room . Hitherto the only prisoners who had been found able to endure summer work at the furnaces were the sturdiest of the negroes . Two of them were Youtsey 's companions now ; he was supposed to be " assisting " them . Youtsey began to die . He was shifted to the machine shop , and put at a ' ? danger point . " He knew nothing of machinery . His condition was not very good ; the assistant 's post at the furnaces had affected it . It seemed to him that he was in peril from the whirring wheels and the flying belts . Once be became involved in the machinery and narrowly escaped . Finally the romance-inspired nerve broke , and he sent for the attorneys for the prosecution and made a confession . The confession did not meet the wishes of the prosecution ; it was sent back ; Youtsey burned it , and not until he made a second and more satisfactory statement was his condition mitigated . Then he was not only absolved from unpleasant and dangerous labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , released of his striped clothes , sent to the hospital , and practically made free of the prison . It is no part of this article to prophesy ; but there will be many in both parties who will be surprised if Youtsey is not pardoned at the close of the case against Powers . Powers was found guilty a third time . This time , not improbably upon the specific implication of Youtsey , the jury decided upon the death penalty . Sensationally , the feature of the case was a speech by the defendant , summing up his own case -- a speech which , for masterly presentation of facts , has possibly never been equaled , under like conditions , in the history of our legal practice . In it he advanced no theory of the killing ; he accused no other person ; he threw the whole force of his logic upon the one point of his own innocence . It is a generally accepted belief , among those who have followed the evidence , that Youtsey himself did the murder . His own confession , coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets , and that he had frequently spoken of plans to kill Goebel , makes the case against him  |p475  much more convincing than against any other of the accused . Of the many men charged with complicity in the killing of William Goebel , Caleb Powers alone is under the death sentence . Jim Howard , charged with being the principal , is in jail with Powers , sentenced to life imprisonment and awaiting the decision of the Court of Appeals on his third trial . His conviction was accomplished substantially as was that of Powers . Youtsey is comfortably off in the penitentiary , borne up by the expectation of a pardon . The rest are either free of the law or out on bail , with little danger of the cases against them being seriously pressed . For four years Powers has lived behind bars . ' I have almost forgotten what freedom is like , " he said to the writer . He is kept in a dark , unhealthful , old-fashioned jail , which would have broken the health of most men . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let himself deteriorate , even in the small matter of personal neatness . By systematic exercise he has kept his physical condition . By steady self-control he has preserved himself from nervous breakdown . Among prisoners who are , for the most part , of the lowest , most ignorant , and most uncleanly type , he has kept his standards of self-respect in speech and appearance . Any one who has seen him there will be assured that , if Caleb Powers goes to the gallows , it will be not alone with courage , but with dignity . The Powers case is not the case of Caleb Powers alone . It is , potentially , the case of every Kentuckian . Here is a man who , by the sheer influence of political control working through the courts of law , and corrupting their every process , has been three times convicted of a capital crime , on evidence which no unprejudiced court could possibly find sufficient . It does not matter that Caleb Powers was a Republican tried by Democrats instead of a Democrat tried by Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions had been reversed , Powers 's own party would probably have been guilty of an equally gross injustice . Not the party , but the system , is at fault , and the system will remain after the victim has passed . " There , but for the grace of God , " said the old divine , watching the condemned man on his way to Tyburn , " goes John Newton . " With Caleb Powers , but for the grace of God , goes any citizen of Kentucky . Before this shall have been printed , the Court of Appeals will have ruled upon the third trial . Should the verdict be sustained , effort will be made at once to bring the case before the United States Supreme Court , on the ground that the pardon issued by William S. Taylor , the de facto Governor at that time , is legal and operative . If that fails , nothing but the intervention of a Democratic Governor stands between Caleb Powers and the gallows , between the State of Kentucky and the onus of a legal lynching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
