txt If Capt . Sealby of the liner Republic had accepted the aid I offered him immediately after the collision with the Florida , on Saturday last , the ship would be safe in port now , and the cargo and the effects of the passengers would have been saved , beyond the shadow of a doubt . " This statement was made to-day by Capt . Thomas Fenlon of the whaleback steamer City of Everett , which docked at Point Breeze to-day . The Everett arrived near the ' Republic a few minutes ' after the Baltic , and , according to her commander , was the first ship to speak to the disabled Republic . " The ship wider my command , " said Capt . Fenlon , " contains some of the most powerful apparatus for wrecking purposes afloat . Our pumps have a capacity of 40,000 barrels , or 2,000,000 gallons , an hour . The barge we were ' Cowing would have held all the baggage of the passengers of the Republic and a large part of the liner 's cargo besides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and is equipped with tremendously powerful ma- chinery and towing cables seven inches in diameter . With such magnificent facilities right , . at hand , Capt . Sealby curtly declined our assistance , saying that a cpuple of Government boats were coming to his relief . " These little Government boats could have towed a rowboat as well as they could have towed that big liner . We offered our assistance , mind you , at 8:30 o'clock that evening . We could have worked all night . All it would have cost the White Star Line would have been about $20,000 . As . It was , property of all kinds to the value of some $2,000,000 was lost . " The first intimation that we had of anything wrong was a wireless message from the Nantucket Lightship . We have a De Forest instrument on the City of Everett , and there was another on the barge we had in tow . We put about at once and cruised toward the scene of the wreck . Messages of ' still afloat ' kept coming in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to the 116ricla. - 541r , f0:31r , -. raotIk-kVe side the Republic , and I Offered the use of my outfit to Capt . Sealby . He answered that he needed no assistance whatever , ' but asked us to go to the Florida , as all his passengers were on board that boat . At 9:30 o'clock we ran alongside the Florida . " Men and women cried to us. from the liner and offered us large sums of money If we would only take them off . When my first officer , Mr. Tucker , went on board the Florida her first officer handed him a blackjack and told him to use it on the passengers if necessary to keep them from trying to jump from the deck of the Florida to the City of Everett . " We remained in the vicinity all Saturday , night , with the boats all cleared ready to render any assistance if called upon during the transfer of the passengers from the Florida to the Baltic . " On Sunday morning at 9 o'clock we once more ran alongside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by to allow me to help him . Once again he refused my offer , saying that his ship was all right . He said that he had engaged assistance from New York by wireless . I felt desperate at the way things were going , but my hands were tied . The capacity of my barge was 6,000 tons . " On board the City of Everett were nine heavy deep-sea towing hawsers and two spare ones . The City of Everett is a whaleback , built for towing oil barges across the ocean , and our pumps are the most powerful it is possible to build . The fact that the Republic kept afloat by her own efforts until Sunday night is proof positive , to my mind , that with very little help of the proper kind she would have weathered It out , and would be lying safe in New York Harbor to-day . " The City of Everett is the property of the Standard Oil Company .                    @
