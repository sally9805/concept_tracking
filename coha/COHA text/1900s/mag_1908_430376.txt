 |p1166  WE have always had a few decent , plodding , law-abiding novelists who could lay their scenes without involving the heavens and earth in a row about the weather , and could " make love " without disgracing the leading characters . However , these are not what we call " popular , " they merely become the stand and novelists . But of late even the popular novelists appear to be settling down and doing better . There are fewer honorable thieves and noble murderers in this year 's fiction , and not so many other heroes and heroines in it that ought to be in the penitentiary . A few virtues borrowed and exploited by the worst class of social criminals have been returned and now repose beneath the homely , ill-fitting , tight-waisted bodices of good women . ( If you have ever thought about it , virtues do not demand nearly so much " style " upon the person they inhabit as vice does ! ) . Even the socialistic , muck-raking novelists , those unfortunate writers obsessed with the vice-vision of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expression in fiction , or , not so many of them are writing it . Probably the latter is the true explanation . They are passing out of this primary stage of developing their theories . Their dramatic instinct belongs to the underworld , anyhow , and they think they are reformers only because they can not think clearly . They are really scandal-dramatists who would be idiots if all abuses and indecencies were removed from life . They would have nothing to think , no atmosphere for their lurid minds . This accounts for the gradual passing of the socialist out of fiction who was the most prominent figure in it two or three years ago , when his language still had the monkey hair on it . He was a strange animal at the time . Now he is n't . He is being digested by the industrial and political diplomats and economists , his theories are being rejected or  |p1167  assimilated according to the prevailing sense of honesty and propriety . He is simply the political bell of discontent now , and a very good institution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His method is wrong . And when the method is wrong , the institution will fail . During his recent romantic period the literary means to his end employed by the socialist-novelist were neither enlightened nor proper . He was too much like his downtrodden thieves and noble murderers in his unscrupulous method of collecting material . Take Upton Sinclair for example . He is a good man , a righteous man , so far as socialism can produce either , and his sincerity of purpose is tragic in its intensity , but he lacks that delicacy , commonly known as self-respect , which , if gossip is true , permitted him to play butler behind a rich man 's chair in order to eavesdrop from him material for his last novel . The trouble with such men is that they are a reversion to the type produced by the abuses of our time and they have lost certain qualities in the backward fling . Not one of them , therefore , realizes that it is immoral to get copy like a thief . The padlock of civilization has been broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legalized thieving in the rest of us further advanced in the proprieties of civilization . Now here is the conclusion : never in real life when we come in contact with these people do we feel as if we were associating with our own kind ; they are different , you know , with a slight , shocking scent of the aboriginal about them . And when they first appeared in fiction they had the advantage of seeming unreal to us , and therefore not dangerous . But of late , merely as a matter of taste , we are rejecting them there also . We admit their buzzard genius , and we even admit the need of such geniuses , but for the sake of our literary stomachs we prefer that they would do what is native to them somewhere else than in fiction . Their most characteristic work is an inspired insult to a very fine art that has never been treated with the respect it deserves . Besides the passing of the muck-raking novelists there are other signs of better conditions . It is significant that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas Sedgwick 's new novel does not include the ablest book she has ever written . Now , " The Shadow of Life , " the name of the omitted novel , was a brilliant as well as a profound study of life , but it was one of the most disillusionizing , depressing stories to be found in modern literature . And the inference is that the author has sacrificed her claims to this splendid book because it does not add to a writer 's popularity , nor insure the sale of her new story , to be recognized as the author of a convincing horror . The world is accustomed to its own hand-made horrors , and even takes a morbid interest in seeing them dramatized , but when it comes to accepting the proof that every man has as good reason as a tortured beast for killing himself , the world draws back , pinches itself to make sure of its old , hardened reality , and says : " None of that for me ! I may commit my sins and go astray in my night-times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its only virtue -- Hope . " The diverting thing is that one who could dramatize so well the futility of all human desires should seem to hide it , out of what appears to be a financial regard for her own future . So soon as we pay more attention to the art of performance than we do to the moral of it , decadence has set in . Refined , it may be , but decadence none the  |p1168  less . But decadence leads to depravity . It may lead elegantly , but that is the direction in which its weak , high-bred face is turned . And when we get to depravity , it is the same thing , whether we find it in a novel , or in a savage , or in ourselves . Here is a story just out , where all the social vices of our times are showed in hypersensitive , refined natures . And t h e publisher advertises that the author handles the climax with " exquisite " art . So she does , but that does not recommend the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withoutmoral meaning that may be applied like rouge to the face of either wickedness or goodness . The point I hope to prove is that such " exquisite " books have not been so popular this year . There are two or three out quite as bad as " Three Weeks , " but they do not create such a sensation . Neither is the horror-novel so much in vogue . There is Mr. Robert Hichens 's new story , for instance . He is a writer of poignant romances , determined to produce the last pang from every situation . H e has a torture - gifted imagination and must do his characters to death , even if it takes two volumes . In this last book he portrays that peculiar Neapolitan gaiety which is without humor or friendliness with the same limpid phrasing that makes Fogazzaro 's work wonderful . There is no depth to the performance . It is tragedy and death lifted up and painted upon the wings of a butterfly . And with the same magic of words he can deplete the life even of Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were under the influence of a drug , and had fallen into a morbid dream with eyes wide open , and pale , inert and with folded hands , " is his description of a summer day on the Bay of Naples . He is an artist with a desert soul whose religion is a heathen motto . The question is how long such a writer will be encouraged to propagate himself in the world of ideas thru the minds of his readers . The answer is that while his last book is far superior to " The Call of the Blood , " both in interest and art , it is not so popular . The average reader has not yet put his morals and mind together as a reader . He has not learned to articulate what he wants . He is as stupid as an emigrant when it comes to selecting his fiction ? buys it humbly on hearsay . But so soon as he does learn to know and demand what he wants , there will be a surprise in store for the " popular novelist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less discouraging representations of reality . He is going to insist upon more enchantment , not so much disillusionment . Enchantment , and all the lovely , right things that go with it . He can make his o w n wrong things . This is why De Morgan 's last story is so much more popular than a longdrawn-out novel usually is . It has the right power of enchantment , and it is curious to note how so many critics missed the explanation of the charm of this book in their efforts to trace the resemblance between Mr. De Morgan 's literary style and that of Dickens . The title ? " Somehow Good " ? is the most significant and encouraging title of a story that has appeared in years . It is the proclamation of how much goodness we can acquire over and above the badness . Now , this is a distinct advance in the civiliation of the imagination ( the least civilized of all a man 's faculties if he is a genius ! ) and in the mathematics of morality , when an author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions and subtractions of life as to prove that the remainder is " somehow good , " especially when the rule in fiction has been that the remainder is a " deficit , " or somehow bad . The novelist is the parent of his book in the sense that no other writer is . The historian does not produce history , he records it . The poet does not even produce poetry , he is merely the inspired medium thru which we receive a strange message . And no man could be regarded as the father of an essay . The proper temperament of an essay is impersonal , if not academic . On the other hand , the novelist is not merely the creator of heroes and heroines , but they are infinitely related to him and to other men and women . The fact that they do not move in actual life is no evidence that they are not a very important part of modern society , people with whom we live no less than our neighbors . The only difference is that there is less versatility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hero , the good or the bad woman are really very much alike at bottom in everybody 's novel . It is really an event when an author creates a character , new in the sense that , while belonging to life , it has not before been produced in fiction . The writer recalls but one in this year 's novels . In the hero of " Mr. Crew 's Career , " Mr. Churchill has , for the first time , created the character of what may be called the " political bounder " ? the young American millionaire who enters politics to get a national pedestal for himself , just as he would enter an expensive yacht race to get the " cup . " He is essentially a fool , as all bounders are , of the kind made obtuse by the conscious power of wealth , who never will " play the game " because he lacks the integrity of the true sportsman 's instinct , and because he knows he can buy his way . Just the rich man squeezed down to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have what he wants if he sacrifices every conviction of honest manhood and pays a double price for it besides . America is full of this kind of indecent human blubber , but to Mr. Churchill belongs the distinction of having applied literary caustic to the type in politics , and of having drawn a picture of it that will last long after the type itself has past . But the historical novelist is not the ancestor of his book , to continue the parental figure of speech , in the sense that other writers are . Mrs. Humphry Ward , for example , is merely the literary stepmother of a number of famous men and women who have figured during the last two centuries in French and English history . This may explain the reason why she never really gets the use of her characters . She finds them , adopts them into the plot with much literary delicacy and good breeding , but from start to finish she never really gets beyond blue book descriptions of them . She is not closely enough related to them to engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has made the most remarkable advance in historical fiction this year . Usually the author who deals in historical personages is careful to preserve the time and conditions in which they lived , even the scenes in which they performed their part in the play of life . And generally it has been by these external evidences that we have been able to recognize them . When the hero of an English novel appears disguised in a woman 's petticoat , when he drinks and kisses indiscriminately and is forever on the verge of flight , we know that this is Prince Charlie , whether the author choose to represent him as dark or fair . And when a man appears in an American novel inspired by brilliant but unlawful schemes , and he makes himself hypnotically fascinating to innocent ladies , we say , " It 's Aaron Burr again ! " But until now no one has thought to take the limits of time and place from a great historical character , reproduce it in modern life and deduce the tale accordingly . Gladstone , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the role would not have been an ignoble one , or one unfaithful to the best elements in his nature if properly handled . Now , this is what Mr. Hope has accomplished in his story . He has reduced the great Queen Elizabeth to just woman ? the kind the Queen was ? instilled the character into the person of his heroine , and he has presented to us the greatest woman that has figured for years in fiction . The splendor of it is not that of mere royalty , but of a great na/ ture , holding within it the good and evil of a tremendous consciousness . Brudno 's story of the young Jewish poet and the misery of his connection with Gentiles sustains the same relation to literature that Du Bois 's " Souls of the Black Folk " sustains . But it will not attract so much attention , because the Jews have either passed , or they have never come in for their share of the ethical sentimentality that has been so freely expended upon the negro . Still , the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wishes to understand them . Hereafter we may all be forced to admit that Nature knew what she was about when she separated the different races by geographical barriers , by physical traits , and by instincts of deep aversion toward each other . Until then the weaker races must suffer and develop the depressed nerve-madness of the stinging , sensitive Jews , who are the only ones who have endured it so far - long enough to show what happens and what does not happen . Meanwhile , the less fastidious , the least moral , the most broad minded of each of these races may begin to mix and marry for the production of that great mongrel race , in the excellent qualities of which some intelligent people entertain high hopes . But for me , I have called attention to Brudno 's novel because it indicates so plainly the place in fiction and in real life where civilization makes no advance . There has never been a time in this country , North or South , where more bitterness existed between races that are trying to " mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are other departments in fiction where we find no improvement , no advance of the mind toward the meaning of life . The religious novel is as much a failure this year as it usually is . Eden Phillpotts writes convincing Old Testament fiction . He invariably dramatizes life among the tors and barrens of Dartmoor according to the severities of Moses and the prophets . But the only author this writer now recalls who can produce a Christian romance glowing with that strange , stern , tender spiritual effulgence of the Great Nazarene is Quiller-Couch , and no one thinks of setting him down as a religious novelist . Ralph Conner and his ilk , and even Dr. Henry Van Dyke , are at bottom mere sentimentalists catering too much to the world 's demands in their representations of Christian character . One of Norman Duncan 's short stories of the Newfoundland fisherman is worth all they have ever written . They strive invariably to demonstrate the fact that a man who lives the perpendicular life ? the pious , God-fearing hero ? is a man for all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make him prove his manhood with his fists . This putting in of the fists popularizes the story and it is the religious novelist 's contemptible concession to the world 's savage taste for brutal courage . And it is a literary cowardice he is guilty of toward Christ . Ralph Conner has a novel in nearly all the Sunday school libraries in this country in which the Christian hero lays his enemy across his knees and slowly , torturously breaks his back ! The great reproach of your religious novelist is that he permitted the socialists to discover and exploit what he should have discovered and exploited himself in the name of God and mercy . The material used by the socialistic muck-raking writers should have been the foundations of a great body of Christian literature . But while Ralph Conner was snooping around in the logging camps and Dr. Henry Van Dyke was fishing and picking his frail literary bluebells in Canada , a set of fierce-eyed , sincere and dangerous fanatics has taken possession of the miseries ,  |p1171  the very real problems of our times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachers left out ? which some think is no more than the Church and the preachers deserve . Another bad symptom in the year 's fiction is , that what we have always considered a good thing is represented as a bad thing ? that is to say , marriage , and the married people are giving all the trouble . The only place now for a wedding in a novel is in the last pages . For if the story progresses beyond the " honeymoon " the happy pair are sure to " part . " The trouble is that too many people in fiction and out of it are wortrying over the husband 's rights and the wife 's wrongs , and not enough attention is given to the psychic nature of the law that binds married people to each other , for better or for worse . Some old preacher may have compounded that phrase , but it is an exact description of the law . Only the most selfish men and women ever manage to preserve all their rights . And the meanest ones in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call justice . Justice is not good for many people . It 's apt to make an ass of a righteous man and a demon of a bad one . But to bear some injustice , even much injustice , from the person to whom you are married , does not usually injure the moral character ; the reverse is the rule . And this is what marriage is for ? to continue the race under decent conditions , and to produce by means of tribulations , if it so happens , one patient composite character enriched by the natures of two people , a man and a woman ? not to furnish disgraceful material for writers of fiction whose literary instincts have gone wrong . If a law could be passed , especially in the Northern and Eastern States , where most of the divorce-writing novelists live , by which they might be indicted and punished for fictitious desertion , adultery or bigamy , much would be accomplished toward purifying literature . We have no stories of importance from the West . And there has been no advance made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , but not of what is good or lasting among us . Fox has written as romantically and botanically as usual , but Fox is only a mountain novelist . He is not Southern . No Southern author has produced a really notable story of Southern life as it is . And we can not hope for such a book soon for several reasons . First , we have not the free mind in the South . We are fairly intelligent , we have splendid dramatic material , and we are brave enough to fight , right or wrong , but nothing will induce us to tell the truth about ourselves that is not complimentary , no matter how thrilling it should prove to be . We are the victims of prejudice from within and without . They who love us and they who hate us write about us , but the man with the wide , free vision , who could see us in perspective , and in relation . to the whole , has never written a word in fiction about Southerners , unless , possibly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went . Also , we are the victims of the student man now . We are being studied like a foreign ant-hill by goggle-eyed historians and economists , but we have no interpreter big enough to tell where we are in the order of things . And one reason for this may be that we have no philosophy of life in the South , and therefore no order . We did have the gentlest , laziest , most genial and unselfish of all philosophies , but we lost it , and our Order of the Garter , too , with the blood we shed upon many battlefields  |p1172  during the Civil War . And we have nothing now by which to measure this new changing life . This is why Thackeray 's and Scott 's are standard novels . They were dramas of social conditions long fixed and recognized . We have no such conditions here yet . But probably the most discouraging feature in the whole situation is the lack of an enlightened intelligence in the readers of Southern fiction . Here in the South we lost the leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers . Therefore our authors must look to the North and East for purchasers of their books . And only a fool can write the kind of stories of the South that Northern and Eastern readers demand . How many have read the " Arkinsaw Cousins " ? The book contains remarkably sympathetic and wittily drawn portraits of Southern types . But the Northern reader has little or no faculty for appreciating the peculiar humor and sweetness and tragedy of such people . Yet he will devour with avidity all the inanities that Mr. Somebody writes about Virginia ladies and gentlemen and satin-tail horses ! The Northern and Eastern man is not nearly so intelligent as he has reputation for being , anyhow . His flinty faculties have developed very little since abolition days . They have simply been indented with a great deal of useful information by an educational system too strong to resist . But it is many a day since one of them could venture to form an independent judgment of his own without consulting his " authorities . " If half a dozen of the ablest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , they could not begin a civilization till they wrote a book about how to do it ? for " reference . " This is why they do not and never did understand or appreciate the South . They have written their own books of reference , or demanded them according to their own indentation of ideas , without regard for the truth . But with all these drawbacks and many others that have not been mentioned , civilization is advancing in that most uncertain and iconoclastic of all regions ? the region of fiction . The agitation in regard to the " great white plague " and measures for its suppression is sure to report itself in next year 's stories . Some of the realists and other small tick novelists will write tubercular romances . But this will be more than counterbalanced by the infusion of health and earth-sanity from the civil engineers and forest keepers . Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith presents one of the most admirable heroes of the year in a young man who gets his training for living while digging a railroad tunnel . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ought to be a good one , with plenty of hard work in it . That is what we need in fiction ? more manual labor and less indecent mental dexterity .
