txt The Panama Canal may be changed from a lock ditch to a sea-level canal , if reports from expert engineers , to be chosen from civil life , ' Indicate that the foundations for the Gatun and other dams are not sufficiently - strong to support the structures . This was admitted to-day at the War Department . The engineers will be chosen within the next few days , and will accompany , President-elect Taft on his trip to the ! isthmus . Reports reaching the War Department and the Isthmian Canal Commission with reference to the Gatun dant have been conflicting . It is determined now that these reports must be clarified . The army engineers all along have expressed themselves as satisfied witn the foundations for the dams and locks , but there have been many slips and some damage of late that have not borne out their optimistic prophecies . It is to get an unbiased opinion that the experts from civil life are to be called in . The change , which will have to be authorized by Congress , will mean that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to traffic will have to be postponed-In addition , it will mean an increase in cost of from one-third to onehalf over the lock channel . Col. Goethals , the engineer in chief , testified in the last session of Congress before a Senate committee that he could not tell whether the canal on the lock basis could be completed for $500,000,000 . When the work was begun it was estimated that the building of a lock canal would occupy twelve years , but the rapid work of American workmen and American dredges has been so pronounced that this estimate has been cut almost in half . At the same time the first estimate was made it was figured that a sea-level canal could not be completed in less than eighteen or twenty years . However , with the dredges taking out on an average of 3,000,000 cubic yards of rock and dirt a month , this term is amenable to the same discount as was applied to the estimate on the lock canal . It was pointed out to-day , however , that the construction of a sea-level canal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of dirt to be removed . It also will present new engineering difficulties , for the deeper the cut becomes the more complicated will be the problem of removing the debris . This undoubtedly will add to the cost of construction . The matter , however , is not even under consideration by the Government as yet . Everything will depend on the result of the Taft trip . A request for an urgent deficiency appropriation of $5,458,01,11 to carry on the work of the Isthmian Canal at the present rate during the balance of the fiscal year and for new projects was received by the House to-day from the Secretary of War . Last year a deficiency appropriation of $11,990,000 was made . The principal share of the desired appropriation is for the Atlantic division , where are located the Gatun locks and dam . For this division $3,451.000 is asked . Chairman Goethals of the commission explained that the current appropriation was based on the mistaken idea that Congress had appropriated for a rock crushing plant at Porto Bello , an erecting plant for the Gatun locks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For these purposes $2.500.000 is sought . It has been found , Col. Goethals reports , that there are not sufficient data on the hydraulics of C en Lake and its tributaries to dote. e whether there are any low sand.es that would affect the seepage of the lake . To make an additional survey $55. ( 9 ) 0 is asked . In the central division . including the Culebra cut , it is said that the excavation has been .541 per cent . greater than has been estimated , and for this purpose a deficiency appropriation of $1.150.000 is requested . An additional plant at the Miraflores locks is also requested . Of the total appropriation requested $ , 2 , - 408,000 is for labor and $2,400,000 for materials . All but three of the members of the House Inter-State and Foreign Commerce Committee to-day announced their intention of taking a trip to the Canal Zone during the recess of Congress to look into the condition of the zone and decide on its needs for the immediate future . The three who will not go are Vice Presidentelect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements at ' Utica that will detain him . The christening of his young grandson is the engagement that he ranks highest . Representative Davey is at home ill , and does not expect to come to Washington until several weeks after the holidays . ATSGUSTA . Ga .. Dec. 1S. ? In discussing his forthcoming visit to Panama to-niget . Judge Taft made it plain that it was his purpose to keep himself posted throughout his Administration regarding the coalneering features of the work on the isthmus , as well as the administrative features . It is his intention row to visit the Isthmus each year of his term . He will take with him on his coming trip eminent civil engineers who are not connected with the work . There is some danger , he believes , unless this close independent supervision is maintained regarding the physical features of the project that grave mistakes might be made . The problem that will receive the greatest consideration relates to the engineering features of the Gatun Dam . There has been some expert criticism as the quality of the foundation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr. Taft 's intention to obtain from the most reliable sources available as much as may be known .
