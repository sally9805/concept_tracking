 | Few books had been awaited with more curiosity than that which was to contain a selection from the letters of Queen Victoria . Her character and career had become a cherished possession , not only of her own country , nor indeed only of her own subjects , but in a certain sense of the whole English-speaking world . . She had lived in such close seclusion ever since Prince Albert 's death that she was personally and directly known to very few people , probably a less familiar figure to the younger generation of her contemporaries than any one among her predecessors since the time of George the Second . But every one recognized the simplicity , the firmness , the straightforwardness of her nature . The warmth of her domestic affections had won the regard of the people . The correctness of her constitutional attitude in fulfilling the functions of the Crown had secured the respect of the educated class . Nevertheless , the forty years of widowhood had withdrawn her so much from observation that the revelation of her character and of her action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of surprise to the  | vast majority of people in England . It will be no less a surprise to readers in the United States . Nowhere was she more honored than here . The American people knew that she had always entertained a friendly feeling for them ; and they had the deepest respect for the example which she set of a dignified and consistent life , adorned by the highest qualities of wife and mother . The interest of the book is fourfold . It throws much fresh light on the international politics of Europe , and particularly on the relations of England with France , Germany and Russia . It illustrates the working of the constitutional machinery of British Government , and especially that part of the machinery which is least seen and understood by the world , viz. , the position in which the Sovereign stands to the Cabinet . It supplements the biographies of not a few famous men who held high office between 1837 and 1861 , by giving us letters of theirs hitherto unpublished , and records of their interviews with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it brings out the personal character of the Queen herself , a character some sides of which had been little understood , and could hardly have been duly appreciated , save by those who know the influences that had affected her early years . A few words may be said on each of the above four aspects of the book . In free self-governing countries , the historian has seldom any means of knowing how international questions look when seen from the detached and exceptional position of a throne . The occupant of the throne does not publicly express his or her own views , and is deemed by a sort of constitutional fiction hardly to have any personal views . Yet a sovereign is in more than one way specially concerned with international politics . He or she is technically the friend , practically always at least the acquaintance , sometimes the relative , of the occupants of other thrones ; and is thus , while interested in them personally , interested in them also simply as sovereigns , because the good or evil fortune of any one throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . Thus it is quite likely to happen that the sympathies of a sovereign may run in a different channel from those of his own nation . He may be better fitted than the people are to judge the personal qualities of another monarch , and worse fitted to judge of the policy which that monarch follows . Queen Victoria 's personal sentiments towards  | the heads of other states do her great credit . She was kindly . She was fair . She was discriminating . Her strong liking for Louis Philippe disappeared , as was right and proper , under the impression of his bad behavior in the matter of the Spanish marriages in 1845-6 , and revived only out of compassion for his misfortunes as an exile after the Revolution which drove him from France in 1848 . When Louis Napoleon rose to power , she showed a more discreet reserve in forming her views of him than some of her Ministers did . Their later relations were sometimes politically close , sometimes almost unfriendly . But , though she never trusted him , and was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , she saw what good points he had and was perhaps fairer in her view than most of those who were in those days young and ardent Liberals and looked on " the Tyrant of France " as a sort of limb of Satan . Among all the rulers of that time , the most striking and certainly the most , formidable figure was the Tsar Nicholas . He visited the British Court in 1844 , and the Queen 's description of him , in a familiar letter ( of June 11th , 1844 ) to her uncle Leopold , then King of the Belgians , gives one a better idea of the man and the way he was regarded than one might find in the pages of grave historians . There appears in it something startling to the reader of to-day ; and the more startling because the Queen was a person who might have been expected not to feel it , viz. , the sort of mysterious awe that then surrounded Russia and her autocrat ruler . Western Europe had not recovered from the impression produced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impenetrable , invincible . The concentration of vast irresponsible power in the person of this one Tsar , reigning over many millions of men from the Baltic all across the vast spaces of Northern Asia into North America , made him seem a superhuman kind of being . However , the Queen liked him ; nor did even the outbreak of the Crimean War produce any personal animosity . It was otherwise with the Queen 's subjects . To most of them , especially after the harsh suppression of the risings of Polish patriots and the crushing by a Russian host of the Hungarians who were at war with Austria in 1848-9 , the Tsar became the familiar conventional embodiment of tyranny and cruelty . This popular view of him had a great deal to do with the Crimean  | War . What one reads in these letters bears out what may be gathered from much else spoken and written in 1852-3 ? that that war was undertaken with very little knowledge of the real facts of Southeastern Europe and Northwestern Asia and very little consideration of what a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effect . Public opinion felt , as the Queen felt , that the Tsar had behaved in a somewhat overbearing way when his controversy with the Turks began . It leaped to the conclusion that the Tsar 's ambition must be resisted , and as resistance to him meant armed defence of the Sultan , war followed . In the whole business , no one seems to have thought so justly and advised so prudently as the Queen herself . Some of the credit for this was , doubtless , due to Prince Albert ; but it is impossible to separate how much each of the two consorts contributed to the wise moderation and foresight which the Queen 's letters and the Prince 's memoranda evince . One rises from their perusal with a feeling that , if the views of the Sovereign and the Prime Minister had prevailed , war would have been avoided ; sad that its outbreak was due chiefly to two causes : the compromises made to maintain the apparent unity of a divided Cabinet , and the attitude of that grim old lion , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , whatever he may have thought of the Turks ? and he often treated them with scorn ? hated Russia , and who was in a position which enabled him , almost disregarding his instructions , to affect decisively the course of events . A curious comment on the want of knowledge in England of the actual state of things in Turkey is furnished by a remarkable letter , straightforward , honest and sensible , which the late Duke of Cambridge wrote to the Queen on his arrival at Constantinople ( Vol . III , p. 34 ) . Nor is the case of the unlucky Crimean War the only instance in which the views of the Queen and Prince may be deemed to have been sounder than those held by most of their Ministers . Prince Albert did not understand Italy , and few will now agree with the views he expressed on Italian affairs . He was , moreover , a member of a reigning house and did not like to see crowns knocked off heads , even off heads so unworthy as were those of some Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said was mostly true and useful . However , the best evidence of the sound judgment of the consorts is to be found in  | the last memorandum which the Prince ever wrote to convey their joint views . It was one which suggested to the British Cabinet the softening down of a despatch then being sent to Mr. Seward regarding the affair of the seizure by Captain Wilkes of Messrs . Slidell and Mason on the steam packet " Trent " in 1862 . Every one has admitted the wisdom of that counsel , which came at a moment profoundly important for both nations . We may all , in both countries , be grateful for it . Whoever remembers Walter Bagehot 's famous description of the functions of a sovereign in a constitutional monarchy will wish that that admirable thinker could have survived to read these Letters , and see the illustrations which they afford of the views he expressed with so much ingenuity and penetration . No equally full record of the way in which a mechanism of government so delicately balanced , and therefore so liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever been laid before the world . The topic , however , needs so much explanation , not only to American , but even to English , readers , for comparatively few people know how business is done between the Crown and its Ministers , that I must not attempt to enter upon it . Let it suffice to say that the high sense of duty which the Queen brought to her functions is strikingly evident from the very beginning of her reign . In the first years , before the graver anxieties came , she was gay and bright , as a girl of seventeen ought to be . She was devotedly attached to her husband and to her children , and loved the quiet joys of home . But neither the attractions of social life nor the charm of domestic life ever made . her neglect the functions which the Constitution assigned to her . That an absolute , or almost absolute , ruler of brilliant gifts , like Trajan or Constantine , like the Emperor Frederick the Second , or Henry the Fourth of France , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ruling is only natural . No pleasure is comparable to the pleasure of being able to accomplish great designs by the exercise of intellectual force and unhampered volition . But a constitutional monarch whose will is limited in many ways and whose abilities may not be of the first order , needs an unusual sense of duty and habits of unusual diligence in order to induce constant application to work , much of which is monotonous and in which personal preferences must needs be often thwarted by other considerations . In the Queen 's case , the sense of duty seems to have never been  | absent . She understood her position under the Constitution perfectly , and she did not wish to travel beyond it . King Leopold wrote to her a few months after her accession : " All trades must be learned , and nowadays the trade of a constitutional sovereign , to do it well , is a very difficult one . " ( He , like his royal niece , was fond of italics . ) He was right . The task was anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely to her goodness , but to her uprightness . Her habit of saying plainly and directly what she thought and wished gained for her a measure of personal confidence which was quite different from the respect that attached to her office , and this confidence in her integrity smoothed her path . A chief part of the interest of these Letters is the new light they shed on the character and conduct of the leading English statesmen of sixty years ago . Some one has said that no man is ever quite the same to any two other men . The relation of a statesman to a sovereign is unlike his relation to any one else , and thus it helps us know him better because we see him at a new angle . Lord Melbourne , Sir Robert Peel , the Duke of Wellington , Lord John Russell , Lord Palmerston , Lord Derby , Mr. Disraeli , Mr. Gladstone , with other lesser luminaries , figure here , and their letters add something to our knowledge of each of them . Melbourne was Prime Minister when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years . He is less known to the English public than almost any other man who has filled so high a post . I recollect Mr. Gladstone 's once saying that nothing was more needed than a really good life of Melbourne . In these letters he comes out extremely well , as a shrewd , genial , kindly person , having his faults , yet an English gentleman in the good old sense of the word . He was not great ; he was not even brilliant . But he was firm , honorable and tactful , and he had a sense of humor ( see Vol . I , p. 543 ) . He knew how to drive his team , and while he distinctly belonged to the Whig or moderate section of the party then beginning to be called " Liberal , " he did not offend the Radical section as some other less Whiggish persons did . Whether it was wise for him to continue to correspond with the Queen after his retirement from office has been doubted ; but it is , at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege to influence her against his successor . That successor , Sir Robert Peel , appears to no less advantage  | here . The Queen had entertained some little prejudice against him , a prejudice not wholly unnatural under the circumstances disclosed in this book . His reserve at first chilled her . But his straightforwardness , his sense of public duty , the impression of power he made and his respectful courtesy to herself , soon removed all distrust or aversion . Her grief for him was scarcely less deep than that felt at the death of the Duke of Wellington . Somewhat less favorable is the impression which we receive here of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell . Palmerston , so popular and powerful , during most of his long career , with the nation , was not altogether trusted or liked by his colleagues or by other leaders who nominally belonged to the same side in politics , such as Mr. Gladstone , Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright . As Lord Melbourne , Sir Robert Peel and Lord Aberdeen begin to quit the scene new figures appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to fill the stage during most of the later part of the Victorian epoch . At this time , however , neither Mr. Disraeli nor Mr. Gladstone was yet Prime Minister , so neither came much into direct contact with the Sovereign . The letters which they respectively addressed to the Queen , or sometimes to Prince Albert , are highly characteristic . But Disraeli , when leading the House of Commons in 1859 , wrote brief descriptions of debates in the House which have a good deal of his epigrammatic touch . One deserves quotation . It relates to a debate on the Straits of Malacca Settlements : " The speech of Sir J. Elphinstone , master of the subject , and full of striking details , produced a great effect . His vindication of the convict population of Singapore , as the moral element of that strange society , might have been considered as the richest humor , had it not been for its unmistakable simplicity . His inquiry of the Governor 's lady , who never hired any servant but a convict , whether she employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always Murderers ' was very effective " ( Vol . III , p. 352 ) . But , illuminative as these letters are in their references to the men and events of the time , their chief interest lies in the picture they give of the Queen herself . The traits of a sovereign 's character are never unimportant , because they must needs , even where the monarchy is a limited one , be a factor in the history of the country . Tastes and temper , judgment , volition , manners , all make a difference ; a difference to the feelings of the people , a difference to the conduct of business with Ministers , probably also  | a difference to the heads of foreign states . Apart from this practical significance , there were special circumstances in Queen Victoria 's case to enhance the curiosity which attached to her personality . She had become a symbol of the Unity of the British Empire , of the connection between the ancient Crown of Great Britain and the numerous new colonies and dependencies which shortly before and during her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To their inhabitants , she was a permanent figure , while the statesmen of the far-off Mother Country came and went and were for the most part forgotten . About the practical ability disclosed in the Queen 's correspondence there can be no dispute . Some critics have attributed to the influence and collaboration of Prince Albert much of the judgment and knowledge of Europe , as well as much of the argumentative strength , which appear in the letters relating to foreign affairs . His share is plain enough . His own memoranda reveal his views ; and these views are often apparent in the letters which she signed . The language used is sometimes such as would not naturally come from the pen of one so young and still so inexperienced as the Queen was during the first ten years of her reign . But there is quite enough in the letters written before her marriage and in some later ones also , especially those to King Leopold , letters in the composition of which the Prince would have no share , to indicate her own talents . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy . Though they are simple , direct , correctly and often effectively expressed , they are not striking either in phrase or in ideas . What does impress one in them is a sort of practical good sense , which ' shows that the writer had formed the habit of thinking . She was able to take in the position she had to deal with , and see herself in relation to her surroundings . At a time when most girls of sixteen or seventeen are filled with fancies and carried away by impulses , she had already a clear vision and a steady head . Likings and dislikings , of course , moved her , as they do all of us . She expressed them to her intimates , and especially to " Uncle Leopold . " with a pleasing freedom . But she did not suffer them to affect her action . Her conduct in the question of the Ladies of the Bedchamber exposed her to much criticism at the time , and she seems to have said in later years , " I was very young then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to be done again . " She was only  | twenty . Yet , even in that instance , her attitude was perfectly dignified and , under the circumstances , not unnatural . Probably it was a fortunate thing that her earlier years , before she came to the throne at the age of seventeen , had been passed in seclusion , and with few of those interested attentions by which one fated to inherit a throne is usually beset . Her governess , Baroness Lehzen , was a woman of strong character , who had evidently taught her self-restraint as well as habits of application . Her girlhood was , as she wrote long afterwards , rather a melancholy one . There were few pleasures , few indulgences ; an austere gravity brooded over the quiet household , which enjoyed a very modest pecuniary allowance . Social engagements did not distract her mind from the study of what were called in those days " improving books . " She had read a good deal , and had cultivated her natural taste both for drawing and for music . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what - she read , and to reflect for herself , forming her own judgment . The criticisms on books which , before her accession , she confides to " Uncle Leopold , " and the questions she puts him , show how much more mature and independent her mind had become at sixteen than is that of most girls at twentyone . One discovers already in her two qualities which she retained through life , and which struck those who knew her personally in her later years , all the more because they seemed at first sight to be hardly compatible qualities . One was a strong personal pride and sense of the dignity of her position . She was not haughty , much less arrogant . But she was penetrated through and through with a sense of what it meant to he head of the United Kingdom and the British Empire . Yet , although this feeling was added to her own high spirit , ? she would have been deemed a high-spirited woman even in a private station , ? it did not in her bear the fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own intellectual limitations ; and never tried to make a figure in fields for which she was not fitted . If one were to make a comparison at all between persons whose surroundings were so different , one might , in comparing her with Queen Elizabeth , observe that she was quite free from two of Elizabeth 's salient faults : personal vanity and faithlessness . Truthfulness and honor were the basis of her character , and as she was above deception herself , so she had a horror of deceit in  | others . She thought that international policy ought to be straightforward ; and sometimes remonstrated against courses of action which seemed open to reproach on that score . Frank and open as nature had made her , she learnt , as every one in a delicate and responsible position needs to learn , that there are many things one would like to say which it is not wise to say ; many emotions which are perfectly justifiable , but which it is necessary to restrain . She carried sincerity so far as sometimes to abstain from saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in a conventional fashion , merely because she personally did not feel , and did not intend to force herself to feel , the sentiment which , conventionally , it would have been expected she should express whether she felt it or not . It has already been remarked that she did not allow her dislikes , or prejudices , to interfere with her strict discharge of constitutional duty . The feeling might remain , and any feeling that had once laid hold of her mind was not easily changed . But how little it prevented her from doing what was right in her official relations is shown by the case of Lord Palmerston . Between herself and him when Foreign Minister there had been a long controversy as to his practice of sending off despatches before letting her see them . Both parties stood to their guns , and the contention was at one time quite sharp . But when Palmerston afterwards became Prime Minister , he had always perfectly fair treatment from her . The later correspondence , so far as we have it here in print , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Aberdeen suggested , in September , 1853 , that Lord Palmerston should be invited by the Queen to Balmoral to stay there with her as Minister in Attendance , she complied , though there could have been no guest whose presence she less desired . There was no pettiness in her nature , and plenty of that best sort of tact which conies from trying to understand the feelings of others , and from a genuine kindliness of heart . The long and intimate correspondence with King Leopold is , perhaps , the best illustration of her deferential modesty , on the one hand , and her independence , on the other . She often asked the old man 's opinion , and gave weight to it . But she never blindly followed it ; and when she differed from him and did not follow his advice , she expressed herself with a respectful courtesy which averted any possibility of vexation on his part .  | On the strength of her domestic affections it is unnecessary to dwell . They were known to every one , and no doubt they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always imply a general goodness and kindliness of nature , such as these letters disclose . The Queen had , what some cynical observers have , quite unjustly , denied to women , a capacity for friendship . It is not very easy for a sovereign , even in a constitutional country , to form a friendship with any one in the position of a subject . But the Duke of Wellington , Lord Melbourne and Sir Robert Peel became to her friends as well as Ministers , and , what is more , they evidently felt a real friendship for her , although the Duke of Wellington 's age and grave habits and Sir R. Peel 's extreme reserve , prevented them from expressing their feelings as easily and as prettily as Lord Melbourne did . Perhaps Lord Aberdeen might also be included in this inner circle , for she always writes to him with a confidence and sense of mutual understanding which do not appear in the letters to Palmerston or Lord John Russell or Lord Derby . The correspondence here given closes with the death of Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Queen 's life , for she never recovered the brightness of her earlier years , never again mixed freely in society , and , indeed , never , till almost the last years , - came to London at all except for a night or two when there was some official function which required her presence . The letters of the forty years that followed the great sorrow till her own death in January , 1901 , years which saw even greater changes both at home and abroad than the years from 1837 to 1861. have not yet been given to the world . They could not well be ; for the wise boldness shown in publishing now so freely much which was at one time highly confidential , and which is all the more precious to the historian because it was confidential , renders it undesirable to make public at this moment what affects persons , whether living or already departed , who belong to the generation still on earth . Meantime , the historian will be grateful for what he has received , and all those who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and valued the fine example of Queen Victoria will rejoice to know how good a ground they had for their admiration .
