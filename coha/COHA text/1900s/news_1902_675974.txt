txt gent priVate builder - - Saddled . with such a contract would say that it would be better to break ' it- and employ an architect of standing than to go Oh with it , even though these men should recover their fun fees . And , in the case of the city , it is so disreputable to have these men doing its work , with the taint of jobbery that the facts of their employment necessarily suggest , that we think the city should take its chances in court . The Post suggests that , as to the principal work upon which they are employed , they are already in litigation with the heirs of Mr. TnomAs , the architect of the Hall of Records , and that of this litigation , to reverse the legal maxim , it is to the public interest that there should not be a speedy ending .

Would not those facts furnish a case of such fraud as would vitiate the contracts and discharge the city from the obligations created by them ? We do not say j that these suppositions could be established . But it does seem to us that the case is worth contesting . If the contracts are invalid , that , of course , is tilt end of HORGAN &; SLATTERY . What joy it would be for a Corporation Counsel to get them before a New York jury on a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We observe with satisfaction that The Evening Post concurs in our suggestion that the city should refuse to carry out the contracts which under Tammany it made with HORGAN &; SLATTERY and should leave those eminent artists and scientists ' to sue for their money . Of course , Mr. RivEs is right in advising the Mayor , from a purely legal point of view , that the city would.have no defense to an action ' for breach of the contracts unless they default or exhibit legally Drovable incompetency.  --  But any intelli.
