The Battle of Balaclava was fought on October 25 , 1854 , in the Crimea , the peninsula on the north shore of the Black Sea which gives name to the war of 1854-55 between the Russians on one side and the allied forces of Great Britain , France , Sardinia , and Turkey on the other . The object of the war was to humble and check Russia , although pretext was found in alleged causes relating to the care of the holy places of Palestine . The Battle of Balaclava was really five distinct conflicts , but the name is by common consent given to that one of the five which is known as " The Charge of the Six Hundred .

" And our coats , " went on the veteran , slowly thinking back to the sartorial glories of that wonderful day , " were blue , with white collars and cuffs , and our breeches were blue , with pipe - elayed stripes , and our boots came up to our knees , and we wore big spurs . And each man had a sword and a carbine . " And we were the 13th Light Dragoons , and we led the charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava . " But we ' Light ' Dragoons wer n't so very light ; not all of us . I was light , and there was others like me , but there was big men among us , too ? some on ' em over six feet and weighin ' up'ards of fourteen stone . " There was more than the 13th in the charge .

" " W e 1 1 , on that day of the great charge we was in the saddle early , and there was a good deal o ' fighting and cavalry charging and guns blazing away , and we were standing back , looking down into a lowish , longish kind o ' valley . And up there on the side was some batteries , and we saw the Rooshans go at ' em . And we saw red-capped Turks that were a-holdin ' of ' em go scooting away . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that distance , especially it 's usually bein ' a dullish , dirtyish red ; it was too far for that , and I want you to have it straight ; but we knew they was Turks , and we knew they was running away , and we knew they wore red caps . And it never seemed right to let such poor things wear red , that being our own color , " he added , indignantly . " That whole war always did seem qucerlike to me . Some men they said it voL cxvm. ? No. 704-38 came about through something to do with pilgrims to Jerusalem . It was certainly queer . There we was , and there was the French . They wore red , too ? red breeches ; but they was good soldiers , the French . And there was Italians . Dark men , little chaps , fast talkers . And there was the Turks . Is n't it queer that we should all be there , fighting side by side against the Rooshans ! But it 's all down in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me . " This with an air of finality , as if history were a sort of strongbox in which explanations arc locked up for reference . " Well , there we were , at the elbow of the 93d Highlanders , and the Rooshans tried to rush ' em , and the 93d volleyed , but it was too far off to take effect , and then the Rooshans were all about ' em like mad . Then the Enniskillens and the Scotch Greys came a-tearin ' up to repulse ' em , and there was a fine fight as they charged in . And there we sat in our saddles watching ' em , and a sort of cry broke out all along our line : Now 's our time ! Now 's our time ! ' You see , we was all a-tinglin ' to dash in , along with the Scotch Greys and Enniskillens , instead o ' standin ' there quiet . But our general he looked around sharp and fierce , and his lips moved , and I suppose he said , ' Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " * Lamb paused for a little . " But we soon had fighting enough , " he said to *Lamb is here telling of the famous " Charge of the Heavy Brigade , " which preceded the still more famous " Charge of the Light Brigade . " himself , softly ; " we soon had fighting enough . " It got along between eleven and twelve , and we was still there . And the Rooshans was still holding the guns on the heights that they 'd took from the red-capped Turks . And then all at once Captain Nolan , a staff officer , came with orders , and we all straightened up ready to cheer . Lord Raglan , the commander-in-chief , had sent to Lord Lucan , the commander of the cavalry , an order to charge , and Lord Lucan he told Lord Cardigan , the commander of the Light Brigade , to go in . " ( Curious , to note the unctuous awe in the voice of this private of a quarter of a century 's faithful service when rolling off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've likely heard . We did n't go at the guns that Lord Raglan meant us to attack . And whose fault it was nobody could ever rightly make out , . they tell me , though many think that Captain Nolan carried the order wrong . " He was a brave man , was Captain Nolan , and he asked leave to charge with us , and then he went down the valley , out in front , but we had n't much more'n got to a trot and were beginning to gallop when a piece of shell hit him and knocked his breast in , and his horse turned and galloped back with him through our ranks , with him a-yelling an awful yell , and sitting in his saddle with his sword raised just as it was when the shell knocked him in the heart . And then he pitched from his horse , and that was the last of Nolan . A good horse it was he rode . ' T was a roan ; I knew it well , for it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often tethered alongside of it , and I suppose Captain Nolan saw it and bought it . Anyhow , the roan came back to make its last charge with its old regiment , for it was killed too . " It may be interesting here to interrupt Lamb 's story , and to give the facts as history records them . Captain Nolan carried an order in writing to Lord Lucan , commander of the cavalry : " Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front , and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns . Immediate . " Lord Raglan meant the guns on the heights that the Russians had that morning captured from the Turks , and intended the order to be interpreted in connection with a previous order sent to Lord Lucan and still unexecuted : " Cavalry to advance and take advantage of any opportunity to recover the heights . " But Lord Lucan , misled by the words " to the front " in the new order , thought that he was directed to attack a powerful battery at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be approached through a flaking fire from both sides . He did not think of the guns on the heights , as they were not at " the front , " but on the right flank . But , although the order seemed clear , he felt doubts , for such a charge appeared the extreme of recklessness . " The guns ! What guns ? " he asked . Whereupon Nolan , an eager , hasty , excitable man , not thinking of any possible misconception , and apparently deeming Lucan 's hesitation to arise from weakness , replied with taunting insolence ; " The enemy and the guns are there ! " at the same time waving his hand toward the Russians . Lucan ignored the tone and manner , knowing that Nolan came direct from the side of the commander-in-chief . He took the indefinite wave of the hand to mean a definite pointing out of the central battery , and , his effort to obtain further information Laving been so insolently checked , there seemed nothing to do but order the advance , especially as there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hands . Lucan ought not to have misunderstood , especially as he knew that his interpretation of the second order meant a charge contrary to all rules of warfare ; but there is no doubt that his mistake was a sincere nne . TIe was dismissed from his command ; and his request , to England , for a military inquiry was coldly refused . Lamb , telling what lie saw and judging from what he saw , does not understand about the conduct of Nolan . Nolan did not ask permission to charge with the brigade , but did say to a friend , one of the junior officers . that he intended to take part in the charge . The charge had little more than begun when Lord Cardigan , who rode two horses ' length in front of his staff , who in turn rode several horses ' length in front of the first line of the brigade , saw Nolan galloping out in front shouting and waving his sword . Cardigan became instantly angry , for it seemed to him as if Nolan was presumptuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the men . As a matter of fact , however , Nolan was heading his horse a little to the right , and calling out something which in all human probability was an entreaty to Cardigan to move in the direction which he , Nolan , was pointing out , it not having come to him till he saw the charge actually begun that the intent of the order had been fatally misunderstood . " But I 'm getting ahead of my story , being so interested in Captain Nolan , " Lamb went on . " I really had n't got us started yet . " For there we stood , ready for the charge , when Lord Luean rode up and told Lord Cardigan what to do . We could n't hear anything , of course , but I was near enough to see that Lord Cardigan looked a sort o ' queerlike as he looked in the direction we was to go . And he and Lord Lucan said a few words to each other , and then Lord Luean went off , and Lord Cardigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was some shifting of the regiments ? it was all over in a minute or so ? and we kind o ' felt we was goin ' to do something desperate , although it never came to us that we could he sent in there without any of the rest of the army to support us . And Lord Cardigan said , quiet , but loud enough for at least all of us in front to hear , ' The brigade will advance . ' And then we were off . And do you know , sir , " and he slapped his knee resoundingly- , " that we went down that valley , just a little more than six hundred of us , against thousands and thousands of Rooshans and their batteries ! * " And Lord Cardigan the Earl of Car-digan he was ? he rode out there in front , all alone , sitting stiff and straight ? he was *Lord Cardigan respectfully pointed out to Lord Lucan that the order meant destruction , but Lucan replied : " Lord Raglan will have it so " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and always rode sort o ' stiffish ? and he never turned to look around once , not even once , after we started , but just rode on stiff and straight as if he had been passing at a review instead o ' charging the whole Rooshan army. * " And we did it pretty nearly on empty stomachs . By George ! sir " ( his voice rose in a sort of triumph ) , " we went at the whole Rooshan army pretty nearly on empty stomachs , for each man had only had that morning a hard biscuit , and a little bit o ' pork and a drink o ' water . ' T was the way to give us a ration o ' rum once a day , morning or evening , but we had n't had it that morning . We did n't fight the Rooshans at Balaclava on rum ! And whether , " he went on , laboriously trying to picture in his memory an important detail of the past ? " whether or not we had it that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly remember . " Well , our trumpeter sounded the charge , and we went off at a trot . I was in the front rank , and from the first it looked like a stiffish bit o ' work ? but , Lord bless ye ! we did n't have any real idee till we was well under way . Then it came to us , for we saw what we had started to do . " And I said to my mate on the right of me , ' Well , Bill , I 'd rather be shot in front than stabbed behind . ' I did n't really mean to say anything , I suppose , an ' it was just by way o ' speaking . But , anyhow , T remember that I said , ' Well , Bill . I 'd rather be shot in front than stabbed behind . ' But like enough he did n't hear me , for I did n't speak up loud , being in the ranks in a charge . Those were the only words I said as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little prayer came to me , and I found myself a-saying of it to myself as we went on . " Pretty soon we got into a gallop . " The old tighter drew himself up , and now his mind was altogether with that mighty day of the past . " We broke into a gallop , and the shells and the round shot from the batteries began to fall among * Lord Cardigan never even turned his head until after he had led his men right through the powerful battery at the lower end of the valley . Without turning , he doubtless could see that the men at the extreme right and left were coming on , and he could hear the sound of the galloping behind him . us . Just at first there was a big silence , for it did n't seem to anybody that we was really going to try to do it , and then the batteries began , and the shot and shell fell thick . " I do n't know just how far it was down that valley , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . But maybe I 'm wrong . Anyhow , it was a goodish distance , and the valley seemed to narrow , down at the end where we was charging at , and we went down it like water clown a funnel . And still , not a hard gallop , for Lord Cardigan out there in front would n't let his horse go too fast , it being a long way we had to charge , and of course the brigade behind him could n't go faster than the pace he set. * " There was batteries on our right blazing clown at us , and batteries on our left blazing down , and batteries right in front , and I felt in my face the bits of rock or pebble thrown up by the shot hitting on the hard ground . And there was great clouds of cavalry and infantry stirring about and getting ready for us . We was looking right ahead , of course , but the ride was so long that we could n't help seeing a good deal of what was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only those Rooshans , but thousands of our own men looking down on us and on what we was doing as if they were watching a play . But as we got nearer the end of the valley the smoke got so much thicker that they could n't see so much then.1- " All about us were shells bursting , and smoke and yells , and shot hitting us and flying past our ears , and men pitching from their saddles , and horses getting torn to bits by exploding shells . And still on we went . Did you ever have a *Lord Cardigan 's own idea , when it was over , was that the charge covered three-quarters of a mile . It was really a mile and a quarter . Tennyson 's poetical " half a league " being within a quarter of a mile of literal exactness . It wee really like looking down at a stage , and soldiers of the several armies watched the charge at first with incredulity , then with amazement , and , in the case of at least one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears . And a French spectator , ueneral Bosquet , with the instinct of genius hit of words that have become part of the phraseological treasures of the world : " C'est magnifique , mats ce n'est pas la guerre ! ' " I got to my feet and looked ahead . Everything was wild and smoky , with great flashings , and I tried to catch a horse that ripped past me , and then I tried to run ahead and get at where our men was gripping with the enemy . I suppose I must have laid on the ground stunned-like for a minute or so , for the men that had been behind me was all in front of tue . " Men falling , pitching off in all sorts of ways , and other men , like me , on their feet , and wounded horses screaming and kicking . Awful , the noise a wounded horse makes , but it 's the kicking that 's the worst , for it lashes out in every direction with its hoofs , and many a wounded man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl away . " I could just make out what my comrades were doing , just in front of me , riding around and cutting and slashing ? right among the guns and even past the batteries ? just our handful against an army . And I tried to hurry forward on foot , and I could have cried that I was n't right in with them . " And then ? it seemed all in a moment , and it was only a minute or so ? there they was , coming back , still striking and slashing and firing their pistols , and big crowds of Rooshans trying to surround them or get in front to head us off . " And of course I started back too , and so we went up the valley that we 'd been a-charging down ? all that was left of us all that was left . " Some was still on horseback , and some was on foot , and many a man was bleeding , and some was limping , and some was falling . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although all we wanted now was to get back , just like a little before all we wanted was to get at the enemy , we did n't particular hurry . There was shot and shell still falling , but T suppose we 'd got so used to it that we did n't seem to notice it so much . I do n't pretend to understand . I just know that we went back , without stopping any , but not as men go back in a rout or a defeat . We just struggled back , in a manner of speaking , as a man might . push on through a storm to ' is ' ouse . " T' other day I was in the city and crossing the Strand , and what with cabsand ' buses and big roaring motors , and the crowd , and perhaps me getting old , I was glad to get for a minute or so to what they call an isle o ' safety . And as I stood there resting , the noise and the clutter and clatter and rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me think of that retreat up the valley . Only there war n't no isle o ' safety there ! " As I went on I saw one of the captains ? Captain Webb it was ? lying on the ground , and there was two troopers trying to help him . And one of them called to me . ' Lamb , ' he says , ca n't you give Captain Webb a drink of water ? ' " Now , my water bottle was strapped to my saddle ; we could carry our bottles that way if we wanted , or strapped to ourselves , and I always kept mine strapped to my saddle to keep my sword arm free . " So I had n't any water , and there was Captain Webb , wounded and suffering . And afterwards he died , sir . " Well , I felt that of course I must get that water for the captain , and so I went back , picking my way over horses and men , looking for an unsmashed bottle . I suppose it seemed qucerlike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I never took thought o ' that . I just wanted to get some water for Captain Webb , for he was a fine officer , and he was suffering . I would n't think of calling it bravery . I just wanted to get some water , and pretty soon I found it , strapped to the saddle of a dead horse . " I unfastened it , and all in. a minute it came to me that T never was so thirsty in all my life . That thirst , it was something awful the way it come over me the minute I got that water bottle in my hand . Till then I never thought of such a thing ? you do n't , while you 're fighting , you know . Well , I had never knowed such thirst , and there I was with water in my hand , and so I took a pull at it before I started back for Captain Webb . There was enough for us both , " he added , na ? vely . " I got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves , ' he was saying ; but he felt better with the drink of water , and then the two troopers helped him to get . ahead . " And now I saw a lancer close by , and T helped him on . and carried him on my back for a little . " Now , do n't think it was bravery at all . When there 's something to do like this you do n't notice shells or such things ; that 's all . " Well , we got back . We got back by ones and twos and little groups , riding or walking , perhaps staggering in wounded , and perhaps on a horse that was pretty nearly killed . And as each soldier or each party came in there was a cheer went up from all the other soldiers waiting there that had seen us go into the valley. * " And so we got hack , all that was left of us . I 've heard the verses that calls it that , and good soldier verses they are . Good soldier verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . They got some of us on a stage , you know , a few years ago , at a public benefit concert or show , and one of the big actresses ? I think it was Miss Terry ? she recited all those verses about the charge , and the people in the theatre they just cheered for us old Balaclava men sitting there . " He was silent for a little , going over and over the events of the long-past battle . Then he said , wistfully : " I almost got the V.C. for that little matter of the drink of water . For some of the men or the officers saw it , and so , when it was decided to pick a man from each of the five regiments for the V.C.-for they said that though every man deserved it , yet they could n't give it to every one of us ? well , for the 13th , it was decided that it was between my comrade Malone and me , and we were told to draw lots for it . And Malone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To Lamb 's mind it is clear that Malone won because he drew first . " He drew first , and so he got it , " he repeated , still Not over twenty minutes elapsed from the beginning of the charge to the time when the wrecks of the brigade got back . Of the 673 , 113 were killed and 134 wounded , and sufficient prisoners were taken to make the total loss over half the force . The loss would have been still heavier had not the French , without any request from the English , but moved by intense admiration for the gallantry of the exploit being performed under their eyes , sent in the Chasseurs d'Afrique in a fierce charge which silenced the guns on one of the flanks of the Six Hundred.aggrieved after all this time .

" Oh , they 'll hear it enough , never fear , " said his wife , dryly , who had entered as he neared the close of his tale . " I tell Lamb he talks about it too much , " she said , turning to me ; " he thinks it 's the only thing ever happened . " " Now , mother , " said the old veteran , deprecatingly , " the gentleman wanted to hear . " And then turning to me : " We 're getting old , and there wo n't be many more years for the telling of it . Seventy-eight I am ? and my wife , you would n't believe , would you , sir , that she 's eightyfour ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , as he caught a warning truculence of eye . ? I asked him about his wounds . " Oh , not bad ones . A shot in my leg ? I 've always carried the sear of it ? and a flesh wound right across my breast .
