txt Disorder in the stockyards fight developed into a serious state of affairs to-night , when a negro nonunionist shot and killed a striker , after having been attacked by the rioters . Lines of vigilant policemen guarded the entrances to the stockyards all day and night , but despite this . precaution disturbances were numerous . While an attack was being made on a crowd of colored strike breakers as they were leaving the stockyards to-night John Stokes , one of the strikers . was shot and fatally wounded by one of the negroes . Stokes , together with fully a hundred companions , it is said , nisshed on the negroes , and one of the latter drew a revolver and fired into the crowd , hitting Stokes . The police were close at hand and succeeded in scattering the rioters after considerable difficulty . The union men and their friends have become so embittered against the colored strike breakers that the appearance of a negro in the vicinity of the stock yards is almost certain to be followed by violence . A negro barber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stock yards to-night , was dragged to the street by a mob and beaten until unconscious . When the police arrived they announced that ' the colored man was dead , but in the course of an hour he was revived by physicians and will recover , The mob was under the impression that the barber was employed in some of the packing plants , and without waiting to ask any questions attacked him before he could offer an explanation . Chief of Police O'Neill , who has taken personal charge of the 375 policemen detailed to stockyards duty during the strike , declared to-night that the police had the strike situation well in hand , and that they would be able to control the strikers and their friends . Sympathetic Strike Complete . The teamsters voted to-night to join the general  --  Strike . and the 700 drivers employed in the packing industry in Chicago will quit work to-morrow . With the lunion teamsters out , every union organization represented in the Chicago packing plants will be on strike . The greater portion of the fresh meats disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the down-town district by these teamsters . With the men on strike and non-union men in their places , rioting is almost sure to follow . When Mayor Harrison was asked to-night if he intended to take any action in an attempt to stop the strike , he said that for the present at least the matter would be under the control of the Police Department . Little if any advantage was gained by either side to-day , and there is no hope tonight of any immediate- settlement of the difficulty , Realizing that they are facing one of the hardest propositions in the history of the packing industry , the packers are leaving nothing undone to gain the upper hand in the struggle with their 50,000 union employes who are on strike . All day long workmen from outside points were rushed to Chicago and taken to the stock yards under police protection to fill the places of the strikers . To-night it was announced by the packers that 7,000 new men were now installed in the different plants at the stock yards . With these men and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get their affairs in such shape that the strikers wil be compelled to seek a truce in the hostilities and a peaceable settlement at the dictation of the employers . Although the receipts of live stock to-day were small compared with receipts on corresponding days under normal conditions , many cattle , hogs , and sheep were left in the pens to-night unsold . With all the union workmen out on strike , with the exception of the packing house teamsters , the only additions to-day to the ranks of the strikers were about 100 teamsters , who quit work as individuals , preferring to do this rather than wait for an official order to walk out , and the waitresses in the restaurants at the stockyards controlled by the packing companies . The teamsters have become restless , and the general belief is that few if any of the 700 employed in the packing industry will wait for the sanction of the international officers of the union to go on strike . When questioned regarding the situation to-night Michael J. Donnelly , President of the Butchers ' Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no hope of an immediate settlement . The fight is on , and the only thing we can do now is to stick to the end . " Recall Ultimatum to Independents . The union organizations recalled their ultimatum issued yesterday prohibiting their members employed in the independent plants from killing live stock purchased in the stock yards . where the animals are being handled by non-union employes . The labor leaders took this step after the independent packers had pointed out to them that if such an order was carried out it ' would be a benefit to the packers . That hunger is felt among some of the families of the striking laborers and is driving them to deeds of desperation was Illustrated when a throng of women and children descended on a peddler 's wagon at Wood and West Forty-third Strets to-day . The sight of the wagon piled high with watermelons , peaches , and other fruit seemingly maddened the crowd , which , In an instant , swarmed over the wagon , seizing on everything within reach despite the peddler , who rained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock fading away , he drew a revolver and fired into the air to scare oft the invaders . At the sound of the shots a crowd of men appeared and charged on the peddler . Fleeing for his life before the enraged crowd the peddler escaped by jumping on a passing trolley car . When the police reached the scene the wagon was found stripped . Even the seat and movable boards had been carried off for firewood , Strike Breaker Almost Killed . Two thousand persons saw one of the most brutal cases of slugging and some of the poorest marksmanship on the part of the police since the strike at the Stock Yards began . A strike breaker , John Mulloy , had just left the yards , and reached Forty-first and Halsted Streets , when three men , of whom one is John Doody , attacked him : Mulloy was knocked down and nearly killed . His nose was broken , his eyes cut open with terrific blows , and one ear was nearly torn off . The sluggers had not completed their work when five policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a crowd of strike sympathizers and curious Spectators , through streets and alleys , to the Halsted Street Viaduct , the policemen calling upon the fugitives to stop on pain of being killed . The crowds in the streets were so large that the policemen were afraid at first to use their revolvers , and in the crush two of the sluggers leaped into a laundry wagon and were rapidly driven away . The third , man was kept In sight , and as soon as he reached the approach to the viaduct the policemen began shooting . The noise sounded as if a sham battle Was In progress . App.trently every shot was aimed to hit , but all missed . Doody had an apparently clear way ahea3 of him , and was running like a deer , when he stumbled and fell , Before he could pick himself up the policemen were upon him , and he was held until a patrol wagon came from the Stock Yards Police Station . He was put in a cell to await a hearing in court . Mulloy , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found by friends , who quickly took him away . Girls Precipitate Race War . Development of a race war is rapidly proceeding throughout the strike district . the trouble starting in the Stock Yards restaurants , where all the dining room girls quit on account of the presence of coiorea cooks . As rapidly as a girl took off her apron and walked out a colored man was employed in her place . Thereupon twentyfive girls in Swift &; Co. ' s restaurant quit in a body , twenty-five at Nelson Morris &; Co. ' s , and thirty at Armour &; Co. ' s . The first step taken by the feminine strikers after tearing off the aprons was to march to a hall and hold a meeting , where it was decided to- form themselves for . picket duty and see that no girls went into the yards to work either in the strike-afI ected places or in the restaurants of other firms . . A dozen of them took up places at Exchange Avenue and Halstead Street , and every young woman who passed was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do picket duty . Not a few complied , but the others broke away and fled Into the yards to work . Four girls were roughly handled , but not seriously hurt .
