THE autobiography of the Reverend Newman Hall , published about a dozen years ago , tells us that he began life as a reporter . In the exercise of his calling it was his fortune to take down a speech of Wilberforee 's which , as it turned out , was the last ever delivered by the philanthropist . After Hall had written out his notes he was sent to Fairleigh to submit the manuscript to the orator himself for revision . " All I remember about the interview , " he writes , " is the earnest attention with which he went over the proofs , and with what emphasis he said : ' Upon ! Upon ! Why upon ? Do n't say upon , but on . ' " Dr. Hall gave this story as an interesting illustration of Wilberforce 's careful attention to trifles in speech . In no way does it deserve that commendation . So far from being an exemplification of a careful attention to trifles , it is nothing but a specimen of countless illustrations that could be furnished of trifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eminence indulge tinder the fond persuasion that they are manifesting a noble zeal for preserving the purity of the language . It is needless to add that beliefs of this sort are not confined to men of eminence . As a rule . criticisms of the class to which this belongs are directed against special words and phrases . No small share of them is taken up with censure of something which is apparently not needed for the comprehension . The zeal of Wilberforce led him to attack the unnecessary up of upon . At least it did so in theory ; in practice he doubtless used , as does everybody , the objectionable form habitually , and in consequence had been reported accurately . But his correction of the word which he pretty surely employed suggests the consideration of a view of language which is constantly put forth as conveying a general truthnot to be gainsaid . It has further the special distinction of being always approved and enjoined by those who discourse upon usage , and of never being adopted in their own usage or in that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up constantly for admiration and imitation , it is the desirability of saying whatever is to be said in the fewest possible words . This is proclaimed everywhere as the ideal to be aimed at , and it is usually proclaimed at interminable length . There seems to be a generally accepted belief in theory that language ought to be regulated on purely economic principles . Everything not absolutely essential to convey the meaning should be discarded remorselessly . To act otherwise is to put a needless burden upon reader or hearer . It is to be remarked that the point of view which has just been indicated is in no wise limited to verbal criticism . There is hardly a single matter about which opinions of a nature essentially similar will not be found professed by some and often by many . There are those , for example , who object to winding roads , no matter how delightful the country they traverse , how pleasant the surprises the various turns cause to spring unexpectedly upon the sight . Now a railway is designed primarily for swiftness or despatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several , and often not the most important one . But the idea of the railway has affected the views of many modern men . To them a road is not a road in the proper sense of the word unless it conform to the mathematical definition of a straight line . It must be the shortest distance between two given points . The primary object of its existence in the eyes of such persons is to furnish easy and rapid conveyance to carts containing coal or lumber or manure . The result may be and usually is hideous . But to these practical gentlemen it is satisfactory , because their ideal conception of a highway as a work purely of utility has been successfully carried out . Now at the outset it is desirable to say that language is not disposed in the slightest degree to shut itself up within any restrictions of this sort . The principles by which its development is modified or governed are deeper and more philosophical than those of mere utility . It is , in truth , exactly the same with the clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What in the narrower sense is the unnecessary becomes in the broader sense the absolutely necessary . Shakespeare , while limiting it for his own purposes to the bodily covering . stated the general truth in the powerful lines in which ' , ear addresses Regan : The whole philosophy of style is here embodied in the philosophy of dress . There are few things said so concisely that they could not be said much more concisely were one willing to sacrifice all grace of expression to the desire to say what he has to say in the fewest possible words . But literature never has taken and never will take as its model the style of telegraphic despatches . The conveyance of meaning is but one of many motives which actuate either speaker or writer . What every one is consciously or unconsciously aiming to do is to make the meaning clearer or more effective , so that men shall not merely comprehend it , they shall have their attention arrested by it , shall be influenced by it , shall be gratified by the way in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel of silence , is proclaimed in hundreds - of articles and books . Every one , however little he himself follows its precepts , recommends them to his friends and charges disregard of them upon his foes . Now conciseness is neither a goodthing nor a had thing in itself . Its value , like its appropriateness , depends upon the subject , upon the occasion , upon the audience addressed . But the success of it depends most of all upon the personality of the speaker . If terseness can be united with vigor of expression which conveys the idea powerfully to the mind and with point which fixes it there , nothing can be more all-sufficient . Conciseness then has done its perfect work . But to effect this result requires great ability , if not genius ; and great ability , to say nothing of genius , is very exceptional . On the other hand , when brevity is united with dulness ? as it is very apt to be ? it loses not merely the power to influence and to inspire , but to inform . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted only to the highest order of minds . On the other hand , condensation , even when the matter is particularly valuable . is rarely entertaining . Intellectual fare can no more be made palatable by compression than can bodily . Pemmican is described as a food intended to comprise the greatest amount of nutrition in the smallest space . It is useful ? in fact , invaluable ? on certain occasions and in certain places . But no one is likely to choose it as a regular article of diet . still less to entertain his friends with it at a feast . A great dead can justly be said in favor of conciseness . There are those in whose case it would doubtless be an advantage if they carried its practice still further and said nothing at all . But it is well to look upon the other side of the shield . The whole system of education , for instance , rests upon en entirely different basis . Instruction proceeds upon the assumption that to make durable impression upon the mind it is not conciseness that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and the same ideas , and often in the very same words . There is nothing new about this principle . It has behind it the experience of the ages . It is precisely the attitude of the Hebrew prophet twenty-five hundred years ago . Line upon line , precept upon precept , here a little and there a little , was the way the word of the Lord was to be impressed upon those who were to be taught knowledge and made to understand doctrine . In the use of language men vary constantly between what may be deemed an unnecessary diffuseness and what some arc disposed to regard as improper conciseness . In the daily intercourse of life we constantly indulge in modes of expression which have no reason to show for their existence on the ground of utility . On the other hand , we proceed to omit what , grammatically speaking , is essential . Take a single illustration out of scores which present themselves . Why do we , in writing , address our correspondent as Nly Dear Sir ? The concluding word is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are addressing is not dear to us ; usually he does not belong to us in any sense . If the name of the person addressed is made to precede , even the Sir can be omitted and yet leave the intent of the writer perfectly clear . Why again before signing our own names do we interpose such phrases as Very truly yours , or Your obedient servant ? The words are wholly unnecessary ; if interpreted strictly , they are ordinarily false . In nine cases out of ten we are not truly our correspondent 's ; we should be indignant if any one really thought us to be what we call ourselves , his obedient servants . Usages of this sort may be demanded by convention ; but the moment we set up brevity and conciseness of speech as the ideal standard of expression there is nothing to be said in defence of any of these locutions . Let us , however , turn to another part of this same business of correspondence . If the method of addressing letters on the inside is found objectionable on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the outside struck men at first as objectionable on the score of brevity and the consequent assumed violation of grammar . To this day there are persons who still retain the practice , once general , of preceding the name upon the envelope by a For or a To . It is the survival of a usage which was in former days common , or perhaps it may be right to say universal . The omission of the preposition from the direction began to manifest itself conspicuously in the latter half of the eighteenth century ; at least that is the earliest period in which reference to it has fallen under the present writer 's notice . Naturally it pro-yoked considerable comment . It brought much grief to many estimable persons , who saw in it another agency contributing to the ruin of the language which is always impending unless certain usages they object to are abandoned . The feeling then provoked by this discarding of the preposition may perhaps be best , shown by an extract from a forgotten book of a forgotten man who had in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a music-composer named William Jackson . who in 1781 brought out two volumes of essays entitled Letters an Various SuNeets . The work was successful enough to pass through at least three editions . One of these essays embodied a protest against the practice just mentioned in the shape of a petition . from the preposition To . In this the petitioner is represented as complaining that " he had for years past had a place in the direction of all letters ? that he was first removed from thence , as be apprehended . by some member of Parliament , who was too much busied in his country 's good to attend to propriety . As it is the wicked custom of the world , " he continued , " to press down a falling man , the said To is in a manner totally displaced from his ancient possessions ; all people except the very few , who prefer grammar to fashion , agreeing to his removal . " The petitioner went on to say that he would have kept his complaints secret had his place been filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had himself displaced For . But to he succeeded by nothing was a revival of the levelling principles of the fanatics of the last century , which he felt to be something all lovers of the constitution must shudder at . " Consider , good people , " he concluded , " you who so well know the value of property , what quantities of letters are at this instant in the post-office that are neither To nor For any person . " The considerations so far advanced have dealt rather with general principles than with specific instances . Sufficient has been said , however , to indicate , what later will he shown more fully , that diverse and sometimes antagonistic influences are constantly operating upon the users of speech , and that these lead often to results entirely different and sometimes even actually conflicting . But the first example just given brings out sharply the one point that needs to be made emphatic here . This is that the desire to express themselves in the briefest possible way has never been a distinguishiug characteristic of men , whether ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms as it is of phrases and sentences . English in the course of its history has sloughed of a large proportion of its inflections . Some , however , have been retained which from the point of view of mere utility have no reason to show for their existence . Why , for instance , should -s terminate the third person singular of the present tense of the verb ? An ending is no more required there than is an ending in the first person or in the three persons of the plural . The pronoun or noun as subject would indicate sufficiently all that the speaker or reader would need to know in order to understand either the meaning or the grammatical construction . Yet no one designs or desires to dispense with this abstractly useless letter . It shows how little in the matter of speech we are governed by utilitarian considerations , how little we are disposed to abandon on the score of its needlessness what has come down to us , that it would require a revolution violent enough to unsettle the foundations of the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now occupies . But while not neglecting the consideration of grammatical forms , it is to the consideration of words and phrases which can be discarded without affecting the meaning that these articles will be mainly directed . In the general class called expletives will accordingly be included here for the sake of convenience not merely the locutions which go specifically under that name , but all the various expressions to which the terms redundant or pleonastic or tautological or intensive are applied . The number of these that are heard everywhere and are used by everybody makes up a somewhat formidable list when taken together . Still , it could not well be otherwise . Language is always disposed to resort to circumlocutions , to roundabout methods of expression , to the employment of two ormore words when a single one could apparently perform all the service that is really required . These theoretically unnecessary modes of expression have always existed ; they will always continue to exist . If he is to be stoned who in dulges in them , every one of us must expect to undergo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be takes exception to some one locution which contains words in his opinion utterly needless that he personally is free from committing offences of a similar nature . Damn6d custom , to use Hamlet 's phrase , has so brazed our conscience or our consciousness that we have come to be - unaware of the existence of our own frailties . So far from being sensitive to them we have ceased to be sensible of them . Numerous indeed are the motives which have led and still lead men to resort to expletives . Certain of those now in use contain little more than a repetition of the same idea expressed by two different words . A part of the compound has become obsolete or archaic ; hence it needs or needed to have its meaning strengthened . Luke , for instance , meant " tepid " ; but as it came to be somewhat unfamiliar , the sense was brought out with precision by adding to it worm . Different from this , though possibly allied to it , may be the attributive use of widow in the expression widow woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it may not have been always so . The difference of the final vowel in the original Anglo-Saxon words constituted the sole distinction between widuwa a " widower " and widuwe a " widow . " When the levelling processes that went on after the Conquest gave to both these words the same ending -e , a natural way to fix definitely the idea of femininity , before - er was added to create the masculine form , would be to append " woman " to the common word . If this were so . it would be almost inevitable that the combination would survive , long after the necessity for it had disappeared . However this may be , the expression has subsisted for centuries in our speech . When in our version of the Bible the woman of Tekoah tells King David , " I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead , " we are supplied in the same short sentence with illustrations of two different sorts of expletives . For the one the original Hebrew is necessarily responsible ; for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century had " woman widow . " But whatever the origin , the expression has come down to the present time . Nor is it confined , as is often asserted , to colloquial speech . To cite one instance out of many , it is used in Barnahy Budge by Dickens , when speaking in his own person . " To find this widow woman , " he says , . . . " linked mysteriously with an ill-omened man . . . was a discovery that pained as much as startled him . " A common influence operating upon the users of speech in the creation of expletives is the disposition to break up the Monotony of expression by varying the form of the sentence . Tf we were really overcome with a desire to discard the employment of useless words , if we were really anxious to say in the shortest space what we have to say , the language would be forced to undergo alteration and reconstruction to an extent that would leave much of its present structure hardly recognizable , For instance , none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . " Yet it is impossible to maintain that the adverb is in the slightest degree essential to the conveyance of the meaning . We could have expressed ourselves just as accurately , just as clearly , if we had simply said , as we often do say , " Many persons were present . " When we think of the vast number of sentences in our tongue which are introduced by the strictly useless there , we can get some faint conception of the extent to which , according to the glorifiers of the terse , the resources of speech have been squandered in the employment of this one unnecessary word . One observation is to be made here of the construction just given which applies equally well to a large number of others . There in the sentence cited is unquestionably an expletive ; but it does not strike us as an expletive . Usage has made this method of expression so familiar that the sense of the needlessness of any part of it has disappeared entirely . Whenever , in feet an unnecessary word or locutionhas established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually escapes reprehension because it escapes apprehension . Therein consists the security from attack of many of the phrases we hear daily . The redundant way of expressing one 's self has become so common that to us it is the proper or sometimes even the only possible way . A resort to the shorter but all-sufficient form of speech would appear stiff and pedantic . Usage in this matter plays strange tricks not merely with our practice , but with our perceptions . All of us would be puzzled to explain why one method of forming a sentence , though containing an expletive , strikes us as perfectly proper , and a method essentially similar grates upon our feelings merely because it contains an expletive . Even farther than this can we go . A word or phrase which is actually redundant sometimes does not seem so to us , while another word or phrase which seems to us redundant is not so at all . - Who , for example , in asking another his intentions about travelling , would put a question in such a form as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , nevertheless , all he needs to say in order to express the meaning fully . Yet to this method of interrogation the most ardent advocate of brevity would not resort . He would proceed to begin his sentence with a strictly unnecessary word , and say , " Do you go to Europe this summer ? " The one spoken to , if he wishes to reply in the negative , refrains in turn from confining himself to the perfectly adequate expression , " I go not to Europe this summer . " Instead he insists upon inserting into the sentence the word do . From the point of view of linguistic utilitarianism this auxiliary verb is pure surplusage . It is in that light a specimen of modern degeneracy ; for the ancient language knew it not . But let us take the same sentence and put it in another form . Any one of us , if he sought to declare an affirmative intention with the simple verb , would then confine himself to that without using any auxiliary . He would not think of placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his assertion emphatic . If he did so without some such motive . the redundant word would strike every one as distinctly objectionable . Consequently we leave out in the affirmative sentence what in the interrogative and the negative we regard as essential . No one will pretend that either in the nature of things or in the principles of grammar there is any real ground for this difference of usage . In truth , the distinction in the employment of these forms of expression is a comparatively modern one . Readers of sixteenth and seventeenth century literature are well aware that do , though its employment was then on the wane , was still found frequently in declarative sentences . It is the mere accident of usage that makes us now regard it as redundant in these . Dr. Johnson in his life of Cowley criticised that poet for his frequent use of do and did under such circumstances ; but he conceded that in the time of the latter this " inelegance of language , " as he phrased it , was little censured or avoided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been confined to the ears of his own contemporaries . But this usage of the past had witnessed its final day when in 1711 Pope could both attack it and exemplify as a fault in the single line , While expletives their feeble aid do join . When , indeed , we have come to feel that we can not get along without the use of some particular expression containing a word or words strictly unnecessary , these words have ceased to be redundant to us , whatever they may strictly be in themselves . But the process can be reversed . Let us take a locution which seems peculiarly exposed to the charge of containing an expletive and yet contains nothing of the sort . It is the colloquial have got in the sense of " have . " This expression is of peculiar interest , because it is a late partial exemplification of a process which took place on a considerable scale in that remote period in the history of our tongue when the English verb had only two tenses ? a present and a past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use . But their preterites continued to survive and took upon them the signification of presents . In so doing they assumed another meaning suggested by the change of form and time they had undergone . Starting VOL . CXV. ? No. 689. - 89thus on their course as independent verbs , they developed new preterites of their own . The steps which followed one another in procedures of this sort can be illustrated by the archaic uPot , " know , " and wise , " knew . " It is a common , if not the common , theory that wot is the past tense of a strong verb meaning " to see . " According to that view its strict signification is , " T have seen , " or , " I saw . " I saw , therefore I know , is the natural development of the sense . Thus assuming the meaning of a present , it proceeded to form a new preteriteteist . The account of the change that went on may or may not be true in this particular instance ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place . As these verbs have the form of a preterite and the meaning of a present , they are technically called preterite-presents . They constitute a most interesting class , if men will consent to believe that anything in grammar is entitled to the epithet of interesting . Of it the auxiliaries form an important contingent . in it dare would be included , were we to classify this word according to its origin . As its existing present was originally a preterite , it conformed to the inflection of that tense . Its third person singular therefore appeared regularly and still appears frequently without the final -s . Not until the sixteenth century did men venture to say " he dares " for the strictly proper " he dare . " Etymologically speaking , indeed , the verb ought no more to have an -s in the third person singular than can or shall . All the justification for the appearance there of this ending lies in good usage . A story exactly opposite can be told of another verb . Need belongs to the regular conjugation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be needs , if we defer to strict grammar ; but in certain cases , especially where it denotes obligation or necessity , it is disposed to drop and generally does drop the termination -s . We say preferably " he need not do it " instead of " he needs not do it . " This has been true of the verb for centuries . So while dare has assumed an -s to which it is not entitled , need has dropped one to which it is . But a peculiar interest attaches to have got in connection with the preterite-present verbs . As has been observed , it is a late partial exemplification of a process through - which they all went . Owing to its compound form it could not drop its present tense , nor could it develop a new past . But it could go and did go so far as to assume the meaning of a present . It is a somewhat noteworthy fact that the Greek verb meaning " to get " had a precisely similar history . As a consequence , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got is not really redundant . It is simply a natural and legitimate extension of meaning . Certainly if there is anything which a man can justly be said to have , it is that which he has got . The subsequent transition from the idea of acquisition to that of possession is both easy and proper . Still , as the same meaning can be expressed by its auxiliary have used as an independent verb , have got has been long subjected to much vituperation . It is not infrequently held up as a signal example of errors of speech . This has doubtless affected the feelings of some of those who employ it , though it has not affected the fortunes of the expression itself . It continues to be now , as it always has been , in the best of use . During all periods it occurs in the language of comedy . It belongs primarily to colloquial speech and the literature which represents or approaches colloquial speech . The persistent avoidance of it in that might at times render the speaker liable to the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oftentimes subject the writer to the imputation of lacking somewhat in the sense of fitness and decorum . For it must always be kept in mind that methods of expression which are appropriate and indeed necessary in one style may be quite out of place in another and distinctly different style .
