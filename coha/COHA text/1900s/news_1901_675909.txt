txt The upper half of the six-story carriage factory of Burr &; Co. on the northwest corner of Broadway and Fifty-fourth Street and the adjoining property of the Diamond Rubber Company , were nearly destroyed last night by a spectacular fire which raged over an hour before it was gotten under control . The fire started just after 11 o'clock and for many blocks around the streets were filled with people . Several thousand per ' sons , many of them in evening clothes , evidently returning from the theatres , made up a large part of the crowd . In the rear of the Diamond Company 's two-story building at 1,717 Broadway was where the fire began , and it was some time before the firemen had any warning that there was much danger except to the horses next door , in 0 . S. Bailey 's Rockingham stables . Men rushed out of street cars and into the stables to save the horses , many of which were blooded animals belonging to private families . Some of the horses balked at the bright light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten out and quartered in near-by stables . While the horses were being taken out one of the more spirited animals kicked a stableman in the head . He was taken to Roosevelt Hospital , where his wounds were dressed . Just as the burning rubber in the forward part of the building was practically put out , a sheet of flame burst through the roof toward the rear and shot up in the air alongside of Burr &; Co. ' s carriage factory , which took fire almost instantly in the fourth floor . A second and a fourth alarm brought a water tower , and for a few minutes it looked as if the fire would spread much further . Many of the residents in Fifty  --  fourth Street began to leave their houses with their more valuable personal property . While the flames were pouring out of all of the nine windows of the upper floors on the Fifty-fourth Street side of the carriage factory three firemen , who were kept drenched by the play of the water tower upon them , dragged a line of hose up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . In about one minute , which seemed fully an hour to the watching crowd , the flames were beaten back enough to give the firemen a chance to stand- on the escape unprotected by the tower , and a cheer went up from the crowd . An extension ladder was then run up on the front of the build : ing , and more firemen protected by a drenching stream carried up another hose . Chief Croker , who wp.s on his way to the fire , ? had been delayed 43y running down a man at Twenty-seven%th Street , as soon as he reached the scene mounted the long fire escape and led the fighting in the thick of the fire at the top of the building . For some time the men were not sure that they would not have to retreat . Shortly after 12 o'clock the fire was gotten under control , and within the next half hour the fire was pretty well extinguished except for the burning woodwwork in isolated parts of the gutted floors . The entire building was drenched with water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about $55.000 because it is not thought that the walls of the building suffered . The damage to the Diamond Rubber Company was not estimated , as the amount of stock on hand was not learned . When the fire was at its height a hose running through Fifty-fourth Street , just east of Broadway , burst in the middle of a crowd consisting largely of finely dressed women and men in evening clothes , who were drenched ' to their skins amid the laughter of the crowd , and there was a scattering that was much quicker than anything the police had been able to effect in their efforts to give the firemen room . The fire lines were in ? barge of Capt : Donohue and ' the reserves of the West Forty-seventh Street Police Station . Among the persons who witnessed the fire was Fire Commissioner John Scannell . In addition to the crowds in the street , the windows of the Hotel Bayard , the Artston , and two or three apartment hotels within a few blocks were filled with spectators . Traffic of the Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half and the cars crossing Fifty-third Street and running on Eighth Avenue were also blocked for the best part of an hour . While Chief Croker was speeding tip Broadway in his automobile on his way to the fire he struck a machinist employed in the Victoria Hotel , who was crossing at Twenty-seventh Street with a can of beer in his hands . The machine tossed the man about fifteen feet , and the beer flew In all directions . The man picked himself up but slightly hurt . He refused to tell his name . As the Chief was about to start on again a man who said he was John Linner , a shoe manufacturer of and President of the Town Council of Carlisle . Penn. , leaped in his way and abused him roundly for running the man down , told him he must be drunk , and ordered him to get off the machine . Chief Crokcr called to Policeman Magna and ordered him to arrest Limier , saying that he would return later and make a charge against him . Linner was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know who he was talking to , and was led away to the West Thirtieth Street Police Station , where at 1 A. M. he was still detained , pending the arrival of Chief Croker . Mr. Linner succeeded in obtaining bail before Chief Croker returned . He felt very bitterly over his arrest and declared that there was nothing about Chief Croker or his automobile to indicate that either belonged to the Fire Department . Chief Croker. on his way back from the fire , stopped at the station house and insisted that Mr. Linner be held and said he would appear in the Jefferson Market Police Court this morning to press his charge of interfering with a fireman against him .
