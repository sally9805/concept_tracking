txt That the Southern Pacific Railroad has been giving rebates up to . September of this year in flagrant and defiant violation of the law is charged by Franklin H. Lane , InterState Commerce Commissioner , who returned to-day from a trip to the West . Commissioner Lane will make his report *e the commission at an early date , certain data . will be turned over to the Department of Justice , and it is expected here that an early prosecution will be begun against Edward H , Harriman and other officials of the Southern Pacific . Any prosecution of the Southern Pacirta officials for the rebating disclosed try Commissioner Lane 's investigation Will be made under the Hepburn law , Which provides a penalty of imprisonmenal as well as a fine , in the discretion of the court The law specifically declares that any officer , Director , employe , or agent of the road granting rebates is liable to this punishment , and fixes the term at two years for each offense . In the Standard Oil case in Chicago , Judge Landis held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecution had been under the Hepburn law , Judge Landis could have sent the Standard Oil officials to the penitentiary for 2,924 years . It a conviction is obtained in the Southern Peeifics case and the Landis construction of the law is upheld things can be made mighty unpleasant for Mr. Harriman . There is no question that the Department of Justice will push this case as hard as it can . The desire of the Administration to make an example of some of the " predatory wealthy " will not be slackened because the victim in this Parilaular ease happens to be the man whom the President described as " at least as undesirable a citizen as Moyer and Haywood . " In San Francisco last week Commissioner Lane compelled the officials of the Southern Pacific to produce their books from which it was learned that the company had never ceased to give rebates . C. B. Seger , auditor of the Southern Pacific , testified that a secret system of bookkeeping was used , a " third account , " whose existence , he said , was made known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after assuming the office Of auditor . This " third account " comprised " in-side rates " less than the regular published schedules of tariff furnished the Ordinary shippers . He was led to their discovery , he said , by certain papers passing through his office which were wholly irregular . On inquiry he found that a certain set of books was kept in the office of the freight traffic manager . He demanded that these books be placed under his supervision . When they came he found they had not been kept in the regular office of the Freight Claim Department , but had been placed in a separate room with two confidential clerks . Rebates for Favored Shippers . They were , he found , kept for the purpose of paying rebates to certain favored ' inter-State shippers . Although his office ! had never paid any rebates , he admitted I that the company had a regular rebating I system covering all State business . When Freight Claim Agent Brewer was I called upon to produce other books re- I lating to these " third account " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane compelled their production . Examination showed that they comprised a great number of inter-State shipments of late date , directly in dis-1 obedience of the law . Among these were I shipments of ice from California to Nevada points and hides from New Mexico I to California points . In all cases a lower rate than the published schedule had been given to favored shippers . An interesting case was that of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company , relat- I ing to a shipment of nails from Colorado ! to Arizona . G. W. Luce , the " inside I man " of the Southern Pacific , had given ? ; to the company a lower rate than that quoted . When the rebate claim was pre- I seated to Brewer 's office it was promptly ; refused , as promptly appealed to G. W. Luce , and as promptly allowed . This is I one case typical of many shown by the books Commissioner Lane brought to Pa ' - Mr. Luce , it seems , stood guard oveeethe interests of the poor shippers , standing begging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no law . the Southern Pacific Company should not break its promised word  --  and the rebates was paid . In every case when the other officials who were not on the " inside " refused the claims of certain favored shippers tearful appeal was made to Mr. Luce , and relief in the form of a. substantial rebate was found there . Mr. Scrivener , Secretary of the Associated Oil Company , which is alleged by ! all California papers . as an open secret , to ; he a branch of the Standard Oil Company , testified that a large block of the stock is ownectby W. F. Herrin , general counsel of the Southern Pacific Company . This company has free switching on the tracks at San Jose , while an outside company . the California Gas and Electric Cornpany , has " ... special switching rates " at ; 2.50 per car . It was shown by the books that since the fire in San Francisco the Associated Oil Company etas received in the form of regular rebates the sum of Sle.G90 . The California Pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Box Trust , " has received during that time rebates amounting to =251. - 12 . The Union Ice Company was shown to have received during the same period the sum of $18,5CELSB . Miller and Lux , the great farmers of California , who are the soul of the Western " Beef Trust , " have received since the earthquake period the sum of $25 , - 9J4.36 , all in Inter-State rebates . It slier and Lux also enjoy a special rate in lumber . When their representative was questioned as to why they were accorded a rate less than another company using the same lines , he replied that it was because , he understood , that In certain contingencies the rival company might not be able to afford the neccasary fecal  --  les . For this reason , he said , Harriman 's railroad system gave his company a rebate . These are a few instances selected from the Investigation of Commissioner Lane . That he has returned with evidence enough , to present to the Department of Justice and call upon the Attorney General to proceed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the head , is certain from the instances cited . The Southern Pacific has , according to the evidence contained in Commissioner Lane s budget , been guilty of numberless criminal offenses against the Inter-State act , and that the officials will be proceeded against through the Department of Justice there can be no doubt
