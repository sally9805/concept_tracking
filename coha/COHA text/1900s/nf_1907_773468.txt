txt // the very best that he is capable of , during the day . How superbly he carries himself who knows that he can work out the Creator 's design each day , and has no fear , or doubt , or anxiety as to what he can accomplish . He feels that he is master of himself , and knows to a certainty that no moods or conditions have power to hinder him . He has come into his dominion . Amid the feverish rush and turmoil of modern life , the fierce competition , and the nerve-exhausting struggle for existence in which the majority are engaged , we see here and there serene souls who impress us with a sense of power and of calm , unhesitating assurance , and who travel toward their goal with the rhythmic majesty of the stars . They have learned how to think correctly ; they have mastered the secret of successful living . It is true this supreme self-control , which enables a man to rise to his highest power , is one of the ultimate lessons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement and is possible to all . Sometime we shall all learn better than to harbor , even for an instant , any suicidal thought or emotion . We shall no more dream of entertaining thoughts of fear , envy , or jealousy , or worrying , fretful , or anxious thoughts , than we would of entertaining thieves or murderers in our homes . The time will come when intelligent people will no more indulge in fits of anger , will no more indulge in uncharitable thoughts , feelings of hatred or ill-will , or gloomy , depressing , downward-tending thoughts , than they would take poison into the system . Thousands of people who never amount to much could do the work of giants if they could only conquer their moods . XXV . LET YOUR DECISION BE FINAL . THE day before the terrible disaster at St. Pierre , the Italian bark , " Orsalina , " was taking her cargo aboard , but her skipper , Captain Marino Leboffe , became so alarmed by the threatening appearance of the volcano that he decided to stop loading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acting protested , and threatened to have him arrested if he should attempt to leave the harbor with only half his cargo aboard . But the captain was immovable . To their angry remorastrances and repeated assurance that Mt . Pelee was not dangerous , his firm reply was , " I do n't know anything about Mt . Pelee , but if Vesuvius should look as your volcano does this morning I would get out of Naples and I am going to get out of here . I would rather sail with half a cargo than run such a risk as a man would run here . " Twenty-four hours later , the shippers and the two custom-house officers who had tried to arrest Captain Leboffe were dead at St. Pierre , while the " Orsalina , " with her captain and crew , was safe on the high seas , heading toward France . A strong will and an unalterable decision had won , where weakness and yielding vacillation would have led to destruction . 151 // The great demand of to-day is for the strong , vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his mind , but does so with firmness , and , when he has considered all the circumstances and conditions of the matter he is called upon to decide , does so once for all , and then throws it off his mind and passes to something else . Such a man has usually superior executive ability . He can not only make a programme , but he can also carry it out . He can not only decide upon a course , but he can also execute it to a finish . Every watch has an unseen spring back of the dial which compels the wheels to revolve and makes the hands mark the time with precision ; so , beneath the works of every great enterprise , at the head of every great establishment , although not often seen by the public , is a strong character of this kind , a man with an iron grip , who makes things go and forces the wheels of the machine around , regulating their motion with precision . There is no going back of him ; his decision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise , or suggest , but he is the man who makes the programme and sees that it is carried out . He is the dominating power . Everything else must point to him , and all others must get their cues or orders from him . If he steps out or ceases to act , the institution is like a watch with a broken mainspring . The wheels are all there , and everything else is in place , but the power is gone and nothing moves . The iron hand , the decisive power back of it all , has failed to lend its impulse . The splendid business which A. T. Stewart had built up went to pieces when the great executive and organizing force that had guided it was removed . The famous old " New York Ledger , " which Robert Bonner , by his audacious and original business 4 ! // methods , had raised from an insignificant little financial sheet known as the " Merchant 's Ledger " to be the leading story paper of this country , began to decline immediately after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is only one of these great leaders to thousands of followers . It is easy to trail , to lean , or to hang onto the one who leads , but it takes courage , grit , and stamina to be original , prompt , and decisive , to stand squarely on one 's own feet , and to trust entirely to one 's own judgment . If you are a vacillator , if you have acquired a habit of hesitating , or of weighing and considering and reconsidering , never quite knowing what you want , you will never be a leader . This is not the stuff of which leaders are made ; for , whatever else a leader may lack , he knows his own mind . He knows what he wants , and makes straight for it . He may make mistakes ; he may fall down now and then , but he gets up promptly and always pushes on . The man who decides quickly can afford to make mistakes ; for no matter how many he makes he will get on faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a wrong course that he dares not start out to do anything . Those who wait for certainties , or stand on the brink of the stream waiting for somebody to push them in , never reach the other shore . One of the most pitiable objects in the world is the man who is forever hanging trembling in the balance , who never knows which way to turn , who is the prey of conflicting opinions and the victim of the greatest pressure , who follows the counsel of the last man who ad154 11V THE CHEERING-UP BUSINESS . vises him , who moves along the line of least resistance , and who does not feel within himself the power to decide things . The very reputation of being cursed with a yielding disposition , of being easily moved from your conviction , or of being unstable in your opinions is fatal to all confidence , ? to credit . A great many people seem to have a mortal dread of deciding things . They do n't dare to take the responsibility , because they do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should decide upon one thing to-day , something better may come up to-morrow and cause them to regret their first decision . These habitual waverers so completely lose their self-confidence that they do not dare to trust themselves to decide anything of importance . Many of them ruin naturally fine minds by nursing the fatal habit of indecision . I know a man who never closes anything of any importance if he can possibly avoid it . Everything is left open for further evidence . He will not seal his letters until the very last minute lest he may want to change something . Time and again I have seen him tear open the seal of an envelope , after it was stamped and ready to mail , in order to make some change . He has even been known to telegraph to people to return his letters without opening them . Although this man is a great worker , a man of fine character , and splendid friend , he has such a reputation of being whimsical and uncertain in his judgment , always ready to reconsider anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has already done , that he has never won the confidence of business men with hard sense . Everybody who knows him feels sorry for his weakness , but does not want to trust him with anything of importance . // Another victim of vacillation whom I know is a lady whose character in other respects is admirable . Whenever she wishes to buy anything she makes a tour of all the stores in her city where the articles she wants are sold . She drifts from counter to counter , from department to department , from store to store , pulling over the goods on the counters , holding them up , and looking at them from different standpoints , but never knowing exactly what she wants . She would like to look at something " a little different " in shade , or at " a little different " style of goods . She can not quite tell what will be most becoming to her . She will try on all the hats in the shopping district , look at all the dresses , and tire out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home without buying anything . If she does purchase , she is in doubt as to whether or not she has done just the right thing , wonders if she would better take it back and change it , and asks the opinion of everybody she knows . She wants something that is warm , and yet not too heavy or too warm . She wants something that will be comfortable on both a hot day and a cold one ; something that will be appropriate for the mountains or the seashore , for the church or the opera , ? some combination impossible to procure . She seldom buys anything without changing it two or three times , yet is never satisfied . Such wavering and inconstancy of mind are fatal to all character building . No one who is thus cursed will ever have any close-knit fibre of character or stamina timber . Such things ruin one 's confidence in himself and his own judgment , and are destructive to all mental effectiveness . Your judgment must dwell in the depths of your l5G IN TILE CHEERING-UP BUSINESS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , out of the reach of the waves of emotion , passion , or moods , or the advice or criticism of others , and beyond the reach of superficial disturbance . This is the kind of judgment that is always sought in any matter of weight or importance , ? one which is beyond the reach of the influence of anything but the right . One of the tragedies of life is to see magnificent ability held down by some little weakness , when , perhaps , most of the faculties are strong and vigorous . Thousands of people , to-day , are struggling along in mediocrity with ability enough to have taken them to the heights where excellence dwells , but for one lack in their nature , ? ability to decide quickly and finally . The tragedies of untrusted judgments have given the world more failures than actual incompetence . An engineer who starts to build a bridge and then keeps finding better places to put his piers , and wondering whether he has selected the best location or not , will never get the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and build the bridge , no matter what obstacles he may strike . So it is with the builder of character , he must decide finally what he will do , and then make for his goal , refusing to look back or be moved from his course . Tens of thousands of young people with good health , good education , and good ability are standing on the end of a bridge at life 's crossing . They hope they are on the right way , they think they are doing the right thing , and yet they do not dare to burn . the bridge they have just crossed . They want a chance for retreat in case they have made a mistake . They can not bear the thought of cutting off all possibility of turning back . // 1 They lack the power to decide conclusively what course they will take . These young people are in danger of wrecking their lives by their hesitation . If they would only make up their minds to burn their bridges behind them , and thus concentrate their powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances of success . All of their resources would then rush to their assistance , buttress them against obstacles , and make their victory certain . But while there is a doubt in their minds , and they hold the path of retreat open , they will never amount to much . If indecision runs in the blood you inherit , arouse yourself and strangle this insidious foe to your achievement before it saps your energy and ruins your life chance . Do not wait until to-morrow , but begin to-day . Compel yourself to develop the opposite quality by the constant practice of firm decision . No matter how simple the thing you are called upon to decide , be it the choice of a hat or the color or style of a garment , do not vacillate . Throw all the light possible on whatever you have in hand for decision ; weigh and consider it from every point of view ; call your common sense and best judgment to your aid before reaching a conclusion , and then , when you have once made your decision , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no reconsidering , and no opening the matter up for further discussion . Be firm and positive . Declare the polls closed . Persist in this course until the habit of firm decision becomes fixed and you will be surprised to see what it will do for you , both in increasing your confidence in yourself and that of others in you . You may make // mistakes in the beginning , but the strength and reliance you will gain in your own judgment will more than compensate for these . The power to decide firmly strikes at the very marrow of ability . If you can not do this your life ship will always be adrift ; you will never be anchored . You will drift about on the seas at the mercy of storms and tempests , and will never make your port . XXVI . GREAT DETERMINATION AND LITTLE TALENT . How can we account for the fact that many of the greatest things in the world are done by one-talent men , while the ten-talent , the versatile man is never heard from ? Everywhere we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability , and we do not understand it at all . We can not understand why the boy who was at the foot of our class in school or college has distanced us in the great life race , for he did not have half the ability we possessed . We laughed at him at school , but , somehow , he has focused his energies upon one thing and , like a tortoise , he kept plodding until he " arrived . " He has managed to keep ahead , to accumulate a competence with one talent , while our ten talents are still drifting without aim or results . The very consciousness of being dull and stupid has spurred many a boy on to make the most of what little ability he had . The very humiliation of being told so often by teachers and parents that he is not bright makes him determined that he will not be a nobody . The very comparison of himself with his brilliant brother has perhaps made him set his teeth with a resolution to show that the brother has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discovering or having it impressed upon him how limited his abilities are , he makes great efforts , and not being versatile , he does not have the temptation to dissipate his energies on a score of things , but simply develops his one talent and makes the most of it . He can concentrate and focus his powers more easily than can the ten-talent man . He does not have to meet constantly the arguments on this hand and on that , that perhaps he could do something else better . He knows if he succeeds at all it must be by developing his one talent , and he focuses all his attention upon it . We hear a great deal of talk about genius , talent , luck , chance , cleverness , and fine manners playing a large part in one 's success . Leaving out luck and chance , we grant that all these elements are important factors in the battle of life . Yet the possession of any or all of them , unaccompanied by a definite aim , a determined purpose , will not insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants of the race , the men who have been conspicuously successful , we shall find that they all had one characteristic in common ? doggedness and persistence of purpose . It does not matter how clever a youth may be , whether he leads his class in college or outshines all the other boys in his community , he will never succeed if he lacks this essential of determined persistence . Many men who might have made brilliant musicians , artists , teachers , lawyers , able physicians or surgeons , in spite of predictions to the contrary , have fallen short of success because they were deficient in this quality . Persistency of purpose is a power . It creates confidence in others . Everybody believes in the determined man . When he undertakes anything his battle is half won , because out to do . People know that it is useless to oppose a man who uses his stumbling-blocks as stepping-stones ; who is not afraid of defeat ; who never , in spite of calumny or criticism , shrinks from his task ; who never shirks responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of his purpose , no matter what storms may rage about him . What good would it do to oppose such a man as Grant ? One might as well attempt to snub the sun . There were many more brilliant men in the Northern army , but no other was so dogged , so persistent in purpose as Grant . He could see but one thing ? the triumphant end . It did not matter how long it might take to reach that end . It must be fought out on that line " if it took all summer . " Napoleon was much more brilliant than Wellington , but was not a match for him in dogged persistence . The iron duke could stick to a losing campaign with as much determination as to a winning one . He did n't know how to beat a retreat . The persistent man never stops to consider whether he is succeeding or not . The only question with him is how to push ahead , to get a little further along , a little nearer his goal . Whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach it . Every other consideration is sacrificed to this one dominant purpose . The success of a dull or average youth and the failure of a brilliant one is a constant surprise in American history . But if the different cases are closely analyzed we shall find that tl : explanation lies in the staying // power of the seemingly dull boy , the ability to stand firm as a rock under all circumstances , to allow nothing to divert him from his purpose , while the brilliant but erratic boy , lacking the rudder of a firm purpose , neutralizes his power and wastes his energy by dissipating them in several directions . We often find that boys who have educated themselves in the country , almost without schooling or teachers , make the most vigorous thinkers . They may not be quite as polished or cultivated in some ways , but they have something better than polish , and that is mental vigor , originality of method , and independence . They do not lean upon their schooling , or depend upon their diplomas ; necessity has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves and be practical ; they know little of theories , but they know what will work . They have gained power by solving their own problems . Such self-educated , self-made men carry weight in their communities because they are men of power and think vigorously and strongly ; they have learned to concentrate the mind . Self-help is the only help that will make strong , vigorous lives . Self-reliance is a great educator and early poverty a good teacher . Necessity has ever been the priceless spur which has called man out of himself and spurred him on to his goal . Grit is more than a match for almost any handicap . It overcomes obstacles and abolishes difficulties . It is the man who makes an opportunity and does not wait for it ? the man who helps himself and does not wait to be helped ? that makes the strong thinker and vigorous operator . // It is he who dares to be himself and to work by his own programme , without imitating others , who wins . If you will greatly succeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuality , your independence , your originality , be so trainees that you will not be lost in the crowd . No one else can solve your problem , or work out your riddle . You stand or fall by it . Your happiness , your well-being , your success and your destiny hang upon your carrying out the programme the Creator has given you . No matter how skilfully constructed or how powerful the locomotive may be , unless the water used to run it is boiling , the train will not move an inch . What the boiling water is to a locomotive , enthusiasm is to a man . No matter how great his ability or diversified his talents , unless he is filled with that enthusiasm which generates energy , great motive power , as the boiling water generates the steam which propels the train , he will never accomplish anything noteworthy . Every successful person , whatever his profession or occupation , is filled with this stimulating force . It is this which enables him to overleap obstacles , to spurn hardship and privation to dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal fire kindles sleeping powers , stimulates latent energies , and arouses resources undreamed of before . It multiplies ability and often takes the place of talent . XXVII . MINIMIZING DIFFICULTIES . THE world has little use for the weak-kneed , the fainthearted , but the conqueror who carries victory in his very presence , who overcomes opposition which appalls weak minds , who does not skip his difficult problems , who conquers everything which gets in his way , is always in demand . People who accomplish but little usually have a genius for seeing difficulties in the way of everything they undertake . Their imaginations conjure up obstacles which rise iii their pathway , like giants or great mountain peaks , and paralyze their courage . They can see them a long way off . They begin to look for them as soon as they plan any course of action ; they wait for them , and , of course , they find them . These people seem to wear obstacle glasses and they see nothing but difficulties . There is always an " if " or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , ? just enough to keep them from taking the necessary step or making energetic effort to get what they want . They do not think there is any use trying to get a situation which they see advertised because there will probably be a hundred other applicants ahead of them when they get there . They see so many people out of employment that they have no hope of getting a position for themselves ; or , if they have one , they see so many 164 // obstacles to their advancement , so many ahead of them , so many favored by their employer , that when there is a vacancy they stand no show for promotion . No man can rise to anything very great who allows himself to be tripped or thwarted by impediments . His achievement will be in proportion to his ability to rise triumphantly over the stumbling-blocks which trip others . When I hear a young man whining that he has no chance , complaining that fate has doomed him to mediocrity , that he can never get a start for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see him finding unconquerable obstacles everywhere , when he tells me that he could do this or that if he could only get a start , if somebody would help hint , I know there is very poor success material in him , ? that he is not made of the stuff that rises . He acknowledges that he is not equal to the emergencies which confront him . He confesses his weakness , his inability to cope with obstacles which others surmount . When a man tells us that luck is against him , that he can not see any way of doing what he would like to do , he admits that he is not master of the situation , that he must give way to opposition because he is not big enough or strong enough to surmount it . He probably has n't lime enough in his backbone to hold a straw erect . There is a weakness in the man who always sees a lion in the way of what he wants to do , whose determination is not strong enough to overcome the obstacle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard work . He wants success , but he does not want it badly enough to pay the price . The desire to // drift along , to take things easy , to have a good time , overbalances ambition . Obstacles will look large or small to you according to whether you are large or small . People who have a tendency to magnify difficulties lack the stamina and grit necessary to win . They are not willing to sacrifice a little comfort and pleasure . They see so much hardship in working their own way through college or starting in business without capital that they do neither . These people always look for somebody to help them , to give them a boost . When a boy tells me that he just yearns for an education , that he longs to go to college , but that he has no one to help him as other boys have , that , if he had a rich father to send him to college , he could make something of himself , I know perfectly well that that boy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply like to have it if it could be gotten without much effort . He does not long for it as Lincoln did . When a boy to-day says that he can not go to college , ? although deaf , dumb , and blind girls manage to do it , ? I know that he has such a knack of seeing difficulties that he will not only miss college , but will probably also miss most of what is worth while in life . The young man who , after making up his mind what he wants to do in the world , begins to hunt up obstacles in his path , to magnify them , to brood over them until they become mountains , and then to wait for new ones to develop , is not a man to take hold of great enterprises . The man who stops to weigh and consider every possible danger or objection never amounts to anything . He is a small man , made for little things . He walks around // an obstacle , and goes as far as he can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strong man , the positive , decisive soul who has a programme , and who is determined to carry it out , cuts his way to his goal regardless of difficulties . It is the weak-kneed man , the discouraged man , who turns aside , who takes a crooked path to his goal . Men who achieve things , who get things done , do not spend time haggling over perplexities , or wondering whether they can overcome them . A penny held close to the eye will shut out the sun . When a man lies down on the ground to see what is ahead of him , a rock may hide a mountain . A small man holds petty difficulties so closely in view that great objects beyond are entirely shut out of sight . Great minds keep their eyes on the goal . They hold the end so persistently in view , and it looks so grand and desirable , that the intermediate steps , no matter how perplexing , are of comparatively little importance . The great man asks but one question , " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties will I run across ? " If it is within the reach of possibility , all hindrances must be pushed aside . We meet these trouble-borrowing , difficulty-seeing people everywhere . There is usually one or more on every school board and church board , every board of directors or trustees , who always sees difficulties which do not appear to the others , and if everything depended upon these people nothing would ever be accomplished . Nearly every invention , discovery , or achievement which has blest the world would have failed had the calamityhowlers , the objection-seers been listened to . The youth who is bound to win may see difficulties The youth who is bound to win may see difficulties , 16S IN THE CLIEERING-UP BUSINESS . but he is not afraid of them because he feels that they are no match for his grit . He feels within himself a power infinitely superior . He knows perfectly well that undaunted pluck can annihilate them . To his deternination they do not exist . The Alps did not exist to Napoleon , not because they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that he was greater than they . His generals could see the Alps , with all their terrors , and thought they were impassable ; but the mighty general saw only victory on the green plains beyond the eternal snow . You will find that the habit of minimizing annoyances or difficulties , of making the best of everything that comes to you , of magnifying the pleasant and the agreeable and reducing to the least possible importance everything that is disagreeable or unpleasant , will help you wonderhilly not only in your work but also in your attainment of happiness . It transforms the disagreeable into the agreeable , takes the drudgery out of distasteful tasks , eases the jolts of life wonderfully , and it is worth infinitely more than money . You will find yourself growing to be a larger , completer man . The sunny , buoyant , cheerful soul manages , without losing his equilibrium , to glide over difficulties and annoyances which throw others off their balance and make them miserable and disagreeable . The Creator never put the grandest of his creations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or intended him to be crushed by obstacles . Character was never intended to be ruined by irritation . But even the Creator can not make a man who is determined to use blue glasses see things in a white light . It all depends upon the color of the glasses you adopt , ? your own mental attitude . // Every man has within him the power of changing the blue into white , the disagreeable into the agreeable ; every one has the crystal lens which may resolve even murky light into rainbow hues . No man ever amounted to much in the world until he learned to put out of the way things which would trip him , or to get rid , at any cost , of the things which block his passage . Self is the greatest stumbling-block . Our own selfishness , our desire for comfort , for pleasure , is the greatest obstacle in the path of all progress . Timidity , doubt , and fear are great enemies . Guard your weak point , conquer yourself , and you can conquer everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obstacles are like wild animals . They are cowards but they will bluff you if they can . If they see you are afraid of them , if you stand and hesitate , if you take your eyes from theirs , they are liable to spring upon you ; but if you do not flinch , if you look then squarely in the eye , they will slink out of sight . So difficulties flee before absolute fearlessness , though they are very real and formidable to the timid and hesitating , and grow larger and larger and more formidable with vacillating contemplation . Charlotte Perkins Gilman , in her little poem , " An Obstacle , " describes a traveler struggling up a mountain side , bent on important business , and bearing a heavy load , when suddenly a huge obstacle spread itself across his path . He was dismayed . He politely begged the obstacle to get out of his path . It did not move . Ile became angry and abused it . He knelt down and prayed it to let him pass . It remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , when a sudden inspiration seized him . Let him tell in his own words how he settled the matter : " I took my hat , I took my stick , My load I settled fair , I approached that awful incubus With an absent-minded air ? And I walked directly through him As if he was n't there ! " Most of our obstacles would melt away if , instead of cowering before them , we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them . XXVIIIL FORTUNE SEED . IF a person who has received a comfortable salary for five or ten years suddenly finds himself out of a position , without any money saved up , he is quite likely to blame his luck , instead of looking at the matter with a dispassionate mind and realizing that experience is putting before him , in the most convincing manner , a lesson which he needs to learn by heart . If , instead of bemoaning his " luck , " he will listen , a still , small voice will whisper to him of nickels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dimes , and dollars spent which have not yielded their value in enjoyment . Money spent on legitimate pleasures need never be regretted . Legitimate pleasures are those which do not leave a bad taste in the mouth , but , instead , bestow delightful memories that no amount of hardship can deprive one of . The writer knows of a person whose income has unexpectedly been cut off , leaving him quite unprepared . For years he has lived up to the limit of his salary giving no thought to the future . " Think of it , " he remarked , desperately , " had I but saved only ten cents a day for the last fifteen years , and I could have done so without ever missing it , I should now have five hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty cents , not allowing 171 // for accrued interest . But I might have saved a great deal more than that , without foregoing any real pleasures . ' T is maddening to think of such folly , and I deserve the hard time I am having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of a laboring man could not save ten cents a day without a great deal of self-sacrifice . It is certainly no over-statement of fact to assume that the average workingman in this country might save five cents a day without undergoing deprivations . The amount is too small to be worth while . Let us see ? Suppose that a young man of twenty-one should make a vow to put away at least five cents a day , each day in the year , and not to touch his savings for ten years . Do you realize that , at the end of that time , he would have one hundred and eighty-two dollars and fifty cents to his credit , as a result of putting away an amount so small that he would never miss it ? Many enormous fortunes have grown from a smaller capital than this . If a man has good brains , energy , and , at the age of thirty-one , a capital of one hundred and eighty-two dollars and fifty cents , there is no reason why , at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , if he be a man of ordinary ability . If , on the other hand , he has the money-making talent , there is no reason why he should not be well started on the road to wealth . If in ten years , his earliest and best years , he can accumulate but five cents a day , he will never become very rich . The power of small things is one of the most important facts of life and too much stress can not be laid upon it . It is absurd and illogical to despise the units when there can be no tens and hundreds without them . A 1 // man alone may be puny and insignificant ; but , multiplied , he constitutes the power which dominates the earth . One penny may seem to you a very insignificant thing , but it is the small seed from which fortunes spring . If we want to raise a flower or vegetable , we procure the seed , plant it in good soil , and do all that we can to facilitate its growth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant ; but sometime , somewhere , somebody planted the seed . The penny is nothing in the world but the seed of that wonderful growth which the best of us can not help admiring , and for which all of us long ? the fortune plant ! If you would have one of these wonderful plants for your own , if you dream of sitting at ease under its branches in your old age ; go about it in a rational way . From this moment , treat that little disk of copper , with the head of an Indian on one side and " ONE CENT " on the other , with the respect that a fortune seed deserves . Do n't scatter and waste seeds so valuable , but plant them in the soil which will foster them ? the savings bank . There is hardly an able-bodied laborer who might not become financially independent if he would but carefully husband his receipts and guard against the little leaks of needless expense . But , unfortunately , this is the one thing which the working-man finds it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to work hard to every half-dozen who are willing properly to husband their earnings . Instead of hoarding a small percentage of their receipts , so as to provide against sickness or want of employment , they eat and drink up their earnings as they go , and thus , in the first financial // crash , when mills and factories " shut down " and capitalists lock up their cash instead of using it in great enterprises , they are ruined . Men who thus live " from hand to mouth , " never keeping more than a day 's march ahead of actual want , are little better off than slaves . " I have often been asked to define the true secret of success , " says Sir Thomas Lipton . " It is thrift in all its phases and , principally , thrift as applied to saving . A young man may have many friends , but he will find none so steadfast , so constant , so ready to respond to his wants , so capable of pushing him ahead , as a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cover . Saving is the first great principle of success . It creates independence , it gives a young man standing , it fills him with vigor , it stimulates him with proper energy ; in fact , it brings to him the best part of any success , ? happiness and contentment . If it were possible to inject the quality of saving into every boy we would have a great many more real rues . " " Provided he has some ability and good sense to start with , " said Philip D. Armour , " there is no reason why any young man who is thrifty , honest , and economical should not accumulate money and attain so-called success in life . " When asked to what qualities he attributed his own success , Mr. Armour said : " I think that thrift and economy had much to do with it . I owe much to my mother 's training and to a good line of Scotch ancestors who have always been thrifty and economical . " " Every boy should realize , in starting out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of saving , " says Russell Sage . " Even if he can save only a few cents at the beginning , it is better than saving nothing at all ; and he will find , as the months go on , // that it becomes easier for him to lay by a part of his earnings . It is surprising how fast an account in a savings bank can be made to grow , and the boy who starts one and keeps it up stands a good chance of spending a prosperous old age . Some people who spend every cent of their income on their living expenses are always bewailing the fact that they have never become rich . " " The first thing that a man should learn to do , " says Andrew Carnegie , " is to save his money . By saving his money he promotes thrift , ? the most valued of all habits . Thrift is the great fortune-maker . It draws the line between the savage and the civilized man . Thrift not only develops the fortune , but it develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENTANGLING ALLIANCES . RECENTLY a young woman in New York became fascinated by a young man whom she met accidentally , and , after only a few days ' acquaintance , was married to him . She did not look up his history and did not know anything about his past . While on their wedding trip the bridegroom was arrested for theft , and it was found that he had been in jail several times before . The bride was heart-broken , but she could not retrieve the false step that linked her fate with that of a convicted thief . By not taking a little precaution this innocent girl has practically ruined her life . It is the easiest thing in the world to slide into the meshes of entanglements which will cripple our advance or mar our reputations . How many careless young girls are led unconsciously into alliances with young men of whom they know practically nothing and wake up to find themselves entangled for life ! How many men in our large cities , rich , and , apparently , possessing everything to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell on earth by the partners of their entangling alliances . How many homes are wrecked every year , and how many innocent and unsuspecting children made to blush with 176 // shame at the horrible disclosures which reveal to them a father , whom they loved and honored and looked up to , as a whited sepulchre . Think of the disgrace , the social ostracism and untold suffering of the innocent wives and children , the characters blasted by the almost criminal entanglements of prominent men , some of them millionaires , which have been unearthed recently . How many rich men would exchange the wealth , which it has taken them a lifetime to amass , if they could erase the stain of dishonor they have brought on the family name , or retrieve the false step , the slip which put them into the power of those who have robbed them of peace , happiness , and all they hold dearest on earth . I know a young man who is trying to get the confidence of the public for a high position who would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfortunate alliances and entanglements in which he was immeshed in his youth ; but he can not wipe them out . They stand out glaringly and threateningly , staring him in the face whichever way he turns . Every time he takes up a paper he knows he is liable to run across some of these terrible ghosts which haunt his career . Unfortunately there are always editors and competitors who are only too glad of art opportunity to throw mud at one who is trying to climb up , or to pull him back ; and a man who has a clean past , who has no stain on his record , and who can look the world in the eye without wincing and dare any one to put his finger upon a dishonest or discreditable act , has a wonderful advantage . " Beware of entangling alliances ! " said George Washington to the young nation . There are thousands of vie178 IN THE CHEERING-UP BUSINESS . tims of entanglements of all kinds in this country to-day who , if they could only gain the ears of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Washington 's words of warning . Is there a sadder picture than that of a promising young man of great ability , conscious of power which he has no opportunity to use to advantage , and mocked by an ambition which he can not satisfy , because he is hopelessly in debt or so bound by other self-forged chains that he can not extricate himself ? Instead of being a king and dominating his environment , he is a slave to his entanglement , or is dogged for years by creditors . Keep yourself free . Keep clear from complications of all kinds that may possibly compromise your manhood , your womanhood . An entanglement , whatever its nature , is imprisonment , no less terrible because it is voluntary . If your brain is intact , your mind unburdened , your hands and all your faculties free , you can do great things even with small money capital , or , perhaps , even without any . But when you are ground under the heel of debt and are not at liberty to act of your own accord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are under obligations or with whom you have formed entangling alliances , you can not accomplish much . You are a bondman , not a free man . There are hundreds of men to-day , in middle life or older , working in ordinary positions who are as able as or abler than the men who employ them , but who were so anxious to " get rich quick " that they fell an easy prey to smooth , long-headed promoters . They got so entangled in wildcat schemes and plausible speculations that they have never been able to free themselves . Good , honest men and women in this country are struggling with 1 // superhuman efforts under loads which almost crush them , and are barely getting a living , who could do wonders if they were only free . But every avenue of opportunity seems closed to them because they are not in a position to seize whatever chance may offer , ? are not free to work it out . Everything they do is done at great disadvantage . They have to employ personal work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had not lost their money in some foolish investment , or were not so tied up by mortgages and debts that they are practically business prisoners . They can not go where they would , but where they must . They are pushed instead of pushing ; forced instead of forcing . They do not choose ; iron circumstances compel them . I know one of these victims who earns five hundred dollars a month , but for years half of his salary has gone for what business men call " paying for a dead horse . " When quite a young mall he made a foolish investment , in which he not only lost every dollar he laid up , but also gave notes for a large amount , which fall due every three months . He can not get free from these notes without going into bankruptcy , which he is too honorable to do , and so his whole life has been handicapped . He is now fifty years old , with several sons and daughters , whom he has not been able to educate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his family , as well as his own peace of mind , have been ruined by this ghost-debt which will not down . IIe has lived all these years in constant fear that he might be sick , or that something might happen to him , and that his wife and children might suffer in consequence . // The result of all this is not only a disappointed ambition , but the man has also lost his hopeful disposition , his buoyancy , and natural optimism , and has become sour and pessimistic . His monotonous life of compulsory service , of slavery to a foolish transaction , entered into without investigation , way back in his young manhood , has crushed all the spirit out of him . He has practically given up the thought of ever doing anything more than make a bare living for himself and his family . Existence has become a mere joyless drudgery because in a weak moment he mortgaged his whole future . What freedom or power has a man for a creative , productive career under such conditions as these ? Shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot by entanglements from which , perhaps , he can never get release , how can he work out his life plan ? How can he realize his aspirations ? Struggling just for something to eat and something to wear , while forced to give up most of one 's earnings for past errors , is not life . It is not freedom . It is slavery . It is slow strangulation . The mania for getting rich ? the mad , false idea that we must have money ? has played worse havoc among ambitious people than war or pestilence . A member of the Chicago Board of Trade says that the men and women of this country contribute a hundred million dollars a year to the sharpers who promise to make them rich quick . They work the same old scheme of a confidential letter and shrewd baiting , until the victim parts with his money . Thousands are plodding along in poverty and deprivation , chagrined and humiliated because they have not been able to get up in the world or to realize their ambitions , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some smooth promoter , who hypnotized them into the belief that they could make a great deal very quickly out of a very little . The great fever of trying to make one dollar earn five dollars is growing more and more contagious . We see even women secretly going into brokers ' offices and " bucket shops , " investing everything they have in all sorts of schemes , drawing their deposits out of the banks , sometimes pawning their jewelry , ? even their engagement rings , ? and borrowing , hoping to make a lot of money before their husbands or families find it out and then to surprise them with the results ; but in most cases what they invest is hopelessly lost . Thousands of young Americans are so tied up by financial or other entanglements , even before they get fairly started in their life-work , that they can only transmute a tithe of their real ability or their splendid energies into that which will count in their lives . A large part of it is lost on the way up , as the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electric bulb . Do n't tie yourself or your money up . Do n't risk all your savings in any scheme , no matter how much it may promise . Do n't invest your hard-earned money in anything without first making a thorough and searching investigation . Do not be misled by those who tell you that it is " now or never , " and that , if you wait , you are liable to lose the best thing that ever came to you . Make up your mind that if you lose your money you will not lose your head , and that you will not invest in anything until you thoroughly understand all about it . There are plenty of good things waiting . If you miss // one , there are hundreds of others . People will tell you that the opportunity will go by and you will lose a great chance to make money if you do not act promptly . But take your time , and investigate . Make it a cast-iron rule never to invest in any enterprise until you have gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so sound that level-headed men will put money in it , do not touch it . The habit of investigating before you embark in any business will be a happiness-protector , a fortune-protector , and an ambition-protector as well . Young people often get involved with questionable characters , and , before they are aware of it , their reputations become smirched . They do not choose their friends with discretion , or they compromise themselves socially , politically , or in . a business way , innocently , perhaps , but with the same result . Before they realize how it has happened , either their characters have received a stain which will not wash out , or they find themselves in an unfortunate , embarrassing position . Look out for your record , young man and young woman . Keep it clean and yourself unentangled . As you value freedom , the boon of a clean reputation , and an unobstructed passage in your upward climb , do not tie yourself up , ? financially , socially , morally , or in any other way . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can act with freedom and with untrammeled faculties . Keep your manhood , your womanhood , and independence so that you can always look the world squarely in the face . Do not put yourself in a position where you must apologize or cringe or bow your head or crawl before anybody . A little ability with freedom and a persistent determination is better than genius so tied up that it can not // act . A productive , effective mind must be untrammeled . What is the use of having a giant 's intellect if you bind your faculties in such a way that you must do a pygmy 's work , the work of mediocrity ? Keep your freedom at all costs . XXX . BUSINESS INTEGRITY . " WILL you be honest , if I buy you ? " asked a wouldbe buyer of a young negro , in the old days of human traffic . " I will be honest , whether you buy me or not , " replied the slave . We hear much about honesty as the best policy . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ways , and ought to know . Yet to be honest anyway , whatever comes of it , is the first thought of every one who carried his manhood into his business . " Veritas " is engraved upon the buildings and gates of Harvard University , ? " The Truth . " Now that the college yard is enclosed by a park fence on every side , this legend from a great Hebrew poet is placed above a principal entrance : ? " Open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth truth may enter in . " No self-respecting gate upon the globe will open willingly to those who do not keep the truth ? " truth in the inward parts , " as Hebrew sages used to say , ? truth in conscience and life .

" I shall not forget , " he says , " nor will any of the twenty young men who surrounded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one had undertaken to copy at the blackboard some memoranda which he had made at home , and which he had privately introduced into the class-room .

Mr. Pierce spoke to us , ashy pale , faltering in voice , on Truth . What was all this study for , but the pursuit of Truth , ? if , haply , one could attain it ? And here was a creature who pretended to such truth . Pretence in the temple of Truth ! A Lie as the work of purity ! Truth ! None of the twenty men who heard that word of pathetic indignation have forgotten it .

" replied Mr. Jones , and when the court next assembled , he arose and said : " May it please your honor , we deny that this signature is genuine .

" Mr. Jones , " shouted Allen , in a voice of thunder , " I did not hire you to come here to lie ! This is a true note ! I signed it , ? I 'll swear to it , ? and I 'll pay it ! I want no shuffling . I want time . What I employed you for was to get this matter put over to the next court , not to come here and lie and juggle about it .

Do not go to such stores . If you do , you will be cheated . " If I hire you , " said a Detroit grocer to a boy who had applied for work , " I suppose you will do as I tell you ? " Yes , sir . " " If I told you to say that the sugar was high grade when it was low , what would you say ? " The boy did not hesitate a moment . " I 'd say it , " he responded promptly . " If I told you to say the coffee was pure , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you say ? " " I ' d say it . " " If I told you to say that the butter was fresh , when you knew that it had been in the store for a month , what would you say ? " " I 'd say it . " The merchant was nonplussed . " How much will you work for ? " he inquired , very seriously . " One hundred dollars a week , " answered the boy , in a business-like tone . The grocer came near falling from his stool . " One hundred dollars a week ? " he repeated , in astonishment . " With a percentage after the first two weeks , " said the boy , coolly . " You see , " he went on , " first-class liars come high ; and , if you need them in your business , you 've got to pay them the price . Otherwise I 'll work // for three dollars a week .

" Truth , unfaltering integrity , justice , and honor are never to be departed from , " wrote an eminent American statesman to his son . " Lies come from meanness , low vanity , cowardice , and of a depraved nature , and they always fail of their object and bring the liar into contempt . Without strict integrity , justice , and honor , no one can have continued success in anything , or lasting respect from anybody . Every one is found out sooner or later , and much sooner than he supposes . Indeed , your true character is sure to be known and sure to be justly appreciated . " A man took a seat in a railway car , says a western periodical , and he piled the seat at his side with bags and parcels . The car became crowded , and a gentleman asked if the other half of the seat was occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has just gone into the smoking-car , and he ' 11 be back presently . " The gentleman , having reason to suspect the truth of this statement , said , " All right , I will sit here till the man comes back , " Proceeding to remove the bundles and bags , he placed them on the floor or in the rack . The other man glared , but could say nothing . As a matter of fact , " the man in the smoking-car " was an invention . By and by the owner of the bundles arrived at his destination , and began to gather up his effects . " Excuse me , " said the gentleman , " but you said these bundles belonged to a man in the smoking-car . I shall consider it my duty to prevent you from taking them , since by your own state188 IN TILE CI-MERINO-UP BUSINESS . ment they do n't belong to you . " The man became violent and abusive , but dared not lay his hands on the bundles . The conductor was called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : " Well , I will take charge of the bundles myself , and take them to the station in the city ; and if no one else claims them meanwhile , you " ? indicating the man who had once repudiated their ownership ? " may have them . " Amid the laughter and applause of the passengers , the man got off at the station , just as the train was pulling out , without his luggage . He obtained it the next day , but was well punished for the lie lie had told for the sake of monopolizing a seat that did not belong to him . Suppose we lived in a world where natural things would lie and deceive us , ? a world where the mountains , the sea , the forests , and the rivers were all shams ; where the earth , which looks rich and fruitful , would mock us by refusing harvests in return for our seed ; where what appears like a beautiful landscape would prove only a deceptive mirage ; where gravitation could not be depended upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; where the atoms were not true to the law written within their . 1ut it is not so , for there is no sham in nature . It is in regard to man alone that we can say : " Vice has many tools , but a lie is the handle that fits them all . " " It is an old saying , " says Margaret Sangster , " that one lie obliges the teller of it to speak half a dozen more , and that before he or she knows it , the situation becomes terribly complicated ; but this is not all . The possibility of one 's telling a falsehood in any circumstances shows that the character is wanting in perfect integrity or wholeness . I have seen a very beautiful diamond which // had lost a great deal of its value because the eye of an expert had found in it a slight flaw . A person who deviates from the truth in the slightest degree has thus produced a flaw in his character . It is something like the little speck in fruit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell what is not true , you will find it easier the second time to deviate from the truth for some fancied reason . " If a youth should start out with a fixed determination that every statement he makes shall be the exact truth ; that every promise he makes shall be redeemed to the letter ; that every appointment shall be kept with the strictest faithfulness and with full regard for other men 's time ; if he should hold his reputation as a priceless treasure , feel that the eyes of the world are upon him , that he must not deviate a hair 's breadth from the truth and right ; if he should take such a stand at the outsethe would , like George Peabody , cone to have almost unlimited credit and the confidence of all ; and could have developed into noble man-timber . Soon after his establishment in Philadelphia , Franklin was offered a piece for publication in his newspaper . Being very busy , he begged the gentleman would leave it for consideration . The next day the author called and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied Franklin , " I am sorry to say I think it highly scurrilous and defamatory . But being at a loss on account of my poverty as to whether to reject it or not , I thought I would put it to this issue : at night , when my work was done , I bought a two-penny loaf , on which I supped heartily , and then , wrapping myself in my great coat , slept very soundly on the floor until morning , when another loaf and mug of water afforded a pleasant break // fast . Now , sir , since I can live very comfortably in this manner , why should I prostitute my press to personal hatred or party passion for a more luxurious living ? " In our war for the Union , when General Robert E. Lee was in conversation with one of his officers in regard to a movement of his army , a plain farmer 's boy overheard the general 's remark that he had decided to march upon Gettysburg instead of Harrisburg . The boy telegraphed this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy . " I would give my right hand , " said the Governor , " to know if this boy tells the truth . " A corporal replied : " Governor , I know that boy ; it is impossible for him to lie ; there is not a drop of false blood in his veins . " In fifteen minutes the Union troops were marching to Gettysburg , where they gained a victory . Character is power . The great thing is to be a man , to have a high purpose , a noble aim , to be dead in earnest , to yearn for the good and the true . Truth , as between man and man in the conduct of business , will never fail if each party will put his conscience into his dealings . " Trust that man in nothing , " said Laurence Sterne , " who has not a conscience in everything . " Is not a man who is partly honest , wholly dishonest ? " Put that back , " said President John Quincy Adams to his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a letter . " That belongs to the Government . Here is my own stationery at the other end of the desk . I always use it for letters on private business . " This conscientiousness in regard to what many would consider a mere trifle may appear excessive . But the dividing line between vice and virtue is so fine that the // boundary is often unconsciously crossed , and it is just as dangerous for a young person to play at hazards with conscience as it is for a child to toy with a dagger , or to play with fire . He who is honest in small things can be trusted in great . A nickel is so small a sum that many people think they are not defrauding any one or acting dishonestly if they retain the fare which the street car conductor has forgotten to take . These people would indignantly resent any imputation of dishonesty , yet they have no hesitation in keeping that to which they know they have not the shadow of a right . They would feel themselves injured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , or coffee , or any other commodity , had knowingly deprived them of even the most infinitesimal part of their just weight , or that their milkman had held back for his own benefit but one spoonful of the milk for which they had paid . The virtuous indignation of these people against the fraudulent grocer , milkman , or other tradesman , would be fully justified if they themselves observed the Golden Rule . But , if we are not strictly honest ourselves , have we any right to demand or expect that others will be so ? The necessity for absolute integrity in the business world appears from the very nature of the transactions between man and man . The time will never come when men will not have to trust one another in some way . Yet it will always be possible for a man to commit one or two frauds ? just as it is now possible for any man to go out with a revolver and kill one or two people whenever he chooses . " I remember , " says Minot J. Savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West I ever // knew . He made a claim I was not willing to allow , ? that it was honest for him to take advantage of the ignorance of any man with whom he was dealing to get the better end of a bargain . He said that , if he happened to know more than the other man of what was going on in the world , he was justified in taking advantage of the man 's ignorance , for he had no one to blame but himself for his ignorance . I question whether that is defensible . Ought we to take advantage of the ignorance , the weakness , the infirmities , the frailties of our fellowmen to leave them worse off than they were before ? " Mark Twain tells us that an impoverished descendant of Audubon , in sore straits , was willing to sell a copy of his great volume on " Birds " for a hundred dollars ; it was worth in a market a thousand dollars ; the purchaser chuckled over his mean bargain .

It proved to be such a copy , and she got her thousand dollars in gold . That is the honorable dealing which exalts humanity . " The very least that can be said of a man who cheats his neighbor , through his neighbor 's ignorance , is that his character is " out of plumb . " We are to use the plumb-line iii character-building . A golden rule for every business man is this : " Put yourself in your customer 's place . " I have read a curious story of one . When Philippe Wurtz began to do business for himself it is said he // used to kneel and pray over his account book that he might make no entry there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a timely topic in our modern world . The principle of all right exchange is equivalence , the quid pro quo , as the common phrase is . In all honest trade , for every good received , an equivalent good is rendered . In every legitimate bargain both the persons interested are satisfied , and permanently satisfied ; each gets what he wants . Two farmers in Virginia exchanged horses , the condition being that , at the end of a week , the one who thought he had the best bargain should bring the other two bushels of wheat . One week later they met halfway between the two towns each with a bag of wheat . Each thought lie had the best bargain . If every one inclined to do a dishonest deed should " put himself in the place " of the other man , and " love hint as himself , " lie would not do it . That is a development of Christianity yet to come .

" What a lesson these words contain for the young man of to-day who thinks that long-headedness , shrewdness , cunning , and sharpness are the only success-qualities worth cultivating ! Mr. Straus says that if he got a bad bargain himself he could stand it , even if his losses were heavy , but that // he could never afford to have the man who dealt with him get a bad bargain . He felt that his own loss , however great , might possibly be repaired ; but that if a man who had dealings with him should lose , or be deceived thereby , nothing could ever compensate him ( Mr. Straus ) for this , as his character would be permanently injured .

Besides , he says , it injures his self-respect to know that any one reasonably lacks confidence in him , because honesty was the foundation stone on which his business was built . Young men who are in too great a hurry to get rich , who want to build up a successful business in a year or two , without any apprenticeship to the drudgery of details , have their thoughts so selfishly centered on their own aggrandizement that they are very apt to forget " the man at the other end of the bargain .

George Peabody once left a grocery store where he was employed because they sold cigars , declaring he would not sell any man an article which would do him harm . There is nothing more cruel than the course taken by some employers , which is a constant temptation to employees to be dishonest . Justice Crane , of New York , recently induced an employer to withdraw a charge of theft made against a young man who had stolen an article of small value , and pointed out that the young man 's wages ? five dollars a week ? were a provocation for him to steal . The magistrate thus cited his own experience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to get along on two dollars a week the best way I could . My employers paid no more attention to me than if I had been a dog .

There was one day ? and I shall never forget it ? when I was handed two thousand five hundred dollars in cash for my firm when I did not have the price of a meal all day . I confess that , upon that day , only the knowledge that I had a mother who believed in my absolute honesty restrained me from stealing . The firm was one of the largest and most influential in this city . I was pretty near the rock upon which this youth before us foundered , you see .

The young man who starts out , willing to be poor and honorable , holds in his hand one of the strongest elements of success . A Federal colonel , when Vicksburg was taken , says a southern newspaper , had strict orders not to let a bag of cotton go out of the lines .

His integrity stood by him so far ; but he began to feel troubled in mind . He went to his coinmanding general and told him of the orders he had received and the temptations offered . Said he : " I want to resign and go home ; it is getting most too warm for me . I can stand some things , but not everything . Human nature has its limits , and I am afraid I may find my limit .

I want to resign and go home before I lose my honor . " He saw that if he put his honor and pocketbook in front of him , his pocketbook would win and his honor lose . So he thought it best to get out of the way of opportunity and temptation . Cotton was bringing nearly a dollar per pound at the time . " Character before wealth , " was the motto of Amos Lawrence , who had inscribed on his pocketbook , " What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul ? " Let me , at this point , go back a moment to the statement I made that the time will never come when men will not have to trust one another in something . It is impossible to do this except upon a common basis . ? There is a point , " said Minot J. Savage to his congregation one Sunday , " that I need to call your attention to for a passing moment . I have had occasion to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this civilized world of ours is only a little way at any time from destitution . If there were no production , if nothing were added to the stock of the world , the world would wear out and eat up all that there is in the course of two or three years , and so perish . Here , then , is this stock of general good ; and it seems to me a fundamental principle of business honesty that any man who proposes to take out of this accumulated wealth of the world the tiniest particle for his own use must see to it that he adds something to the general welfare that // shall be an equivalent , at least . If he leaves it no richer or if he takes what he has no right to , he becomes , no matter what his position , what we mean by a thief . That is what theft means . Rendering some equivalent , serving the world , adding to its legitimate amusement of welfare in some way , is the only honest condition for any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in the world 's business , see to it that it is honest , that there is equal exchange . These are the principles that underlie honesty in business . " Honesty in business , political honesty , religious honesty , honesty in every department of life , ? these should be our ideals . We should build not only our houses , but build our social order , our business , our political order , our religious structures of sound materials rightly related to each other , sanely and truly adjusted , so that they will stand , so that they will become a part of the divine order . If we do this , we not only achieve the happiness of other people , the welfare of other people , but , in the long run , we of necessity attain our own happiness and our own welfare , for we can not possibly live alone . We are dependent every moment of our lives for not only happiness , for not only wealth , but for comfort , for health , for peace upon the general condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are parts . For the sake , then , not only of other people , but also for our own sake , and that we may join hands with God and become a part of His divine order and may help on the perfection of that order which means the kingdom of God , ? for the sake of all these things , let us walk honestly . " Not long since , soon after one of the largest defalcations known in the history of American banking , several // bank presidents and capitalists in New York made the statement that the only practical protection that the people have for their money is common honesty . All the schemes devised can not keep criminals from taking what does not belong to them . The best banks in the country have been robbed by the employees who were most trusted . The fact that the wrongdoers had been speculating or living beyond their means came out afterwards , but proved little as to the carefulness of the institution in taking care of the money intrusted to it . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in operation , the final safety is common honesty . It is that way in other departments and enterprises of life . Schemes may be invented , bonds may be taken , and efforts may be made to bring honest results , but in the end common honesty is depended upon for protection and for security . If , therefore , there is anything in your own life which is in the slightest degree at variance with common honesty , you are to that extent an enemy of well-established society , and if all men were like you no society would be possible . There are men who choose honesty as a soul companion . They live in it , with it , by it . They embody it in their actions and lives . Their words speak it . Their faces beam it . Their actions proclaim it . These are the men who uphold civilization . " Down on School Street the other day , " says a Boston pastor , " a poor Italian took a two and a half dollar gold piece in mistake for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away ? No . I3e wrapped it up in a piece of paper and put it where he could give it to the man who had made the mistake , and when he came for it there it // was waiting . Was it a trifle ? Any of us would trade with that man hereafter , because this tells the story of character , the stuff of which a man is made . When you can break off a little fragment of a man 's character , and find it firm and solid , you feel that if he is made of material like that he can be trusted . You have confidence in that kind of stuff and you can build on him . These may be trifles but they make character . " Apart from all question of sentiment there is no doubt of the cash value of business integrity . If civilization is an advantage , in a mercantile point of view , the common honesty which makes civilization possible is an advantage ; that is to say , common honesty has a cash value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to succeed in business . Mayor Hart , of Boston , recently said that in fifty years he has seen the outworking of honesty and fair dealing , that ninety per cent of the successful men have been distinguished for their business integrity , and that those who have taken a counter-course have perished by the way . " Honesty , " said he , " is a natural law and the violation of it means retribution , a day of reckoning and punishment . As unerring as the law of gravitation when honesty is violated , it is followed by retribution . The consequences can not be avoided . They may be deferred but justice must always be faced in the end . A merchant has something that somebody wants , and in return for it he wants that which somebody has . When the trade is effected , if it has been done honestly , both will profit . In the affairs of capital and labor , honesty on both sides must prove advantageous to both . Capital can not prosper if in its dealings with labor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule works the // other way as well , just as the experience of ninety per cent of the successful men of the community shows that it works in all affairs of life . Integrity is the ground of mutual confidence . Upon this ground a youth advances with sure steps . " He is , " says Bulwer Lytton , " already of consequence in the world , when it is known that he can be implicitly relied upon . " When Ingram , of the " Illustrated London News , " was a young newsdealer , he once walked ten miles to deliver a single paper , rather than disappoint a customer . He could be depended upon , and nothing could hinder him from pushing into the front rank of newspaper men . What a lesson in honesty is the story of Meyer Anselm , the founder of the great fortune of the Rothschilds , who lived , at the close of the eighteenth century , in that little corner of Frankfort known as Jews ' Lane , where his fellow countrymen were terribly persecuted . Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked them in at night and on holidays and Sundays , they were still required to retire at a certain hour , under penalty of death ; and they were hounded in a manner which seemed designed to drive them to the lowest condition of life and far from the practice of honest dealings . Anselm , proving an exception to the ordinary ruling character of the Jews around him , established himself in humble quarters , over which he hung a red shield , giving to his family the name of " Rothschild , " the German for " red shield . " There he conducted the business of a money lender . When Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel was driven from his estates by Napoleon , he gathered // together five millions of silver , and left it with Anselm , not daring to hope for the possibility of getting it back , for he thought the invaders would surely capture it . The Jew , however , was very shrewd , and , after hiding it in his garden till the danger from the enemy was over , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , Anselm was able to send by his eldest son , to the landgrave 's great surprise , a report that the sum loaned , with the usual interest , was at his disposal . In all the generations of the family , not one member , it is said , has brought a stain upon its business integrity . More than all else , this reputation for sterling honesty is the foundation of the colossal fortune of the Rothschilds . When A. T. Stewart went into business in New York he determined that the truth should always be told over his counters , whatever the consequences . No clerk was allowed to misrepresent or to cover up a defect . He once asked the opinion of an employee in regard to a large purchase of goods of novel patterns , and was told that the designs were inferior , and some of them in very bad taste . The young man was just pointing out the defects of one particular style , of which he held a sample in his hands , when a large customer from an interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and first-class to show me to-day ? " The young salesman replied promptly , " Yes , sir ; we 've just brought in something that will suit you to a dot . " Throwing across his arm the very piece he had criticised a moment before , he expatiated upon its beauty so earnestly that a large sale was the result . Mr. Stewart , who had listened in wondering silence , here interrupted , // warning the customer to give the goods further and more careful examination , and telling the young man to call upon the cashier for any wages due him , as his final account would be made up at once . Stewart 's integrity paid , and paid in cash . " In building up a business the grandest advertisement ever written is poor compared with a reputation for keeping honest goods and telling the exact truth about them . Found your business on truth , and the superstructure will be a success . " Wedgwood , the potter , although he rose from a workman , was never satisfied till he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it did not come up to his idea of what it should be , lie would break the vessel , and throw it away , saying , " That wo n't do for Josiah Wedgwood . " Character makes reputation ; and the Wedgwood pottery , with Wedgwood 's honesty behind it , won world-wide celebrity . When Lincoln became a lawyer , all clients knew that they would win if the case was a fair one ; and , if not , that it was a waste of time to take it to him . After listening some time , with his eyes on the ceiling , one day to a would-be client 's statement , he swung suddenly round in his chair and exclaimed : " Well , you have a pretty good case in technical law , but a pretty bad one in equity and justice . You ' 11 have to get some other fellow to win this case for you . I could n't do it . All the time , while standing talking to that jury , I ' d be thinking , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe I should forget myself and say it out loud . " After giving considerable time to a case in which he had received from a lady a retainer of two hundred // dollars , he returned the money , saying : " Madam , you have not a peg to hang your case on . " " But you have earned that money , " said the lady . " No , no , " replied Lincoln , " that would not be right . I ca n't take pay for doing my duty . " He refused to argue a case when he learned that his client had deceived him by representing that his cause was just . His partner , however , took the case , and won it , receiving a fee of nine hundred dollars , of which Lincoln refused to take his half . His integrity came at length to be bone of his bone , and flesh of his flesh ; and no one could meet him or hear him without knowing he was honest . " I wo n't hear him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Lincoln was speaking in 1856 , " for I do n't like a man that makes me believe in him in spite of myself . " When an attempt was made to secure the passage of an ordinance of repudiation in Illinois , Stephen A. Douglas lay ill at a hotel in Springfield . He asked to be carried to the convention ; and while lying upon his mattress , wrote as a substitute for the repudiation bill : " Resolved , That Illinois will be honest , although she never pays a cent . " It was adopted , and was the deathblow to repudiation , not only in Illinois but also in all the other States . The credit and prosperity of the whole nation rose at once . In 1837 , after George Peabody moved to London , there came a commercial crisis in the United States . Many banks suspended specie payments . Many mercantile houses went to the wall , and thousands more were in great distress . Edward Everett said , " The great sympathetic nerve of the commercial world , credit , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time // paralyzed . " Probably not a half-dozen men in Europe would have been listened to for a moment in the Bank of England upon the subject of American securities , but George Peabody was one of them . His name was already a tower of strength in the commercial world . In those dark , dark days his integrity stood four-square in every business panic . Peabody retrieved the credit of the State of Maryland , and , it might almost be said , of the United States . His character was the magic wand which in many a case changed almost worthless paper into gold . Merchants on both sides of the Atlantic procured large advances from him , even before the goods consigned to him had been sold . When Walter Scott 's publisher and printer failed and six hundred thousand dollars of debt stared them in the face , friends came forward and offered to raise money enough to allow him to arrange with his creditors . " No , " said he proudly , " this right hand shall work it all off ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our honor unblemished . " What a grand picture of manliness , of integrity in this noble man , working like a dray-horse to cancel that great debt , throwing off at white heat the " Life of Napoleon , " " Woodstock , " " The Tales of a Grandfather , " articles for the " Quarterly , " and so on , all written in the midst of great sorrow , pain , and ruin . " I could not have slept soundly , " he writes , " as I now can under the comfortable impression of receiving the thanks of my creditors and the conscious feeling of discharging my duty as a man of honesty . I see before me a long , tedious , and dark path , but it leads to stainless reputation . If I die in the harness , as is very likely , I shall die with honor . " Samuel L. Clemens ( Mark Twain ) , one of the world 's // best known and best loved men , has added a new chapter to the story of honesty between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad " to pay his debts . He went around the world this time to satisfy his conscience . The great humorist 's example has afforded an inspirational example to all debt-ridden countrymen . At first we simply laughed at Twain 's jokes . Then we discovered that they are literature . Next we learned , against our will , that the humorist is something else , ? a serious soul , who does not love the laughter he provokes . At length , the humorist turns out to be one of the most striking examples of the honesty of his country , a quality that the world has tried to deny to all jokers . Here is a man who can exemplify his country 's gift of humor and its honor at the same time . Possibly the greatest test of honesty is found in the rare instances of paying debts long after they have been outlawed . Considerations of policy influence most men to be honest , while conscience pricks some into restoring what has been wrongfully withheld . But where a man has been released from his debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inspiring . Bolton Hall , an attorney and tax reformer , a son of the celebrated divine , Dr. John Hall , recently paid off one hundred thousand dollars of released debt , impelled solely by honor . Is not business integrity a valuable asset ? Were the thousands of business men , who lost every dollar they had in the Chicago fire , enabled to go into business again at once , some into wholesale business , without money ? Their record for honesty became their bank account . The commercial agencies said they were square men ; // that they had always paid one hundred cents on a dollar ; that they had paid promptly , and that they were industrious and dealt honorably with all men . They drew on their character . Character was the coin which enabled penniless men to buy thousands of dollars ' worth of goods . Their integrity did not burn up with their stores . The best part of them was beyond the reach of fire and could not be burned . Thousands of dollars are loaned on character , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankers ; " for there are men of such high character ? though not rich in this world 's goods ? that they will not borrow more than they call pay . " That was the reply he made when he was asked concerning the ability of small capitalists ? men doing a small business ? to raise money on credit . Another banker put it more bluntly , saying that he would rather lend money to an honest poor man than to a rich knave who could give substantial security . The tenor of all the replies was a tribute of hard-headed business men to the great value of a business reputation for honesty . It was a striking evidence of the fact that proved integrity is business capital , and that such capital is within reach of every man . " A dozen men , " said a well-known business man to a youth just starting in business , " will sell you an outfit on credit because they know you . Poverty , with such a character as you have , is better capital than ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man comes in contact with chances for money-making , " says a prominent merchant . " To use them , he must have friends who have learned to rely on his honesty and judgment . Such friendships are only made through // the medium of a carefully cultivated reputation for integrity of purpose . " If any young man proposes to conduct any kind of business it is of the utmost importance for him to know , at the outset , that the mercantile world is " businesslike " and systematic , and that merchants act upon the principle of keeping tally . Everything counts . Commercial agencies record every movement made from the time one enters business . If not fair and upright in all your dealings , you will be greatly hampered ; if honest and trustworthy , your credit may in time be unlimited . Creditors will have nothing to do with a person tricky and unscrupulous ; merchants and bankers extend credit according to their confidence . Merchants have the best fraud police . They have their regular detective agencies in their Duns and Bradstreets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit men . They also have credit guaranty companies , ? a modern invention . The most minute information is recorded by the mercantile agencies . The nature of the business , its details , and the life-stories of the partners , their ability , habits , and character are all given . All these precautions are not an absolute protection against fraudulent men , but they do protect against men who continue to be fraudulent . No one can visit one of the great business agencies without being impressed with the magnitude of their recording work . Every business man 's record is either for him or against him . XXXI . WRESTING TRIUMPH FROM DEFEAT . " 1 wish , " said President Roosevelt , in a recent address in Washington , " to see in the average American citizen the determination not to shrink back when temporarily beaten in life , as each will be now and then , but to come up again and wrest triumph from defeat . " " To come up again and wrest triumph from defeat . " That is the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lived . Perhaps the past has been a bitter disappointment to you . In looking it over you may feel that you have been a failure , or at best have been plodding along in mediocrity . You may not have succeeded in the particular things you expected to do ; you may have lost money when you expected to make it ; or you may have lost friends and relatives who were very dear to you . You may have lost your business , and even your home may have been wrenched from you because you could not pay the mortgage on it , or because of sickness and consequent inability to work . A serious accident may have apparently robbed you of power . The New Year may present a very discouraging outlook to you . Yet , in spite of any or all of these misfortunes , if you refuse to be conquered , victory is awaiting you farther on the road . 209 // A little boy was asked how he learned to skate . " Oh , by getting up every time I fell down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads men and armies to victory . It is not the fall but the not getting up that is defeat . After twelve thousand of Napoleon 's soldiers had been overwhelmed by the advance of seventy-five thousand Austrian troops , he addressed them thus : " I am displeased with you . You have evinced neither discipline nor valor . You have allowed yourselves to be driven from positions where a handful of resolute men might have arrested an army . You are no longer French soldiers . Chief of Staff , cause it to be written on their standards , ' They are no longer of the army of Italy . ' " In tears the battered veterans replied : " We have been misrepresented . The soldiers of the enemy were three to one . Try us once more . Place us iii the post of danger and see if we do not belong to the army of . Italy . " In the next battle they were placed in the van , and they made good their pledge by rolling back the great Austrian army . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears to face the world just because he has made a mistake or a slip somewhere , because his business has failed , because his property has been swept away by some general disaster , or because of other trouble impossible for him to avert . This is the test of your manhood : how much is there left in you after you have lost everything outside of yourself ? If you lie down now , throw up your hands , and acknowledge yourself worsted , there is not much in you . But if , with heart undaunted and face turned forward , you refuse to give up or to lose faith in yourWRESTING // self , if you scorn to beat a retreat , you will show that the man left in you is bigger than your loss , greater than your cross , and larger than any defeat . " I know no such unquestionable badge and ensign of a sovereign mind , " said Emerson , " as that tenacity of purpose which , through all changes of companions , or parties , or fortunes , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wearies out opposition and arrives at its port . " It is men like Ulysses S. Grant , who , whether in the conflict of opposing armies on the battlefield , or in the wear and tear of civic strife , fighting against reverses , battling for a competence for his loved ones , even while the hand of death lay chill upon him , " bates no jot of heart or hope , " that wring victory from the most forbidding circumstances . It is men like Napoleon , who refuse to recognize defeat , who declare that " impossible " is not in their vocabularies , that accomplish things . You may say that you have failed too often , that there is no use in trying , that it is impossible for you to succeed , and that you have fallen too often even to attempt to get on your feet again . Nonsense ? There is no failure for a man whose spirit is unconquered . No matter how late the hour or how many and repeated his failures , success is still possible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of his life , from a hard , narrow , heartless money-grubber , whose soul was imprisoned in his shining heap of hoarded gold , to a generous , genial lover of his kind , is no mere myth of Dickens ' brain . Time and again in the history of our daily lives , chronicled in our newspapers , recorded in biographies , or exhibited before our eyes , we see men and women redeeming // past failures , rising up out of the stupor of discouragement , and boldly turning face forward once more . There are thousands of people who have lost everything they had in the world who are just as far from failure as they were before their loss , because of their unconquerable spirit , ? stout hearts that never quail . How much we owe to this great army of the invincible which is forever amongst us wringing victory from defeat ! There can be no failure to a man who has not lost his courage , his character , his self-respect , or his self-confidence . He is still a king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have grit and nerve in you , your misfortunes , losses , and defeats will call them out and make you all the stronger . " It is defeat , " says Beecher , " that turns bone to flint and gristle to muscle and makes men invincible . " Some people get along beautifully for half a lifetime , perhaps , while everything goes smoothly . While they are accumulating property and gaining friends and reputation their characters seem to be strong and wellbalanced ; but the moment there is friction anywhere ? the moment trouble comes , a failure in business , a panic , or a great crisis in which they lose their all ? they are overwhelmed . They despair , lose heart , courage , faith , hope and power to try again , ? everything . Their manhood or womanhood is swallowed up by a mere material loss . This is failure , indeed , and there is small hope for any one who falls to such a depth of despair . There is hope for an ignorant man who can not write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backbone . There is hope for a cripple who has courage ; there is hope for a boy who has nerve and grit , even though he is so hemmed in that he has apparently no chance in the world , but there is no hope // for a man who can not or will not stand up after he falls , but loses heart when opposition strikes him , and lays down his arms after defeat . Let everything else go , if you must , but never lose your grip on yourself . Do not let your manhood or womanhood go . This is your priceless pearl , dearer to you than your breath . Cling to it with all your might . Give up life itself first . A man should be so much greater than any material failure that can come to him that it would scarcely be mentioned in his biography , and that it would be regarded as a mere incident in his career ? inconvenient but not very important . In true manhood there is something which rises higher than worldly success or failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointments or failures , a really great man rises superior to ' them . He never loses his equanimity . In the midst of storms and trials to which a weak nature would succumb , his serene soul , his calm confidence still assert themselves , so completely dominating all outward conditions that they have no power to harm him . Like a great monarch of the forest , amid the war of elements he stands unshaken through all changes and ravages of time . I have been in the track of a terrible tornado the day after it had swept on its path of destruction . It had uprooted everything that was weak , and had twisted off every tree that was rotten at heart or that was not firm of fiber . Only the stalwart and true , those that were sound to the core , withstood the awful test . All the buildings in a village through which I passed , except the strongest , whose foundations were deep and firm , went down before its terrible force . When the great // historic panics swept over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by men without great resources of experience and character went down by thousands . Only the sound and vigorous , with great reserves of power and capital , withstood the ordeal . Little , weak , backboneless , nerveless men are the first to go down when an emergency comes , and hard times and panics frighten capital . Obstacles paralyze the weak , but strengthen the strong . " What is defeat ? " says Wendell Phillips . " Nothing but the first steps to something higher . " Many a one has finally succeeded only because he has failed after repeated efforts . If he had never met defeat he would never have known any great victory . There is something in defeat which puts new determination into a man of mettle . I le , perhaps , would be content to go along in comparative mediocrity but for the stimulus of failure . This rouses him to do his best . He comes to himself after some stinging defeat , and perhaps for the first time feels his real power , like a horse who takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he had previously thought that he was a slave of his master . A great many people never really discover themselves until ruin stares them in the face . They do not seem to know how to bring out their reserves until they are overtaken by an overwhelming disaster , or until the sight of their blighted prospects and of the wreck of their homes and happiness stirs them to the very center of their beings . Young men who never amounted to much , when suddenly overtaken by some great sorrow or loss , or other misfortune , have developed a power for self-assertion , for aggressiveness , an ability to grapple with the difficulty // or trouble confronting them which they never before dreamed they possessed , and of which no one who knew them conceived them capable . The very desperation of the situation spurred them on to do what they would not have thought possible in their former ease and luxury . They had never touched their power before and did not know their strength until the emergency came . Many a girl who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had practical training , is suddenly thrown upon her own resources by the death of her father , or the loss of property , and instead of being cared for , nursed and caressed by tender parents , she finds herself obliged , not only to support herself , but also to take care of brothers and sisters and an invalid mother . This crisis which confronts her calls out her reserve and ' develops an independence and power of self-effort which no one ever imagined she possessed , and which is amazing even to herself . There is a certain something in our nature , a divine force , which we can not describe or explain , which does not seem to inhere in any of our ordinary faculties , which lies deeper than any visible attribute , but which rushes to our assistance in great emergencies , in supreme crises . When death or danger threatens in railroad or steamship accidents how often we see men , and sometimes frail women , exert the power of giants in their efforts to extricate themselves from the impending peril . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how often have delicate girls and women performed Herculean tasks , tasks which they would have deemed impossible had it not been for the magic stimulus born of the emergency . // It is the locked-up spiritual forces within us ? forces that we do not , as a rule , call to our aid in the ordinary experiences of life ? that make men giants , that stamp Iiunianity with the divine seal . The man who uses all the resources that the Divine Power has implanted with him can not fail . It would be strange , indeed , if the grandest of God 's creatures were ever , in his real character , at the mercy of the accidents which make and unmake fortunes . No , there is no failure for the man who realizes his power , who never knows when he is beaten ; there is no failure for the determined endeavor ; the unconquerable will . There is no failure for the man who gets up every time he falls , who rebounds like a rubber ball , who persists when every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else turns back . " SOMETHING WHICH BRINGS THINGS OUT RIGHT IN SPITE OF ME . " How many times we come to a crisis in life when some obstacle confronts us which we think will be a terrible calamity and will perhaps ruin us if we can not avoid it . We fear that our ambition will be thwarted , or that our lives , perhaps , will be wrecked . The dread of the shock which we think will overwhelm us as we come nearer and nearer to it , without any possibility of averting it , is something frightful . Many a time in the writer 's life has he come to such a point , ? when it seemed as if all was lost , ? and yet something beyond his ' control has straightened out the tangle , solved the puzzle which seemed insoluble ; the storm which threatened shipwreck has passed over , the sun has come out again , and everything has become tranquil and serene once more . If we look ahead , the // troubles seem thick and threatening , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of room , pleasant faces , and people to help us in case of need . When we look back over our lives how few accidents have really happened to us . Many have threatened , but , somehow , things have come out right in spite of us , so that we have wasted our vitality , we have grown old and wrinkled and bent , and have shortened our youth anticipating troubles and worrying about calamities which never were to happen . Why should we thus needlessly throw away happiness and usefulness ? It seems strange that when we know perfectly well that we are dependent for every breath we draw upon a Divine Power which is constantly providing for us and protecting us , we do not learn to trust it with absolute confidence and resignation . There is only one thing for us to do , and that is to do our level best right where we are every day of our lives ; to use our best judgment , and then to trust the rest to that Power which holds the forces of the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXXII . OIL YOUR MENTAL MACHINERY . " PREPARE yourself for the world , " said Lord Chesterfield , " as the athletes used to do for their exercises : oil your mind and your manners to give them the necessary suppleness and flexibility ; strength alone will not do it . " To thus keep one 's self supple and flexible in mind and body and manners is to keep constantly growing . Chesterfield had in mind an ideal social success merely when he spoke of the necessity of keeping mind and manners supple and flexible by oiling . But the business man , the professional man , the scholar , the writer , the teacher , the preacher , or any other man who desires to advance in his calling must keep his mental machinery constantly oiled . If he does not , he can not hope to retain his suppleness and flexibility or the susceptibility to new ideas upon which progress depends and the foundation of industry is built . In the early days of our history , when the roads of Nantucket Island were few , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various points on the sandy plains , warning passengers not to " rut the road . " " The evident idea , " says a recent writer , " was that you would make better progress yourself and be more considerate of others , if you would take a fresh path each 218 // time you went over the plain , instead of going again and again in the same tracks . " We all know the danger of falling into ruts . If it is not literally true that " familiarity breeds contempt , " there can be no doubt that in many instances long familiarity with our surroundings makes us insensible to their defects . If the mind is not kept flexible and thoroughly responsive to new ideas , by means of contact with other minds ; if it is not kept alive by constant effort to reach the highest ideals formed in youth , not only will a man 's business , his trade , profession , or occupation suffer , but the whole man will also gradually deteriorate . The brain , like the muscles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man ceases to exercise his highest faculties in the pursuit of his chosen work , both his brain and his work lose little by little until he ceases to be able to measure himself by other men or to judge of his work or business from an unprejudiced standpoint . When he has reached this stage growth is at an end ; deterioration has already made rapid strides . Nothing is more conducive to progress and more helpful in keeping one up to high standards than taking one 's bearings now and then , and making , as it were , a fresh start . Whatever a man 's occupation or profession may be , his chances of attaining marked success in it are ten to one if he makes up his mind at the outset that , at least once a year , he will make a thorough study of himself and his methods from the standpoint of an outsider .

To postpone enjoyment day after day , and year after year , until we get more money or a better position , the means to travel or buy works of art , to build an elegant mansion , or to attain some distant goal of ambition , is to cheat ourselves not only of present enjoyment , but also of the power to enjoy in the future .

Each year they promise themselves that by the following year they will be ready to take life easier , perhaps to indulge in a little travel . When the next year comes , however , they feel that they must economize a while longer . Thus they put off their enjoyment from year to year , scarcely realizing the import of the fact that each successive postponement causes less pain than the previous one .
