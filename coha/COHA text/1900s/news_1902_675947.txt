txt The most disastrous fire in the history of Waterbury is now , 2 o'clock A. M. , raging in the business centre of the city . All the fire-fighting apparatus that Hartford , New Haven , Bridgeport , Torrington , and Naugatuck could spare is here aiding the local department , but the combined efforts of the fire fighters seem unable to check the progress of the flames . At this hour it is I thought 82,000,000 will be a conservative estimate of the loss . A large section of the business part of the city has already been wiped out , and in the high wind prevailing there is little hope of saving what still stands in that part of the business section south of Exchange Place . The fire originated at 6:30 last night in the upholstery department on the third floor of the store of Reid &; Hughes Dry Goods Company at 108-112 Bank Street , and that store as well as many adjoining buildings are smoldering cinders . The origin of the conflagration is not known . The fire was not discovered till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. L. Lyall and E. T. Crooker and A. IC . Burnham were in the store . When they left there was no smoke nor smell of smoke on the main floor . Fifteen minutes later flames were seen to burst with great force from the windows of the third floor , and almost simultaneously from the basement . Before anybody could ring in an alarm the whole interior of the building was a mass of flames . When the Fire Department reached the scene , flames were issuing from every window of the btllding , and it was evident that the structure was doomed and the entire business section of the city was imperiled . The fire started in a drizzling rain with a rapidly rising wind , and . with the increasing cold , the rain turned to snow . The I wind was at first shifting , but it settled toward the east and carried destruction with it . The first building to catch from the Reid &; Hughes store was a tall structure to the rear and westward , occupied by the Salvation Army Barracks and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped back to the eastward across Bank Street and wiped out the Ryan &; Fitzma.urice Block , Cannon &; Webster 's drug I store , Davis 's cigar store , and the store of J. B. Mullings &; Sons . They burned rapidly through to South Main Street . and jumped across that street . shriveling the buildings like paper . At the same time the flames caught the Masonic Temple and traveled from the Salvation Army Building to the rear of the Franklin House on Grand Street , and the entire block , consisting of seven or eight handsome five-story buildings , with thirty tenements and the large and commodious headquarters of The Waterbury American were soon in ruins . After 0 o'clock the militia was called out to preserve order . There was serious talk of blowing up buildings to prevent the spread of the flames . The fire was partially under control at 10:30 o'clock . It had been checked on South Main Street , and indications were that it would content itself on Centre Street with burning out the Long Block that contained the Franklin House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new places , and the efforts of the local firemen , combined with the aid given by fire-fighters and apparatus from the other cities , seemed powerless to stay its progress . The blaze was wiping out the business portion of the city , all the fire being confined to that section , though residential parts of the city were in danger by sparks driven by the furious wind . In the panic caused by the fire there were many rumors of accidents and fatalities , but at the Waterbury Hospital at 2 o'clock it was said that no accidents or deaths had been reported there . Losses on buildings reported up to U o'clock were as follows : W. H. Camp block , in which was located Reid &; Hughes 's store , $75,000 ; Masonic Temple , $50,000 ; O'Connor block , $35,000 ; Greenberg &; Buckner. $30,000 ; Old American block , Charles Miller , owner , $35,000 ; Johnson block , $40,000 ; Jones , Morgan &; Co. , clothiers , $50,000 ; J.
