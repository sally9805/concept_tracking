Tut , essays on history are a confusing . sort of literature . Whoever seeks in si:ch writings a systematic philosophy of the past or a standard of values in human ries , will be woefully disappointed . xpe What is more surprising , if one inquire .. 1cly shout the right method and the true purpose of historical studies , the enlightenment one gets is but slight and tubious . The treatises , while they all emphasir ? t he difficulty of the historian 's task . do not seem to agree at all concerning the sat tire of it , or its aim , or its scope , er the best way to go practically about it Even on what is perhaps the oldest of all the questions that ever have been raised concerning it , the question , namely , whether it , should be philosophical and interpretative or merely narrative and accurate . there is no agreement reached ; some of the writers seeming to feel that the historian is bound to take upon himself the fairly godlike role of interpreter , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be equally firm that he ought to hold himself with a rigorous , impersonal modesty to his lesser function of i no estigator and chronicler of facts . But it has been pointed out that his en in the least expanded acceptation of it . involves a daunting exercise of in , lionent . Through the obvious necessity to choose from the mass of his material he is driven upon a sort of interptoitation . In the proportions of his work . in his allotments of space and emphasis . in countless unconscious manifestations of sympathy and repulsion , in his rot , io.s ! mints and forbearances , his at- titude toward his subject is revealed . However lie may strive to keep himself out of his work , he can not do it . What he chooses to tell , and how he tells it , so much is his , is he . And yet , unavoidable as these questions of what and how are seen to be , quite apart from the whys and wherefores , there is no closer approach to a consensus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . In the entire field covered by the discussions of history there is scarcely to be found a single res adj udicata , a single universally accepted canon . But the writers , differing as they do on all the specific points in controversy , seem to be agreed , nevertheless , that there are canons , if they could only be formulated , that there is a standard , if it could only be defined . Let any historian set to work attacking the contentions of another , or defending his own . and it is ten to one his language will imply that there is a way of dealing with the past which is " history , " and that all other ways are wrong . The other historian 's work is interesting , brilliant perhaps , he will say ; or , on the other hand , he will pronounce it undeniably accurate , unhnpeachably respectable , and consonantly dull . But in either case he is sure it is not " history . " When , for example , Buckle announced that lie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first to explode his pretensions , and spared 110 ridicule in the refutation ; but in that very uame essay Droysen himself advanced many of the ideas which afterwards , when he had collected and 650 The Problem of the American historian . ordered them , he ventured to call The Principles of History . Not long ago , it was because of inaccuracy in details that this true quality of history was most frequently denied to historical writings . Nowadays , one seems to hear more of insight , imagination , and sympathy ; even of skill in presentation , and of literary style . But there is no agreement , probably there would be no way to phrase an agreement if it were reached , concerning the relative importance of these two parts or aspects of the historian 's work . Perhaps we shall never get a better saying on the matter than a quiet remark of Parkman in his introduction to what is still , on the whole , the best performance any American has ever made in history . The utmost care and patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , indispensable ? and inadequate . The philosophers will , no doubt , continue to find fault with the story-tellers , and the " dryas-dusts " to debate with the " romancers , " so long as history shall continue to be written . Three books n which have appeared within the year invite Americans who care about the history of their country to consider anew the question of the best way to write it . President Woodrow Wilson of Princeton has essayed to cover the entire field in a single narrative of moderate length . A number of English and American scholars have collaborated to the same end in a group of essays and narratives which make up the seventh volume of The Cambridge Modern History . With the posthumous publication of john Fish 's Essays , Historical and Literary , we have before us , it seems , all that we shall ever have from the pen of a very pleasing writer who has left untouched scarcely a single period of us : American past . It happens , also , that President Wilson , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned The Cambridge Modern tory , in his inaugural discourse as gius Professor at Cambridge , and Fiske , in one of the papers in these last tau volumes of his , have all three set forth at some length their views of historical work . It is scarcely to be believed , however , that the particular example of coiiperie tion presented by this volume of the Cambridge series will help us in any positive way to a notion of what the best p , ssible history of the United States will be like ; for the best possible history will not , one feels sure , prove to be a cooper:1. tire enterprise . ' Even the late Justin Winsor , though himself the editor of the most important coiiperative work we have , freely admitted that no eoneeie. able advantage of cooperation could eves compensate for the disappearance of the personal historian . After all , a coilpera. tive history can be nothing more than a series of separate histories , or of separate essays , or of both . There is a great convenience in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a subject or a period ; but it is prepo. terous to suppose that the extremely dif- ficult problem of historical preseutatioli has been solved by so simple atel chanical a device . It was the individual contributors to the seventh volume of The Cambridge Modern History who hail to face that problem , not the editors of the series . To compare the several styles and methods of these contributors would he a more practical approach to it thou to attempt a judgment of the entire voltune .

Fortunately , ' , ileitis , for himself and for his work , Fiske , though much of his time was given to lecturing , did not at any time , I believe , conduct a seminary in history . ' We may well suppose , however , that if he ever bad sat at the head of a seminary table and talked informally with the students gathered about hint on the general aspects of their work and Isis , he would have talked as he has written in this Palle " It is significant , even though we take the discourse to be incomplete , that there is scarcely a word in it about the writing of history . So far , it confirms the strongest impression which the present writer got from Fiske @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was that I understood at last how he wrote the way he did . He talked the same way . It is entirely probable that he could neither have talked nor written any other way if he had tried . Once , when he and Justin Winsor spoke in public on the same occasion , ? a meeting held in memory of Parkman , ? the contrast between the two in the matter of naturalness was very marked . The contrast in the same respect between Fiske 's narrative style and President Wilson 's is scarcely less marked . In the final sentence of his essay on The Truth of the Matter , in Mere Literature , President Wilson said : " ' There is an art of lying ; there is equally an art ? an infinitely more difficult art ? of telling the truth . " One feels concerning Fiske , however , that if he exercised any art at all in writing history , it was an extraordinarily unconscious sort of art . If there was any conscious art whatsoever , then it must have been profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's impression of the man himself ? to attain so completely the effect of artlessness .

The style is as unmistakable as his voice or his handwriting . To have written in any other style would have been , for him , like disguising his handwriting or his voice . In the presentation of his thought he was as free from artifice , not to speak of affectation , as a peasant or a king . There is neither straining nor restraint . He is never dull , but one would scarcely use such a word as brilliant to describe his happiest effects . " Brilliant " is , on the other hand , the very first word one applies to the work of President Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is impossible to believe that the effect is unconsciously attained , as a sort of unearned increment of his labors in the searching out and setting forth of the truth . One feels that , however well he has builded , he builded no better than he knew . Perhaps the quickest and keenest mind now at play on our American past , confessedly regardful of all that can be accomplished in the way of impressionistic statement , he was , one would say , the best writer we had among us to try , with a narrative of the whole course of our development , an experiment of that particular theory of historical composition which he himself had so eloquently advanced . For in the days when the German influence was at its height in all our academic circles , when the document threatened to win here the same dominance which it had already at the German universities , when the historians of both continents seemed to be trying , as Lord Acton acquiescingly explained , " to develop learning at the expense of writing , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work was to many of us a source of comfort and of hope . He continued steadfastly to treat scholarship as a means , not an end , and to regard history as a branch of literature rather than of science . But a great and successful attempt in the writing of history would have done more to establish his position than any reasoning or eloquence could do . the attempt which he has made was certain . ly big enough . It was so big , in troth , that one might consider he was courting absolute success or failure when he set about it . But history is no more the domain of the absolute than politics ? or life . We need not use such a word as failure when we admit that the adherents of the doe . ument will possibly find in minor inae. curacies of the work more to confirm them in their loyalty than we can find in its larger merits to fortify us in our different faith . To contribute fresh details of knowledge was , apparently , no part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the author to keep his work immaculately free from little mistakes . But the book , fair as it is on points of controversy , spacious and catholic and guiltless of conscious partisanship , and everywhere of a lively intelligence , is nowhere profoundly philosophical and sagacious . Readable it is , also , particularly if one take it by episodes and topics , less so if one go on steadily to the end but it does not stir , absorb , elevate , depress . It is welcome , for no other book at all comparable to it covers the whole great field ; welcome even in the cheapening dress , garish with frippery. unedifying illustrations , in which the publish em have clothed it . But if we try it by the simplest test , the only test which the mass of readers ever employ , the test by which we all form our genuine opinions of books , however we may afterward elaborate and explain'them ,  --  the test of its hold on our own attention , the appeal it makes to our own intelligence and sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work say of Parkman in American , or of Green in English history .

It will be manifest not merely in the impregnable accuracy of the narrative . but in the tone and elevation of it . as in that " air of matured power , of grave and melancholy reflection , " which Macaulay praised in Thucydides . The inure fact that he can not have born lung about it goes far , no doubt , to acconnt for our disappointment in Presid.int Wilson 's performance . But when all has been said that can be said on that : cord , his manner and style in narrative , lemicularly if one contrast it with the manner and style of - Fiske @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not merely cat thcse tArct. whom litany of us would c:n , n.c from the mass of our recent his : , , rians to compare with the historians of ottcr countries who have written as men of lvtivis. may have held differing views : esteeming the best way to write about pad . We should , no doubt , be very annul not to over-estimate the part which any theories of composition they may have held actually played in this work ; for we know too well that good writers very often break the rules they set themselves , and to the bettering of their books . Here , however , we have not merely two plans , two theories of historical composition , but two manners and styles , two ways of writing history , which differ quite plainly . It should not be entirely impracticable to take account of the difference with a reasonable sureness of one 's ground , notwithstanding that there are many other things which should enter into a complete comparison of the two writers . A comparison on that point alone must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by paragraph , President Wilson 's writing is more likely to impress one with the writer 's skill than Fiske 's is . That is why we call it brilliant . It shines . But the narrative , meanwhile , does not hold the reader as Fiske 's does . The continuous flow of skillful sentences actually tends to draw one 's attention away from the matter in them . They sometimes come between the reader and the story which they tell ; and , after all , it is the story , not the English , which one means to read . One naturally asks , therefore , why it is that a writer of such gifts and sympathies as President Wilson has shown , certainly not unmindful that brilliancy may be a fault , and bent , no doubt , on suiting the manner to the matter , the tone to the occasions , the pace to the progress of the theme , ? why he has not succeeded better in a thing which he had so carefully studied out the best way to do To put the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of telling us the history of our country is not on the whole so good a way as Fiske 's , whose way was , apparently , to tell it as he talked ? Of course , we are speaking now of two literary styles , and for the moment our consideration of them need not be affected by the circumstance that they are employed in history . All that we 654 The Problem of the American Ilixtorian. can decide , perhaps , is what one so frequently decides when a similar question is raised , ? that the simpler , the more natural style proves in the long run the more acceptable . We might , however , go a little further , and find in the present comparison another instance favorable to the definition of literary style as a gift , a characteristic ; as a thing comparable to one 's physical bearing , to the trick of one 's gait . President Wilson , who could probably come nearer telling us why and how he writes as he does than Fiske could have told us the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stylist than Fiske was , has a less distinctive and habitual style of his own than Fiske had . What he writes to-day is not so sure to be like what he wrote yesterday or ten years ago . But the point which is of most value seems to be this : one may indorse every dictum in President Wilson 's essay on The Truth of the Matter that bears on style in history , and still conclude that the truth of that matter , like " the truth of history " itself , is ? beyond our ken . Take . for example , his general proposition that what the historian as a matter of fact does is to convey impressions of the past . It can hardly be gainsaid . But when we go on to argue that his method should therefore be impressionistic , what we know of the method of great narrators , great story-tellers , makes us doubtful lest we be leaving something out of the reckoning ; and that something , I should be inclined to say , is nature . Was Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or Macaulay , who was so lacking in subtlety ? Or Froissart ? Or Herodotus ? If our reasoning were correct , should we not have to decide that even to the historian a marked style of his own must prove , in fact , an encumbrance , a thing to be got rid of altogether ? Must not he also , like the dramatist , make use of all styles , but have none of his own ? Here , I think , the peculiar nature of the historian 's task , the distinctive characteristics of history as a branch of literature , come into the argument . For the historian 's aim is not , after all , purely literary , purely artistic . Granted that to do his work the best way he must he an artist , there is always upon lam the duty of loyalty to another sort of truth than the truth of art . He is bound to tell the plain truth also . his imasination must serve , not control . Ile must tell what actually happened in former times ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committed Oat to the known facts , he is also Itched about by ignorance . Granted that through the power of imagination he may see his subject as the artist does . that he may see the past as a sort of whole . he has not the freedom to deal with it as if he were entirely artist , and nothing mere . The difference between his task and the tasks of his fellows , the novelists , the dra. matist.s , the poets , consists chiefly in the obligation he is under to distinguish between so much of the whole as he knew : in ordinary ways and so much as he can only imagine or divine . His consciete , will be forever telling him so ; tind effect will be to keep within comparatively narrow bounds whatever impres , icit ism he may employ . Carlyle 's observation concerning narrative as a meant to represent the past ? that it i , only a line , and must go straight on , while life stretches out in all direction ;  --  is also of moment . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrator , must be accomplished with little of reproduction , little of verisimilitude. since his representation of the past lack , two dimensions . In any attempt to fine the sort of writing about the pas ! which is history , we must , I think . be . gin by admitting that history can wily represent the past by the use of fact , which are known in ordinary ways .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lc greater in the written discourse th:In in the spoken . They are probably hot si great .

That would be more liko noting . To be consistent , ought not also , if one were reciting before an i/tie/we , to wear the costume of one 's perh i. yeak its language ? Speaking rc I ? vitieg , ought one not to discard all knowledge , and every habit of thought , which did not belong to the period ? With all these things which characterized his period the historian ought , no doubt , to be familiar . It were well , if it were possible , that he should be so familiar with them that he could , in imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him they are none the less things to be told , not to be lived , just as the events are also to be told , and not to be acted . Surely , recent writers of history have not gained , in comparison with the great and simple masters , by resorting to the devices of the novelist and of the playwright ; devices which in fiction and the drama are no doubt right and proper , but which in history are like darkening the room in the daytime and bringing in the candles . Impressionism in history is too suggestive of the use of stimulants to heighten our interest , or of hypnotism to get us over time and space ; whereas the real masters move us profoundly without such artifice . They are entirely respectful to time and space . They spread no magic carpet for our feet , make no pretense of transporting us into other lands and ages . They stand frankly beside us in our own time , on our own ground , and look back with us " over the centuries and the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it ever is advisable or even permissible to employ any sort of illusion in history . Attempts in that way to heighten the reader 's interest , or to vivify the representation of the past , or to convey subtly , by suggestion , what it may be hard to set forth plainly , will sometimes , and for a little while , seem to be successful . But in the repetition they are sure to grow tiresome . Effects so obtained fall short of the power and permanence which belong only to the natural . In so far as the discussions of history aim to increase the power of historical narrative by the discovery of new ways to tell the truth about the past , I am persuaded that they are vain . The peculiar restraint which is im- 656 The Problem of the American Historian . posed upon the historian as an artist , and which commends to him the frank and natural style in narrative , is scarcely less an ethical than an artistic restraint . To state what it is , clearly and precisely , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not exercise anything like authority over his subject . And that , certainly , is the feeling into which one comes after prolonged study of the past . No man can ever attain such a mastery of the past , or any part of it . as to justify him in departing entirely from that specific information concerning it , those facts and characteristics of it , through which he has arrived at his own understanding of it , in order to present it more convincingly to other minds . If he can only make his reader also aware of what happened , and from what reasonable causes , and after what fashion of occurrence , he will do well . Any such insight and hindsight and foresight as they attempt who would fain discover " the meaning of history " would be nothing less than a complete mastery of life . It would carry along with it all science and all theology . And he who pretends to understand completely any considerable part of the past , to see a clear plan and meaning in it , pretends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For where is he to stop if he begin to interpret in that omniscient way ? Surely it is better , in any attempt at interpretation , to proceed after the modest , ever inquiring fashion of the real masters , not in history alone , but in science as well , neither assuming nor denying that there is a comprehensive plan . If the historian have a conviction , he will do better to state it as his conviction , and nothing more , than to work it so intimately into the narrative that it can not be disentangled and considered by itself . To exercise so great an authority as that over his subject , to take so great a liberty with the mind of his reader , is not honest , even in a master : it matters not whether in that unfair way he seeks to establish more firmly the basis of th moral order , or , like Macaulay , to jus. tify a party , or merely to make his nal , rative more impressive . The reader , if he discover the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to profit by it . To rest upon authority is. no doubt , pleasant ; but the sense of security one gets after a while from the per . feet honesty of one 's guide is in the long run far better . It is the things that are told us in the simplest honesty , with whatever confessions of ignorance man be necessary , that help us most to under . stand the life about us ; and I know not why the same thing should not be true of past life . A peculiar and extreme example of this sort of honesty in his . tory is found in the career of the late Lord Acton . For he believed , it seem : , in the deep moral significance of all his . tory , and held the true goal of historical studies to be nothing less than a coin . plete interpretation of the past , and the laying bare of the whole plan of human development . But though he himself spent his lifetime in all manner of diligent inquiry , in the investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his mastery of any soh. ject or period , and never would publish a book . His modesty was no doubt excessive , but one can not live long in this world without coming to associate a degree of humility with any high form of honesty or of competency . It is they who see the deepest into life who keep the most of wonder in their eyes . And if frankness , straightforwardness. naturalness , do conduce to the value of historical narrative , and conduce also , on the whole , to the interest and the charm of it , they are not less conducive to another effect of it which is scarcely less important : an effect which it has in common with every other sort of work that is at all artistic . I mean . the ef feet of making life and humanity more impressive than we ordinarily find then : : of enlarging and ennobling them . For // it true that we take life and humanity in art otherwise than we take them in our daily experience . It is not our wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women about us with all that dignity and mystery and large-Jibs which , human figures wear in great riction , and statues and great books . Of COL/150. the observation is far from aw : but it deserves to be considered when one inquires how it is best to treat he past . For it can scarcely be questioned that in this respect the historian eav and f rem ' ently does accomplish what : mists of other sorts commonly accomplish . Apart from the question of bow he , lots it . the question of whether he ought to do it . the question of truthfulness , mar- not unreasonably be raised . Is it sot incumbent on him , we might ask , to void this particular effect altogether , as he must avoid other delusions and and to keep humanity and life in that perspective in which we habitually on thou . : nut to portray them in the light anion t he scale of every day ? Will not the dots of fairness , of impartiality which forlihis hint to champion particular men and causes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of his whole subject If it were so judged , he might , indeed , tonther with , the whole company of ark , of every sort , of them that in any way reproduce life , plead , in excuse , a very high , temptation . For it can not be baked that in this effect art plays to oar nobkness and not to our vileness . To derive that sense of things from hisry is to be peculiarly fortified in all the worthier part of our natures . It is tonical to our bravest aspirations . And , con- tlwre is no other way to weaken tie risises Of men half so effective a , to Wu , in them the habit of seeing to affair of chance and pity- tbaetions . Even to reason that there is no moral order whatsoever in the miner , is not SO hurtful to the moral standards of individual men as to make them see themselves and all their fellows alike as but little things . But perhaps a better defense for the historian who seems thus to enlarge his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and careful record of the past of the race is absurd , and a waste of time , unless one has already a high conception of humanity , and finds , or at least wills to find , a great nobleness in life . For however considerable may be the practical uses of a knowledge of the past , I am persuaded that men do not , as a rule , give themselves to the study of it for any merely practical purpose whatsoever . It is rather from a grave curiosity that the historian sticks to his endless task . There are historical writers , it is true , but chiefly of the documentary and institutional school , whose work reflects no such feeling as this , and has no such effect as that we are considering . But these men are not historians in the sense that they reproduce the past , or portray mankind , at all . And this , perhaps , is also part of the distinction we may make between those writers on history who are , and those who are not , historians : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not , pursue their labors from the deep and natural concern they have about humanity and all that pertains to it , from that reverent and wondering curiosity about life which is the motive and inspiration of all art . However that may be , the great narrative historians certainly do make us see life as tremendous and full of interest , and men , even in their follies and their weakness , as after all entirely noteworthy creatures . The effect is as clear after reading Thucydides or Gibbon as it is after reading Homer or Dante , or when one gazes upon great pictures . Perhaps a little reflection will enable us to see that . right or wrong , it is a natural , an inevitable effect of seeing life and humanity well portrayed . For what the portrayal , the reproduction , does for us is 658 The Problem of the American Historian . to arrest for our completer observation what in ordinary experience we see but partially , or when we ourselves are so distracted that we can not scrutinize and contemplate it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that , as has often been remarked , the artistic truth of it is a thing to be recognized , not proved , is probably memory . For memory does also enlarge and ennoble in the same way the artist does . The incidents of yesterday , of a year ago , of one 's childhood , have not , in one 's thought of them now , the pettiness and formlessness of what is happening before one 's eyes to-day . In yesterday 's meeting with my friend , nothing he said seemed notable , and there was little in his look and bearing even to suggest the immensity of his individual experience or the great mystery of his existence and of mine ; but all that will be in my thought of him if memory bring him again before me , or if I look upon his portrait . Surely , then , we can ask no more of the narrative historian than that he deal with past life as faithfully as our memories do . We can not blame him for magnifying his subject , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are constantly playing us the same trick ? if , indeed , it is a trick . On the contrary , we ought to recognize in this very thing ? a thing to be found in all accepted art , and most apparent in the highest ? a sign of his membership in the brotherhood of artists . It is a power which he has because he is an artist and a man of genius , a power not to be won by conformity to any rule of composition ; but I think little question can be made that the effect is best accomplished by those historians who write of the past in that straightforward , natural way which on other grounds also we find to be the best . Honesty and simplicity are in themselves a sort of reverence for one 's subject . He who builds in perfect sinceray will always build better than he knows . He will make his subject seem larger that way than he can be anr sort of authoritative manipulation of or any rhetorical parading to and fro be-fore it . In these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the past , but it is the staple. the natural , the entirely honest historian who invests it with the most of that ma4hi. tude and nobleness which life takes on in memory and in art . Compare the narratives of Homer , of Thneylides , of John Bunyan ? to take three good examples of the manner I have in mind with the best of the elaborative writha ; of our own time , and no one coo fail to see hose muds more impressive incidents and characters are in the hands of these three than they are in the hands of our contemporaries . Of course , these thren were great masters of narrative , and per haps it is not fair to compare work whidi has come down to us only by reason of its extraordinary excellence with tua but the work of other masters . lint there is more in the matter than the parity between genius and ordinany talents . Few would think of mentioning Fiske 's Discovery of America in the same breath with these great narratives . But read his direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage of Columbus , and see if it dues not surpass , in the largeness of the /deal. as well as in the breathless interest of it . while one reads , any of the more elalie rate and conscious attempts to impre , s one with the mighty issues committed to those little caravels . The manner amp style of it is what is probably best described as natural ; and in that respert. though not in the entire execution . it is not unlike the story of the Sicilian copsdition in Thucydides . It is from his constant use of this niae net and style , scarcely less than extraordinary memory , his imitedry. and his considerable powers of imagination . that Fiske doubtless deserves a higher rank among the writers of history than any other American since Parlonan. net- // that Mr. Henry Adams and Mr. James Ford Rhodes have both their special periods as he probAy He% r did master any period . Litrle.that ? st praise can be said of Mr. work on the score of honesty and dill , oce , nor is there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his characteristic ' antler is not easy or graceful . Mr. 11,1111 , has a better gift of speech and midi insight of a critical , intellectual lai is lacking in sympathy and in warmth . 11 , , , eV er , we compare Fiske 's work with the wort of such men as Parkman and Green . his achievement must be acconItt , et less than theirs .

History , indeed , iv , nut his lifework quite as it was thY lifework of the other two . His gifts wee , not imperiously controlled and marshaled by any such deep , quiet passt , , 11 wc find informing the serious liter:nue that lasts . Right as he was to pusnit the past as simply as he could , one : utactnnes feels that his vision was s , ; dear and undisturbed because there wen t Ling . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iu mews lives and natures , and thing : poet i sal and inspiring ? which he did nit see at all .

Anil when one reflects on the whole virtu . uul hotion of the past which he present , . tine linds it too easy-going . The matter seems always a little too plain . Ilinirything. apparently , is explained , or at least is explicable . The course of events is Ion , regular , too processional , ten like the course of nature undisturbed by hulean nature . When we consider how constantly we are bewildered by what happens among our fellows , before our very eyes , we have difficulty in believing that there was so little of the marvelous , the inexplicable , in all this life which glides before us in his pages . He does not entirely convince us because he does not wonder . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took so strong a hold of our intellectual life about the time when he began to write . Herbert Spencer 's influence was still upon hint when he turned from science and philosophy to the history of his country . But when we compare any American with any English or any Continental Instorian , we ought to keep in mind that the tasks are not altogether alike . It may not be entirely the fault of the story-teller if one story fall short of another in interest and charm . The truth is , that in many respects ? in the atmosphere , in the variety of incidents and characters ? the story which the Old World historian has to tell is a better story to tell than ours is . He is particularly fortunate in the ascendency of the human and biographical over the economic and geographical motives ; for the fortunes of these compact European states seem to have been continually turning on the fortunes of individual men , their heroisms , loves , ambitions ; and this has not been true of our widespread commonwealth . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast upon his pages . Moreover , the artists of other sorts have prepared the way for hint to the sympathy of his readers . Poets and dramatists , painters and sculptors , have given to many of his themes an accessory charm . Spread over the entire surface of his continent and its islands are countless monuments and ruins which forever turn the thoughts of men backward . - Writing in a land where nothing is so rare as ruins , for a people whose faces are set toward the future , and telling a story in which the vastness of the field 660 The Problem of the American Historian . of action and the play of great material forces tend to dwarf the human figures , in which it is seldom permissible to introduce the entire lives and portray the complete characters of individuals , the American historian has not so good an opportunity for many of the effects which have been as common in history as in other forms of literature . The range of motives is not so wide . Human nature is not , perhaps , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense and passionate . To many of our deepest individual experiences it scarcely relates itself at all . The springs of laughter and of tears are seldom reached . Now and then , as in Franklin , Washington , Hamilton , Lincoln , we encounter fascinating or impressive characters , but for the most part the men who come before us arouse our interest rather for their causes than for themselves . Women and children we hardly ever see at all . Our concern is less with incidents than with movements and conditions , less with individuals than with the mass . We feel ourselves to be studying races and mankind . The fact that hardly a single good play or poem , and until recent years hardly a single good statue or monument , has dealt with an episode of American history , may mean more than that the arts are backward in America . For one thing , it means to the American historian that he will not yet find the popular imagination quickened to his themes . Perhaps it means also that his material is not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older lands . But until a master has dealt with it we can not know that this is true . If there were a master , he might convince us that the interest and the charm of the story is only different . For indeed it does not seem altogether reasonable to suppose that in the discovery , peopling , and partitioning of a whole continent , in the founding of so many states , in our revolutions , wars , and swift upgrowth to a colossal stature of /rationality , there is any dearth of material for art . pe1 , . Imps , under wise tutelage , we shall COME to see in the magnitude of the theme . the spaciousness of the field , the ( Tint di . rectness and simplicity of the action , full compensation for any lack of that dramatic intensity which belongs to the history of France , let no say , or of Greece . For the mystery which maiquity sheds upon the stories of these old . er lands we have , everywhere through . out the story of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fn. tore which shall be greater than any their past . It is through a fixed habit of thought , but a habit which we in Amer. ica may conceivably change , that human affairs seem to derive a greater dignity from the dimness of their origins than from the equal twilight of their ends and outcomes . There is no sufficient reason why memorials should impress us more deeply than harbingers and portents . Life is but life , nor does it greatly matter with which of the two eternities it is shadowed . But whatever difference of values there may be in his themes as compared with others , the American historian is unwise if he attempts to set them forth with any ? new method and mariner . For him , as for all historians of comparatively recent times , it is necessary , no doubt . to take . account of many things which the data rians of other stages of civilization , when science had made but little progress , did not need to consider . He will he drawn to generalize as they , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will also have to treat of material forces . of institutions , anal of races . far more extensively than the historians ' of smaller and more homogeneous states . For these reasons , he may very likely find Gibbon a better model , on the whole , than narydides . But that he will need our not art , or any way of telling about the Jest essentially different from the way at the earliest and best narrators , I can not he ' tare. ; rough he will have more to tell than they had . the addition will be of little moment as compared with those great periettneltt elements of all history with whirl ' they also dealt . His story , like theirs , wdl he of the men that lived before our time ; of what manner of men they were . and what they did ; and of what sort of world they lived in , and how they changed it into the world we live in now . He will do best , he will do supremely well , if he tell his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may understand ; honestly and truthfully , so that we may profit by it ; naturally , because we shall like it best if he tell it in his own way ; seriously and reverently , because he will be speaking of the dead .
