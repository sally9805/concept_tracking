txt The expansion of co-operative trading in Great Britain is one of the most remarkable of modern instances of commercial development along lines created by changing social and economic conditions . The British trading societies are both wholesale and retail . The former are usually federations of the retail distributive societies , and buy for them in so large a way as to secure all the advantage to be derived from magnitude in transactions and unquestioned credit . One of the principal of these , the English Wholesale Society , was founded in 1864 with fifty members and a capital of ? 999 . It now has a membership representing more than a thousand cooperative societies , employs a capital of ** and does a business of ? 16,000,000 per annum . The retail co-operative associations have a capital of ? 26,000,000 , and use in addition accumulations of dividends and interest , known as loan capital , to the amount of about ? 8,000,000 . As the rule these societies have more capital than is needed for the purposes of their business , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remunerative investments for their surplus . Such investments now amount to something like ? 9,000,000 . The older and richer societies are always willing and even eager to invest their surplus in the shares of new societies , and are now employing about ? 4,000,000 in this way . Of retail societies there are now about 1,500 in Great Britain , and their sales last year exceeded in value $50,000,000 . Their divisible net profits in 1901 were very nearly ? 8,000,000 . The number of the co-operative stores very much exceeds the number of the societies , for the reason that many of the societies have several , and some a great many . A few days ago the Barnsley Society opened its fiftieth grocery store . Others have done as well and grown as large . The Leeds Industrial , for ex ample , has 48,000 members , and its annual sales exceed $6,000,000 . The Gateshead Society has 1,200 members and annually sells more than $2,000,000 in value . The Sunderland Society has 12,500 members and its sales exceed $1,500,000 .

That at Bolton , in Lancashire , has 24,000 members and sales of nearly $4,000,000 annually . These are representative trading societies , and it is not surprising that their inroads upon the domain of the retailer is changing rapidly , and it would seem permanently , the character of merchandise distribution in Great Britain . The war of competition which began in the North of England , notably at St. Helens , is spreading in all directions and threatens in many localities , and ultimately it may be in all , the extinction of the small retailer . In St. Helens a Private Traders ' Defense Associatien has been organized and a boycott declared against the co-operative stores . This was met by raising among the societies a defense fund of ? 100,000 , of which ? 50,000 were contributed by the Wholesale Society . The issue is not yet determined , but what the net result is likely to be is indicated by the fact that the St. Helens Co-operative Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small for the business they are doing . This would look as if the " fight for life " was on the part of the private traders , rather than on the part of the society . Obviously co-operative trading has g-ained a position in Great Britain from which it can not be dislodged by individual competition . Their line of battle extends from the centre of England to the sea in every direction , their reserves are formidable , they stand together shoulder to shoulder , and the retailer who refuses to take them seriously overlooks the value of organization sustained by large and mobile resources . Meanwhile Sir Tuomas LIPTON and others are showing that great successes are still possible in retail trade , though not by the methods followed by the small trader , which are probably the only ones he can follow . That the co-operative society has not become a factor of importance in the commercial system of this country is probably due to the fact that the modern department store takes its place and fills its function well enough to discourage competition initiated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
