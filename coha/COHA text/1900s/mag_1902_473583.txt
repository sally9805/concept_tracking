MY invitation came from 0o-Dham-ma-Nanda . That was his name " in religion . " Earlier he had been indicated by another , which implied , to those who knew it , an Irish diver employed in the pearl fisheries of Ceylon . But since the pearl-diver had gone forever , so , naturally , had his patronymic . There remained a priest of the yellow robe of Buddha called 0o-DhammaNanda ? " Lord of the Law of Happiness . " He himself chose the designation , he told me . " You were not afraid , " I said , " of such a name ? " 0 Oh , not at all , " he replied . " I thought I 'd like it . " He sat looking at me steadily and quietly , under the punkha in my friend 's drawing-room , from which one saw the evening light upon the Irrawaddy . His head was shaved , his bare feet were crossed on the floor . He was plentifully swathed in his saffron habiliments , but the upper one fell like a plaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T uneovered . It was curiously repellent , that bare arm and shoulder ; it expressed a detachment that was almost an indecency . I found myself staring at it with unforgivable rudeness . It had been hard to know exactly what to expect , hard to give any definition to one 's vision of a man of one 's own race dedicated to a religious ideal of the East . I had seen many priests of Buddha , poonghees ? in throngs , in companies , or solitary upon the highways , humble and enntemplative , holding their great palm-leaf fans between their eyes and temptation ? he would not , I thought , be like those . But he was curiously like them . His shaven head was as disconcertingly smooth , the sun had tanned his skin almost as dark an olive . In his eyes , which were blue , sat the same look of withdrawal and of concentration , as if his spirit , intent upon inner examination , had turned its back upon the world . When he spoke or answered it looked over its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in his voice , but on his long upper lip , in the way his eyes darkened when he smiled Yes , he was like them . Every morning , for three years , he had taken the thabeik , the begging-bowl , and gone out barefooted , bareheaded , past the little bamboo houses of the people , collecting his daily food , asking nothing , rejecting nothing , saying no word of thanks , a mute opportunity for good works . Every day for three years he had eaten but twice , at nine and at noon , and gone to bed fasting to preserve the innocence of his dreams . Every day for three years he had walked with downcast eyes fixed never more than six feet in front of him , telling upon his rosary , " I worship the Buddha ; I worship the Law ; I worship the Assembly , " and hundreds of times every day had he whispered to himself , " Aueissa , dokka , anatta " ? " Misery , pain , illusion " ? when perhaps the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed much at the well . He was vowed to no possessions , no desires ; as he ate he assured himself that he took food to sustain the body only , and found a sin in its savor , making no haste at his meal , and always leaving , moreover , a mouthful upon the plate . He drank from his own primitive filter that he might not even take life invisible , and always he meditated upon the Law . I knew that he had done these things and many others that belonged to the part he had chosen . It was plain from his face that he had clone them . It was bound to be a catechism , and the results were bound to be meagre . The mere spectacle of him was too dramatic , too absorbing ? the wide gulf he had stepped across on the bridge of his yellow robe . It was as though I hailed him , with my questions , from the other side , as if he shouted to answer me , though his voice was soft and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speaking , quite discounted and , as it were , neutralized , by the refinement he had gathered somewhere ? not in Dublin . I asked him , of course , what determined him to the rule and the order he had adopted . He answered me carefully , picking his words ; and though the brogue was thick upon them , I suspected that it was nothing to the richness that he suppressed . " It first came before me , as you may say , in Ceylon . I studied it a bit there , and then I came up here to Burma to one of these kyaungs , which is Burmese for monasteries , and the priests they tuk me in hand and learned me till I was ready to enter the priesthed roeself . " It was quite like that . But he seemed to have no more relation to his language than to any other circumstance of the life he had discarded . " Do you read Pali ? " I asked . " I do not ? yet . The sacred texts has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new letters of th ' alphabet that comes hard to me ? them an ' the new language together . The other priests " ? he smiled gently ? " has got the start o ' me there . They learned it as bhys , here in the kyaungs . " I wondered . whether I had ever before heard a creature from my own side of the world admit , for any purpose or under any circumstances , that an Oriental had " got the start " of him . Tins was humility indeed , astonishing and curiously sweet . " You are the first European , are you ? not , to become a Buddhist priest in Burma ? " " 1 am , " he said , and just for an instant the old Adam looked out of his eyes in a ray of vanity . But he lowered them at once , and when he looked up again it was veiled . What I longed to get some inkling of was whether through mysticism and mortification he had really attained , even momentarily , another plane of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why this should be contradicted by a brogue . I made a cautious approach . " Do you meditate much ? " I asked . " Not so much as some . There 's some that does nothing else . " " Then what. ? " I paused , being trou- Plied , and then as if to soften this asperity , he added , " Happiness in Buddhyism is different to happiness outside of it . Ye would n't understand . " I had a sense of compunction when he went on to say that if he might get his umbrella , which he had left at the back of the house , he would like to go now -- -a discreet idea that perhaps his happiness was none of my business , either . Something like apology trembled on my lips , but I am afraid I forgot it when he told me that the second induction of a European into the Buddhist priesthood would take place the next morning at nine o'clock , " there or thereabouts , " and that I might come and see it if I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the world , but his birthright in it , what was an apology ? The kyaung stood back from the road under trees , as Burmese monasteries always do . They were beating a gong in front of it at nine o'clock next morning ; but they beat a gong so often in Burma , and for reasons so obscure , that it mingles with the barking of the pariahs , and the cawing of the crows , and falls upon alien ears , dulled into a kind of constant accompaniment to life . It would not have called us , the Stoic and me ; but we knew the address . The Stoic is an Administrator ; let him go at that . He is captive to the service of this gentle country and his far-off King ; be would call himself a Pagoda Slave , but that is too cruel a term even for bondage like his . Besides , I am not sure that the Stoic finds no hidden bliss in putting up with it . The monastery was built of brown 1111-pain ted teak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world from under its many high-pitched roofs ; its appearance was rickety . As we climbed the outer staircase , Oo-Dhamma-Nanda appeared at the door of the landing . He explained genially that all was not yet ready ; I believe they were shaving the candidate . The place was full of Burmans , both priests and the laity , full of talk and laughter and cheerful bustling . The candidate was abandoning the garments of this world . Would we wait ? Would n't we ! But if we might have a couple of chairs under the mahogany-tree furthest from the gong , we thought we would prefer to wait there . Var .. CV. ? Nn 629 -8 9 They brought us chairs , the laity , detailed in two comely Burmese maidens , each with a rose above her ear , each in a fresh pink silk tamein and spotless white jacket . Then they brought a table and spread a cloth upon it , and on this they set forth madeira-cake and a plate of those terrible little Italian confections , mostly of almond paste , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added long glasses and a bottle of cider . " Oh , Stoic , " said 1 , " behold your breakfast , " but he only smiled indulgently and out the inadeira-cake . There are stoics who regard the feelings of other people even before they repress their own . A gay-colored group gathered at a respectful distance to watch our enjoyment of the feast , and among them was a little Burmese boy . I hope it was not very wrong ; I beckoned to the little Burmese boy , who came willingly . An idea seized one of the rose-decked incident ; she fled away as fast as her tightly wrapped petticoat would permit , and presently reappeared with two large brimming cups of tea . " The intention is excellent , " remarked the Stoic , " but the milk is of the bazar , " and he said something in Burmese which meant , I believe , that we were the kind of people who never drank tea . They received this with perfectly cheerful understanding ; but they began to think of other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink lemonade and chocolates . We could only submit , passively , and the Stoic ate everything he could . Time passed , and without intermission they beat the gong . " Do you realize , " I said , " that we are taking part in a feast to celebrate the relapse of a Christian into paganism ? " " Let us hope , " replied the Stoic , " that he will make a good pagan . " " It is a strange change . " " The universe is transformation , life is opinion , " quoted the Stoic . " But whence this opinion ? " I begged to know . " What wandering current from the heart of an exotic ideal thrilled 0oDhamma-1landa and bade him follow ? It must have had to penetrate so much . " " Perhaps he worships his demon . Perhaps , unknown to his kind , he has always worshipped it . Buddhism provides generously for that . We of the West worship our activity , or our ambition , or our sense of beauty ; we never worship our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make your body a negation , and dress it contemptuously in yellow cotton , and obey the Law . " " Oh , " I said . There was no time to say more ; it was ten o'clock , and midway on the grass between us and the monastery appeared Oo-Dhamma-Nanda , beckoning . Most of the assemblage had drawn to one side of the room , and there it crouched on the floor upon its heels . On a mat before the people sat the old Sadaw , the abbot . He had the most benevolent face I have ever seen in the world ; his eyes wandered about him as if they dreaded meeting pain , and he smiled constantly , as water will ever ripple . It was as if he wished to ward off sadness with his smile . I watched it , fascinated , for a lung time , wondering if he succeeded . A younger priest hovered about him , others huddled in the background . There was not a semblance of order ; quite as many Burmans , men and women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . The women specially bustled and laughed at the other side of the room , bending over baskets of eatables , not in any way humbled by the occasion , rather in their way mistresses of it . The room was divided by a long row of pagoda-shaped lacquered Ok , which cover the food offerings to the priests . I saw no furniture except the couple of chairs which were found for the Stoic and me , and the table which pursued us from outside , to be immediately placed at our elbows , laden with fresh confections . A few Chinamen mingled with the Burmans , and many in whom the races were plainly blended . Oo - Dhamma - Nanda moved among them with lifted , anxious eyebrows ; his glance was deprecating when it fell on us , but we could not be sure whether we were the subjects or the objects of his apology . The place was open all round ; we could see through the wooden lattices the sun flaming on the trees outside . From mid-roof hung the ghost of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in it and flew constantly in and out , adding their tribute to the festival . It seemed , as it hung there , a type of nugatory incarnations . " Yet we , " said the Stoic , " perpetually ask for truth , and always the sparrows build . " Then , while we all still talked end feasted , from an inner room appeared the candidate . He was dressed in robes of the priestly cut , but they were all white , and he stood in them a bent old man . His shaven head was as white as his garments , and so was his skin ; his deep-set timid eyes had speculation and shrewdness in them ; his nose was sharply aquiline , his lips tightly drawn . Surely , one thought , it was late . He desired to find peace and to annihilate sorrow , but would there be time ? His steps could be so few upon the way ; would the journey be worth the departure ? They all looked upon him kindly as he came forward among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interpreter , demanded silence . Then there was something like it . and the scattered groups melted - upon the floor . The candidate was guided forward and shown where to kneel down , He carried his yellow robes in his arms , awkwardly . The officiating priest stood over him , the old abbot fixed his benignant gaze on him . The candidate kneeling , lifted his head and looked up at them , with affection and confidence and docility and submission , between man and man indeed a curious regard ? across this gulf of race and tradition . . . how is one to write of the strange pang it brought ? Out of the attitude , the delicate profile thrown back , the look of exaltation chosen and conviction desired , flashed a seizing resemblance . I looked at the Stoic and he at me . Together we ejaculated , " Cardinal Newman ! " The image was the merest kaleidoscopic suggestion of dissolving circumstance , which immediately carried it away , but on the illusory scene of things we saw it for an instant painted before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidate repeated after him these things in Pali , addressing the abbot : " Grant me leave to speak . Lord , graciously grant me admission to deacon 's orders . Lord , I pray for admission as a deacon . Again , Lord , I pray for admission as a deacon . A third time , Lord , I pray for admission as a deacon . In compassion for me , Lord , take these yellow robes and let me be ordained , in order to the destruction of all sorrow , and in order to the attainment of Nirvana . " GARBED IN PRINTED CALICOES This prayer he also repeated three times . Leaning forward , the abbot took the bundle of robes and gently threw a band about the candidate 's neck , thus formally clothing him , I suppose , with righteousness . At this the candidate again retired with the priest . Some circumstance attended his going ; they made way for him . He moved bent and rigid and slow from among us ? a corpse in its grave-clothes he strangely seemed , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we learned , he changed into the yellow livery , saying after the priest : " In wisdom I put on the robes , as a protection against cold , as a protection against heat , as a protection against gadflies and mosquitoes , wind and sun and the touch of serpents , and to cover nakedness ? that is , I wear them in all humility , for use only , and not for ornament or show . " Again he came out and knelt before the abbot : " Lord , I pray for the refuges end the precepts . " " Buddham sOranam gacchami ; Dhammam iltranam gacchrimi7 ; Sartgkam 86-ranata gacchatni , " * sonorously repeated the priest , and quaveringly the old man said it after him . He stumbled over some of the words ? there was pathos here ? and the cadence he gave to some did not satisfy the priest , so that , looking up like a child , he was obliged to say them several times . The words of the precepts were harder still ? that by which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty syllables ? and here the candidate often broke down , shaking a discouraged head . The dignity and the solemnity fled away from him ; he became only a bewildered old man , a puppet in a play which it was doubtful whether he wholly understood . The kindly eyes of the abbot alone redeemed the situation , and the devotion of an old Burmese woman who stretched out joined hands before this miracle , with a flower in. them . There was still the selection of a name , the new name on the old tombstone of an Englishman . This , according to the usage , was at the candidate 's choice , several being submitted to him . It was " I put my trust in Buddha ; I put ray trust in the Law ; I put my trust in the Priesthood. " plainly an interesting moment ; the old abbot leaned forward and whispered , the officiating priest bent down , and the others drew around ; even the audience ? should I say the congregation ? ? gathered closer , freely offering suggestions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Venerable Lord of Purity " ; " 0o-Caudirna , " " Lord of the Moon " ; " On-Dhamma-Sami , " " Lord of the Written Law " ? should it be any of these ? The candidate hesitated ; his fancy was not caught . " 0o-Asoka l " contributed an intelligent layman in a queue , smiling broadly ( " That chap , " said the attentive Stoic to me , " is a clerk in the Finance Department " ) , and the old man turned at the suggestion . " I 've heard of Asoka , " said he , vacillating . Oo-Dhamma-Nanda settled it . " Cali ' him Asoka , " said he with authority , and it was agreed . " Do you like your name ? " asked an English-speaking Burman , good-naturedly . " Oh , ifs a nice name , " quavered the old man , " but I 'm not equal to Asoka . " T think they scamped the service ; we were in Lower Burma , where orthodoxy , of late years , has suffered some dilution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ritual of Shin-Gautama . Oo-Dhamma-Nanda , through an interpreter , addressed the assemblage . HE held up his bare arm and they listened , many of them devoutly ; the old woman still stretched out her flower . For that instant he was the pictorial priest , all to them that he could ever be . Then ? at me1 ? then he spoke . Alas , he addresseC , them as " Ladies and Gentlemen " ; he made them a speech . It was about " thc work , " the work of the Society for the Propagation of Buddhism , of which 0o ? Dhamma-Nanda appeared to be a corner stone . " The object of this soci'ty , " said he , " is that we should spread Buddhyisn in all people whatsoever color they are . ' He spoke slowly , with his lingers joinec at the tips , and at the end of every sen tence he swayed forward on his toes anc back ? he might have been a ward poll tician addressing a crowd in the interest ! of Tammany . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 3,4 see here with the specs " ? as the society ' : ripest fruit . He made the inevitable ap peal for support . " They say - onion I stren'th , " said he . He related , witl modesty , some of his own exploits in defence of the indigenous faith . He had shut up lio less than three mission stations , he told us , mainly by force of public argument , and he gave us details of one polemical struggle in which the missionary was fairly routed in the eyes of the audience , because he was unable to produce " anny sort of proof " for the story of Joshua and the sun . Ho was modest , lint he also gloried . " If army one gives throuble on these subjects , " said he , " just you refer him to me . I do n't think there 'll be much more anxiety for public controversy so long as I 'm around . " " It 's Buddhyism cum shillalah , " whispered the Stoic ; and indeed the simple grotesqueness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Dhamma an - da in plainer revelation ? his Western energy in full fling , all his vigor going out to preserve and proselytize , a figure of absurd and inconsistent violence vainly trying to merge itself in the great placid passive army of the yellow-robed . It proclaimed the compromise by which the spirit of the East might be brought to inhabit the blood of the West . The interpreter forged along , and the good Burmans , some of them large subscribers to the " Society , " listened without obvious exultation , but appreciative and gratified . It was really not unlike a missionary-meeting at home ; one saw the same depressed interest and respectful attention to the laborer returned from heathen vineyards . If the ladies had worn bonnets , the resemblance would have been complete . One thing remained to finish the ordination of Asolta ; he was to taste at once the essence of the abandonment of the body , to know without delay the new strange carelessness for the morrow which he was pledged to entertain . The priests put his begging-bowl into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the room . They heaped it heartily , one after another , with good things , rice and cakes fried in butter and condiments , putting in their packages with many jokes among themselves . OoAsoka , who moved gravely upon his quest , looked a little dazed at the laughter . .. We went down with the crowd , which showed as perfunctory a spirit as ever issued from a Broadway church . Nor did it Lack its touch of cynicism , which came from the subordinate official in the queue , and was addressed to a paddy-broker in a checked silk petticoat . The clerk clapped the broker upon his fat shoulder . " They are happy men , ' " said he , smiling jovially , " ' whose natures sort with their vocations . ' " My Stoic lifted his eyebrows . " Bacon ! " said he Bacon ? the ruffian ! "
