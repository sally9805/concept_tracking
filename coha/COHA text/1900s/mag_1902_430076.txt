 | If you have traveled along the North Channel in the " City of Midland , " coming east from the Sault Ste. Marie , the chances are that you do not remember Little Current . The whistling of the steamer , which announced the approach to Picnic Island , may have aroused you ; but , probably , you slept in your state-room until the town was left far behind . If you awoke and peered out through the intense darkness of the early hours of the day , you saw , by the light of the steamer 's search-light , the cars of fish brought on the vessel , the dim outlines of the lumber yard , and the light-house , which marks the town , half a mile further on . When the steamer moves from the island , even the blackness of the night is not so great as to prevent you from seeing how near the shores are on either side and admiring the skill of the helmsman who guides the boat through the narrow passage . A few houses are seen clustering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers disembark , are met by lantern-bearing friends , and disappear in the night , one or two persons come on board , the whistle blows , the bell rings , the propeller moves , and you are gone . Such was the writer 's experience on a recent vacation trip . But as we went westward , after we passed the narrows at Killarney and the lovely lake-like scenery there , we soon touched at Manitowaning . There we had pointed out in the distance the Jesuit mission of Wickwemiquong , where the fathers still teach the Hurons , as they did in the country further south , before the Iroquois drove them away , and we next came to Strawberry Island . Looking past its light-house , we saw , on a height at some distance , the spire of a church and below it three tall iron smokestacks . " That is the Roman Catholic Church , where the priest comes from Wickwemiquong to say mass , and those are the stacks of the mill on Picnic Island , " cries one to whom Little Current is home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come nearer and see the cupola of the Presbyterian  | church , and the houses on the bluff , we turn the last point , and stop at the wharf at the east end of the town . It is about three o'clock in the afternoon . A crowd is down to meet us and freight is rapidly transferred from our lower deck to the store house on the shore . If it be in the season , we receive in return large numbers of baskets of blueberries , which grow profusely everywhere . While the steamer waits , the adventurous passengers investigate the town and some even press up the hill to see the pleasant cottages which overlook the channel . It is a picturesque view which meets our eyes when we have climbed to the west end of Robinson street . The narrows cause the waters to run with that rapid current , whence the town takes its name . The hills of the North Shore rise in the distance . Nearer are the barren shores of La Cloche Island , the flat and stony acres of Goat Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tiny Spider Islet in the west . In the near foreground and close to the shore are the low-lying Picnic and Mill Islands , whose names hear record to departed pleasure and industry . At some early period in the history of the town , people held picnics on the former island , then pleasant and well timbered . Although Little Current is only thirty years old , such a condition of things belongs to ancient history . There is hardly a tree left on Picnic Island and the great piles of lumber , the boarding houses for the mill hands , and the idle mill cover most of its surface . Mill Island is still more melancholy in its witness of bygone greatness . One can hardly believe that the mill was used only about three years or so ago , all is so desolate and ruinous . The tramway has fallen and the piles of lumber have gone , leaving only splinters and bits of bark behind them . The rusty and broken cars are piled up on one end of the island . The wooden walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which held in place the strap iron , on which the cars ran , have loosened and the rails have one end high in the air . A few cows with their mournful tinkling bells and two or three boys , fishing from the bridge by which the tramway crossed to the mainland , are the only inhabitants of this place , which was once so busy . It may chance that , instead of heeding the captain 's whistle , warning us that the " City of Midland " is about to start again on her voyage , we feel the fascination of the wild and new country  | and determine to tarry at Little Current for a day or two . If we so decide , we shall do well , for Manitoulin Island is well worth study and nowhere can it be observed better than at this place , its chief settlement . If we stay , we will climb the hill again and again to see the fine summer sunsets across the Channel and behind the hills of the North Shore . The bright hues linger long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the romantic country . We wander along the commons , past the long houses , whose windows , battened with wooden shutters , are silent witnesses to the past activity of the town . Little Current has a past . It is so young a country , that the man from whom we hire our horse and carriage , when we drive inland , is the first white child born on the island , yet it is so old that it can speak of past and vanished prosperity . In its hey-day , there were five saw mills at Little Current , beneath whose remorseless teeth the logs were speedily turned into boards . The town was full of life then . In expectation of growth , they built a large school house on the edge of the woods , the very last house in the place . The children complain of the bleak walk to school in the winter . Churches were quickly put up : Presbyterian , Methodist , Church of England , and Roman Catholic . The Baptists never gained strength enough to build , but met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Music Hall , which is adorned by two gigantic moose heads and is frequented by secular dancers on the week day evenings . Then came the collapse of the boom . The geese that laid the golden eggs were being killed . The best timber was vanishing before the greedy teeth of the mill saws , when the Dingley bill was passed with its two-dollar duty on lumber and by that the ruin was made complete . Of the five saw mills , three have been burnt and were not rebuilt . Only one is running and that is a small one on the mainland . When we cross from Mill Island to Picnic Island on the floating bridge , picking our way with care , lest the section on which we stand should have its floor submerged by some sudden motion , and when we finally come to the chain which holds the last section to the land , we are in a scene of desolation . It is more impressive in its loneliness than many an ancient ruin , because it speaks so plainly of the recent presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber yard , with piles of boards towering on either side , and notice how each pile is marked with number and size of boards , so as to be ready for instant use , yet notice too how the spider webs are everywhere . The strap iron rails are rusty from disuse . The quiet of the place is deathly . Turn from one lane into another and into yet a third and still the same quiet , broken only by your own footfall , or the monotonous soughing of the water on the edges of the piers , as if it moaned that industry was dead . The great mill , with its lozenge shaped windows , stands idle and the tall conical smokestack no longer consumes the sawdust falling from the logs . In the town of eight hundred people , the little churches are scarcely half filled on a Sunday . The place is over-churched , no doubt , but what would you ? Which is to give up its work in favor of the others ? Little Current has not only a past but a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graze on the commons in the woods are sent down to settlements of Canada to feed the people there . The grazing industry is sure to increase . At the wharves of the town , tugs are moored every day , preparing to take booms of logs to some mill , or returning from such a trip . We may saunter there in time to see the " Sweepstakes " come in . " She 's the finest boat on the North Channel and lit with electric lights . She cost forty thousand dollars , " volunteers one of the loiterers . So grand is she that she seems too good for the humble office of towing booms of logs . Dail- too , come the steamers , bringing a contact with the outer world and daily come the fishing tugs , bearing to Picnic Island the spoils of the nets . We shall do well to cross to Picnic Island a little before noon , when these boats come in . While the men are buying butter , crackers , and other supplies from the store on the wharf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cargo is . It is a fine sight : the beautiful lake whitefish , the sparkling trout , the graceful pickerel , and sometimes the lordly sturgeon and muscalonge . Packed in cars between layers of cracked ice and with sawdust covering the whole mass , they will be taken on board the steamer to-night and will feed the people of Buffalo , Cleveland , or Toronto . All is not work in Little Current 's present . When we have climbed the hill on the east of the town , have passed the pretty house the mayor has built , and have left the universal board  | sidewalk , we wade through a sandy strip and come to a large enclosure with a new board fence . It is the race track only recently opened and the scene of speedy driving , for there are fast horses on Manitoulin . Little Current has not only a past and a present , but she also hopes for a future . When we sit in front of the Mansion House and chat with the old landlord about the uprising of 1837 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tory and settled on the Canadian lands , we look across , past the lighthouses , and on a stretch of water scarcely more than quarter of a mile broad . Beyond this is Goat Island and beyond that , one island after another , with small channels of water between them , until the North Shore is reached . It is to Little Current that the railroad must come , if it ever crosses to Manitoulin Island . That it will come , the Little Currentians firmly believe . Was not a charter once gotten for it ? Has not the Dominion government promised a subsidy at some time in the near future ? Can not the twentyfour miles of track needed be constructed at small cost ? All three questions they answer affirmatively , and the more sanguine spirits talk of branches east to Manitowaning and west to Gore Bay , or even to distant Meldrum Bay at some time in the future . Manitoulin Island is cut off from the rest of the world in winter . It is true that the cable crosses the strait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can obtain news for its weekly issue , but passage for persons or goods is difficult or impossible . For about a month before the ice hardens and while it is breaking up , no one travels much , save the mail carrier , who gets across with his dog sled when he can . At every landing of the steamboat , we see the large strong dogs which draw these sleds in winter . When the ice is heavy , the stage is sent forth , covered with painted canvas and adorned within with advertisements of the hotels and business houses , " just like a city omnibus , " as the enthusiastic citizen said who showed it to us . This vehicle on runners makes the trip in three or four hours , but it is a bleak journey , with the thermometer far below zero outside and the wind blowing wild and fierce . The little kerosene stove in the stage can not make the passengers comfortable . Some day the steam cars will carry visitors to Manitoulin , but now it is best visited by steamboat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordial informality of frontiersmen . They do not stand on ceremony , nor ask for formal introductions , but are affable to strangers and anxious that all should enjoy their stay on Manitoulin . The kind hospitality that was shown me there I can not avoid mentioning and must not more than mention . We must not , however , spend all our time in the village . There are famous fishing grounds near at hand , to which a sail boat can soon bear us and where we can have rare sport . Or , if we prefer the land , we may stroll over the hill to the east of the town , where the boys play baseball on the rocky common , in which the shale continually presses to the surface . After we have left the houses , we reach a great pasture , on which large numbers of cattle graze . The existence of former forest fires is attested by the charred fence , which blackens our hands as we climb over it . Beyond it is another pasture in which a number of colts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wood . Passing through this , we are on the shore of a hay . The town is behind the point to the west , ahead is the Strawberry Island light . The pebbly beach is a fine place on which to fling oneself on a warm afternoon and to watch the reeds bend in the breeze and the boats come along the Channel . If we are bent on wider adventures , let us hire a horse and carriage and visit the Indians on the Sucker Creek reservation . We take the shaded and pleasant school house road and pass the deserted grange hall and the rude and unkempt cemetery . Then we climb the hill and look afar over the land . There is even a better view from the mountain further inland , on the road to the great Manitou Lake , which hides its secrets in the center of the island , but this view is far extending . The country is rough , the tree stumps still stand in the clearings and patches of virgin forest are found here and there . Wheat and oats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden may be seen around some farmer 's house . The dwellings are not attractive . They are generally of frame , though some of the ruder ones , especially those of the Indians , are the log cabins chinked with mud , which are so common in the Southern states . The houses are often unpainted , even in the towns . The uncertainty of the future and the fact that it is probably cheaper to rebuild than to  | paint have caused this , which takes away much from the attractiveness of the habitations . The road winds and we descend some steep slopes , until at one of the turns we see a few rude cabins , some small patches of cultivated land , a number of gaunt razor-backed hogs , many wild and ill-fed dogs , and some stolid dark-skinned men , and we know that we have reached the Indian village . A hopeless kind of place , I grant you , but from one of those cabins have gone out a Church of England clergyman in the far Northwest , and a young woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the culture of the white race . The Indians ' future is not a hopeless one after all . The best trip for us with our horse and carriage is the drive to Sheguiandah . There is not much to attract us in the place itself , but the views along the road are fine . The village has a few houses , two stores , and a Methodist church , where the clergyman preaches on Sunday afternoons . He has already driven fourteen miles from Little Current , where he lives , to Green Bay for the morning service and has returned half the distance for a second sermon . After the afternoon meeting , he must drive back to Little Current and preach there in the evening . Service in these parts of the world is required for a few years of all young Canadian preachers , as a kind of missionary work . " Is it not very tiring , " we venture to ask his wife . " Yes , but you must remember some ministers have four appointments and George only has to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each place . " Let us take the lower road to Sheguiandah . The road has its name from its nearness to the water , not from its slight elevation . We pass the race track and see beyond it the fields and the range of hills which forms the backbone of the island . To our left stretches the North Channel , with its numerous bays and wooded islands . There is a width of view and the clear air seems to carry our gaze far beyond the usual distance . The road is good and passes in some places over such slight depth of earth that we are almost driving on the solid rock . Here we are among plowed fields , there we turn and pass between the crowded trunks of trees , we climb a steep ascent , and before us spread the waters of the bay . About a mile before we reach Sheguiandah , we come  | to a hill so steep that the horse can scarcely ascend or descend it , but we make the downward trip in safety , we see the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we are greeted by the barking of village dogs . If we cross the bridge we see the harbor , where the steamboats come no more because the water has grown so shallow . Everything must be brought by wagon or sail boat from Little Current and the lengthening shadows admonish us to return thither .
