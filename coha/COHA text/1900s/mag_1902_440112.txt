MR . JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL seenpied a unique position in the history of American literature . In the first place , he was a poet of a high order . At the age of twenty-two he published a volume of poetry , and from that time his gift was recognized : he was spoken of as the coming American poet . Although the promise of his youth was never quite fulfilled , his poetry alone would entitle him to distinction and remembrance . He is not so widely react nor so popular as Longfellow and Whittier ; there is too much metaphysical subtlety , and often difficult and remote allusion , in his poetry ; yet by the few be is cherished as having clone some exquisite things . But as he did not give himself exclusively to poetry , we are not called upon to speculate on the possibilities wrapped up in his imaginative art . He devoted himself to other lines of intellectual activity , and , as his biographer n intimates , his critical powers were developed at the expense of his poetry . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position for nearly twenty years ; lecturing on Dante and on German and Spanish literature , and acquiring intim ence and repute as a teacher and philosophical critic . And still further , from his youth he was interested in political issues , taking in prominent part in the anti-slavery movement , He never became a professional reformer , as did many of his contemporaries , and he was never quite identified with the abolitionist party , but yet was regarded as a most valuable ally . He continued to follow the course of politics , and with intenser interest , in the years immediately preceding the Civil War ; in his capacity as editor successively of the Atlantic Monthly and the North American Review , he wrote numerous articles by which be exerted a deep and far-reaching influence , especially on the more thoughtful minds . fn the third stage of his career he appears as a statesman , sent as American minister first to Spain , and then to England , where his reputation and popularity reached the fullest measure . He rose to be one of the foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands , and receiving at home and abroad honorable recognition , such as comes but rarely and to the few . When his term of service as minister to England expired , the English people would gladly have retained him in some other capacity ; and had he been willing to accept it , he would have been elected to a professorship of literature in Oxford University . He returned to America to enjoy the few remaining years of his life . In 1891 he died , at the age of seventy-two . As we muse over this record of a life , Lowell appears not only as the poet , the man of letters , and the minister of the state , but as having fulfilled in his age something of the role which Petrarch played in the time of the early Renaissance , or Erasmus in the sixteenth century . His high character as a Man , his capacity for affairs , his entire devotion to ideal ends , ? these quail-ties , combining with his endowment of imagination and his acquirements as a scholar , placed him upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life deserved a careful and an ample record ; there was called for in the biographer a rare union of gifts in order to do justice to so rich and complex a career . No one who reads the life of Lowell , by Mr. Horace Scudder , can rise from its perusal without a profound sense of gratitude that it was given to him to write this biography . He has wrought out his task with painstaking and conscientious fidelity , bringing to it qualifications which no one else possesses in equal degree . Tenderness and reverence , delicacy and restraint , are everywhere apparent . There is criticism and comment , but always subordinate to telling the story of a life . The hand of the accomplished literary artist is manifest in the disposition of the material . But especially valuable to the reader is the insight which serves for the interpretation of Lowell 's work . Incidentally , also , the book becomes a history of American literature in the latter half of the nineteenth century . To do justice to this biography in a brief review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few comments are offered , which are suggested by some of the more striking aspects of Lowell 's life as Mr. Scudder has described them . And in the first place , we are impressed with a certain vagueness of purpose running through all the years , a tone of dissatisfaction with himself and with his work , as though Lowell did not feel that he had ever quite found or completely realized his mission to the world . The history of the first stage of his life , from the time he left Harvard College in 1838 till his appointment to the chair of literature in 1853 , is like that of many young men , with a consciousness of undeveloped power , blindly feeling their way in search of the motive or the opportunity of self-expression . What to say , how and where to say it , in order to the fulfillment of the moral obligation which life by its very law imposes ,  - -  that was Lowell 's problem . The inference would seem to be that to know definitely , without shadow of misgiving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how it is to be performed , is not always , at least , essential to the highest success . Lowell is one of many illustrations of this groping after a vocation , to which one may know he is called without knowing what the vocation is . In these cases a fascination attaches to the seeking and the groping , no longer felt so keenly when the vocation has been found . St. Francis of Assisi and Ignatius Loyola are more interesting as we watch them in their uncertainty , eager to pour their lives into some new mould , unwilling to follow tamely in the steps of their prede- cessors , and yet forced at last to accommodate themselves to the world 's order , to combine somehow the new impulse with past achievement . John Henry Newman , on his way back to England , burning with intense purpose to do something , he knew not what , is more thrilling than the record of what he achieved . It was so with Lowell for many years . There were tentative efforts , in all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was evident that , consciously or unconsciously , he had devoted his life to the promotion of American literature , helping to win for it natura &; expression imq also native independence , in contrast with the imitativeness and the servile sensitiveness to foreign criticism which had marked its previous history . Mr. Scudder has not failed to point out some of the defects in Lowell 's attitude and in his mental make-up in the earlier years . There were traces of crudeness and of flippancy , an apparent effort always to be saying new or smart things , an air of jauntiness and of forced jocularity , as though these were essential features of the literary attitude . To some extent , it appeared in Lowell as a sort of intoxication with life , exuberant , and tumultuous . Perhaps it was likewise a reminiscence of what may be called the Knickerbocker phase in our history , when affectation became almost natural , and to give humorous expression to life was the aim of every literary aspirant . But in Low-ell 's case the wit , the humor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the springs of life , yielding fruit as in the Fable for Critics , and finally , in its perfected form , the Biglow Papers . Here also deep moral purpose underlay the humor . It is an interesting incident , which Mr. Scudder records , that Lowell 's second wife could not endure the Biglow Papers . She was not without a sense of humor , but she told Mr. Stillman that she thought this line of expression was unworthy of her husband 's genius . Humorobs satire often verges on irreverence , and we get a glimpse of this in Lowell 's youth , in his criticise ; on Daniel Webster . The criticism , of course , was anonymous , appearing in the Standard , an anti-slavery newspaper ; but it hardly seems quite right for so young a man to be taking the venerable statesman to task for his sup . posed deficiencies , even to be twitting him with his defeat and sore disappointment . Here are a few of Lowell 's sentences : ? " What will Mr. Webster do ? ' asks Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of any age ! ' adds Jones triumphantly . Meanwhile the greatest man of any age is sulking at Marshfield . It has had its rattle taken away from it . It has been told that nominations were not good for it . It has not been allowed to climb up the back of the presidential chair . . . . We would not be understood as detracting in the least from Mr. Webster 's reputation as a man of great power . He has hitherto given evidence of a great force rather than of a great intellect . But it is a force working without results , It is like a steam engine which is connected by no band with the machinery which it ought to turn . A great intellect leaves behind it something more than a great reputation . The earth is in sonic way the better for its having taken flesh upon itself . We can not find that Mr. Webster has communicated an impulse to any of the great ideas which it is the destiny of the nineteenth century to incarnate in action . His energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? dry bones into which the touch of no prophet could send life . " But Lowell , it may be said by way of apology , was for the moment in a somewhat exceptional mood , unable to recognize the great principle for which Webster stood , ? the cause of national unity , endangered alike by Southern devotees and Northern abolitionists . The Lowell of later years was a differ- // ant man from the young Lowell who WILS anonymously assaulting the great statesman . At the age of twenty-one Lowell had become engaged to Miss Maria White , of Watertown , near Cambridge , a young lady of beautiful appearance and possessing marked intellectual and spiritual gifts . She was also of a transcendental tendency , of which Emerson was then the spokesman ; but she was practical withal , and her influence upon Lowell was profound . She interested him in reforms , especially in the antislavery movement , to simh , an extent that he was almost ready to identify himself with it , and in danger of snaking his poetry " a handmaid to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he could not silence , and in the final outcome lie refused to go to the full extent of the abolitionist dream . Thus he saved his art from degradation , while yet also he helped the cause of anti-slavery by his poetry as well as by his prose . During the period of his engagement to Miss White , which lasted for five years , Lowell seems to have been living in exalted , ecstatic mood , writing much poetry to be compared with that of Petrarch as giving the language of love . No one can understand Lowell who does not dwell on this episode in his life , fully described by Mr. Scudder : " Maria White and her brother belonged to a group of young people on most friendly terms with one another , and known offhand by themselves as the Band . They lived in various places , Boston , Cambridge , Watertown , Salem , and were constantly seeking occasions for familiar intercourse . . . . To this coterie Lowell was now introduced , and the relations between bins and Miss White made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirituelle beauty and poetic temperament and Lowell 's spontaneity of wit and sentiment were heightened in the eyes of these young people by the attachment between them , and they were known with affectionate jesting as the Queen and King of the Band . In the exalted air upon which the two trod , stimulating each other , their devotion came to have , by a paradox , an almost impersonal character , as if they were creatures of romance ; their life was led thus in the open .. . . The letters exchanged by them were passed about also among the other young people of the circle . . . The two young poets ? for Maria White was not only of poetic temperament , but wrote verses , sonic of which found place in current magazines --  were lifted upon a platform by their associates , and were themselves so open in their consciousness of poetic thinking and acting that they took little pains to abscond from this friendly publicity . It is a curious instance of freedom from shamefacedness in so native a New Englander as Lowell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all testify to an ingenuousness of sentiment at this time , which was a radical trait and less conspicuous later in life only because , like other men , Ise became subject to convention . " Lowell was married in 1844 , and event for a while to Philadelphia , managing to support himself and his wife by Isis writings , although , it must be admitted , in a somewhat meagre way . He soon returned to Cambridge , where Isis father and mother were living , taking up his residence with them at Ehnwood ; writing articles for various newspapers and magazines with forgotten names , for which he received slight compensation , and sometimes none at all . One is struck with the amount of his literary productiveness , and with his ingenuity in the suggestion of schemes of works , or plans for articles and books . It was , or seems , a desultory process , but he thought he detected beneath it all a unity of purpose . Thus he proposed to classify his poetry into four divisions 1 , Love ; 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of Isis projects , with a complete summary of his accomplished work , have been carefully collated by 258 Hr .

It also appears that poverty or a straitened income was the experience of Lowell for many years , and , indeed , with one brief period of release , was the normal tenor of his life . There came a small legacy from his wife 's father , and this , together with money received from the sale of his ancestral acres , enabled him to spend the year 1851-52 in Europe , with his family . Hardly had they returned when the health of his wife gave way , and she died in 1853 . Of four children who had been born to him but one survived , so that he was left alone with a little girl as the only salvage from the wreck of Isis life . Yet this bereavement , as Mr. Scudder has remarked , proved an end and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tine when he entered upon his Harvard professorship in 1856 , though attended with the bitter regret that his wife eould not share in the enrichment it brought . In preparation for his teaching he spent another year in Europe , mostly in Germany , for the purpose of acquiring Use language . In 1857 he married Miss Frances Dunlap . He had only begun Isis work in the college when he accepted an invitation to become the editor of the Atlantic Monthly . Mr. Scudder has enumerated the successive efforts to establish some kind of monthly magazine as a vehicle for the best literature , in many of which schemes Lowell was interested to the extent of sending contributions ; once even making himself financially responsible , ? of course to his loss . These literary journals , with queer names , and with no financial support pledged in advance , were short-lived ; sending out two or three interesting numbers , and then passing out of existence . With the Atlantic Monthly , however , a journal was projected destined to live and to exert a wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped his impress so powerfully that , after nearly fifty years , it still perpetuates his spirit . But it may be questioned whether his assumption of the duties of an editor helped Lowell to greater efficienev in his college work . He was indeed an inspiring teacher , as is evidenced by the testimony of his pupils . The routine of Isis position , however , was irksome . He took little interest in faculty meetings , nor could he bring himself to perform certain functions of Isis office ? such as conducting examinations or assigning to pupils their rank ? without feeling a degradation of himself or of the subject he was teaching . Thus a story is told of him that , on one occasion , a student asked for the mark assigned to some thesis he had written . Lowell , in reply , after inquiring what grade was expected , offered to give it rather than undergo the drudgery of reading the paper . That his vocation in life was not that of a college teacher is shown in other ways . Not only did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , but he also exhibited a serious defect in that he did not apparently individualize his pupils , treating them rather as opportunities for self-expression . He stimulated powerfully a few who were anxious to learn , by informal conversations in the classroom or at his home , when he poured himself forth in generous freedom , exerting the spell of a wonderful fascination . And yet one of those students , Mr. Barrett Wendell , who was also an enthusiastic admirer , found that Lowell did not remember him in after years . The influence of his professional work on Lowell himself was marked and important ; for it led him out of the provincial sphere of American literature with which he had been preoccupied , , as in his Fable for Critics , into the study of the masterpieces of human thought . He had made his first beginning in this larger field when , still a youth , he had turned to the English without permission . 260 111r . Scudder 's Life of Lowell. upon American society at large , and with a special force upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the circulating waves of the invisible ether , known to exist by the manifestation of their results in American life . One of these is Puritanism , and the other is the French Revolution . The first asserted the grandeur and the urgency of moral ideals even to the extent of resisting , and , if necessary , overthrowing every power , however strongly enthroned , which stands in the way of moral advance . That spirit or tendency has passed into American life as one of its chief constituents . Lowell was inspired by it when he wrote his poem Prometheus , or again the lines which he puts into the mouth of Cromwell : The other influence , proceeding from France , is closely akin to Puritanism , and yet differs from it widely . Its ideal is human freedom in terms of human brotherhood and equality . How profoundly Lowell yielded to this mood is apparent in his early poetry , especially in the anti-slavery poems , where his utterance is inspired by a concrete motive and a tangible appeal . To the principles of the Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who became tine precursors of the French Revolution , Lowell , at least in his earlier years , gave an unqualified approval . Thus he spoke of Jefferson , who was saturated with French ideas , as the " first American . " When again in 1848 another revolution broke out in France , Lowell was stirred by his glowing enthusiasm into writing an Ode to France , together with an article in which he exultingly celebrates the triumph of the idea of the people . These two influences have contributed more powerfully than any other to make America what she is ; they form the qualities in which Lowell gloried as distinctively American . They are dis . tinctive , for no other country has felt them both or in like degree . England , for example ; never accepted the Puritan movement to the same extent ; indeed , it would be nearer the truth to say that she rejected it , banishing it beyond the seas or breaking its backbone at home , so that it ceased to exert a controlling influence . Nor did England receive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Burke 's protest was the typical English attitude . France , on the other hand , never gained the moral force of the Puritan movement , and the aspiration for liberty , fraternity , and equaliity suffered from its absence . But it is not necessary to test the nations of Europe by this American standard , in order to demonstrate the existence of distinctive American characteristics ; nor should we be justified in having introduced the subject here , were it not so prominent in the thought and experience of Lowell . While the Civil War was in process , he spoke of it as being waged for the " Americanization of all Americans ; " that is , their more thorough fusion into a nationality by the operation of distinctive American forces . It was because Lincoln seemed to embody these truths in his personality as no one had done before to the same extent that Lowell proclaimed him the greatest American . It should be added , however , that Lowell was far from being a mere visionary or theorist in these matters . He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , like that of anti-slavery , to such an extreme as to endanger the nationality . The anti-slavery men could never be made to see that nationality was a higher // cause than their own . Hence their treatment of Daniel Webster , as in Whittier 's poem entitled Ichabod . If Lowell were tempted for a moment , as we have seen , into a similar mood , he soon escaped from it . Thus lie writes in 1818 : " I do not agree with the abolitionists in their disunion and nonvoting theories . They treat ideas as ignorant persons do cherries . They think them unwholesome unless they are swallowed stones and all . " And again , he speaks of Reform as though he had entirely measured it as an ideal of living and found it impossible : " I find that Reform can not take up the whole of me , and I am quite sure that eyes were given us to look about us with sometimes , and not to be always looking forward . If some of my good , red-hot friends were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there are other directions in winch one may get away from people besides the rearward one . " Lowell 's enthusiasm for freedom and human brotherhood , but combined in organic fusion with his devotion to the cause of national unity , culminated in the Civil War . It was a proud moment in his life , as marking the fulfillment of his hopes , when he read his memorable Ode at the Harvard Commemoration in 1865 . In that poem he reached the high-water mark of his poetic power and inspiration , and it is interesting to read what Mr. Scudder has told us of its composition , ? that it was written at white-heat , the night before its delivery . To those who were looking forward , as was Lowell , to a period of moral advance and national honor , after the nation should have vindicated its unity and wiped away the stain of human slavery , ? to such as those the revelation of corruption in the high offices of the state , in the years immediately following the Civil War , brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So deep was the sense of degradation as to make one blush to own that he was an American citizen . No one felt more keenly than Lowell the disgrace which had befallen the state , nor did any one express more vividly the sense of the common shame . lie was now satirizing the Republican party , as previously he had directed his satire against their opponents . When efforts to reform the Republican party , where corruption was intrenched in high places , proved hopeless , Lowell joined the hand of imthpendents , ? " Mugwumps " they were called , ? and became one of their leaders , presiding at their meetings and making speeches in behalf of civil service reform . To las prominence as an independent politician Lowell may have owed in part his promotion ? if so it may be considered ? from private life to public office . In Massachusetts , where the independent voters were most numerous , he was chosen in 1876 as a presidential elector , in which capacity he cast his vote for Mr. Hayes . Many will recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for a moment thrilled the country with its awful possibilities , that he should fall back upon the original conception of the function of an elector , in the exercise of his freedom east his vote for Tilden , and thus save the state from the threatening peril . It was the choice between personal honor and the salvation of the state from anarchy . If that were the issue , it contained the elements of tragedy . The appointment of Lowell as American minister to England gave almost universal satisfaction , the only exception being certain discredited politicians who distrusted the appearance of the literary man in politics . In England , also , it was a welcome appointment ; for Lowell was known and appreciated by his writings , and bad been honored with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge . Among the incidents of the time spent in England Lowell 's speeches are prominent , remembered for their grace and felicity , ? the speech at Binning- ham on Democracy , or in honor of Longfellow when his memorial was placed at Westminster , or again in memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after long years of unmerited neglect . While Lowell was our minister , what was known as the " Irish Question " was embarrassing the English government . There were possibilities of complication with America , which were treated by Lowell with practical wisdom in the interest of peace between the two nations . But Lowell 's course none the less drew down on lain the suspicion and the charge of sympathizing with the English against the Dish , and of pursuing an un-American policy . Some color for the suspicion may have been found hi his popularity with the English people , but in anything said or done by him there was no ground for accusation . He performed the duties of his office as any other incumbent would have done , whatever his political sympathies or affiliations . Yet a change had passed . over Low-ell in the latter part of his life , so that his attitude was not quite the same toward political issues , and in las mode of expression the difference was marked . Not that lie bad lost his faith in those elemental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future of America . This point has biographer has made clear . But he had no longer the same confidence in political parties as agencies for carrying on the government , nor did he clearly see the way by which existing evils were to be abolished . He could not have written now the enthusiastic poems of his youth , nor the political papers where roman brotherhood hovers in the air , as if almost ready for materialization . He was no longer under any illusions in regard to America , though still retaining his faith in democracy , The truth was , he had not recovered from the some experience which had destroyed his faith in the Republican party . He had found , when in Europe , that the case of America was being urged as the best argument against republican forms of government . From this abomination of desolation , with its frauds and defalcations , he saw no method of escape . In Iris own community in Massachusetts the men who were opposed to the removal of abuses were most in evidence : Butler running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil service re . form , and Banks returned to Congress by a large majority . And yet he writes : " These fellows have no notion what love of country means . It is in my very blood and bones . I am no pessimist , nor ever was . . . . What fills ore with doubt and dismay is the degradation of the moral tone . Is it or is it not a result of democracy ? Is ours a government of the people , by the people , for the people , or a kakistocracy rather , for the benefit of knaves at the cost of fools ? Democracy is , after all , nothing more than an experiment like another , and I know only one way of judging it , ? by its results . Democracy in itself is no more sacred than monarchy . It is Man who is sacred ; it is his duties and opportunities , not his rights , that nowadays need reinforcement . " From this mood of moral revulsion , deep and intense as had been the previous mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover , nor did Ise live to see the Republican party rise from its degradation under the influence of new motives and opportunities . The corruption had been but temporary and superficial , ? the reaction , it may have been , after a period of prolonged tension , when for the moment the way of the state led through paths of dullness and monotony . However it may have been , Lowell did not live to discern the change which would bring moral purification . In his address The Place of the Independent in Politics , he falls back on the doctrine of the remnant as the only hope of the country , ? a doctrine quite the opposite of // the democratic creed , that the opinion of the many is the ground of faith . He saw the dangers from the immigration of ignorant foreigners ; he groaned over the degradation of the civil service ; he had lost faith in political parties . If the attempt to reform these parties from without should fail , then " the failure , " as he writes , " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notable utterance from an essay on Democracy , written in his last years : " No ideal of democracy is to substitute the interest of the many for that of the few as the test of what is wise in polity and administration , and the opinion of the many for that of the few as the rule of conduct in public affairs . That the interest of the many is the object of whatever social organization man has hitherto been able to effect seems unquestionable ; whether their opinions are so safe a guide as the opinions of the few , and whether it will ever be possible , or wise if possible , to substitute the one for the other in the hegemony of the world , is a question still open for debate . " In the same essay he asserts the authority of the state as the supremely if nportant thing , and deprecates the principle of natural rights : " The claim to any selfish hereditary privilege because you are born a man is as absurd as the same claim because you are born a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural right , and that is the right of superior force . " There is one sentence toward the close of his address on Democracy which deserves to be quoted , for it is significant as connecting the stages of Lowell 's life in continuous and natural piety : " Our healing is not in the storm or in the whirlwind , it is not in monarchies or aristocracies or democracies , but will be revealed by the still small voice that speaks to the conscience and the heart , prompting us to a wider and a wiser humanity . " It is in the word " humanity " that we have the clue to Lowell 's life and to his development , to any changes of opinion he may have undergone . Gradually and more and more he was emancipating himself from theories , from crude experiments , because he errs reverting to deep and enduring human ways and convictions , Whatever humanity as a whole had loved or had lived and labored for ; whatever was essentially human , the necessary outcome of the spirit in man , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to be noted of Lowell 's intellectual history that he passed through life almost wholly unaffected by the scientific influence which was revolutionizing his age . It does not appear that he had given his allegiance to the doctrines of natural selection , the survival of the fittest , and heredity . He remarks on them that if they should be accepted they must profoundly modify the thought and action of men . Mr. Scudder has called attention to Lowell 's " aversion " to the speculations of science : " he had but a bowing acquaintance with the investigations of Darwin and Huxley ; " he was " impatient of the encroachments of science on the formation of intellectual beliefs . " In his famous address on the occasion of Harvard 's two hundred and fiftieth anniversary , when he was listened to eagerly by the large audience , he contended earnestly for the humanities as the chief interest of a university . His objection to the elective system was its appearance of making a departure " from the unbroken experience and practice of mankind . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude on the subject of religion . Here again he seems to have resented the encroachments of science , which in the interest of a theory was condemning as superstitious those deeper impulses of the human soul , demonstrated to he essentially human by their existence in every age and land . Thus , in his great poem The Cathedral , he defends the religious doctrine of a divine Providence , and the doctrine also of the creation of the world and of man by
