txt Senator Platt was interviewed at Manhattan Beach last night and while he would not express a preference for the Governorship , he said : " So far there seems to be no situation and the field is open to every one . Congressman Payne and Lieut . Gov . Woodruff seem to be the most prominent candidates talked about at present , but we have not given up all idea of Mr. Odell being nominated for Governor , although Mr. Odell has determined not to be a candidate , and his determination is well known to all leaders of the party throughout the.State . The convention when it meets may demand Mr. Odell 's nomination and force him to accept . There seems to be a strong eentiment in the organization for Mr. Odell . " Have you any preferences among the candidates ? " Mr. Platt was asked . EXPRESSES NO PREFERENCE . I have not expressed any yet , " said the Senator . " Do you expect to dictate the nomina-tion ? " " I do not , " said Senator Platt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican constituencies will nominate the man they think best . They will decide who it is that is the proper candidate for the head of the State ticket . ' Various candidates have been mentioned for the nomination . Gov . Roosevelt has suggested ex-Judge Charles Andrews of the Court of Appeals . Gov . Roosevelt and his friends have been suggesting a number of candidates . " I think the convention will nominate as its candidate a man who has been active in the Republican organization , a man who has served his party within the organization . I do n't think that because a man has been active in the party and has worked for its success , that that fact should be a bar to seeking political preferment or high office . SAYS HE MIGHT " KICK . " " I am opposed to the nomination of a man who considers himself better than the party . I might kick against the nomination of a man for the office of Governor who is not recognized as an organization man . " " Who will be the Republican nominee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. S. Gibbs , yesterday . " I do n't know , but I might make a guess , " he answered . " What would be your guess ? " " Odell , " was his reply . " I know he says he does not want it , and I believe he is sincere in his statement , but every one wham I have seen who has anything to do with making candidates wants Odell nominated . That remark is true as applied to all parts of the State . I should not be surprised if the convention insisted - on nominating him . " Nevertheless , Mr. Odell persists in his declaration that he will not be the nominee , and some of his closest friends have within the last forty-eight hours changed their minds and really believe that some other than Mr. Odell will be named . MR WOODRUFF 'S POSITION . Lieut . Gov . Timothy L. Woodruff was a caller at State headquarters yesterday , and had a long talk with Chairman Odell . " Are you a candidate for Governor ? " a TIMES reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " Are you in a receptive mood ? That seems to be a popular question just now . " " We will not talk about that , " he said . " What about Walter B. Atterbury 's ? statement that the Kings County delegation will be for you first , last , and all the time ? " " I suppose the Kings County delegates would be for me if I was a candidate , but I am not I shall not lift a finger to get the nomination . I know that Dady , Atterbury , and others of my friends have been urging my name , but I shall do nothing myself , nor will I permit my friends to make a canvass in my behalf " " Would you accept the nomination if it were tendered to you ? " " How could any man refuse it ? " he rejoined . " Well , with you it will have to be a case of the office seeking the man ? " " Yes , " was his answer " How about the squabbles over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily The political condition there is as smooth as the surface of a mill pond on which oil has been poured . There is not a ripple of discontent . Jacob Worth will be nominated for Congress , and Senator D. F. Davis will be renominated. 1 hope that Abram C. De Grays ' who is one of my warmest friends , will be renominated for the Assembly . " At State headquarters there was a good deal of talk about Congressman Sereno E. Payne in connection with the Gubernatorial nomination . Mr. Payne , as has been stated , is in Europe . and is not expected in New York until after the meeting of the convention at Saratoga. on Sept. 4 . His nomination . it is believed . would be acceptable to all shades of Republicans . GOVERNOR 'S FRIENDS ' CHOICE . Another Gubernatorial candidate appeared on the political horizon yesterday afternoon He is Col. William Cary Sanger of Sangerfield , Oneida County , and it is said that friends of Gov . Roosevelt are responsible for the use of his name . Col. Sanger is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention on Thursday without his consent . He served lour terms in the Assembly . Gov . Roosevelt was inclined to appoint him Adjutant General . bet Col. Sanger did not want the place . In political circles it is openly intimated that Col. Sanger 's candidacy would not receive the approval of Senator Platt . Outside of Odell , Woodruff , and Payne . however , the only persons seriously consid ered as possible nominees for the Governor ship are S. Fred Neeon . Speaker of the As sembly , and Justice William E. Werner of the Supreme Court . Each of these has many friends .
