 | A TOTAL eclipse of the sun is one of the most impressive sights that nature offers to the eye of man . Such a sight will be witnessed by dwellers along a certain line in Louisiana , Mississippi , Georgia , and the Carolinas on the 28th of May . To see it to the best advantage , one should be in an elevated position commanding the largest possible view of the surrounding country , especially in the direction from which the shadow of the moon is to come . The first indication of anything unusual is to be seen , not on the earth or in the air , but on the disk of the sun . At the predicted moment , a little notch will be seen to form somewhere on the western edge of the sun 's outline . It increases minute by minute , gradually eating away as it were the visible sun . No wonder that imperfectly civilized people , when they saw the great luminary thus diminishing in size , fancied that a dragon was devouring its substance . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the continued progress of the advancing moon . It will be interesting if , during this time , the observer is in the neighborhood of a tree that will permit the sun 's rays to reach the ground through the small openings in its foliage . The little images of the sun which form here and there on the ground will then have the form of the partially eclipsed sun . Soon the latter appears as the new moon , only instead of increasing , the crescent form grows thinner minute by minute . Even then , so well has the eye accommodated itself to the diminishing light , there may be little noticeable darkness until the crescent has grown very thin . If the observer has a telescope with a dark glass for viewing the sun , he will now have an excellent opportunity of seeing the mountains on the moon . The unbroken limb of the sun will keep its usual soft and uniform outline . But the inside of the crescent , the edge of which is formed by the surface of the moon , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last vestige of the sun is to disappear , the growing darkness will become very noticeable . It is a curious fact that the darkness does not seem to come on uniformly , but like a series of shadows , following each other at intervals of a few seconds . The cause of these seeming shadows has been the subject of some discussion ; but there is reason to believe that they are an optical illusion , caused by the unequal rate at which the eye accommodates itself to the diminution of light . A short time before the fading crescent is to disappear , the observer should look toward the point from which the shadow is to come ? commonly not far from the west , say between southwest and northwest . If the air is quite clear , the shadow will first be seen on the distant horizon , advancing at the rate of a mile in every two , three , or four seconds , according to circumstances . The nearer the time is to noon , the slower will  | be the advance , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the spectator will be enveloped in it . The advancing mountains on the rugged surface of the moon have reached the sun 's edge , and nothing is seen of the latter except a row of broken fragments or points of light , shining between the hollows on the lunar surface . They last but a second or two before they vanish . Now is seen the glory of the spectacle . The sky is clear and the sun in mid-heaven , and yet no sun is visible . Where the latter ought to be , the densely black globe of the moon hangs , as it were , in mid-air . It is surrounded by an effulgence radiating a saintly glory . This is now known as the " corona . " Though bright enough to the unaided vision , it is seen to the best advantage with a telescope of very low magnifying power . Even a common opera glass may suffice . With a telescope of high power only a portion of the corona is visible , and thus the finest part of the effect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , is better , so far as the splendor of the effect is concerned , than the largest telescope . Such an instrument will show , not only the corona itself , but the so-called " prominences " ? fantastic cloud-like forms of rosy color rising here and there , seemingly from the dark body of the moon . The darkness during the height of an eclipse is not so great as it is sometimes supposed to be . The sun still illuminates the atmosphere outside the region of the shadow , casting into the whole dark interior a " disastrous twilight , " as Milton calls it , strong enough to enable the astronomer to read the time by his chronometer without difficulty . It may be likened to the actual twilight about half an hour after sunset . Under any circumstances the observer will have but a short time to enjoy the scene . In a minute or two , perhaps three , four , or five minutes , according to circumstances , sunlight will be seen coming from the same direction as that from which the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the observer . The glory disappears in a moment , and , except for the partially eclipsed sun , nature assumes her usual aspect . Much has been written about the effect of such an eclipse upon animals . Quite likely these descriptions have been exaggerated . But it has not always been thus in the case of men . Arago tells of a girl in the south of France who was tending cattle in the fields during the eclipse of 1842 , which was total over the region in which she lived . Filled with alarm at the black object which had usurped the place of the sun , she ran forward crying . When light returned and the sun reappeared , she dried her tears with the exclamation , " Oh , beautiful sun ! " Of late years a powerful aid has been lent to astronomy by photography . With the sensitive chemicals now used in the photographic art it is possible to photograph celestial objects which are invisible to the eye . Millions of stars are now being charted in the sky , and thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , even when aided by the most powerful telescope . Now it is hoped that our astronomers will apply some method of photographing the sky around the sun during the coming eclipse . If there is any object or any group of objects there of which the attraction would produce any effect , we hope that it may be discovered . The eclipse will in some of these particulars be fortunate and in others unfortunate . It is rare indeed that such a phenomenon occurs in a climate where there is so little cloud as in the region of Georgia and North  | Carolina , over which the shadow of the moon will pass . On the other hand , the duration of totality is very short , little more than a minute near New Orleans , and less than a minute and a half in North Carolina . This compares very unfavorably with the sixminute duration of the eclipses of 1868 and 1883 . But we may rest assured that our astronomers will make the best use of the brief moments at their disposal ; and if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Eclipses of the sun are of such general interest to the public , as well as to the astronomer , that the reader will perhaps not be wearied if I say something more about them . A sort of dramatic interest is given to them by the fact , so familiar to all of us , that the sun and moon are almost exactly of the same apparent size . Each of these bodies is at certain times a little nearer to us than at others . When the moon is nearest to us , it seems a little larger than the sun , and when farthest away , a little smaller . It makes all the difference in the world in the character of an eclipse which of these two is the case . In the first case , the moon will entirely hide the sun ; in the second it can not . To see to the best advantage what will happen , the observer on the earth must choose such a place that the center of the moon will pass exactly over the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipse . If the moon is a little larger in apparent size , it hides the sun , and the eclipse is total . But if it is smaller , the extreme edge of the sun will be seen all around the dark edge of the moon , forming a ring of sunlight . The eclipse is then annular . Such an eclipse does not offer the same advantage in the study of the sun that a total one does , and is therefore of less scientific interest . But it must be very instructive to any one who has the opportunity to see it . On the average the apparent size of the moon is smaller than that of the sun , so that annular eclipses occur a little oftener than total ones . In 1865 an annular eclipse was visible in the Southern States , and another will pass through the Gulf of Mexico and across Florida on June 28 , 1908 . During the latter the sun will be almost covered . It is remarkable that , though the ancients were familiar with the fact of eclipses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some even the laws of their recurrence , there are very few actual accounts of these phenomena in the writings of the ancient historians . The old Chinese annals now and then record the fact that an eclipse of the sun occurred at a certain time in some province or near some city of the Empire . But no particulars are given . Quite recently the Assyriologists have deciphered from ancient tablets a statement that an eclipse of the sun was seen at Nineveh , B.C. 763 , June 15th . Our astronomical tables show that there actually was a total eclipse of the sun on this day , during which the shadow passed 100 miles or so north of Nineveh . Perhaps the most celebrated of the ancient eclipses , and the one that has given rise to most discussion , is that known as the eclipse of Thales . Its principal historical basis is a statement of Herodotus , that in a battle between the Lydians and the Medes the day was suddenly turned into night . The armies thereupon ceased battle and were more eager to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that Thales , the Milesian , had predicted to the Ionians this change of day , even the very year in which it should occur . An eclipse of which we have a very explicit statement in the writings of the ancients is now generally known as the eclipse  | of Agothocles . Agothocles was tyrant of Syracuse , and was long engaged in war with the Carthaginians . In B.C. 310 , the latter were blockading his fleet , of which he was in personal command , in the harbor of his own town . He availed himself of a momentary relaxation in the blockade to sail away for the Carthaginian territory . The second day of his voyage , which lasted six days and nights in all , he saw a total eclipse of the sun . This observation would have been of great use to the astronomers of our time in correcting their tables , were they sure of the locality of A gothocles at the time he made it . But it has been an open question whether he sailed directly toward the south or went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island of Sicily . The result would be quite different in the two cases . The probability now seems to be that he passed to the north , and this accords with the conclusions from our most recent investigations on the motion of the moon . In modern times , since it became possible to predict the path of an eclipse along the earth 's surface , and the time at which it would begin and end at any given place , the principal interest which astronomers at first took in the phenomenon grew out of the test which it afforded of the tables of the moon 's motion . In 1715 , the shadow of the moon passed over the western and southeastern parts of England , including London in its range . Halley , who had just been made astronomer royal , planned a more extended and careful series of observations on this eclipse than had ever before been made . Men in various towns near the edge of the shadow noted carefully whether the sun was totally eclipsed or not , and where it was , how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to lay down on a map , from observations , the limits of the moon 's shadow without an error of more than two or three miles . The times of beginning and end of the total phase were also carefully noted in London and its immediate neighborhood . The French astronomers had a different method of observation , which could be equally well applied whether an eclipse was total or not . They did what any of us can do with the aid of a spy-glass : they pointed a telescope at the sun , and then , instead of looking into the telescope , held a screen at some little distance behind it , on which an image of the sun was thrown . By looking at this image the progress of the eclipse could be noted more easily than by looking at the sun itself , because no dark glass was necessary and the observer could sit down and watch the affair at his leisure . The diameter of the sun on the screen was marked off into twelve digits , and the time by the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three digits , and so on could be recorded . It was not until after the beginning of the nineteenth century that men began to avail themselves of total eclipses to make observations of the sun 's surroundings , with a view of throwing light upon the question of the physical constitution of our great luminary . The corona and the prominences had , been observed since the seventeenth century , and drawings and descriptions of the appearances made ; but it does not seem to have occurred to any one that questions respecting the nature or cause of these objects could be answered . Even now the reader may inquire how it is that we can learn anything about the sun by hiding him from our sight , and , if we can , why a chimney would not answer the purpose as well as the moon . The answer is not far to seek . In the daytime the whole air around the sun is so brightly illuminated that it is impossible to see anything in the immediate neighborhood of that body . We may cut off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not cut off the illumination of the air except by an object far above the air . The size and distance of the moon are such that it cuts off a great deal of light for hundreds of miles around us , and enables us to see the region close around the sun through an almost dark sky . Even when curiosity as to the corona and prominences began to be aroused , it was long before any answers to questions about then : were apparent . Any one could look into a telescope , describe what he saw , and , if a good draughtsman , make a picture of the scene . But what could he learn from such a picture ? So much in the dark were even the most advanced astronomers on the subject up to the middle of the nineteenth century , that it was not established whether the corona belonged to the sun or to the moon . If , as might be the case , the latter was surrounded by a very rare atmosphere , even one so rare that we could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rays of the sun might show as a corona around the moon . In 1851 a total eclipse was visible in Northern Europe , which enabled the question of the whereabouts of the red prominences to be settled . It was found that , as the moon traveled along over the sun , shetraveled over the prominences also , advanc-  | ing on those in front , uncovering those behind . This showed that these objects certainly belonged to the sun and not to the moon . The same would probably be true of the corona , but in this case it was difficult to reach so positive a conclusion . About 1863 64 the spectroscope began to be applied to researches on the heavenly bodies . Mr. ( now Sir William ) Huggins , of London , was a pioneer in observing the spectra of the stars and nebulae . For several years it did not seem that much was to be learned in this way about the sun . The year 1868 at length arrived . On August 18th there was to be a remarkable total eclipse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 miles broad ; the duration of the total phase was more than six minutes . The French sent Mr. Janssen , one of their leading spectroscopists , to observe the eclipse in India and see what he could find out . Wonderful was his report . The red prominences which had perplexed scientists for two centuries were found to be immense masses of glowing hydrogen , rising here and there from various parts of the sun , of a size compared with which our earth was a mere speck . This was not all . After the sunlight reappeared , Janssen began to watch these objects in his spectroscope . He followed them as more and more of the sun came out , and continued to see them after the eclipse was over . They could be observed at any time when the air was sufficiently clear and the sun high in the sky . By a singular coincidence this same discovery was made independently in London without any eclipse . Mr. J. Norman Locker was then rising into prominence as an enthusiastic worker with the spectroscope . It occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood of the sun was so intense that any matter that existed there would probably take the form of a gas shining by its own light . The spectrum of such a gas is composed of bright lines , which are but little enfeebled to whatever extent the spectrum as a whole may be spread out by the prism through which it passes . But the sun 's light reflected from the air is more and more enfeebled the more it is spread out . Consequently , if a spectroscope of sufficient power were directed at the sun just outside its border , the brilliancy of the light reflected from the air mignt be so diminished that the bright lines from the gases surrounding the sun would be seen . It was anticipated that thus the prominences would be made visible . Both of the investigators we have mentioned endeavored to get a sight of the prominences in this way ; but it was not until October 20th , two months after the Indian eclipse , that Mr. Lockyer succeeded in having an instrument of sufficient power completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see the prominences without an eclipse ! At that time communication with India was by mail , so that for the news of Mr. Janssen 's discovery astronomers had to wait until a ship arrived . By a singular coincidence his report and Mr. Lockyer 's communication announcing his own discovery reached the French Academy of Sciences at the same meeting . This eminent body , with pardonable enthusiasm , caused a medal to be struck in commemoration of the new method of research , in which the profiles of Lockyer and Janssen appeared together as co-discoverers . Since that time the prominences are regularly mapped out from day to day by spectroscopic observers in various parts of the world . Up to the present time the question of the corona is an unsettled one . There appears to be some yet unsolved mystery enveloping its origin . Everything about it shows that it can not be an atmosphere of the sun , as  | was once supposed . Were such the case , it would , unless composed of some substance vastly lighter than hydrogen , be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that body . It could not rise hundreds of thousands of miles from the sun , as the corona does ; and even if it did , its light would be smooth and uniform , whereas the coronal light has a sort of hairy or fibrous structure . This may be seen on most of the good photographs of the corona . Professor F. H. Bigelow has noticed a remarkable resemblance between these seeming fibers and the curves which iron filings scattered over paper assume when we place a magnet under the paper . He has thus formed a theory of the corona based on some action of the sun akin to magnetism . The coincidence between the results of this theory and the general figure of the corona , especially the direction of the fibers , is , to say the least , very curious . Some sort of polarization in the direction of the sun 's axis seems to be clearly indicated . But we have here no explanation as to how the matter forming the corona is kept from falling into the sun by the powerful attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the earth . Quite likely this is brought about by some form of electrical or other repulsion , similar to that which is seen to act in the tail of a comet . Another mystery is the nature of the long streamers , sometimes extending far beyond the outer parts of the corona . Some analogy has been suspected between these and the streamers of the aurora . The view has thus arisen that the corona may be an aurora around the sun . More observations and studies must be made , both upon the aurora and the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism , before we can reach any decided conclusion on this question . The composite nature of the spectrum of the corona shows that the substance which forms it is not all in the same state . Most of the light which it emits gives an unbroken spectrum , seemingly without dark lines . This shows that it emanates partly from hot particles , and not wholly from diffusing gases . It is likely that this matter shines partly by its own light and partly by the reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines in the spectrum , one of which has particularly attracted the attention of investigators ever since its discovery in 1869 . It seems to be emitted by some gas not known to exist upon the surface of the earth , and to which the name coronium has been given . It is interesting to remark in this connection that the solar spectrum shows at least one other substance in the sun which was formerly not known to exist on the earth , and which was therefore called helium . But , only a few years ago , this substance was found in clevite , a somewhat rare mineral of Norway . Possibly we may yet discover coronium somewhere on the earth . We may consider it as certain that the corona , considered as a mass of matter , is a very flimsy affair . When we recall that its extent is to be measured by hundreds of thousands , nay , millions of miles , and that it surrounds a globe of more than a hundred times the diameter of the earth , and therefore having more than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it as a very massive structure . But we should be deceived . A few quarts of water condensed in the air will make a very respectable-looking fog or cloud . Such a cloud in the immediate neighborhood of the sun would shine with a hundred thousand times the light which any terrestial cloud ever shone with in the brightest rays of the sun . Quite likely , if we should surround the earth with a corona like that of the sun , we should never be able to see it , or to detect its existence in the air or above the air , by any research we could make . But an observer on the moon would see it plainly . It would be the same with the tail of a comet , which is so tenuous that we can see a small star through a million miles of its thickness . Fifty miles ' thickness would not suffice to make it visible in the brightest rays of the sun . Perhaps the most interesting object which the spectroscopists have examined during total eclipses is known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Young , during the eclipse of 1870. which he observed in Spain . He was noticing the changes in the appearance of the spectrum given by the sun 's light when the moon was nearly cutting it off . At the very last moment , when no part of the sun was visible except its extreme edge , the dark lines of the spectrum were changed to bright ones . As the last ray disappeared , all the bright lines of the spectrum flashed out . This showed that the substances which compose the sun exist at its immediate surface as a layer of glowing gases , all substances being vaporized by the fervent heat which there prevails . This heat is more intense than anything we can produce by terrestrial means . The questions that relate to the sun are  | not the only ones that total eclipses enable the astronomer to attack . Such of our readers as have specially interested themselves in celestial science are doubtless aware that the motion of the planet Mercury shows a minute deviation which might be produced by the attraction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . This deviation was first discovered by Le Verrier , celebrated as having computed the position of Neptune before it had ever been recognized in the telescope . His announcement set people to looking for the supposed planet . About 1860 , a Dr. Lescarbault , a country physician of France who possessed a small telescope , thought he had seen this planet passing over the disk of the sun . But it was soon proved that he must have been mistaken . Another more experienced astronomer , who was looking at the sun on the same day , failed to see anything except an ordinary spot , which probably misled the physician-astronomer . Now , for forty years the sun has been carefully scrutinized and photographed from day to day at several stations without anything of the sort being seen . Still , it is possible that little planets so minute as to escape detection in passing over the sun 's disk may revolve in the region in question . If so , their light would be completely obscured by that of the sky , so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance that , during a total eclipse of the sun , when the light is cut off from the sky , they could be seen . Observers have , from time to time , looked for them during total eclipses . In one instance something of the sort was supposed to be found . During the eclipse of 1878 , Professor Watson , of Ann Arbor , and Professor Lewis Swift , both able and experienced observers , thought that they had detected some such bodies . But critical examination left no doubt that what Watson saw was a pair of fixed stars which had always been in that place . How it was with the observations of Professor Swift has never been certainly ascertained , because he was not able to lay down the position with such certainty that positive conclusions could be drawn . The Pickerings , of the Harvard observatory , have devised a special combination of four photographic telescopes , to take the region on each side of the sun during the total phase , and see whether any new objects are found on the negatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been known from ancient times . It is based on the fact that the sun and moon return to nearly the same positions relative to the node and perigee of the moon 's orbit after a period of 6,585 days , 8 hours , or 18 years and 12 days . Hence , eclipses of every sort repeat themselves at this interval . For example , the coming eclipse may be regarded as a repetition of those which occurred in the years 1846 , 1864 , and 1882 . But when such an eclipse recurs , it is not visible in the same part of the earth , because of the excess of eight hours in the period . During this eight hours the earth performs one-third of a rotation on its axis , which brings a different part under the sun . Each eclipse is visible in a region about onethird of the way round the world , or 120 ? of longitude , west of where it occurred before . Only after three periods will the recurrence be near the same region . Put in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the path of its shadow will pass farther north or south . A study of the eclipses of the series to which the present one belongs will illustrate the law in question . The first one that we need mention is that of 1846 , April 25 . The middle point of the shadow-path , that is , the point where the total phase occurred at noon , was then in the West Indies , among the Bahama Islands . This was the first eclipse of the series that was really total , and here it was total only near the middle of the path . The path passed from the Pacific Ocean over northern Mexico , touched the northern end of Cuba , and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the African coast of the Mediterranean . The central point was in 25 ? north latitude . The next recurrence was on May 6 , 1864 . The shadow swept over the Pacific Ocean , and the middle point of its path was in 32 ? north latitude . After the lapse of another period , the eclipse returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great desert of Sahara , passed through Egypt and the continent of Asia , leaving the earth in the Pacific Ocean south of Japan . The middle point was now in 39 ? north latitude . Next we have our present eclipse of May 28th . After passing from New Orleans over the Gulf States along the line shown on our map , the shadow will enter the Atlantic Ocean at Norfolk , cross over to the Spanish Peninsula , and pass along the Mediterranean into Northern Africa . The central point will be in the Atlantic Ocean , in 55 ? north latitude . During the three periods of recurrence the changes in the respective positions of the sun and moon have been such as to throw  | the shade some seven degrees farther north at each recurrence , or about twenty degrees in all That is , it will now pass twenty degrees farther north than it passed in 1846 . The next period of 6,585 days will bring us to 1918 , June 8 . The shadow will then pass from near Japan over the northern part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of the Columbia River , and travel over the United States in a southeasterly direction , through Oregon , Idaho , southwest Wyoming , Colorado , Arkansas , and the Gulf States and Florida . Somewhere in Mississippi or Alabama it will cross the path of the present eclipse . At the point of crossing the inhabitants will have the pleasure of seeing two successive total eclipses of the series . Their fortune , however , will not be so remarkable as that of the inhabitants at a point in the Northwest who saw both of the total eclipses of 1869 and 1878 . The series will continue at the regular intervals we have mentioned until 2044 , August 23 , when the shadow will barely touch the earth in the region of the North Pole . After that it will skip our planet entirely . There are two series of eclipses remarkable for the long duration of the total phase . To one of these the eclipse of 1868 , already mentioned , belongs . This recurred in 1886 , and will recur again in 1904 . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost entirely on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , so that it was not favorable for observation by astronomers . That of 1904 , September 9 , will be yet more unfortunate for us , because the shadow will pass only over the Pacific Ocean . Possibly , however , it may touch some island where observations may be made . The recurrence of 1922 , September 21 , will be visible in Northern Australia , where the duration of totality will be about four minutes . To the other series belongs the eclipse of 1883 . This will recur in 1901 , on May 18th , when the moon 's shadow will sweep from near Madagascar and cross the Indian Ocean , Sumatra , Borneo , and Papua . Unfortunately , this region is very cloudy , and however carefully the preparations for observations may be made , the astronomers will run a great risk of not seeing the eclipse . But hope springs eternal in the human breast ; and it is not likely that observers will be deterred from an heroic attempt by any threats of the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be longer and longer through the twentieth century . In 1937 , 1955 , and 1973 it will exceed seven minutes , so that as far as duration is concerned our successors will have a more remarkable opportunity than their ancestors have enjoyed for many centuries . The question may arise as to the degree of precision with which the path of an eclipse can be predicted by the astronomer . It is sometimes supposed that he can determine a hundred years in advance , and to the exact second , when such a phenomenon will begin or end . This is a great exaggeration of his powers . One entertaining such an idea may have a very high opinion of the power of modern mathematics , but he has no conception of the difficulties of the problem of the moon 's motion . The pull which the sun exerts on the earth and moon by its gravitation second after second , minute after min ute , hour after hour , day after day , and year after year must be known , and its effect continually added up by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Leibnitz and Newton . The changes in the positions of the two bodies caused by the pull of the sun continually changes the action of that pull , because , as one will readily see , the latter depends upon the relative positions , while the positions are continually changed by the pull . This is what makes the problem so complicated . If we had only the sun to deal with , we might hope to get along . But the planets , especially Venus , come in , and insist on having their little pull also . Before their action was found out , there were some deviations in the motion of the moon which are now attributed to the action of Venus . To compute this action is the most complex problem which the mathematical astronomer has to deal with , and he has not yet succeeded in solving it to his satisfaction . And when he has solved it , he is by no means at the end of his trouble . There are several indications that the rotation of the earth slowly changes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a little faster and sometimes a little slower . The change is , indeed , very slow ; not more than two or three thousandths of a second in a day . But , if it takes to rotating faster even by this minute amount , it will get ahead of its calculated place by a second in a year and a minute in sixty years : and then the astronomer who fixes his point of observation so that he will be carried to exactly the center of the moon 's shadow , according to calculations made sixty year before , may find himself out of the way by several miles .  | What makes the matter difficult is that these changes in the earth 's rotation can not , so far as we have yet learnt , be exactly observed , or even predicted ; they probably arise from changes in the position of ice around the North Pole , changes in ocean currents , and perhaps in the movement of the winds . The reason that they can not be directly determined is that we can not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the error of a second . The rotation of the earth on its axis affords the astronomer the only measure of time he can use in his work , and if it goes wrong , he is , for the time being , left at sea . But his motto to-day is always forward ; he has not lost one particle of enthusiasm because his science has been progressing for 2,000 years . He will leave no device untried to learn everything that is to be learned about the motions of the earth and heavenly bodies , confident that if he must fail , his successors will carry on his work to perfection . If to-day he can not tell his successors of the year 2000 when to expect an eclipse within one minute by the clock , he of the year 2000 may do it for his successor of 2100.
