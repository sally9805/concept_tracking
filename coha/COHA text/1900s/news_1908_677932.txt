txt Harry Thaw 's first day as an Inmate of the State Asylum for the ' Criminal Insane passed without particular incident , but was marked by 111-concealed dissatisfaction on the part of the prisoner with his new surroundings . Nearly all day long he sat in the ward to which he is confined , dressed in the plain blue flannel suit which is the regulation uniform of the inmates , staring listlessly out of the window , or at the other prisoners sitting about the room , displeasure evident in every line of his face . He kept entirely to himself and made it evident by his sullen demeanor that he did not care to be disturbed in his thoughts . The routine of the day was broken late in the afternoon by a visit of two of the principal alienists who appeared for the defense at the two trials , Dr. Britton D. Evans of " brainstorm " fame and Dr. Smith Ely Jelliffe of New York . The two dotitors arrived at Fishkill Landing on the 4 o'clock train , and drove out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i returning immediately afterward to New York . Their visit was unexpected , and Is believed here to signify that a motion will be made at once to attempt to release Thaw and that they will be the principal witnesses in his behalf . They refused to make any statement whatever or comment on Thaw 's condition . When the alleniste arrived Thaw had just returned to the ward from chapel service , and was evidently in a , more contented frame of mind than he had been at any time during the day . He appeared to expect a visit from his counsel or some member of ' his family during the day , and their failure to arrive had clearly added to his uneasiness . Consequently he welcomed the two doctors joyfully , and chatted with them in a spirited manner during their stay with him . Despite the fact that several of the inmates of Matteawan have private rooms of their own , food especially prepared for them , and other luxuries and freedom , Thaw has so far been treated like any ordinary " patient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , .1-IciwaaAcirnpel'ed to sleep in the dormitory with " elliiiCethea. , men in his ward , wash at the common toilet , eat in the big dining room , wear the regulation asylum suit , and was not even permitted to smoke . Dr. Amos T. Baker , who has charge of " Ward No. 1 North , " in which Thaw is confined , said.that he would have to earn his- right to the fre'edom of the rules before he will be allo*ed any liberties . So far he has been subjected to the strictest discipline . He 's with the it Mild " Cases . The ward in whlAh Thaw is confined is that in which the k ' mild " homicidal patients are kept . He has fifty-seven wardmates , among them a biz negro and an eighty-year-old Chinaman of the name of Quimbo Appo , who has been in the asylum for thirty-one years , and is continually , predicting his rescue by his army of 25.000,000 men stationed just across the river at Newburg and his fleet of warships anchored up- the Hudson . The harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include him in the rescue , but the new inmate did not encourage his advances , and the old man gave it up after awhile . Ward No. 1 is a. large , airy room on the second floor of the hospital . The windows are heavily barred , and the furniture is so heavy and unwieldy that it can not be used as weapons of warfare or missiles for the prisoners to throw at each other . There are tables for checkers and cards . Opening directly off the ward Is the dor- I mitory where Thaw and his mates sleep . The men have to undress before- each other in the ward promptly at 9 P. M. , and then pile into the dormitory , where the little iron beds stand in rows only a few feet apart . Lights are out at 10 . Thaw rose this morning with the rest of the men in the room at 7 o'clock , and , after standing in line some minutes , took his turn at the common washstand , and then filed into the big dining room downstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eggs with 300-lunatics sittipg at the long tables about him . The only thing that marked him from other prisoners was the fact  --  that he was one of the thirty-seven that are allowed to use knives and forks . He had slept rather fitfully during the night , but seemed to enjoy his breakfast . After the meal was finished Thaw returned to the ward and read all the New York papers which had been ordered for him . Then he had an hour 's exercise with the others in the court of the asylum , and , returning , sat quietly by himself until luncheon time : After that- he attended the weekly chapel service in the big main corridor and joined noticeably in the hymn singing . The service was conducted by the Rev. Harry Sheldon of the Fishkill Methodist Church . Thaw listened attentively to his remarks . Immediately after the service he had his long talk with the two alienists , having just time for his exercise before dinner . After that meal , which conslated of roast pork , boiled potatoes , sauerkraut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence and remained thus until the hour for turning in . , Had $6,000 Cash with Him . It was learned to-day that when Thaw was searched last night at the hospital and his belongings taken away from him preparatory to entering the asylum $6,000 in cash was taken out of his pockets and turned over to LaWyer O'Reilly , It is believed . that Thaw 's . wife will . come up from . New York to visit him to- - morrow , and there is a. ? rumor about town that arrangements have been made for her to take a house in the village so that ' she can , be near her husband ? during  --  his stay here . There ** another , . rumor about ? to the effect that the motion for . Thaw 's I release will be made : in Dtrtchess County courts.at Poughkeepsie . , Neither Dr. ' Robert B.

His picture and physical measurements will be taken in a day or two for the hospital records . He gave his age on entering as 37 . One of the different methods of relaxation afforded to the inmates which Thaw will soon be allowed to indulge in will be a part in the asylum orchestra . He is an accomplished musician and during his confinement in the Tombs his Interest in these things has only been increased by lack of opportunity forindulging in them . When he arrived at the Holland Hotel last night for dinner . before going to the asylum , he jumped at the piano at once and played steadily for " halfan hour . THAW 'S MOTHER WANTS WRIT . Summons Peabody to Devise a Way of Getting Him Out of Matteawan . A. Russell Peabody , personal counsel for Harry K. Thaw , yesterday visited Mra . William Thaw at the Hotel Lorraine and discussed with her the prospects of getting her son out of the asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some private institution for the insane . Mr. Peabody was called on the telephone by Mir . Thaw and summoned to the hotel . The lawyer said that the mother of White 's slayer seemed highly pleased with the result of the trial . " We are not preparing to ask for a writ of habeas corpus in the immediate future . " ' he said . " My client ' , is being held under observation at Matteawan , and the fact that he was Judged not guilty of Vie crime charged against him on the ground of insanity did not pees on his present condition of mind . That matter has been left open by the verdict , and , so far as I can see , the validity of his marriage to Evelyn Nesbit is not in question , and he still has the right and the powers as a citizen to transact business matters for himself . " Mr. Peabody said that the matter of the Marriage could be settled only by annulment proceedings started either by Thaw or his wife , and he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin such an action . Hvelyn Nesbit Thaw remained at her home , 446 Park Avenue , and referred reporters to Lawyer Daniel O'Reilly . District Attorney Jerome is satisfied with the confinement of Thaw in Matteawan and has expressed the conviction that his release from that place would mean a recurrence of a maniacal spell and injury or death to some one . It is known that he will fight any move to get Thaw out of Matteawan.
