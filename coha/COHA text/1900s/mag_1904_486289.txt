EX-SENATOR DORSEY is making a desperate effort to divert attention from his participation in the Star-route swindles by entertaining the public about his share in the management of the Presidential campaign of 1880 , General Garfield 's appreciation of his efforts , his friendly correspondence with the President-elect , and the advice he gave the latter with regard to the formation of the Cabinet . This correspondence , interspersed with oral remarks from Mr. Dorsey , who recently asked the court for an adjournment of the Star-route trial on account of his physical sufferings rendering him unable to attend the court , but who now proves a very ready talker , fills nearly two pages of last Monday 's Herald . From the letters printed it appears that General Garfield had a high opinion of Mr. Dorsey as a campaign manager , and expressed himself as much gratified by his skill , energy , and success . It appears also that he , after the election , invited Dorsey 's opinion and advice with regard to the manner in which his Administration should be organized . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorsey 's advice , he failed to do the things Dorsey most earnestly urged him to do , and he did the things Dorsey most vehemently protested against . The statement that Garfield offered to Dorsey the Secretaryship of the Interior so far rests upon Mr. Dorsey 's own assertion , and we see good reason to disbelieve it until it is supported by documentary evidence or other indisputable testimony . But whatever light this correspondence may throw upon Mr. Dorsey 's political activity , or upon Garfield 's way of treating people , or upon his character generally , the question which Mr. Dorsey just now has to answer , and from which the public should not permit their attention to be diverted , has nothing at all to do with these things . It is simply whether Mr. Dorsey is a thief ; or , in other words , whether he has conspired with others to rob the Government . This question is to be decided after a fair trial by a competent jury . And if the jury finds that Mr. Dorsey has done the things for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign of 1880 , or General Garfield 's confidence , or the weaknesses of Garfield 's character that may have been disclosed in this correspondence , should not , and , we trust , will not , stand in the way of his being punished like any other person convicted of an infamous crime . A point of striking interest in Mr. Dorsey 's correspondence with General Garfield is the extremely poor opinion Mr. Dorsey entertained of Mr. Wayne MacVeagh , and of Independent Republicans and reformers generally . There is no meanness and villany he did not think them capable of . The excessive virulence of his language with regard to Mr. MacVeagh seems almost to indicate very gloomy forebodings on his part as to what might be in store forhim in case Mr. MacVeagh should occupy a seat in President Garfield 's Cabinet . In that respect he was not disappointed . His remark in one of his letters to Garfield , that he would much rather see a representative Democrat than an Independent Republican in a Republican Cabinet , is thoroughly characteristic of the Machine politician . Far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the ranks of his own pasty who are hostile to Machine methods . With a Democrat who is a thorough partisan , a Republican Machine man can strike hands ; with him he can come to an understanding ; with him he has sympathies , views , and objects in common ; with him he can cooperate  --  with an anti-Machine man never . Dorsey 's wish to have a good Democratic partisan in Garfield 's Cabinet in preference to an anti-Machine Repilltlican , is therefore perfectly logical and intelligible . We have had similar things in this city quite frequently , and invariably the cooperation of the two machines was an expensive luxury to the public . The chief difference between the decision in the Curtis case by the Circuit Court and that rendered on Monday by the Supreme Court is , that the latter places the legal and constitutional objections to political assessments on a broader and clearer basis than the former . It will be remembered that the act under which General Curtis was indicted only prohibits certain classes of officers and employees from receiving or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never taken place , it might with some plausibility still be contended that , while Congress might prevent this , it could not prohibit assessments by or payments to volunteer committees , or , in other words , that by a slight change of machinery the system of collecting a percentage on salaries might be kept up . But no one can read the opinion of the Court carefully without seeing that , while its actual effect is only to affirm the constitutionality of the present act , the grounds on which the opinion is rested are such as to imply that Congress has all the powers that the most extreme reformer can ask . The object of the existing statute , the Court says , is clearly to protect employees from extortion under threats of dismissal . But this is only a small exercise of the authority vested by the Constitution in Congress . A " voluntary " payment to Jay Hubbell is a piece of extortion on the one side , but it is a bribe on the other , or , as the Court says : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in authority to contribute from their personal income to the expenses of political campaigns , and a refusal may lead to putting good men out of the service , liberal payments may be made the ground for keeping poor ones in . " Again , if part of the compensation received for public services must be contributed for political purposes , " it is easy to see that an increase of compensation may be required to provide the means to make the contribution , and that in this way the Government itself may be made to furnish indirectly themoney to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage . " This reasoning , of course , applies to the whole system of political assessments , whether it is carried on by Executive officers , or Congressmen , or anybody else . It means that Congress can legislate on the subject so as to prevent all interference with Treasury clerks and letter-carriers , all attempts to wring money out of them , or to cajole them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what cloak is thrown over the abuse . The system , if carried on by volunteer committees of ministers of the Gospel , will be no more sacred than if it is in the hands of officeholders . Congress can protect the service from outside interference in any quarter just as it can protect the voter at the polls . This is what the Curtis decision means , and the public has every reason to be grateful to the General and the " boys " who have helped on his litigation for the valuable contribution they have made to the cause of reform . The examination of Mr. William H. Vanderbilt and of Mr. Rufus Hatch by the Committee of the Legislature which is trying to find out whether there is anything wrong in " grain corners , " and , if so , what is the best means of preventing them , was interesting as showing how little about corners those know who are popularly suspected of making them . Mr. Vanderbilt was apparently almost as ignorant of their working , except in so far as they sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain , as the Rev. Dr. Crosby , who knew nothing about them except what he saw in the newspapers . He made no corners himself , he said , and he hardly speculated in stocks , or , if he did , it was on a large margin . In a general way he thought ill of corners , and so did Mr. Rufus Hatch . Mr. Vanderbilt disclaimed , and doubtless with much truth , a large part of the activity which " newspaper men " ascribe to him , and insinuated that they kept him constantly cornering and speculating , as part of their " business . " One can not help hoping that these investigations of corners and stock-gambling , if they do not reveal the true nature and cause of corners , will at least make somewhat clearer the futility of trying to prevent them by legislation . The belief that speculation can be stopped by statute is centuries old . The English statutes against " regrating and forestalling " were attempts to prevent speculation in produce ; they seldom succeeded , ? and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had not been executed . The great check on speculation in Wall Street , or in any other street , is to be found in Mr. Vanderbilt 's assertion that " not one man in ten goes into Wall Street but he is sure to be a loser in the long run . " This is doubtless true , and it constitutes a penalty of the most tremendous kind , which is self-inflicting . It may be said that this argument , if good for anything , is good against interference with gambling-houses by the police , because nearly everybody who goes to a gambling-house loses his money . But then what goes on in gambling-houses is not the excess or perversion of a good thing . If playing three-card monte and throwing dice were up to a certain point useful occupations , as the buying and selling of stocks are , and became injurious only when carried to excess , it would be terribly difficult for us to suppress gambling . Gold and silver mining is another example , besides stock and grain dealing , of a useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is got ; but who would or could forbid mining simply because nineteen-twentieths of those who put money into mining lose it , or because there is vast speculation in mining prospects ? " Selling what you have not got , " which is most condemned in all these inquiries , is immoral , if done for immoral ends , but it is one of the commonest and oldest and most useful of human transactions . Everybody who promises to do anything at some future time for a consideration , even to pay a debt , sells what he has not got . It might be a very good and beautiful world in which nobody sold anything which he could not deliver on the spot , or promised anything which he could not instantly perform , but it would be a world so different from this that but few of this generation would want to live in it . The prevailing opinion as to the good management of the New York Post-office is confirmed by the report of the commission of inquiry appointed by the Postmaster-General . What is said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - " All applicants are treated alike , no matter - who recommends them or to what political organization the applicant may belong . " This impartiality of treatment is what real civil-service reform would secure in all departments of the Government . Its practice in our Post - office has not proved destructive of patriotism . It has not established an offensive officeholding class . The applicants for places are examined " in penmanship , in arithmetic , in geography , in English grammar , in the history of the United States , " and in such public matters as may be necessary " to test general capacity or special fitness for the post 11 service . " This certainly is " practical . " It does not require familiarity with Sanskrit , or Greek , or abstruse astronomical problems . It does not restrict competition to college graduates , as some of our old-fashioned statesmen have feared competitive examinations would do . It is precisely a practical test such as this that real civil-service reform would secure in all departments of the Government . Objection to this reform is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The New York Post-office , however , has made an earnest experiment with the principle , and , as these objectors lay such stress on the value of facts as compared with arguments , the results of the experiment ought to be conclusive with them . The proposal of the Joint Committee on Shipping to pay a cash bounty to shipbuilders on the materials of home production used by them equal to what the duty would have been if the same materials had been imported from abroad , is a dangerous one from many points of view . In the first place , it will kill the wooden shipbuilding trade , which is really in a flourishing condition notwithstanding the outcry- raised on the subject . We have seen a statement published to the effect that more ships were built this year at Bath , Maine  --  the principal centre of the industry on the Atlantic coast  --  than in any previous year . We have made some inquiries of our own upon this point which lead to the conclusion that the trade is really in a prosperous condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we submit that Congress ought not to destroy it by offering a premium to iron shipbuilders  --  a premium collected from the whole body of the people , including the builders of wooden ships . Iron ships are better than wooden ones , and they earn more mommy for a given amount of freight transported . The difference between the two is so marked that it is quite within the range of possibilities that iron may supersede wood in our own shipyards for ocean-going vessels within the next ten years , even without the intervention of a bounty from the Treasury . But let us have fair play , at all events . If bounties are to be paid , let them be paid on tonnage , and not on materials . The Maine shipbuilders are as good protectionists as the Pennsylvania shipbuilders , and have equal rights to put their hands in the Treasury . Another point of danger is that the annual appropriation of money by Congress , to pay shipbuilders for the supposed losses incurred in their trade , will attract so much criticism and shed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to put the whole protectionist system in peril . The Keely stockholders , were cheered on Wednesday by the report of Mr. Boekel , the engineer appointed by the court as custodian of the Secret . The report shows the Secret to be in very fine condition , notwithstanding its long keeping ; but what it is Mr. Boekel declares that it would be improper for him to explain , beyond the fact that the Keely engine " disintegrates " water so that its " molecular structure is broken up , " and " there is evolved therefrom a permanent expansive gas , vapor , or ether , ? hich result is produced by mechanical action . " Mr. Keely , he says , will soon have an engine completed , and it is his purpose to call the attention of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to the matter . We trust , however , that if that company persists in continuing to use steam , some rival trunk line will be given an opportunity to try the new motor , for the public has the right to the best motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has committed a business homicide on a negro named Rose Moseley , for testifying against him in a lawsuit . We have no doubt that , although Moseley was a negro , this occurrence will produce " gloom " in Anchorage and a general wish that Crittenden had let Moseley alone . It may even lead to a trial of Crittenden , in which there will be considerable weeping ; but the sympathies of the jury will probably be rather with the wounded spirit of a man who has been testified against by a negro than with the Commonwealth or the dead negro . There will not be any weeping o'er the scandal which the affair brings on the community and its administration of justice . Some one wittily said of the South after the war , in the Ku-klux period , that if Southerners would only raise more cotton and less " hell , " all would be well . It may now be said that if Southern towns would indulge in less " gloom , " and spend more on halters and hangmen , it would work an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in hanging man-slayers would yield richer returns than $255,000,000 spent on river and harbor improvements . In Opelika , Ala. , the other day , " every doctor in the city , " we are told , " was engaged in extracting buckshot from the bodies of the wounded , and Mr. Maloney lies dangerously , and it is feared mortally , wounded . " " How came it ? " asks the local chronicler . Well , there were some special causes at work in this case , but the main reason why " it came that there was so much buckshot in the bodies of the wounded , and that Mr. Maloney is in such a sad state , is probably that several of the wounded were not executed years ago for some of their previous frays . Governor Stephens of Georgia says he has pardoned Cox on " numerous petitions , numbering hundreds in all , embracing many eminent citizens , lawyers , jurists , merchants , bankers , ministers of the Gospel , journalists , mechanics , and farmers , and including a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present General Assembly , asking Executive clemency in his behalf . " lie ought to publish their names and reasons , those of " the ministers of the Gospel " especially . According to every account of the affair in the local papers , the killing of Alston was as brutal a homicide as ever was perpetrated ; and if the eminent citizens of Georgia  --  lawyers , jurists , merchants , bankers , and divines  --  think three years ' imprisonment sufficient punishment for it , they must have highly original notions about the duty of the State in the matter of protecting life . The homicide question had begun to attract attention abroad before we took it up . Dr. von Holtzendorff , of Munich , one of the foremost of European jurists , had an article on American homicide in a recent number of the Deutsche Rundschau. - The subject had arrested his attention before we began to discuss it . In fact , foreign jurists , and divinest and penologists who wish to study homicide in all its phases , will begin to come to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study our prison system . Medical authors of works on ' Gunshot Wounds , their Diagnosis and Treatment , ' will also begin to appear in the Southern States before long in large numbers , because there are in no other part of the world the same opportunities for studying the action of buckshot on the human frame . The effect of the single bullet is well known , but hardly any foreign surgeon has had an opportunity of observing the results of a good charge of buckshot from a shotgun . A paper , for instance , from an Opelika doctor , who has spent a day or two extracting buckshot , would excite great interest in foreign medical societies . The Spanish-claims naturalization question has been finally decided , as it was plain to be seen it must be decided , by the adoption of all of Mr. Frelinghuysen 's suggestions . That is to say  --  claimants must prove their citizenship exactly as they must prove any other fact ; the judgments of our naturalization courts are to be taken as conclusive except in cases of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they conflict with some treaty stipulation or rule of international law . This disposition of the matter is exactly what Mr. Blaine wanted to secure , and could have secured had he clearly defined what the question at issue was . But , funnily enough , he wrote a paper on the subject , in which he appeared to take the ground that the United States insisted that naturalization papers fraudulently obtained were just as good in an international court as any others  --  a position about which the Commission naturally thought there was a good deal of doubt . Had Mr. Blaine been a lawyer his mistake would have been impossible . A large number of well-known clergymen have issued an address to the ladies of New York , urging them to " put no wine or strong drink upon their tables " on New Year 's Day , and calling attention to the fact that in past years " this course has been very largely followed in the best social circles . " That there has been an enormous falling off in the consumption of wine at New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to dispute , and the " best social circles " are entitled to the credit of the improvement They may indeed point with pride to their record in this respect . The reform has been the result of voluntary social action , unassisted by penal machinery , such as the . Prohibitionists insist is necessary to restrain intemperance . One fact , however , the clergymen who sign the address seem to have overlooked  --  that the best social circles have , within the past few years , taken a more effective way of guarding against their guests becoming intemperate , by not having any guests at all . Providing tea and coffee is , after all , only a palliative , for guests who insist on making an " old-fashioned " festival of the day , will always find means of getting fuddled during their round of visits , while the simple device of shutting up the house and leaving town for the day , which has got to be so common of late , goes to the root of the matter , and leaves both host and guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible to attain . The abandonment of New Year 's receptions is clearly the true way to effect a complete and permanent reform , and now that a distinct move in this direction is being made by society , clergymen and moralist* have 4 weapon ready to their hands far more effective than tea or coffee . It appears that there is a hitch about getting Sir Charles Dilke into the Cabinet . He first appeared in political life in 1868 as a Republican , and made his debut in politics by several fierce attacks on the Queen 's civil list , which he denounced as extravagant , and accused her of not paying the income tax . He fell into many mistakes in matters of fact about which it is difficult for an outsider to get information , and the general effect of his crusade on his political prospects was supposed , as far as office is concerned , to be fatal . But hardly any mistake is fatal to a man who is young , rich , accomplished , and clever ; and all of these Dilke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even young men are not omniscient , began to cultivate silence , and grew a little more conservative , distinguished himself as a debater and man of business while the Liberals were out of office , and got over the social discredit brought on him by his Republicanism and his criticism of the Queen so far as to become even hand in glove with the Prince of Wales . Consequently , when Gladstone came back to power , he was one of the rising men who had to have something , and he got a post for which he was admirably fitted  --  the Under-Secretaryship of Foreign Affairs  --  for he is a remarkable linguist , has travelled much , and made a close study of foreign politics . The time has now come for him to go into the Cabinet , but it appears he can not get the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster , which Mr. Bright held , because the revenues of the Duchy are part of the civil list , and have to be paid over to the Queen , and she is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not care to have any part of her income managed by a gentleman who had criticised the whole of it so severely . The Duchy of Lancaster is an old principality which has been merged in the Crown , but still has its revenues kept separate from those of the Crown , amounting , net , to about $200,000 a year . Lord Derby is objected to as a member of the Cabinet on the ground that his desire to cut loose from Egypt altogether makes him , if not a bad Whig , a bad Gladstonian . But his attitude on the Irish question is far more objectionable , from the Gladstonian point of view , than his attitude on the Egyptian question , for he apparently declares himself opposed to Home Rule in any shape , or to doing or saying anything about it that will make it a practical question . His theory about Ireland is that Irish hatred of England must be recognized and treated as a permanent and ineradicable evil , and met by dull , steady resistance as in the past . These views are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sees so well the difficulties of all action that he would avoid action wherever avoidable , and where he had to act would act to-day as he acted yesterday . The definitive rejection by the German Bundesrath of a motion favoring the abolition of " compulsory civil marriage " has a signifiC6UPO going beyond trio merits of the question itself . The law making the celebration of marriage by a civil magistrate compulsory was one of the fruits of Bismarck 's " liberal " period , and of the beginning of the Kulturkainpf . Civil marriage , especially compulsory civil marriage , has always been one of the greatest eyesores to the Catholic Church . The Clerical party , supported in this instance by a considerable number of the Protestant clergy , have , therefore , spared no effort to compass the repeal of the act . The secret sympathy of the Emperor and the Empress was counted upon by them in this respect . They hoped that compulsory civil marriage would be sacrificed by way of concession to the Vatican , when it seemed to be Prince Bismarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to it , at any price . The decisive step taken by the Bundesrath , which would not have been taken without the consent of the Chancellor , seems to indicate that the limit of concession has been reached , for the time being at least . The periodical Russian scare seems to have broken out once more in the European press . We are told that Russia is strengthening her western frontier by fortifications in a most extraordinary manner ; that no less than seven railroads , for which no commercial necessity exists , have been built in that quarter , evidently for military purposes , and that large bodies of troops have been concentrated near the Galician line . All these things are interpreted as indicating hostile intentions on the part of Russia against Austria and Germany . Then , again , we are assured that the mission of Mr. Giers to Berlin is of the most pacific character , that the diplomatic relations between the three emperors are very satisfactory , and that the movements of troops on the Galician frontier mean nothing but the " ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of greatly unsettling commercial relations between Russia and Germany , and of seriously depressing the value of Russian securities and the Russian paper currency at Berlin and Vienna . We learn also that Prince Bismarck , through his organs in the press , while not denying the existence of any danger , gives the world in general and the German people in particular to understand that he has amply provided for the emergency by renewing the alliance between Germany and Austria . This circumstance throws some light upon the character of the whole excitement . Prince Bismarck is fond of having a little diplomatic byplay when he gets seriously embarrassed in his home policy . He loves to remind the German people that they are surrounded by very dangerous neighbors , but that he is still there to keep those neighbors at bay . He delights in the role of the " necessary man , " who must be humored , But when he says that by the Ana-trip-German alliance all international emergencies are sufficiently provided for , he is undoubtedly right . The military power of Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile neighbors will , single-handed , dare to defy it ; and even a combination of enemies such as Russia and Fiance would have a very hard task on its 13404 in attacking it ,
