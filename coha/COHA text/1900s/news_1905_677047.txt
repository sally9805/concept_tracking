txt J. H. Mansfield &; Co. , a brokerage firm without Exchange connections , which occupied a suite of offices on the third floor of the building 44 Broadway , suspended business yesterday . Anxious creditors swarmed about the place all day long . To-day action will be taken by Reno R. Billington , an attorney representing a number of creditors , to obtain the arrest of the members of the firm , if they can be found . The bull market is believed to be largely responsible for the crash . Not even the employes of the concern knew that the suspension was impending . They reported for duty at the regular hour yesterday morning , only to be confronted by locked doors , from which hung a placard reading : " Business temporarily suspended ; will resume in a few days . " Mr. Billington was one of the few who had any idea that the company was in trouble . He has offices in the same building and has been trying in vain to collect claims aggregating $40,000 from the Mansfields . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , " I had not expected the end to come so soon . I knew that the concern had garnered a harvest of a least $130,000 and probably much more in the few months that it was in business . and the money was coming in so fast that I expected its promoters to hold on a bit longer . Had Many Women Patrons . " The New York patrons of Mansfield &; Co. were principally women . The firm made a special bid for feminine business and had a woman 's department 's elaborately fitted up . The mail business was heavy , and there were many men who sent in large sums from out of town hoping to reap rich returns . I know of one case , in the last few weeks , where an up-State man intrusted $10,000 to the concern . " J. H. Mansfield &; Co. is incorporated . Its capital , according to its letter heads , is $100,000 . John T. Mansfield is its President . His brother , J. H. Mansfield , is Treasurer , and Rosetta J. Bressler , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are comparatively young men . They are but little known in the financial district . For some years they ran a news bureau , and six months ago went into the brokerage business . They engaged - costly. offices and advertised  - -  largely : F brie the first , according to Mr. Billington , they did a good business . Then they began to send out circulars . On July 18 they mailed 23,000 circulars which told the advantages of their " Put Protection Plan . " " We are so confident of our position , " the circular began , " that we will issue a put good for six months on United States Steel common and for three months on its preferred stock that will protect your account with us for that period of time regardless of any fluctuations in prices , if you will deposit with us a 10-point margin . " It continues : Every customer who has availed himself of this plan of ours has made enormous profits . One good customer started with a $100 account and in less than five months drew out more than $1,300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to make more than $1,200 in the mercantile business , your own energies thrown In . Place $1,000 with us under our put protection plan . With $1,000 you can operate in 100 shares of stock with absolute safety , and if you only get a point a day you are getting $100 profit a day , or $36,000 a year . Even supposing that the stock declined your account would be protected , you would not be called upon for additional margins , and the dividends would be credited to your account . When the market opened yesterday morning there were fifty people , forty of them women , grouped about the entrance of Mansfield &; Co. , staring ruefully at the notice of suspension . Their number was augmented as the day wore on . There was one little woman in widow 's weeds , who was weeping bitterly . " I put $3,000 Into Mr. Mansfield 's hands , " she said between sobs . " It was every cent of my husband 's life insurance . He told me that it would make me rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the saddest cases I have ever known , " said Mr. Billington , " are the results of Mansfield 's operations . One of the claims given us for collection is for $1,100 . It represents the life savings of a carpenter from the northern part of the State . who was so taken by the socalled put proposition ' that he mortgaged his house , and sent the money down to the firm . " Last week , so I am informed , the Mansfields sent a man out of town to solicit investments . He succeeded in getting $50,000 . " I had been pressing the Mansfields very hard for several days , and they put me off with one promise after another . Yesterday I got tired and told them that I would give them until noon to-day to settle , and that if they failed to come to time I would take action against them . Instead they closed their doors . " To-morrow I will ask for a warrant for the arrest of the Mansfields . I was told , however , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John T. Mansfield is not given in the Directory . T. H. Mansfield was recently married . He and his wife occupied expensive apartments in Ve Raleigh , 7 West Ninety-second Street . They left yesterday without telling any one their destination .
