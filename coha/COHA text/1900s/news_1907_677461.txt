txt It is is natural enough that in proceedings under the Corrupt Practices act Attorney General JAcim.eox should wish to be represented by assistants designated by himself . For that avowed reason he revokes Attorney General MAYER 'S designation of GELERARD/ DAVIS as the representative of the State prosecutor in proceedings requiring V711.nreat IL HEA.s.ar and other candidates to correct and amplify their statements of campaign expenditures as required by law .

A failure on his part to press the action to compel Mr. HEARST to make , as the law requires , a detailed and specific statement of the uses to which the $256,000 he spent in the campaign was put would be , in effect , a notice to the public that the chief law officer of the State held that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of the Legislature .
