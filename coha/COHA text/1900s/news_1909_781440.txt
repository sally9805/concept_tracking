txt Amendment to Disfranchise Them Apparently Beaten  --  Rhode Island Republican , Virginia Democratic . Throughout the Union yesterday the general result was such as to give no Encouragement to municipal reformers . In almost every place where that was made a pronounced issue the verdict was on the side of the machine . Despite President Taft 's attitude of hostility toward the Cox machine in ' Cincinnati that organization won out ; the reformers were whipped out of their hoots in Philadelphia ; the labor Jrganizations that elected Schmitz in San Francisco are again victorious , and Heney , the militant reformer of California , is apparently thoroughly trounced . The Finn ' Conners mwhine wins in Buffalo , and the Barnes machine in Albany . About the only gleam of hope for raunicipal reformers is to be found in the Indianapolis election , where Gauss , the Democratic candidate , was defeated by Lewis Shank . The brewers and the liquor interests generally are said to have spent money like water to : lea Gauss , and Thomas Taggart worked for him . Even this victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gauss was personally an honest and high-class mari , not at all a machine candidate . While Boss Taggart is a sufferer by the result , Gauss was not a typical Taggart man . One exception to the general rule was found in Toledo , where Brand Whitlock , the independent Mayor , was re-elected by about 2,500 plurality . Few State Elections . There were only three elections for Governor yesterday  --  in Rhoda Island , Virginia , and Massachusetts . The Republicans carried Rhode Island and Massachusetts , and the Democrats , as usual . won in Virginia . Gov . Abram J. Pothier is re-elected in Rhode Island over Olney Arnold by a plurality of at least 1,000 . The chief interest in Rhode Island was over the Constitutional amendments redistricting the State and giving the Governor the veto power . The latter has been carried and the former appears to be . The cities , disgusted over being outvoted by the country towns , have voted for it despite the opposition of the Democrats . Judge William Hodges Mann is elected Governor of Virginia to succeed Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republican candidate was Capt . William P. Kent , and toward the closing of the contest attacks affecting Kent 's integrity were made by Congressman Glass and Gov . Swanson . Minor State offices were filled in Maryland , Pennsylvania , and Nebraska . The centre of interest in Maryland , however , was the constitutional amendment disfranchising the bulk of the negro population . This amendment has been beaten , as a similar amendment was four years ago , but by a. smaller majority . This result puts an end to the effort of the Gorman machine to secure control of the election machinery . according to the men who opposed the adoption of the amendment on that ground . Bay State Anti-Tariff Vote . The only result of National significance is in Massachusetts , where the Payne-Aldrich Tariff bill was a prominent issue . Ex-State Senator Vahey , the Democratic candidate for Governor , loses by 8,000 , after running heavily in Boston . Gov . Draper 's small plurality  --  it was 60,000 last time  --  is taken as a strong indication of the attitude of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Direct nominations also entered into the Massachusetts campaign , Vahey snaking his fight on that issue nearly s much as on tariff revision . National issues , however , may be regarded as one chief factor in this virtual victory or the Democratic platform . This was the only State in the Union where the tariff question was directly presented as an issue . In their effort to conciliate the tariff revision Republican voters the Democrats went to the length of nominating two low-tariff Republicans on their ticket , one of whom , Eugene N. Foss , the candidate for Lieutenant Governor , has been the most strenuous advocate of that reform in the Republican Party . Foss ran only slightly ahead of Vahey . In New Jersey the Republicans have made a clean sweep . Mark M. Fagan , the " New Idea " ex-Mayor of Jersey City , has again been defeated by Mayor Wittpen . The Legislature will be overwhelmingly Republican . Gov . Fort 's campaign against liquor in Atlantic City has been answered by a " wet " majority there . Nebraska is in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judges . Great Democratic gains are shown , and the outlook appears to be satisfactory for Mr. Bryan if he decides to make the race for Senator next year . His friend Dahlman , the " cowboy Mayor " of Omaha , has made a clean sweep in Douglas County for his organization . The chief interest outside of New York , however , centred not on these State contests but on the many munielipal elections throughout the Union . Mayor Johnson Beaten at Last . Of these the liveliest was in Cleveland . where Mayor Tom L. Johnson has at last met his Waterloo . He was first elected in 1901 , and has come up for re-election in every campaign since , then . Even so strong a man as Senator Theodore E. Burton was unable to break his grip two years ago . But in this election Johnson , opposed by a candidate without half Burton 's renown  --  Herman C. Baehr  --  has been dea , feated . He concedes Baehr 's election by 1,500 . What seems to have been the decisive factor was the overturning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that issue did not figure on the stun/kJ to any great extent . Baehr 's majority is between 4,000 and 6,000 . In Louisville there was a bitter campaign , the counterpart of that in New York , and the result Indicates the election of W. 0 . Head , the Democratic candidate , over Mayor Grinstead , the Republican candidate . There were two other candidates in the field . The American , or anti-Mormon , candidate in Salt Lake City , Mayor J. S. Bransford , has been re-elected . This , however , is largely due to the failure of the opposition parties to pull through a successful fusion . Gibboney Loses Ground . D. Clarence Gibboney 's fight against the McNichol machine in Philadelphia has ended in a crushing defeat . The Republicans claim the re-election of District Attorney Rotan over Gibboney by a majority of more than 50,000 . Gibboney came near getting on the regular Republican ticket at the primaries , and this led to the expectation that he would make a great showing at the polls . This expectation has not been justified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate in Philadelphia has made for some years . " Dave " Martin , of the " Hog Combine , " seems to be elected Register of Wills . There is no crumb of comfort for the reformers in Philadelphia , for Martin represents in his own person all that they have been fighting against , and Rotan has been hand-in-glove with the machine ever since he took office , It was a fair stand-up fight and a complete defeat on the issues . Gibboney is known as the " Dr. Park-hurst of Philadelphia . " He started making exposures as a result of per-sonal investiVions , just as Dr. Parkhurst did in 1 ' 9 ' 2 , and formed a Vigil- , ance Leager , which for years has been ! the terror of the ring . He had the McNichol regime badly scared for quite a while during the present campaign , but the result has been such as to justify I Boss Durham in handing down the reins of leadership to Boss " Jim . " San Francisco Hafts Reform . The blackest eye that municipal reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco , where Francis J. Heney is badly beaten for District Attorney . There was a three-cornered fight for the Mayoralty there , in which all the elements in the Republican party that are opposed to the anti-graft agitation started by Hersey united to secure the nomination and election of William Crocker . Crocker is defeated by the labor candidate , P. M. McCarthy . The result in this Mayoralty case simply shows that the labor organizations which elected Scifinitz have not lost their grip on the town . Big Democratic gains are reported in Many counties of New York State . Orleans and Clinton Counties have gone Democratic , and Warren is reported to have done so . To offset this that rockribbed old fortress of Democracy , Scoharie , has elected a Republican County Clerk . In Buffalo Louis C. Fuhrmann , the Democratic candidate for Mayor , is elected , but the rest of the Democratic ticket , with one exception , has gone down to defeat . Close Vote on Wadsworth . Direct primaries cut a considerable figure In the election , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Pittsburg has indorsed the proposition for a $7,000,000 bond issue , which was backed by Mayor Magee .
