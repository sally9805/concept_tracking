txt While there were no authoritative statemeats forthcoming yesterday regarding the new control of the Louisville &; Nashville Railroad , there were plenty of rumors to make up for facts . There was also much activity among thosq who are supposed US be most closely identified with the present disturbance in the property . After ' many visits to the house of J. P. Morgan &; Co. by John W. Gates , there began about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon a conference of men representing various interests , which lasted so ' long that the conferees ' hunger finally got the better of i them , and a light supper of roast beef and asparagus was ordered at a near-by restaurant . The conference was held in the inner sanctum of . the office of J. P. Morgan &; Co . There were present besides George W. Perkins of the firm of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , John W. Gates , Edwin Hawley , who owns ' the Colorado and Southern , and is a. member of the Executive Committee of the Southern Pacific ; Talbot J. Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , Francis Lynde Stetson , the lawyer , and one or two others whose names could not be learned , but who were said to be friends of Mr. Gates . Mr. Taylor was the first to leave . He came out of the rear entrance to the Morgan office in the Mills Building . When asked what had been done at the conference he said : " I am not in it , " and to a question regarding the future of Louisville he replied : " I am not interested . " About 7 o'clock supper was ordered , and then George W. Perkins appeared in the front office at the request of the reporters who had gathered and submitted to a cross-examination . The questions he was asked and the answers he gave ran something like this : " Has the Southern Railway bought Louisville and Nashville ? " " I ca n't talk about that subject . " " Has Mr. Gates got control of the road ? " " That 's a question for Mr. Gates to answer . " " Do you think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did not know it had gone down this afternoon .

" " I 've ' seen it close weaker , " interposed William Pierson Hamilton , Mr. Morgan 's son-in-law , who was standing near by . " Well , " laughed Mr. Perkins , " May 9 is still several ? weeks off : ' , ' " Mr. ' Perkins , will you tell us whether or not the control of Louisville and Nashville is the subject of your conference ? " " Well , " said Mr. Perkins , smiling , " do you think we are going to huy out Huyler ' s ? " . . " Will you give out any statement regarding the result of the conference ? " " No , said Mr. Perkins . Then he went back to his supper . About 8 o'clock the conference broke up . John W. Gates drove to the Waldorf in a motor vehicle and Edwin Hawley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hawley sent down word that he could not talk . John W. Gates , contrary to his custom , did not ? lounge in the corridors of the Waldorf , : but retired at once to his room and denied himself to reporters . The following questions were sent up to his room in writing : : " Is. it true that August Belmont has served notice on you to the effect that he will not give up Louisville and Nashville without a fight ? " " Have you any thing to say regarding the conference this evening at J. la Morgan 's office ? " To both questions Mr. Gates replied by writing on the paper in blue pencil the words , " No answer . " The first of the above questions referred to a report that Mr. Belmont had decided to fight for the control of the road which Mr. Gates is supposed to have wrested from hint . Max Pam , one of Mr. Gates 's associates in the American Steel and Wire Company , was seen at the Waldorf. but he declared that he knew- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from one of Mr. Gates 's intimate friends that he claims that his holdings give him actual control of the Louisville and Nashville Road  --  that is to say , total over 300,000 shares . Moreover , it is asserted by this same authority that leading railroad interests of the country recognize this fact , and that in consequence already three important systems are negotiating with Mr. Gates for the transfer of his holdings . The general idea at the Waldorf last night seemed to be that Mr. Gates was trying to sell out to either the Southern Railway , the Illinois Central , or the Southern Pacific . An attorney , a member of one of the big corporation law firms of Wall Street , said : " It seems to me that Gates somehow heard of a Morgan plan to buy the road , and then jumped in and bought on his own account , either to ingratiate himself with Mr. Morgan , or to make a little money out of it for himself .

The Moore Brothers of Chicago are in no wise interested in the matter , though , clearly , they may become so if the Rock Island should be a bidder for the property , as it is in some quarters reported to be , for Ulu are now the controlling interests in that system . , , It is not believed that the stock purchased has been paid for outright , but is , in part at least , carried on margin . It isapointed out , however , that it would be a comparatively easy matter for the gentlemen named to pay outright for a controlling interest , for ( presuming the average price to be even as high as 15120 a share ) the total for 301,000 shares would be $36,120,000  --  a sum readily obtainable by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE LOUISVILLE AND NASHVILLE . Dealings in 120,000 Shares Cause Net Advance of 81/4 Points  --  Groundless Report of a " Corner " Revived . Wheresoever the control of rsoufsville and Nashville is lodged  --  and Wall Street hears a variety of stories in respect to the present ownership of the system  --  the one fact that stood out clearly in Wall Street yesterday was that a battle royal was being fought for the shares of the company . So keen was the contest and so altogether aggressive the buying that , on purchases involving approximately 120,000 shares of the stock , the ' issue at one time jumped up nearly 14 points , to 133 , and , after a final half hour of great irregularity , closed for the day at 128 , with a net advance of Sy4 1 points . Incidentally , the entire market in the last hour showed signs of semi-demoralization , such stocks as St. Paul , Union Pacific , Illinois Central , Missouri Pacific , Northwest , and Pennsylvania  --  decidedly strong earlier in the day  --  selling off sharply two and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was largely forced by selling prompted by a revival of the report of a " corner " in the Louisville and Nashville stock . This report , it may be said on official authority , is altogether lacking in foundation . There will be no " squeeze " of the shorts by a calling of the stock borrowed by them against their sales . They will be given time to deliver . , As for the nature of the late buying , there was in the financial district much speculation . One report had it that the management of the company , after numerous cable inquiries , had discovered that the heavy holdings of the stock abroad remained practically intact , and that , despite Mr. Gates 's alleged claims of control , the actual ownership of the property might be maintained by the old interests were they only able to secure some 60,000 shares of the stock in this market . Accordingly , one claim is , Mr. Belmont and the Directors went into the market and bought up all the stock they could obtain . In other quarters it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , but that it represented , not purchases of long stock , but in reality purchases against the sales of the 50,000 shares of Treasury stock which  --  because not officially denied  --  it is generally believed in the Street , were sold by the company 's management . In still other quarters it was said that the bulk of the buying came from the Gates contingent , who , firm in the belief that they had gotten a good property at a low figure and would be easily able to sell at an advance , were adding to their holdings . Beyond all this , it is an unquestioned fact that some of the buying came from outside shorts who were finally forced to cover . A number of other shorts , it may be said , effected a ' private settlement before the opening of business yesterday . The actual transactions In the stock were noted chiefly for the marked irregularity attending them .

Simultaneous with this sharp advance came the almost violent two and three point break In the general market  --  due largely to the fear of a " corner " and a recurrence of the Northern Pacific affair . That there is no danger of any " corner . " however , is clear not only from the statements made by members of Mr. Gates 's firm , but also  --  from the fact that the stock not only did not command a premium for loaning Purposes . but did not even lend " flat , ' plenty of it being available at 3 per cent .
