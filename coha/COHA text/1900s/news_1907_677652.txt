Orchard . in testifying , said in signinA the registry ' receipt he purposely wrote as illegibly as possible . The clerk was not permitted to endeavor to decipher th , e name this morning , but the book itself , with the other two that completed the record , was submitted to the inspection of the jurors , and the ' ? proceedings ware halted for a Se* minutes to permit them to take a good look at all three .

Orchard 's story of his attempt to set off the - powder in the Vindicator mine being frustrated by the unexpected appearance of a eager was corroborated partly by the eager himself , Clarence Harrah , who is now a mill man at the Reduction Works in Colorado City , where the strike of 1903 occurred . Harrah has always been a non-union man , and the scorn Darrow feels for all such came out in spite of himself in his cross-exo.ntination .. Harrah knew nothing of Orchard 's attempt to touch off the powder . He simply told of the incident of seeing a man come up the shaft to the eighth level . where he was waiting for the cage to go out of the mine , and of telling the man to hurry up . as it was supper time .

Harrah ' started to answer one of them , and Darrow interrupted , Borah insisted that the witness be allowed to conclude . Darrow flared up and declared that Harrah was not answering the question as he asked it . Judge Wood cut in with the remark that the witness would be allowed to answer . Darrow Insists on His Way . " But he must answer it in my way ! " exclaimed Darrow , hotly , meaning not exactly what ho said. , but that the answer should be responsive to his question and not a speech of the witness 's own .

This was Orchard 's testimony that Haywood had once told ' him of having sent ' Steve Adams to San Francisco to kill Bradley . Orchard reported Haywood as saying then that Adams had failed and had come back to Ogden. where he went broke and telegraphed for money , which Haywood sent him . Borah called witnesses who testified to the arrest of Adams in Ogden in June , 1903 . He was caught in a fruit car stealing a ride from the West . City Detective Pinder of Ogden testified to getting Adams out of jail as a brother Mason , and to identifying him at the telegraph office , where he saw Adams write a telegram to Haywood . Pinder was not permitted to give the context of the message , although he said he could . Then the local manager of the Western Union Company was called and directed to bring the original of 1 Adams 's message to Haywood and the response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they were out of his jurisdiction . Threatened with Contempt Charge . Thereupon Senator Borah asked the court for an order requiring the manager , who is the statutory agent of the telegraph company in this State , to furnish the messages , saying that as this was a corporation doing business in Idaho , the agent could be punished for contempt of court if he did not obey . Judge Wood said that he would issue the order and that Senator Borah could prepare it . Mr. Hackett , the agent . had already produced a telegram from Fred Miller , the Spokane lawyer , to Thomas Hogan , as Orchard had called himself when he was arrested , and did not need the threat of contempt proceedings to produce the Adams messages . But the maging of the threat serves to protect the company for obeying the demand . He had explained that the originals and copies of ordinary messages sent and received are retained by the company for only six months , but that a. record is always kept of messages relating to the transmission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money transactions mentioned by Orchard , and called J. C. Huston , an official of a Denver bank , but Senator Borah explained that before he could proceed with Mr. Huston 's testimony it would be necessary to have certain papers which were in his office , and as it was near the time for adjournment , Judge Wood decided to stop then and go on half an hour earlier to-morrow .
