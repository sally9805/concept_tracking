I REMEMBER how as a boy I used to roam about the old shipyard at the bend in the river below the town . On long , hot summer afternoons I would sprawl in the shade beneath the bulge of a schooner 's planks and watch the workmen as they climbed about the seaffoldiugs . I loved the spicy smell of the wood , the carpet of chips that gave beneath my feet , the pitch and oakum , the clatter of the mallets , the scrap-ings of the saws . Out upon the river , over the tops of the rushes waving at the water 's edge , I could see the white sails of the ships dropping down to sea , the foam gleaming at their bows , the little black figures of their crews tugging at the halyards , and I would long to get on board of one , with my green sea-chest stowed beneath my bunk . and sail away into the great blue ocean down beyond the bay . From day to day I watched ships g r o w upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of keel to the final day when , with the last shoring knocked away , they slid softly down the tallowed boards and dipped into the water . I knew each boat from stem to stern , from every rib to the last plate upon h e r bottom , to the last bit of tar and fibre stuffed into her scams . As I lay on my back beneath the overhang of a ship 's prow , gazing up at the great stretch of bowsprit sailing . against the summer clouds , I grew to wondering of her fate , dreaming of her life to come in the dim mystery of the future . Visions of coral reefs passed before me , of dark oceans and roaring surfs , blazing sands , palms towering against depths of blue . I saw her crew delving after treasure , scanning parchments yellow with years , stained with rusty blotches , spotted with arrow-heads and thumb-prints . I saw her at strange ports , surrounded by craft of curious build , filled with dark-skinned men in white , and dusky women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the afternoons waned and I grew tired of dreaming , I would leave the boat and go into the little lean-to shed of the old wood-cutter in the corner of the yard . Ile was a small 111f111 with a stoop , long bony hands . and eyes that peered quizzically at you over a pair of wood - rimmed spectacles that he kept far out on the tip of his nose . I-Te was always working a t an elaborate bit of carving or figure-head , and it seem-ed magic the way a face would grow beneath his chisel , Sometimes the daughter of the owner of a ship building in t h e yard would pose for him , and I would sit absorb-ed , watching the modelling of her hair spring from the block of wood . The old woodcutter seemed always glad to see me . He had been a sailor in his day , had been in fights with buccaneers upon the Alain , chased by South Sea pirates , and was full of yarns and snatches of sea tales that made my blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he put away his tools , I would climb down from the stool I always perched upon and wander homeward , my mind ateem with swarthy visages , cutlasses , low black hulls with raking masts , and chests of Spanish gold . That was years ago . The city has spread down the river , far beyond the bend , and engulfed the old shipyard . The great iron sheds of a modern plant have sprung up upon the spot where once I sprawled and watched the scudding ships upon the whitecapped river . Traffic roars about its walls ; office buildings tower skyward ; humanity throngs the streets , surges through countless ferry pours into the vortex of the city . Against the sky stand jagged outlines of mills and gas - tanks , factories , warehouses , elevators , networks of structural steel . Whistles shriek ; street-cars clang ; railroads stretch their tangled webs along the hank ; and back and forth the engines shift , shunting lines of cars , their bells clashing , their stacks vomiting billows of black vapor . The air blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasts from liners , shrieks of tugs ; and now and then come whiffs of oil from the refineries upon the opposite shore , or maybe of spices from a West-Indiaman close by heaving forth her cargo on the wharf . In midstream a frowning battleship , with soaring turrets , rides at anchor , the light gleaming on her guns , and behind her , through a haze of smoke , there comes a glimpse of docks and masts and funnels , and farther on down-stream a tangle of war-vessels at the navy-yard . Within the plant is concentrated energy . Hulls loom upon the ways ? vast frames and ribs of new leviathans ; huge ships of iron , lost amid a maze of scaffoldings . Here grow towering shapes of steel , fighting war-ships of the nation ; cargo vessels , liners , excursion - boats , river steamers , schooners with many masts , revenue - cutters . barges . Some are destined for foreign seas and traffic on strange waters ; some will plough the deeps laden with a country 's products ; some will patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lowering guns , emblems of a nation 's power ; some there are will put . to sea and vanish from man 's ken , their fates locked up forever in a waste of heaving water . Into the shipyard invention pours limitless achievement . Called by modern progress , she brings forth greyhounds , turbines , giant crafts of battle . She harnesses the primal forces and adapts them to her need . Driven by her goad , ships grow mighty on the ways . They fling aside the waves , annihilate the leagues of ocean , gulp down a nation 's freight , track the seas with foam . From all direc-tions men are d r a wri into the shipyard 's grasp ? working hordes , swarming from out the hovels of the city ; sallow clerks , herded over draughting - tables ; architects , chemists , engineers , conning blue-prints , poring over analyses of metals , pondering diagrams of forces ; managers behind their desks , buried in a rush of letters , besieged by telephones , office-boys , importuning agents ; companies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it forests fall ; mines give up mountains of red ore ; mills thunder and furnaces fling out tongues of flame ; railroads pour into its maw an avalanche of steel . Labor crowds its gates . Industry and commerce wait upon its mood . Before it nations empty out their coffers . It is almost noon . Within the shipyard work is at its height . Foundries roar , machine-shops clamor , the powerhouse resounds with the clang of engines , the whir of dynamos . There come the crashings of metal upon metal ; of steel piercing steel ; of huge machines punching , biting , trimming armor plate ; of cranes with great hooks hovering , dropping , soaring with giant loads ; and over all , the thunder of hydraulic haminers , the roar of rivets driven into iron . It pours from mighty shells of ships , from unknown depths beneath the overhang of hulls , from bowels of battleships and liners . Among the meshes of lofty scaffoldings flicker yellow spots of flame where riveters are busy with their charcoal fires . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are flung from man to man . The ground is littered with heaps of shorings , teakwood , chains , sections of engines and of boilers , huge propeller blades of gleaming bronze , vats of scarlet paint . There is a smell of turpentine and grease . In vast interiors , through openings in walls of corrugated iron , men can be seen toiling in the midst of whirling belts . All at once a whistle blows , sounding loud and shrill above the clamor of the yard . Work breaks oif abruptly . The roar of the hammers ceases . A great steel section of a ship , which has been lifted from the ground and is swinging swiftly to the ways , stops in its flight , and hangs motionless between the earth and sky . Through the sudden lull is heard a surging tramp of feet , a multitude of voices , and out from deep re ceases of the scaffoldings , from black shadows beneath the ships , down gang-ways and through machine-shop doors , pour torrents of humanity , motley crowds of many handicrafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron-workers , painters . riggers , calkers , jacks of all trades . Of many lands they are , and tongues ? Americans , English , Irishmen , Greeks , Portuguese , Italians with dangling ear-rings , herculean neg-roes , Slays and Huns , Northmen with shocks of hair showing startlingly white upon their grimy faces . They climb over the lumber piles , sit in rows upon heaps of slier-ings , here and there crowd into chatter- Down at the river 's edge a watchman stands . The huge iron stern of a battleship rises above him . It is punched with rivet-holes ; the great steel plates are vivid with red paint . The water is thick and oily . It breaks sluggishly over the broad boards of the ways which run out from beneath the vessel . The man is oldish-looking , with a long face , deep shadows beneath his cheek-bones , and tattoos of strange design upon his temples . His eyes roam ceaselessly about the yard . " Yer right , " he says , drawing his brows together . " Times ' ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all rush an ' go now . It ai n't ships . It 's machines . Take that gang of Flunkies there . What do they know about a boat ? They 're only here to hammer rivets . They might as well be on a sky-scraper , or workin ' in the Subway . See that chap up in the crane ? He used to run an engin ' on th ' Elevated . There was a fellow like him killed th ' other day in the shop . It was after pay-day , an ' he was careless , an ' did n't rig the chain up proper when they were liftin ' plate . The tackle slipped an ' the plate dropped on him . If he 'd been a sailorman , he 'd ' ve knowed how to hitch the hook . " Half past twelve . The whistle blows . The grimy workmen stream slowly back to work , and again the hydraulic hammers roar . A snarl of vessels lies moored at the dry dock . They are old and battered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the white bones gleaming in their teeth , they made proudly clown the bay , intent on conquest of the seas . Now , vanquished by time and fortune , they have come hack to their place of birth , some but shapeless hulks , huddling together amid a jam of riffraff , as they await their turns within the basin , or to he drawn once more upon the ways . Here are hulls with black holes yawning in their sides ; stackless liners with broken engines , dilapidated boilers , and cracked propeller shafts ; tank ships with loosened plates , careening heavily , their holds half full of water ; steamers of every sort with cabins torn away , shreds of rigging dangling like devastated cobwebs from their masts , rudderless , paintless , streaked with rust . Broken , beaten , stained with salt and seaweed , they speak of distant lands , of mysteries of strange horizons , of storm and tempest and typhoon . Within the basin a steamer is docking . The hydraulic gates are shut , the pumping-engines clang , an exhaust-pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush about waving signals , lowering props against the ship . There come sharp orders from the master of the dock , who stands with folded arms at the edge of the basin . The crew are still on board . They line the rails , chattering and gesticulating ; thrust curious heads through rows of ports . The water sinks rapidly . The steamer settles on the blocks , and soon her battered bottom comes to view . She is an old bunt , scarred by seas . The great plates beneath her water-line are seamed with rust ; the paint has vanished ; the iron is eaten into furrows by years of seething water ; barnacles sprout about her keels , clustering thickly on one an-ether , here and there heaping into chains of hills , spurs of which run off in all directions and disappear into the shadows beneath her hull ; growths of seaweed cling upon her sides , oozing moisture , combed into dark-green traceries . At Itmgth the dock is empty . Its wooden , step-like walls are dripping and covered with slippery moss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship into broad , dark . slimy pools . Water splashes through leaks in the gates ; the air smells dank and marshy , and reeks of river mud . Men scramble down into the basin and attack the steamer . Clad in oilskins , they chick in and out beneath the hull , cleaning , scraping , painting , hosing down the sides . Beneath the stern , they gather in a knot about the screw . One blade is missing , the others are twisted and blunted and caked with rust . The blows of a sledge-hammer ring out loudly ; the men shout at one another as they strive to loosen the propeller from the shaft . One of the owners of the boat ? a tali man in a long rain-coat that flaps about his ankles ? watches them anxiously . His patent - leather shoes are flecked with mud . The foreman hurries about , giving directions . " Oh , this ship 's all right , " he says , in answer to your question . " She only wants a bit of washing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago , and Ieft a blade there in the chain so 's to remember their meeting . But she needed a new screw bad . The old one was all but done for , as it was , by the ice last winter . " The river is aflame with bunting . A battleship is to be launched , and throughout the shipyard it is holiday . The cranes are still , the foundries quiet . the shops have ceased their tumult , lofty skeletons of ships wait silent and deserted . The war-ship , stripped of scaffoldings , towers on the ways . The crowds arrive ; the grand stands are thronged with people . Photographers go about with black cloths flying ; reporters jot down notes , statistics of the battleship , results of wars . Upon the christening platform , beneath the great red " battle prow , the launching party chatters gayly . Uniforms glitter ; naval officials strut around importantly ; the cxtx ? No 709 ? 8president of the yard goes to and fro , worried and preoccupied . The Governor 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roses , waits nervously the launching signal . The tide is at the flood . At the river 's edge workmen stand expectant . The last block has been knocked away . A hush . The crowds grow still . Suddenly there is a shout . The mighty mass of steel begins to move ? glass crashes on her prow . there comes a burst of cheering . a din of whistles , a thunder of a cruiser 's guns . and the battleship , sliding down the smoking ways , plunges into the water . Sundown . Through the shipyard 's gates a horde of workmen pours , and is swallowed by the city . The air blows cold from the river . From the navy-yard there comes a distant bugle-call , the sound of evening-gun fire . The lights of ships twinkle , and in the soaring office-buildings a myriad windows gleam . The shipyard 's day is over . The watchman makes ready for the night .
