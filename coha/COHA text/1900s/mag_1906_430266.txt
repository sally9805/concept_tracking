 | FOUNDED and for a time operated on Socialistic principles , not yet entirely free of these , although many of the original plans of organization have been found impractical , the Caledonia coal mine , located within the limits of the city of Saginaw , Michigan , offers interesting ground for study as a sociological experiment . This mine occupies a unique position in the mining world . A similar plan has , in a few instances , been put into execution in other branches of labor , but probably no other mine of the kind exists in the world . The Caledonia is , as its retail wagons boast , " the workingman 's mine . " It is a mine organized and put into operation by ordinary miners , with little or no capital , and in the face of the opposition of a most powerful trust " backed by the chief railroads . Starting in a small way about a year and a half ago , it has rapidly grown and prospered until to-day , although the original shaft has not yet been fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business basis and is literally overwhelmed with orders . To understand fully what the Caledonia mine is , and what it has done , it is necessary to glance for a moment at the conditions prevailing before its organization . About ten years ago the people of the Saginaw Valley began to realize the possibilities of their coal fields . These were hailed with great satisfaction . The lumber industries , for which the valley was once famous , had for some years been declining and then were suddenly destroyed by unfavorable tariff laws . With lumber went the manufacture of salt , and the valley was face to face with the first great crisis of its existence . Cheap fuel would bring new industries , and thus restore to the valley that old and vigorous life which seemed for a time to have departed forever . All looked forward to a boom , but , although the valley has been slowly recovering from its period of depression and is again making substantial growth , no boom ever came , simply because cheap fuel never materialized . Coal is being mined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even within the city limits , and in such close promixity to public buildings that the latter have begun to settle in consequence . But practically at no time has the price been reduced . Combinations among the operators have , in some instances , kept the local rate even higher than that prevailing outside . Usually the retail price has started in the fall at $4 or thereabouts , and has risen , with the advance of the season , to $4.50 per ton . Up to a few months ago there were two main coal companies or combinations of coal companies in the vicinity of Saginaw ? the Consolidated Coal Company and the Saginaw Coal Company . These had leased practically all the known available coal land , and were paying advance royalties on such as they were not actually mining . Among the land thus controlled was a little tract of forty acres in the southern portion of the city . One of the big companies controlled the land all around this , and under the circumstances , as it seemed that a tract that size would hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the advance royalties by allowing the lease to lapse . In some way several miners became apprised of the fact that the little tract of land was no longer leased . At least one of these had drilled the forty acres for test purposes , and had some idea of their actual value . These men conceived the idea of the Caledonia Company , and set about its organization with all secrecy and despatch . An optional lease on the property was taken out , promises of support and subscriptions for stock were  | secured , and it was only when the work of sinking the shaft had actually begun that the formation of the company became known . Thus the property was snatched from under the very nose of the big company . The leaders of this movement were themselves Socialists and firm believers in the doctrines of Socialism ; consequently the plan of the Caledonia Company was worked out on Socialistic principles . The company was to consist of one hundred men , each of whom had subscribed for ten shares of stock at ten dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every man was to have the same rights and interest in the mine as every other , contribute the same , and receive the same returns . On July 22 , 1905 , although the organization had not yet been perfected , the work of sinking the shaft was begun . About sixty-five persons had subscribed for stock . Few of these had paid in ; some expected to pay in labor . Thus , all told , in actual cash the company possessed only about one hundred and seventy-five dollars . But every stockholder assisted in sinking the shaft . Every man had an equal share in the company , and was actually working for himself . The finest spirit and enthusiasm prevailed , the work was rushed , and the shaft was sunk with extraordinary rapidity to its present depth of one hundred and sixty-five feet . On September 1 coal was sold from the new mine , which was destined to play an important part in the coal situation of the valley . But progress in clearing away the rock and waste , to supply proper entries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , and it was some time before the Caledonia was prepared for regular business . Meanwhile the great coal companies of the valley paid little attention to the new mine , and advanced their price to the regular winter figure of $4.50 per ton . As soon as their mine was in proper condition , the Caledonia people put coal on the market at $4.25 . The other coal companies were furious , and at a meeting with the Caledonia representatives the operators presented their ultimatum : " You have got to come up to our figure of $4.50 . You have a little fortyacre patch of ground with an undeveloped mine . You have no capital , but are dependent on the returns from your coal to carry on the development of your mine . You know the price of life . What are you going to do about it ? " For answer the Caledonia dropped the price to $4 , then to $3.50 ? just a dollar under the operators ' price . " We can put out coal at this price and still make a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingmen , not thieves . The public is our best friend , and we propose to stand by it . " When this action of the Caledonia became known , the operators were prompt with their answer . One of the companies rushed several cars of coal to the south end of the city , which it sold , from a point almost directly in front of the Caledonia mine , at the startling price of $1.75 . The whole affair was suppressed as far as possible . The move was intended to bring the little group of miners to their senses , and immediate effect was anticipated . For the greater share of the Caledonia coal was sold in the vicinity of the mine , and by selling from this point , secretly , the operators expected to cut off their rival 's customers without reaching their own in the city at large . These conditions lasted two days . In the meantime the Caledonia people had not yet yielded or shown any signs of doing so . Not only this , but the public stood by them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine could supply . The general public had learned of the $1.75 coal , meanwhile , and the customers taking advantage of the price were largely those the operators least desired . It was evident that a different move was necessary . Accordingly , the general retail price for the whole city was dropped to $3 ? fifty cents below that of the Caledonia ? where it has since remained . The Caledonia coal has remained at the old price , $3.50 , and there are enough people who appreciate the fact that the present low prices are due directly to the influence of the so-called Socialist mine , who realize that this is the key to the coal situation , and who  | appreciate the efforts , the originality and perseverance of the workers thereof , to keep them piled far ahead with orders . The operators boasted last fall that the little mine was powerless , that it was too small and had too little influence to affect prices . " Do you people , with a little forty-acre mine , think for an instant that you can fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is actually what has been done . The operators have been forced to drop their prices $1.50 per ton , and at the end of the season the little Socialist mine is stronger than ever before , with advance orders enough already to keep it running all summer . The strike this spring has also proved most fortunate for the Caledonia mine , although it has brought new problems to the other miners and their organizations . Shortly before the expiration of the old agreement between miners and operators , it was announced that the Caledonia would continue to operate . The Michigan miners are , of course , thrown out with the general bituminous strike this spring . The Caledonia is the only coal mine in the State which has been operated since the first of April . Consequently , although only permanent customers have been taken care of , the mine has been greatly assisted in its struggle . So far the miners have shown excellent judgment . They have treated their customers fairly , openly , and honestly , and this fact is appreciated . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bigger operators are working the same vein of coal on both sides of it , the coal at the particular location of the Caledonia mine actually contains less sulphur and iron than at perhaps any other point in the valley , and is , consequently , of higher quality . Those most influential in organizing the Caledonia Company , as well as the greater number of the original members , were professed Socialists and firm believers in Socialistic doctrines . Naturally , their beliefs found expression in the plan of the new company , and several principles new in the Michigan mining world were introduced . The company is really a little democracy in itself , or , more properly , the freeest kind of republic , for it is a representative government with every opportunity for reference back to the main body . The details of the work are left in the hands of a Board of Managers , but this is at all times accountable to , and liable to be overruled by , the miners as a whole , the general body . The details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appeal may be taken from his decision to the Board of Managers at any time , however , and from this back again to the general body . The members of the company as miners are paid regular wages , by the company , from the money secured from the sale of the coal . Whatever profit remains over and above this is later paid out to the miners in the form of dividends . So far , however , all the profits have been retained and put into developing the mine , so that really all the miners have received is the amount of their wages . At the outset every member of the Caledonia Company was on an equal footing , theoretically , at all times , with every other member . Each had invested exactly the same amount ; consequently each was to receive an equal share of the profits and equal wages . Respecting the dividends this was equitable and natural distribution , as each man controlled the same amount of stock . The error of the scheme lay in the arrangement regarding wages , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a purely monetary basis the scheme was fair enough , perhaps , but it soon became evident that a man 's mining assets were not confined to the amount of stock he held . The practical miner 's experience and ability made his services of greater value to the company than those of the fireman or pusher . Both were investing their services in the company , and the more valuable services were entitled to the greater remuneration . The idea that every man in the mine must be tied down by the fireman became intolerable , and the necessary change was made . The men now receive wages largely according to the Michigan scale , although with some differences in scale and appli- cation . The scale is applied to the coal " mine run " ? a concession which united labor has been vainly endeavoring to secure from the Michigan operators for some time . In addition it is applied to a thirty-six-inch vein of coal , whereas in other mines the scale is based on a thirty-inch vein , which is much more difficult to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per diem over the scale . But three men in the company receive regular salaries ? the mine superintendent , the secretary and sales manager , and one weigher . The minimum wages paid is $2.01 ; the average is about $2.75 . This is considerably above the Michigan scale . Originally it was planned by those in charge to divide the mine into one hundred equal parts , and to assign to each member of the company one of these as his own . This he was to mine himself at his own pleasure , and from the coal contained therein he was to receive his returns from the mine . The shaft , entries , etc. , were to be worked in common , but the greater body of the coal was to be mined individually . Thus the better and more energetic workmen would realize first on their labor . Press of work was largely responsible for the fact that this project was never carried out . Orders piled in on the little mine , and in their haste to take advantage of the prosperous season the miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort . The plan will never be revived again , as the miners realize that it can never be worked out satisfactorily . The change in the management also had something to do with the death of the project , as the old leaders who had been favoring it went out in disgrace . And thereby hangs a tale . For at one time the Caledonia nearly fell by the wayside with internal troubles . It was found that some of the originators of the company were running it entirely for their own benefit . Instead of the equal distribution which had been harped on as one of the main features of the organization , these men controlled excessively large blocks of the stock . In addition it developed that one of them had taken out the lease to the property in his own name , and was receiving an additional royalty of two cents for every ton of coal mined . The other miners quietly organized among themselves and put the matter in the hands of a capable attorney , with the result that the offending members were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed among the remainder . Since that time the affairs of the company have been most capably managed , and the little mine has come through the winter and the trying time of a general strike throughout the country with flying colors . The Caledonia is the only mine in the State of Michigan which is unaffected by labor troubles , or which is not closed down pending the signing of a new scale . The company knows no differences between miners and operators . What is for the interests of one is for the interests of the other , for every man is at once miner and operator . The course of the mine in keeping open during the strike has been approved not only by the miners of the Michigan district but by President Mitchell himself . But this feature of the case has raised new difficulties for the United Mine Workers . With no other similar mine in the country , the Caledonia presents an absolutely new and unique situation , and one with which the other miners have been at a loss to cope . Shortly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be unaffected , and that it would continue to mine coal , strike or no strike . This excited the immediate hostility of the operators , and elicited the threat that , in case the Caledonia should continue to operate during the strike , non-union men would be introduced into the other mines of the valley . The threat was never carried out , but it caused considerable uneasiness to the Michigan miners . Accordingly , at the annual meeting of the Michigan district of the United Mine Workers , the question was raised as to the status of the Caledonia mine . The Executive Committee wrestled with the problem and proved unable to find a satisfactory answer . A special committee was appointed , and when at length this reported , the battle was fought out again  | on the floor of the convention . It was finally decided that the members of the Caledonia Company must be classified as operators , as they were in direct competition with the operators , the employers of the other miners , with whom , rather than with the Caledonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time a resolution was passed to the effect that united labor should not interfere with the little mine as long as it was run on union principles . Up to this time the Caledonia had formed a local of its own . The charter of this has now been revoked and the mine is no longer recognized by the United Mine Workers . But , in spite of everything , internal knavery , " trust " opposition , and repudiation by the United Mine Workers , the Caledonia has continued to prosper . So successful , indeed , has it been that at a recent meeting of the stockholders it was decided greatly to enlarge the company . The capital stock is to be increased from the present $50,000 to $250,000 , which will raise the number of men composing the company from one hundred to five hundred . Some six hundred acres of coal have been leased , and the work of locating one of the shafts for this has already begun . As fast as new men can be used they will be admitted to the company until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to work the old Caledonia mine , the new men taking care of the new shafts . Only practical miners are admitted , and every stockholder must do actual work in the mine . At present there is but one member of the company , the secretary and sales manager , not actually employed at the mine . The Caledonia is naturally drawing the best class of miners in the State . The freedom and independence attached to the work , the high wages and the prospect of still further returns in the form of dividends , are extremely desirable , and the list of applications for stock is a long and constantly increasing one . The Caledonia mine is an important step in the struggle of labor for social and industrial liberty . It represents the efforts of some of the more enterprising of the miners to secure relief from capital oppression ; to work , not for others , but for themselves ; to become industrially independent . But the Caledonia is not yet beyond the possibility of disruption . The inequality of wages , or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an internal revolution . But although changes in the details and principles of the government are being made from time to time , no general dissatisfaction with the main plan has yet arisen , nor has there been any difficulty in reaching agreements . There are some who question the ability of such an organization to exist . But this much the history of the mine has developed ? the downfall of the Caledonia can come only from internal dissension . What Michigan miners have done in the Caledonia mine others can do elsewhere , and the same plan can be extended to other branches of labor . Already another company has been formed along similar lines , and the enthusiasm of the miners argues for the formation of still others in the near future .
