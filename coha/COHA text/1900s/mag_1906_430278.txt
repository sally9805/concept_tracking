 | WITHIN an hour after the earthquake the Mayor was on his way down town . On the way he met a company of soldiers from Fort Mason . He stopped their captain and asked where they were going . " I have been ordered by General Funston to report to the Mayor or the Chief of Police at the City Hall , " replied the soldier . " I am the Mayor , " said Mr. Schmitz . " Report to me at the Hall of Justice . The City Hall is a complete wreck . " Here were two big men equal to the emergency . General Funston , with a fine disregard for the requirements of official regulations and legal red tape , offered his assistance promptly and generously . Mayor Schmitz , with equal decision and an equal appreciation of the needs of the moment , accepted the offer in the spirit in which it was made . For many weeks the army-has worked in co-operation with the city 's representatives , giving service that was invaluable and indispensable . In the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The army has aided the police department to maintain order , the health department to maintain health , the entire city to regain its equilibrium . " The city , however , has never been under martial law . The Mayor was at all times in command , and the soldiers were under his orders just as the police were . Mayor Schmitz , as soon as he reached his emergency office , appointed a Committee of Fifty , composed of the best men in the community , regardless of party lines or personal relationships . Prominent among its membership was James D. Phelan , formerly Mayor of San Francisco , one of its leading citizens , and a firm opponent of Mayor Schmitz . Nevertheless , he was made chairman by the Mayor of the most important of the sub-committees , that on finance , and has been giving his whole time and energy to the service of the city , in spite of his own great personal losses . The committee met at three o'clock in the afternoon , and the Mayor told me with pride that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been carried out . There was plenty for them to do , however , and the committee met daily until May 5 , when it was superseded by the Committee of Reconstruction , of forty members . Each member of the Committee of Fifty was made a personal representative of the Mayor , having delegated to him the same authority that the Mayor would have if present in person . In the work of notifying and bringing together the members of the Mayor 's committee , in the fire-fighting , and in the strenuous relief work of the first weeks the automobile proved itself invaluable . Motor-cars were popular in San Francisco , and in the destruction of the means of transportation and communication was their opportunity . Many owners offered their machines , and many had them appropriated at the point of the bayonet . The automobile took the place of the telephone and the street-cars ; it carried the wounded to hospitals , and dynamite to the fire-fighters . One prominent citizen volunteered the services of his machine for the dynamite squad , and then , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . not do himself , he took an exciting ride through the crowded streets with a precarious load of explosives in the tonneau surmounted by a nonchalant Jacky . Stringent regulations were made against looting , for the preservation of sanitary conditions , and for the prevention of fire and disorder . No toilets in the houses were permitted to be used , temporary latrines being dug in back yards and vacant lots . No fires were allowed in stoves , for fear of fire from the many injured chimneys , and no lights  | permitted except candles . In the past three weeks I have not eaten a meal in San Francisco that was not cooked in the gutter , or used any light but a flickering candle . Taps was sounded at eight o'clock , and after that hour no lights could burn and no one was allowed on the street except on a matter of almost life and death . A candle burning later brought the rap of a rifle-butt on the door and the curt order , " Lights out ! " The hour for taps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were running and the street lights in order again was the curfew rule given up . All saloons and liquor stores were ordered closed , and decisive measures taken to enforce the order . At grocery stores which had a stock of liquors a soldier and a policeman were posted at the door while food supplies were being given away . As each man came out , if he carried a bottle , a quick down stroke of the bayonet smashed it , and perhaps a smart rap on the wrist or knuckles emphasized the inadvisability of indulgence . The prompt closing of the saloons , together with the presence of the soldiers and the probability that many of the vicious characters of the city took advantage of the free transportation of the first days to seek more remunerative fields , has made San Francisco a model of order and peacefulness . The heads of the police force assure me that the city has never been so quiet ; there is no violence or crime . With nerves shaken by the earthquake , and driven from home by the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency the Southern Pacific Railroad , like so many other organizations and individuals , rose to the occasion . Its great ferryboats running to the Oakland pier did not miss a single trip . For ten days its gates were thrown open and refugees were carried free to any point on its lines . On the day after the earthquake 1,037 cars were moved out of San Francisco , and in the first nine days over 6,000 cars were sent out . In that time the road carried , without charge , to interior California points , 67,000 persons ; to other States , 7,684 persons ; and to points around San Francisco Bay , 226 , - 000 . In addition , 185,000 were carried who paid fares . The railway company handled the immense traffic thrown unexpectedly upon it without accident to a single passenger , without a mishap to any of the hundreds of extra trains , and almost without delay . On the night of April 20 Oakland pier was clear of people and fumigated by 1 A.M. , and the succeeding night found the pier cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed passengers , and an improvised hotel was opened in the temporary general passenger office in the large waiting-room upstairs . The rush from the Third and Valencia Street stations of the Southern Pacific was more melodramatic . With a sea of flame driving them southward , the passengers swarmed in and over the cars , riding out of town on the roofs and steps , or wherever a foothold could be secured . At the very beginning trainmen and conductors were advised that all rules were suspended in favor of one ? the people must be moved from the city , whether or not they had tickets . The task of providing for the most immediate need of the people ? the need of food ? was undertaken at once by the army , in co-operation with the Mayor 's Committee . The commissary storehouses at Presidio , Fort Mason , and Fort Miley were thrown open , and rations issued to all who came . Bread was baked in large quantities , and coffee made in great kettles . The Commissary-General ordered 100,000 rations shipped from Portland , 300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks of grocery stores and provision shops were commandeered and distributed direct from their doors . Cars of supplies in the railroad yards were taken possession of and given out . Relief stations sprang up wherever the food was found , and to every one who applied something was given , for every one needed it . The " bread line " in those first days was a living example of the childhood rhyme , " Rich man , poor man , beggar man , thief , Doctor , lawyer , merchant , chief . " The line , too , was not without its humors . A young woman , after a weary hour spent in moving slowly toward the door of a grocery store , received a cake  | of soap ? with water , even for drinking , all but unattainable ! On the morning of the 19th three thousand tents were distributed from the Presidio warehouse , and camps began to be established in open spaces throughout the city . Forty thousand pairs of army shoes were issued at various relief stations , and supplied an imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two weeks after the earthquake was reduced to its lowest terms he walked . San Francisco 's distances , especially since the fire , are not short ; and the hills that rise before you , wherever you are going , make a trip from the ferry to the Presidio or to Golden Gate Park an affair of moment . The refugee 's one pair of shoes for there was n't much chance to save more than one -- could n't last long on those distances , those hard pavements , those rough piles of brick and debris . During my stay in San Francisco I have hardly entered a street-car or walked three blocks without seeing a pair of the unmistakable army shoes . On the 20th the trains of relief supplies began to come in from near-by points . The list of the places where the cars of supplies came from in the early days reads like a roll-call of the cities and towns of California and the coast . Little villages of hardly five hundred inhabitants sent a car-load , and often followed it with a money contribution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into San Francisco over the Southern Pacific Railroad . For the first two weeks the relief work was carried on without regard to expense . Food and shelter were provided unstintedly and without discrimination . The one object kept steadfastly in view was to prevent any one from going hungry or unhoused . This object was successfully accomplished , and to this fact is doubtless due in great measure , together with the life out-of-doors , the extraordinary immunity from sickness . Any privation would have reduced the power of the people to resist disease and have paved the way for a rapid spread of sickness , if not for an epidemic . The health of the city has been extraordinary . Mayor Schmitz told me that there were only half as many cases of disease as there were a month before the disaster . The excellent sanitary conditions maintained by the army must also be given a share in the credit for this fine record . With the arrival of Dr. Edward T. Devine , the personal representative of the Secretary of War in his capacity as President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving of relief began . Now , a month after the disaster , system has been to a great extent installed , and every day the work is increasing in economy and effectiveness . Dr. Devine 's long experience in directing and co-ordinating relief measures among the poor of New York City , his keenness of judgment , his endless energy , and his tact have made him invaluable in the direction of the work in San Francisco . The Red Cross representative , the Finance Committee of the Mayor , and the army are working together in complete harmony and mutual confidence . The committee , of which ex-Mayor Phelan is the chairman , is responsible foi the funds , and exercises control of the work , with the Red Cross as its executive arm . The actual work of receiving , storing , handling , and distributing supplies and of controlling the camps is done by the army under MajorGeneral Greely . The problem of relief has passed from its first phase , of provision for unprecedented emergency conditions which could be met effectively only by a lavish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem now is to provide wisely and economically for conditions which must in the nature of the case continue for at least several months to come . Thousands are homeless , and must be , as far as I can see , for an indefinite time . The homes in the unburned section are full ; and no move to build new dwellings in the burned district has yet begun . To house these thousands comfortably and under the best conditions for health and good order , a dozen camps have been organized , to which the people are gradually being moved from the scattered and informal groups of tents which sprang up in the first confused days .  | I have visited three of these camps in widely separated parts of the city , and each has its own individuality . In a glade in Golden Gate Park three streets of barracks have been built , where each family or group of men or women has a two-room apartment , clean and well ventilated . Groups of tents , also neatly drawn up in streets , surround the barracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each street are stoves and fireplaces where the food given out from a spacious building at the head of the camp is cooked . Running water is available at intervals , the sanitary arrangements are excellent , and buildings with shower baths and with set tubs . for washing clothes are being put up . On a knoll at one side among the trees hospital tents are ready , and a genial little army surgeon has his eyes very wide open for any symptoms of disease . The camp is in charge of a lieutenant , who has under him a corporal , affectionately styled his Chief of Police , and three privates . He allows none of his men to carry arms , and is rather proud of the good order of his camp . " ' These people are almighty tired of the rifle , " said he . " They 've had it morning , noon , and night for a month , and I 've heard what they think about it . In fact , I 've heard a good many things since I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If anybody had told me a month ago that I 'd talk to any woman the way I 've had to to some here , there 'd have been a fight right then and there . " The lieutenant , by the way , is a Kentuckian . But a walk with him through the camp seemed to show that his charges like him and that his rule , though necessarily despotic , is thoroughly benevolent . The surroundings of the camp are delightful , the luxuriant trees and the green grass making a setting which , taken together with the general comfort and neatness of the camp itself , well justify the Mayor 's comment , " I 'm only afraid these people will never want to leave their new homes here . " In the southeast corner of the city , in the Potrero district , another camp presents quite a different aspect . It is composed of the big conical yellow tents of the army . It stands on a flat space innocent of grass or trees , and its uninteresting surroundings of factories and railroad yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park . Here live two thousand persons , almost entirely from the laboring class . A captain of cavalry is in command , and he finds that the rifle still has its uses . As I reached the camp , a car-load of lumber for tent floors had just come in , and a squad of soldiers was collecting the idle men in the camp to unload it . Willing or unwilling , they had to spend a couple of hours in work for the common good . The despotism was a little more in evidence than it had been in the park , but the benevolence , while better disguised , was unmistakably there . The third camp is situated in a square near Fort Mason , and is composed of dingy white wall tents , giving it its own distinctive appearance . Its population of twenty-four hundred is more varied in character , including several doctors , dentists , and artists . At the Potrero camp the officer in command estimated that ninety per cent . of the men were at work , while here only about ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well regulated , healthful , and comfortable , and the people look contented and happy . The vital aspect of the food problem has now radically changed . At first the endeavor was to feed every one ; now it is to see that none get food but those who absolutely need it . The city is divided into seven sections , and each of the sections into ten or fifteen districts , with a relief station near the center of each . In each section a double organization of the army and the Red Cross works side by side in the distribution of supplies . When the army is withdrawn , the Red Cross will have its organization ready trained to carry on the work . A registration is being made of every family or party that is receiving relief , by a system of cards , which , when filled out , will give detailed information as to the number in the family , the previous occupation and present employment of the breadwinner , membership in fraternal orders , churches , and clubs , plans for the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-teachers , who visit  | each family in its home and get as full and accurate information as possible . The number of rations issued has already greatly decreased , from 268,000 on May 3 to less than 100,000 two weeks later . The registration will reduce this number to a considerable extent by affording a basis for weeding out applicants who are able to work or are unworthy or shiftless . The distribution of supplies is carried on with admirable system and a minimum of waste . From the railways and the docks the stores are brought to three warehouses in different parts of the city . Here they are given out on requisitions from the managers of the relief stations , approved by the heads of the respective sections . A visit to the Moulder school-house , one of the distributing centers , showed almost ideal warehouse conditions maintained in a building constructed for quite different purposes . Captain Killian , in charge , took the greatest pride in the good order and neatness of his domain . ' Each kind of food was piled separately , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One room was filled with breakfast foods , or " mush , " as the local vernacular has it ; another contained more kinds of condensed milk and cream than I ever heard of ; the hallway was lined with piles of cases of canned corned beef , roast beef , dried beef , salmon , sardines , candles , and soap . A room was used for special foods issued only to hospitals soups , malted milk , jams , and other delicacies . In the yard , under a shed , hams , bacon , sausages , and lard were arranged , each ham hanging on its own nail , the bacon piled in well-ventilated stacks . A great refrigerator , built for the purpose , held fresh meat , while across the street among the ruins the sidewalk was filled with piles of sacks of potatoes , arranged , as the Captain pointed out , so that the air could get at every one and prevent rotting . Even the streets around the building were kept swept , and everything was as neat and clean as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for food is being introduced in parts of the city , and it will be extended as rapidly as arrangements can be made . Food kitchens have been started , where those who can afford it are served hot , nourishing meals for fifteen cents each , and those who have no money receive a similar ( though not quite so elaborate ) meal in return for a ticket issued by the relief committee . The first kitchens were installed by a contractor accustomed to feeding railway employees on a large scale , who was sent to San Francisco with five complete camp outfits by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce . Other kitchens will be put up as fast as contractors can be secured to undertake them . The meal tickets are redeemed by the relief committee at ten cents each , and at these prices the contractor can furnish good , substantial meals in large numbers at a profit . This method of providing relief is vastly more economical than the distribution of uncooked supplies , and encourages selfsupport . No man who had or could earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free table , where he would have to stand in line for a long time before his turn came . The distribution of clothing is another important part of the work of relief . A typical conversation which I heard repeated in substance a score of times illustrates the need : " Hello , Jim ! have n't seen you since the blow-off . Burned out ? " " Sure . Were you ? " " Oh , yes . Did you save anything ? " " What I have on , " with a grin . " Same here , " with equal cheerfulness . " What you have on " will answer the purpose very well for a few days , but the need for a replenishment of the wardrobe becomes rapidly imperative , and a donation of a few garments is very welcome . The clothing supply is kept in two school-houses , arranged like department stores , the one for new clothes , the other for second-hand . From these warehouses the articles are sent out on requisition to the relief stations for each particular case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is to be seen carried on with materials supplied by a private individual . A carload of dress goods and sewing materials and over a hundred sewing machines are  | used by the refugees for making clothes for themselves . Experienced cutters and machine operators have volunteered their services in aid of their less skillful companions , gladly accepting the opportunity to make a few garments for themselves as compensation for their services . Now that the most immediate and pressing needs have been provided for ? shelter , food , and clothing ? special needs are in large measure receiving the attention of the committee . Many individual cases are found where a little judicious aid in the form of money or of special relief will set a man on his feet and make him self-supporting again , or take an entire family out of the category of dependents . A house-painter or plasterer or carpenter needs a new set of tools to take up his trade again , a dentist has lost all his instruments and is helpless without them , a huckster needs a horse and wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start life independently again if they had some furniture , or a man knows of em-. employment he could get in some other city if he could get there . Every case of this kind is investigated with the greatest care , with reference to character , ownership of property , insurance , savings bank account , and general worthiness , and a loan made , or tools , furniture , transportation , or money furnished to meet the need . This work of rehabilitation is of a more permanent and far-reaching character than the emergency work which in the first few weeks crowded everything else into the background . It will be a great aid in the restoration of normal conditions in San Francisco , and will be prosecuted energetically and freely , but with every precaution to prevent fraud . The big-hearted , generous response of the people of the United States to San Francisco 's need is too well known to require description . The Finance Committee has received over six and one-half millions of dollars , and I have heard unofficially , but from an unquestioned source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and available , but not yet delivered to the Committee . The work of the relief of San Francisco is one in which every State , and I believe almost every city and town in the country , has had a share . The sinews of war have been provided with a lavish hand , and the campaign in the field has been carried on with energy , thoroughness , and economy . In this unprecedented emergency the people of the United States , the people of San Francisco , and the men and women to whose lot it fell to administer affairs , have all made good .
