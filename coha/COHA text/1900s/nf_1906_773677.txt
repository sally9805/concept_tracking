txt THE NEW EARTH it , a timber famine in the future is inevitable . Fire , wasteful and destructive forms of lumbering , and the legitimate use , taken together , arc destroying our forest resources far more rapidly than they are being replaced . It is difficult to imagine what such a timber famine would mean to our resources . And the period of recovery from the injuries which a timber famine would entail would be measured by the slow growth of the trees themselves . " While all indications point to a gradual national extension of the views of the - President , resulting in checking forest destruction before it is too late , the work of the individual states in the period of the New Earth has itself been significant . Steps are being taken in many states to protect the forests from fire , to provide reserves , and to take advantage of the example of other countries in reforesting cutover areas ; but perhaps the most interesting of all the developments is the creation of forests in states where thay have not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be illustrated than by selecting the state of Kansas as an example of what is being accomplished , a prairie state beset with heavy winds , needing // the protection of forest windbreaks and far removed from the timbered regions . It was thirty-three years ago , in 1,8 Z2 , -a date which may not arbitrarily be chosen as the beginning of New Earth activities , as they lap over and interweave from past days , but which , nevertheless , fairly well indicates the beginnings of the new order , ? that the experiment station of the Kansas State Agricultural College began the planting of forest trees . It was one of the first experiments of the station , though many species had been planted and propagated before . The experiment , as it has developed through the generation , has been rich in results . Many kinds of trees were planted , some of them with good promise of success , others essentially tentative . Land was selected least adapted to ordinary agriculture , high , gravelly and broken ridges , the object being to show the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally , the growth was not so rapid nor so vigorous as it would have been on lower and richer soil , but the station authorities showed the soundness of their knowledge in making such choice . // European larch , white ash , red ash , green ash , Osage orange , catalpa , ailanthus , black walnut , white hickory , soft maple and willow were first selected . Some of the trees were not successful , notably the European larch , but the others pressed slowly forward . Later came other trees , Norway maple , box-elder , hard maple , honey locust , coffee bean , Russian mulberry , cottonwood , Lombardy poplar , silver poplar , hackberry , plane tree and the sturdy oaks , red , black , bur , pin , shingle , yellow chestnut , swamp white oak and English oak among them . Then carne the conifers , and here was shown one of the wisest steps in all the work . The station . authorities held that " whether studied from the standpoint of the landscape artist , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , or from the standpoint of the stock-feeder who realizes that windbreaks save corn , and corn is money , the evergreens are to be considered as among the most beautiful and useful trees . " Austrian and Scotch pine , white , pitch and Table mountain pines , cedars and spruces were the principal cone-bearing trees planted . The success of the planting of these forest // trees has been pronounced . Some of the pines have reached a height of over forty feet , being over a foot in diameter at the ground and from six to eight inches at six feet from the ground , while other trees have had equally satisfactory results . It has been demonstrated that even in a prairie state , far removed from mountain regions , the pines and other trees which we naturally associate with those regions may be raised at such a rate of growth as to make them profitable for lumber ; while trees for mere ornament , for windbreak or fuel also make comparatively rapid and wholly satisfactory growth . Here , as in the work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the future that must be looked to . The farmer of the New Earth who today begins the planting of trees upon his Kansas farm , in line with the information he may obtain free of cost from his is state experiment station , through bulletins issued from time to time as the work has progressed , may not only live to reap handsomely himself from the tree harvesting , but he may he assured that all the generations following him will stand grateful debtors to him . // And so it is going throughout the other states , everywhere these beginnings of forests , following the splendid stimulations of the scientific men of the New Earth , who have so unselfishly been at work to spread among the people what may be termed practical knowledge , as distinguished from that which is eminently true and sound , but is not so arranged , digested and set forth as to be of real help to the people . In addition to its own individual work , the Kansas Station has worked in cooperation with the Bureau of Plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in testing tree seeds ; the state , as well as the nation , thus reaping doubly from the experiments . Here all manner of problems incident to making prairie forests are worked out . The results are of marked aid to the service . Kansas has been visited by disastrous floods , and forestry is being called into play to prevent them . In France , a century ago , forestry came to the aid of the people in a somewhat similar way . Along the French coasts , for centuries , the sand had been encroaching upon the fertile regions , converting them into a // desert . " It was , " in the words of Ambassador Jusserand of that country , at the meeting at which the President made the remarks quoted above , " like a death powder covering our land . " Trees were set out to check the encroachment of the sands , and the country was reclaimed . So in Kansas , the plan of treeplanting along the sandy banks of streams that in high water overflow their boundaries is being followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the flood regions through the bulletins of the state experiment station . The cottonwood tree , a tree of very rapid growth , seems peculiarly suited for flood prevention . A thicket of cottonwood trees along the banks of the Kansas River grew so rapidly that , in twenty years , some of the largest measured over one hundred feet in height , two feet in diameter at the ground and a foot and a half in diameter twenty feet above ground . The average trees were seventy-five feet in height . Not only may these trees form a protection against floods , but , when harvested properly , afford a considerable revenue ; for , though soft of texture , such wood is growing steadily in demand // for packing-cases and barrels . The average price paid by dealers for this wood , for selected stock , is twenty-two dollars per thousand feet ; while , for fuel , the cottonwood is worth three dollars per cord when oak is worth five dollars . The flood land is generally so low that the roots of the trees find abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate and complete water or flood check . The banks once held in place , the water keeps its course , and the surrounding country is saved . In a single year , in 1903 , in the Kansas region of the West , more than two million acres of land were covered with water , property was destroyed approximating forty million dollars in value , and nearly one hundred lives were lost . Not only were crops destroyed and vast damage wrought , but many fields had to be permanently abandoned on account of the washing away of their soil ; while fertile fields on the lower lands were completely destroyed by the deposit of white sand from the floods , covering the land from a few inches to several feet in depth . In addition to the value of the trees in preventing escape of water , they serve to break // the wind ; and this is a most important factor , as the particles of rich organic matter in the sandy soils are , when dry , so light that heavy and constant winds blow them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the most part , have been lamentably slow in taking up the important work of forestry . An unwritten law has prevailed , one would think , providing that the forest must first be destroyed before any steps at preservation could be made . The frontiersman , opening up a new forest region , has seemed to have no conception of the value of the forest , and the greed of the timbermen has swiftly destroyed what the frontiersman left . Gifford Pinchot , in a bulletin issued by the government , calls attention to the fact that the early English settlers of America had been accustomed to a country where timber was already scarce , and where the penalties for its destruction were severe and rigidly enforced . This bred a regard for the forest which later generations have not known . In Nebraska , early in the period of the New Earth , Arbor Day was instituted by the Hon. J. Sterling Morton , later Secretary of Agri- // culture . The chief feature of the day , the planting of trees by school children on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an important educational bearing . Provisions for the observance of Arbor Day have now been made in every state and territory . In order to provide definite and recent information as to the efforts now being made in various states to preserve the forests , letters were addressed to the governors of a number of the states , and from their replies , or from replies prepared by departments of forestry , the following resume of the situation in these states is made : Colorado , as a state , has done little but pass laws . It has no machinery for their enforcement , no state forester , no office charged with responsibility relating to forests , no forest policy . The state experiment station has begun a series of cooperative experiments in tree-planting with landowners in various parts of the state . The national government has established forest reserves to the extent of nearly thirteen million acres , with three forest nurseries and a fourth soon to follow . Twenty thousand young pines were planted in 1905 , with very satisfac- // tory results . A school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand acres of land known as Manitou Park , some sixty miles from the city of Denver , while the state agricultural college adds a course in forestry in 1906 . The following suggestive words are from a leaflet issued by the Colorado State Forestry Association , an organization in the interests of forest preservation : " On coming to Colorado , the first settlers found not less than thirty-six thousand square miles of forest area , much of which was heavily wooded with various kinds of valuable pines and spruces , the heritage of centuries , waiting for the miner , the farmer and the builder of cities , with promise of timber in plenty for generations to come . For many years no forestry laws were enacted . The woods were free for all , and at once became the prey of insatiable avarice and waste . By fire and wanton waste , thirty thousand square miles of virgin forests of the state have been destroyed , so experts say . If true , the enormity is unparalleled ; for under no sky , in any land , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so much forest waste by a like number of inhabitants in 159 ' 1'HE NEW EARTH so short a time . As a result of denudation , the snow melts early , the streams are impaired , the summer flow is lessened , farming is made more precarious , and water famines at times are threatened . Where deforestation is most extensive , the streams show the greatest degree of disturbance . All streams on the eastern slope arc impaired , particularly Boulder , Clear Creek , Platte River and the Arkansas River . Beyond the range the same condition is rapidly obtaining ,  --  the Dolores , San Juan and Uncompahgre in a marked degree . Even the Gunnison and Grand are beginning to show the effects of deforestation . To every thoughtful mind it must be apparent that we are coming face to face with an alarming situation , demanding immediate and energetic action . " Nebraska has no laws for the purpose of conserving the interests of forestry . It has an Arbor Day , but the observance of this day is not compulsory , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a prairie state possessing but little natural timber . However , the settlers have been very zealous in the matter of planting trees , and in the eastern half of the state nearly every // farm has its grove and suitable shade trees . The state is gaining in the matter of the number of acres devoted to tree-growing , rather than losing . In many parts of the state small groves are so numerous as to give the country an appearance of possessing much timber resource . There is no state in the Union in which Arbor Day is more faithfully observed than in this state . Thousands of trees are planted every year upon that day ; but , of course , tree-planting is in no sense confined to that particular day . The people of Nebraska believe that an increase of forest growth has a direct influence upon climatic conditions , and hence the idea of tree-planting has been stimulated . Portions of the state are semi-arid , and if there is anything in the theory that treegrowth is an important factor in increasing humidity , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trees . The General Assembly of Illinois , at its last ( 905 ) session , enacted a law for the creation of forest preserve districts . The act contains a referendum to the people of any county or counties in the state desiring to organize a forest-preserve district under its provisions . For // any district so organized , six commissioners are to be appointed by the Governor of the state , whose duty it shall be to administer the forest preserve law ; and , in pursuance of this duty , the commissioners are empowered to designate by ordinance , streets , roads , avenues , boulevards and highways as public driveways , and may restrain and control the speed of travel on such highways and throughout such forest preserves . Comparatively little attention has been paid in the past either to the preservation or regeneration of forests in Illinois . A very considerable number of individuals have planted groves varying from one to several acres in extent , and some of these have succeeded well . In the aggregate , a very large number of trees have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these have been mostly in shelter belts and in small areas upon farms , as well as along streets in the cities and the waysides throughout the country . The region of the state which was originally prairie proved to be well adapted to tree-growth , but since this land is desirable for agricultural purposes , no forest planting has been done . The Illinois Central Railroad has made some rather exten- // sive plantings of the hardy catalpa for the purpose of procuring railroad ties . These were begun some eight or ten years ago and are doing as well as could be reasonably expected . Most of these catalpa groves , however , have been too closely planted for best results , as is very evident now . In the future these trees will not be planted nearer than eight by eight feet . Even then thinnings will have to be made in the somewhat early history of the plantation . Considerable European larch was planted twenty or thirty years ago , and there are now several very fine groves of it , though small in size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , but here , again , the trees were set too near together and the development has been much slower than anticipated . This tree can hardly be said to have come into a marketable condition in any of these plantings . It is especially valuable only after it reaches a large size . The black walnut grows well enough in any situation in Illinois , and is esteemed exceedingly valuable for posts and railroad ties ; but on the rich black loams , originally prairie , the trunk-boring insects destroy it , while upon the drier clayey or gravelly // regions it is nearly free from these depredations . The growth in the latter locations is slower , but still it is a valuable tree for the purposes named . There is no reforesting of cut-over areas of any consequence , but something of this ought undoubtedly to be done , especially on the lands subject to overflows , along the Illinois and Mississippi rivers . In the southern part of the state , where the richest forest areas originally prevailed , scarcely anything but the destructive processes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1871 , ? additions having been made during the following three or four years , about twenty acres in blocks of from a fourth acre to one acre , of a number of different kinds of deciduous and evergreen trees . This was for experimental purposes , and the plantation is now showing some interesting results . The kinds that are now showing best development are hardy catalpa , European larch , white and buroak , green ash and white pine . The last has been somewhat surprising in its development , since it was planted upon a flat , not very welldrained area , having black loamy soil . More // often this tree grows upon sandy soil . So far as commercial results are concerned , it can not be claimed that there is hope in getting such returns as would have been secured from the usual agricultural crops of the region , but it is probable that ultimately the experiment will prove that such an investment would be considered fairly remunerative . " The state of Alabama , " comes the word from that commonwealth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have still areas of forests , and our people are not as yet sensible of the necessity for re-supplying what is being taken away . " The state of New York , through its Forestry Department , has already undertaken , and is carrying on , extensive operations in the way of reforesting the waste and denuded lands in its forest preserve . The work was commenced in a small way in 1901 , at which time two plantations of white pine were made in the Catskill district . In the following year five hundred thousand young plants ? white pine , Scotch pine , Norway spruce and larch ? were set out on the burned plains near Saranac Junction , in Frank- // estry , but receive no aid from the state . The last legislature had a forestry committee which reported in favor of a forestry commission , for the purpose of examining the forests of the state , to report a plan of procedure looking to the state 's taking active part in certain forestry plans . This bill passed the House of Representatives , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive consideration . Doubtless it will come up again in the next legislature . Oregon is not doing anything in the way of reforesting cut-over areas , or in making new forests , or in farm forestry generally . On a small scale , however , many of the farmers in the irrigated districts in the eastern portion of the state are setting out some trees on small bodies of land , but this is being done on such a small scale that it is hardly worth mentioning . An act was passed by the last legislature of this state providing for the protection of forests and timber of the state against forest fires , and , to that end , providing for the appointment of fire rangers and defining their duties , stipulating for a closed season and providing for the punishment of persons who set // out fires which cause , or may cause , injury to forests or timber , and providing penalties for violations of the several sections of the act . Aside from this , practically nothing has been done by legislation or by private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , however , that nearly one-fifth of the area of Oregon is included within forest reservations , by authority of the President acting under laws of Congress . Some advance along the lines of protection of forests in Ohio has been made , favorable action toward which Governor Herrick recommended in his first message , and will do so again in his message to this legislature , 1905-906 , asking them to form a bureau in connection with the Good Roads Commission . North Dakota is distinctly a prairie state , but efforts have been made to encourage the forestation of treeless areas . This work is being done , in a measure , through the State Agricultural College , which is encouraging the planting of trees for shelter about farm homes , and some progress is being made . At the last session of the legislature a tree bounty was provided , of three dollars an acre , to every // person who shall hereafter plant , cultivate and keep in a growing condition one acre , and not more than ten acres , of prairie land with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of a reduction of taxes levied against real estate to that extent . Every person planting forest trees suitable for hedges along public highways is entitled to an annual bounty of two dollars for every eighty rods of each row in length . It is hoped that these provisions will , to some extent , encourage the forestation of treeless areas . In Kentucky , up to this time ( 1905 ) no legislation has been made looking to the preservation of the state 's forests , except a private organization called the State Forestry Association . At the last session of the legislature a bill was introduced looking to state aid for this association , but it did not pass . Idaho is a very young state , and its laws are still in process of formation . The state owns a great deal of forest lands , and at the last session of the legislature a bill was passed which provides for the perpetuation of the state 's forests . Hereafter only merchantable timber will be sold , and the purchaser will be required // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fire , and placing the forest so that within an appreciably short time the timber value will be renewed . In 1887 , the Kansas legislature enacted a law creating the office of forest commissioner , to encourage the planting and growing of forest trees . Two tracts of land were secured , upon which experimental forest stations were established . The law provides especially for such trees as should be particularly adapted to t he plains region of the state ; the trees grown , % lien ready for transplanting , being issued at the two stations to all residents of the state : applying for them . From fifteen hundred to two thousand five hundred applications have been filed yearly since 7888 . Commissioner of Forestry Beaubien says regarding results : " Where ten years ago there was but the open expanse of sky and grass , until the eye grew weary of the never-ending monotony , today can be heard the song of the mockingbird and the thrush as they nest and rear their young in our artificial forests . This has been accomplished without artificial irrigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has under forestry control five hundred and sixty thousand acres of timber land , chiefly located in the central portion of the state . As an illustration of the effectiveness of state supervision in the one matter of fires , it is shown that while there were probably three thousand deer-hunters upon the reservations of the state ( luring the month of November , 1904 , - the deer-shooting season , not a forest fire was reported from this source . A forest academy , under the direction of the state forester , has been established . With all efforts to preserve the forests , the rate of cutting still remains greater than the rate of reproduction . One of the very interesting features of forestry in Pennsylvania is the encouraging of the planting and cultivation of osier willows for use in manufacturing baskets for an indefinite number of purposes , wicker furniture , carriage and automobile bodies , and so on . With the rise in wood values , boxes made of wood for shipping purposes become more expensive , and the willow baskets admirably take their place . The Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-eight varieties of willows , and suggests // the more important ones which may be planted on vacant and otherwise unproductive land , and be made to yield a good income . Ample directions are given for the planting and care of willow plantations . In the period of the early history of Indiana , that state was heavily timbered with forests of hard woods . The forests rapidly disappeared when the farmers came , and it was not until the year 1900 that forestry became a matter of state concern . The almost complete absence of virgin forest in the state and a general timber scarcity were sharply brought home to the people , and a hearty response for forest improvement followed . A State Forestry Board was established in 1901 , consisting oI ' five members , one to be chosen from the Slate Forestry Association , one from the Retail Lumber Dealers ' Association of Indiana , one from the faculty of Purdue University , one from the skilled woodworkers of the state , and one having knowledge of timber culture and of forest preservation , all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to serve without compensation . Two years after the establishment of the board , over thirty thousand trees 173 ' 1'IIE NEW EARTH nual growth of spruce in the state warrants the cutting of 637,000,000 feet per year without depleting the supply . The pulp mills consume about 275,000,000 feet of spruce per year , leaving for general sawmill purposes 362,000,000 feet of spruce without encroaching upon the legitimate growth of the forests . It it thus shown that with proper fire protection and with careful harvesting there is ample spruce in the state to supply a large demand indefinitely . Even when the land has been ravaged by the thoughtless lumberman , the undersized trees left standing furnish another crop in a comparatively short time . In 1903-04 the legislature of the state made an appropriation for public instruction in forestry , this instruction taking the form of a forestry course in the University of Maine . The course embraces general forestry , forest botany , including field and laboratory work , forest measurements , lumbering , forest management and the like . There is a major course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bachelor of Science in Forestry . It took fully a quarter of a century in Michigan to develop forestry interest . As President // Garfield , of the Michigan Forestry Commission , puts it , very little headway was made until the hulk of the forests was practically gone . It was only when the farm wood-lots were reduced to a minimum , when industries dependent upon the forests for raw material began to leave the state , and when the rivers of the state began to wane , that interest in forestry could be aroused . Though once one of the leading forest states , it was not until 1899 that a forestry commission was appointed , having little authority and very little funds . Later , forty thousand acres of state lands were set aside for the work of the forestry commission , a finest nursery was established , and a million trees , in 1906 , were ready for planting . A department of forestry in the state university and in the state agricultural college has been provided , and courses of lectures on forestry arc projected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of the state is stripped of timber and burned over , every acre of which , according to the forestry commission , might be reforested . More than six million acres of this region have become state tax titlelands . A most earnest effort is now being // made to arouse general interest in forestry and to redeem the state from the sad condition into which it , with other commonwealths , has fallen by reason of the thoughtlessness and the rapacity of those whose duty lay in providing for the future . Some three hundred thousand acres of state land in Wisconsin are now included within the forest reserve . The chief object is to protect the headwaters of the important rivers , and reserve a supply of timber for the industries which are dependent upon the forests for their raw material . State Forester Griffin says , regarding the outlook : " Until we have secured the necessary land , and in a compact body so that we can build fire lines and protect it from fire , we shall probably not do any planting , except on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the next session of the legislature , we shall probably attempt to pass a bill exempting from taxation lands which are planted with forest trees , at least twelve hundred to the acre , so as to encourage reforestation both by lumber companies and farmers . Many of the lumber companies are practicing a more or // less rough system of forestry , and I think that the interest in the work is increasing throughout the state . " In all of the states where forestry is now being so zealously studied , the question of fire protection and fire prevention is being considered as one of paramount importance . But important as is all the work of the individual states in the production of forests , one of the most important advances promises to be in the creation of new and fast-growing trees along the lines laid down in the experimental work of Luther Burbank , the great plantbreeder . Mr. Burbank has demonstrated that trees can be bred for any particular quality , ? for largeness , strength , shape , amount of pitch , tannin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , that any desirable attribute of a tree may be developed simply by breeding and selecting . He has created walnut trees , by crossing common varieties , that have grown six times as much in thirteen years as their ancestors did in twenty-eight years , preserving , at the same time , the strength , hardness and texture of their forebears . The grain of the wood has been made more beautiful at the // same time . In twelve years ' time , without irrigation , these trees have grown to be eighty feet in height , with a branch spread of seventyfive feet , trunks nearly three feet in diameter at the base and nearly two feet in diameter at fifteen feet from the ground . The trees are fine for fuel and splendidly adapted to furniture manufacture . This demonstration of the possibility of tree-breeding places an entirely different aspect upon forestry the world over . It points the way , too , to the reforesting of the denuded areas of the earth at a pace far more rapid than any ever before known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of a variety not crossed , which show unusual rapidity of growth , this particular quality of rapidity is attained , the descendants of these seedlings continuing the rapidity of growth as soon as enough time has elapsed to fix them in their course . So in the case of any other attribute , the seedlings , which , as they develop , show in larger measure the attribute sought , are the ones selected for the fixing and preserving of this larger measure of excellence . While in the generation of the life of the // New Earth great progress has been made in forestry , both national and state , the work now under way by the nation and by individual commonwealths , taken in connection with this remarkable demonstration of the power of man to create trees practically at will , makes the future fuller of promise by far than the past . In no one of the various lines of life that take their rise in the earth has there been greater need of earnest and progressive action in this present revival of knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in this one of forestry : in no line has a greater energy been set in motion . fa // MODERN DAIRYING ABOUT the time that the activities of the New Earth were set in motion , the staid folk of a picturesque Swedish hamlet , and those along the country roads in the vicinity , used to derive no end of amusement from the visits of a lad from the village who was accustomed to go from house to house asking for the privilege of repairing things , ? old watches or clocks , jewelry , and the like . He was not seeking profit but pleasure , for he had an inborn delight in doing such things . In case there was a broken tool of some kind , a door-knob or knocker out of order , ? anything , in fact , that needed tinkering , ? he begged to be allowed to put it in shape . So the country folk , goodnaturedly , humored him , and the defective articles were soon made whole . The fame of the lad spread , and great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little older , he produced a number of quite impor- // tant labor-saving devices , among them an automatic cow-milker , which aroused no slight interest among the country folk . I do not know whether or not it was this latter that turned his attention to the invention which brought him fame and money , but , in any event , he became convinced that the old way of allowing milk to stand until the cream had risen was not the best way . So he set about perfecting a device for the mechanical separation of cream from milk . The invention was a simple one , the act itself so natural , so to say , it was curious that no one had ever hit upon such a thing before . Though simple , it has yet proven one of the wonderful inventions of the age , the de Laval separator . For it was the great Swedish inventor ? whose fame rests by no means on this device alone - who was so greatly admired as a lad by the country folk , when he turned tinker among their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Laval 's invention is one of the most important contributions made to the life of the New Earth . Without it , modern dairying could never have attained its present corn- // manding position . These little machines that take the milk fresh from the cow , whirl it about with great rapidity , separate the milk from the cream , and send the former foaming out through one spout ,  --  the cream , at the same moment , escaping through another spout , ? have exerted an immense economic influence . It would be idle to attempt an estimate of the millions of dollars that have been saved , in time , labor and actual expenditure of money . Not only this , but the saving in material has been great . In an average herd of well-kept , well-bred cattle , the milk will probably average four per cent of fat ; that is , there will be four per cent directly convertible into butter . Under the old method of setting the milk in shallow pans for the cream to rise , not all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining in the milk , so that one-eighth of all the butter-fat was lost for butter manufacture . Under the new method , a first-class separator should not leave more than one-tenth of one per cent of the cream in the milk , perhaps not so much as that . The importance of the invention is still more clearly shown in view of the fact that , under the old order of things , some // farmers set their milk in deep cans in tanks of ice-water for the cream to rise , losing thereby six to eight per cent of the total amount of fat , practically all saved by means of the separator , using the milk direct from the cow . It is of interest to note that in the whole of Sweden , where his inventions have placed him in popular estimation among the foremost men of his generation , Gustaf Be . Laval is held in just as high esteem as he was in the hamlet in those early days when he won the hearts of the good housewives . He is a man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of his other inventions , but by his success in the development of great industries . Though an inventor , he has shown marked business ability , having amassed a fortune . He is pronounced a man of the most delightful attributes , unspoiled by successes , of great strength of character , of most charming personality . But while , on one side the Atlantic , one man was developing an invention that was to prove of such great value to the dairy world , another man on this side the sea was perfecting another invention destined to play an even greater part // in the production of the world 's dairy supplies . Indeed , even with the mechanical separation of the butter-fat from the milk , modern dairying could never have reached its present plane had not an American , Dr. S. M. Babcock , of the University of Wisconsin Experiment Station , invented a machine for the determining of the amount of butter in milk , without waiting for the cream to rise or for the milk to be separated from the cream . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dairy , when he one day hit upon a plan for testing milk for its butter-fat . The device which he made for the test , also , like most other important inventions , a very simple affair , was merely a tin receptacle like a pan in shape , with a cover to it , on the inside of which were compartments to hold several small bottles . By means of a simple crank and wheel , the pan holding the bottles could be made to revolve rapidly . He placed milk in the little bottles , along with a small portion of sulphuric acid . This acid would dissolve all the solids in the milk save the butter-fat . When the pan was rapidly revolved , the butter-fat was forced upward from the milk into the narrow neck of the bottle , // upon which there was a graduate to measure the amount of fat lodged there as a result of the rapid whirling . It was easy to read the scale in the neck of the bottle , and from it to compute the amount of butter-fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample . It was all such a simple thing from one point of view , but it was of tremendous importance , simple t hough it seemed , judged by its bearing upon one of the world 's great industries . 1 t was quickly apparent , as the news of the invention spread , that a new era had dawned in dairying . Hitherto milk had been sold with no reference to its quality . The rich product of the best herds came in unfair competition with the milk from poorer herds , or with milk which had been diluted with water or otherwise adulterated . Under the new order of things , all milk must sell upon its own individual merits . No matter how many pounds of mil k a farmer , for example , might bring to his local creamery , he was ' not to be paid , any longer , by the quantity but by the quality . It made a complete revolution ; like many another revolution , it was an evolution also . Today the Babcock milk test is adopted by // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . It is estimated that in his own state , Wisconsin , the saving per year by its use is fully a million of dollars , while a single syndicate , comprising one hundred and thirty creameries , according to the testimony of its manager , saves at least one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year by means of this test . These two men have not only made modern dairying possible , added enormously to the wealth of nations , and been of large service in relieving man of toil , but they have opened the way to an indefinite expansion of the dairy industry , so that they are contributors to the wealth of posterity far more than to that of the generation in which they live . Without drawing any unfair distinction or casting any discredit upon Dr. De Laval , it may be said that the invention of Dr. Babcock takes on a peculiar interest in view of the fact that , though he might have amassed a colossal fortune had he taken out a patent upon his invention , he yet gave it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work have been given to the world , free of all cost , a significant and commanding illustration of // the fact that unselfishness is not yet dead among men . But Dr. Babcock , like De Laval , has not confined his efforts to one line , though the benefit derived from his other discoveries , like that of the milk test , has been public , not private . He has made exhaustive studies into the composition of milk and other substances , always having in mind the practical bearing of the work . He invented the viscometer , by means of which the viscosity , or the amount of glutinous or sticky substances in oils might be determined ; devised a method of analyzing milk which has been accepted as the standard by the official chemists of the United States , and is largely in use in Europe ; discovered a method for determining the number and size of the fat-globules in milk , and a method for the mechanical separation of the casein in the milk from the other constituents . In connection with Dr. H. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made an important discovery , finding a digest ye ferment in milk , an enzyme , resembling the ecretions of the pancreatic organ of animals . ' This ferment has been given the name " galactose . " The discovery is among the most im- // portant in the history of the New Earth . It was found that to this agent is largely due the ripening of cheese . It was formerly believed that this ripening , or curing , was due to bacteria , and it was also believed that cheese must be ripened at a high temperature . The very opposite has been found to be the case , the cheese cured at low temperature , beginning below freezing and rising somewhat above , being richer in flavor and having less shrinkage in weight . The old-fashioned curing-rooms are thus rendered unnecessary . Several hundreds of dollars may thus be saved in the construction of every cheese factory . The two also discovered , or devised , what is known as the Wisconsin Curd Test , by means of which impurities , as dirt or bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test is of great aid to cheesemakers . Other practical scientists in this country and Europe have been giving close study to the dairy . In the United States the experiment stations are putting forth many bulletins which , though they have a limited circulation ( each station 's publication going chiefly to the people in that state , and thus preventing a // diffusion of bulletins on the same subject from other states ) , are yet of marked value . These bulletins present some curiously interesting information , some of which may be here indicated . In Iowa , for example , a state with large dairy interests , a recent bulletin shows in entertaining fashion that the dairymen of that state could sell four hundred thousand dollars ' worth of water in their butter each year , if they would only conform to the standard the butter-using countries of Europe have established . England , referred to as the greatest butter-using nation , with other European nations , wants butter having sixteen per cent of water . Tests made in a single year , 1902 , of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developed the fact that there was an average of eleven and eight-tenths per cent of water in American butter . In Iowa alone , the change to sixteen per cent would result in increasing the yield of butter each year about two millions of pounds , " which would mean , " in the words of the bulletin , " a financial increase to the dairymen of Iowa of about four hundred thousand dollars , 191 I THE NEW EARTH without the investment or the expenditure of a single dollar . " " It should be distinctly understood , " the bulletin continues , " that the writers do not favor an excessive amount of moisture in butter , but since the world 's best commercial and scientific butter , judges , when viewed by them from the consumer 's as well as from the producer 's standpoint , have fixed the maximum standard of moisture in good butter to be sixteen per cent , it is a matter of business for the producers to come as near to this standard as possible . " The studies in bacteria as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting developments have followed . One investigator , noting the size of the bacteria that appear in milk , says that if they could be increased to the size of baseballs , and a man should be increased in the same proportion , he would stand over fifty miles high . When the milk lies in the udder of the healthy cow , it is germ-free , but the moment it is exposed to the air there is danger of contamination in a thousand and one ways , for the bacteria abound in air , earth and water . // For some reason , the milk that is fresh from t be cow is particularly susceptible to the bacteria , and their development in milk proceeds with remarkable rapidity . At the Maryland station , many tests have been made . In a single cubic centimeter of milk , say about onefourth of a teaspoonful , in one test where the milk was first set in water standing at sixty degrees Fahrenheit , held for fifteen hours and Ilion cooled until the milk stood at the same temperature , 7,000 bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2,500,000 at the end of fifteen hours , 69,000,000 at the end of twenty-four hours , and 300,000,000 at the end of thirty-nine hours , ? suggesting their marvelous reproductive powers . The effect of the bacteria upon the milk is to cause it to sour , to make it less wholesome for invalids and children , and , often , to impart to it a disagreeable flavor . While there are bacteria known to be beneficent and aidful to man , there can be no question that those which so rapidly develop in milk carry death and disease . If disease does not follow the use of impure milk , it is because the system into which it is taken is strong enough to resist . // tant of all , comes under standardization ; and this can be absolutely complied with by means of the Babcock test . The producer can tell , if he will , precisely how much butter-fat his milk contains , simply by making a test to that effect , labeling his bottles to correspond . Upon the quality of his milk , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quart of milk . sold in the United States could be brought under this test . If such a thing were done , the producer , no less than the consumer , would be protected ; the general health of all adults using milk would be safeguarded , while one of death 's easiest avenues of approach to infant life would be effectively blocked . Another , and very interesting phase of the dairy life under the new order of things developed in these stations , is the individual testing of cows . A regular account may now be kept with each cow . She can be compelled to show her precise value . If she does not come up to a certain grade of efficiency as a milk-producing machine , she can be improved by a different ration , or by different care if she has been neglected ; or , if she can not show fitness , she can be discarded from the herd altogether . // Exhaustive studies are being made at many of these stations into the food of the cow , in order that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . So , in a model herd under test an account is opened with each cow . She is charged with what is fed her , credited with what she produces . A careful record is kept , showing her milk product per day and the equality of the milk per day , week and month . At the end of the month . the check sheets in which her name , or number , and her product are recorded , tell precisely what she is doing . In one station , check was kept upon a series of ' ten herds of cattle in different parts of the state . In one herd , the best cow gave 8,230 pounds of milk in a year ; her per cent of fat in the milk was 5.03 ; she made 483 pounds of butter . The poorest cow in the same herd gave 1,986 pounds of milk ; her per cent of fat was 4.78 , and she made only 111 pounds of butter . By means of this elaborate checking the value of a dairy cow can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed are important , but are less important than her milk , tat butter-producing powers . // Along with this has gone a diffusion of information as to the care of the herd . At the Storrs Station in Connecticut . tests have been made with a covered pail which admits the milk through wire gauze of fine mesh , to which are added layers of cheese-cloth . Prevention of impurities is thus secured . The amount of dirt in the milk from the covered pail was only thirty-seven per cent of that in the open pail ; in other words , the cover excluded sixty-three per cent of the dirt . In addition to this , by the use of the covered pail , twenty-nine per cent of the total number of bacteria and fortyone per cent of the acid-producing bacteria were excluded from the fresh milk . Where the milk was drawn from the cow into an open pail and then strained , the results were by no means so satisfactory . In this connection , the filtering of milk as practiced in Europe is worthy of note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which the milk passes , either being forced up through the sand from the bottom , running out over the top , or passing down through the sand by gravity . While practically the entire milk supply of the city of Vienna is filtered through // sand and while fine results are obtained in filtering water through as deep layers of sand : is this milk passes through , yet it is pointed out in a bulletin issued by the Maryland Station that such filtering of milk does not by any means give as good results as might be expected . " Milk " as the bulletin puts it , " has a strange affinity for dirt and seems loath to give up that which it holds in suspension . A peculiar exposition of the characteristic of milk was noticed in some work done at this station in trying to remove the garlic odor from milk . The milk was filtered through bone-black , but came out as black as the charcoal through which it had passed . Water , made lade turbulent by the finest clay , was run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was finally found that charcoal , granulated and washed as free from dirt as possible by agitating in water , would still cause the milk to turn black when run through it . To this same characteristic is very likely due the fact that the best sand filters will not remove all of the dirt from the milk . Filters seem never to have come into use in this country , or there has at least never been // any report of their use as far as could be found . It is very likely that if ever the cities of the country control the handling of the milk sold within their limits , the sand filter will be used as it is in Europe , providing some better means has not by that time been found for purifying milk . " In some ways , the most important change wrought in dairying during this period of the New Earth has been in the freeing of women . If there ever was a distressing white slavery it was that which bound the farmer 's wife and daughter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expected , in addition to all their other duties , to care for the milk , attend to the skimming of the cream , churn the cream into butter , and laboriously " work " the butter until it was ready for market . Not infrequently the milking of the cows fell to their lot also . The work was heavy and hard . It aggravated ailments to which overworked and underfed women were liable . It made life a burden . It shortened many a woman 's life . And , sad fact that it was , the product which she turned out , after the most faithful labor , was often , through lack of ' 200 MODERN DAIRYING knowledge , a most wretched product , unpalatable , unwholesome , easily passing into a condition of offensive rancidity . While it has been economically of large significance , adding great wealth to the nation and playing no inconsiderable part in the prosperity of the United States , the creamery may be said to be most important of all in its freeing of the wives and daughters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has sprung into life in the period of the New Earth can be mentioned which has had a more beneficent influence upon the women of the farm than the establishment of t.lie creamery . The first creamery in the United States appears to have been the one established in ) range county , New York , in 1861 . Slowly the plan expanded , as the farmers saw the superiority of this method over the old one . It was then the custom to send the whole milk to the creamery , but in 1875 the farmers began skimming the cream themselves and delivering it , in place of the whole milk . From this the step to the mechanical separation of cream from milk was natural . The magnitude // of the dairy interests of the United States , now that they are assuming in the broader field of the New Earth the position to which they are entitled , is seen in the fact that , by the last census , there were over eighteen millions of dairy cows , ninety-four and six-tenths per cent of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk were produced in the census year 1900 , an average per year of four hundred and twenty-four gallons per cow . Somewhat over fifty per cent of all the milk produced came from the states of the north central division , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Iowa , North and South Dakota , Missouri , Kansas and Nebraska . During the same year nearly one billion , five hundred millions of pounds of butter were made , together with almost three hundred million pounds of cheese . It gives one an altogether enlarged view of the dairy industry of the United States under this new order of things , to note , in addition to all this , the fact that the value of the dairy interests of the United States is now considerably more than two billions of dollars , on which there is an // income of over five hundred millions of dollars annually . The manufacture of cheese , too , on a scale at all commensurate with the possibilities of the country , dates from the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , also , in New York , in Oneida county , in 1851 . By the close of 1869 , the number had increased to over one thousand in the United States . The manufacture of cheese was originally altogether confined to the farm ; the results were not so satisfactory , however , as in the case of factory manufacture , so that out of the total of three hundred millions of pounds made in 1900 , less than seventeen million pounds were made on the farms . Five states ? New York , Wisconsin , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Michigan  --  made eighty and fourtenths per cent of all the cheese manufactured in the country . The interest in cheese manufacture , and in all the related lines leading up to it , has been not less pronounced on the part of the men of practical science than their interest in the making of butter . The possibilities of scientific investigation are far greater in cheese than in // butter . " The making of first-quality cheese , " in the words of a bulletin from the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and most difficult operation in dairying . It is more interesting than butter-making , since the limits which include good butter ' are narrow , while good cheese ' may mean any one of a hundred products . By slight alteration in the process of manufacture , milk , a liquid with a mild sweet taste and characteristic , delicious aroma , may be transformed into cheeses of paste-like consistency , like Camembert , or the hard and stone-like Parmesan , may result in a product as mild-flavored as sweet cream or pungent enough to bite the tongue , as fragrant as perfect Cheddar or as repellant as Limberger . . . . The art of cheese-making has , possibly , touched its highest point in the hands of a few makers and at rare intervals , for occasionally a cheese is met with that the scorers pronounce perfect ; but the time is evidently still to come when even a few cheese-makers can produce perfect cheese all of the time , or most makers some of the time . To explain this , we must admit that the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no maker can tell just why he frequently fails to produce the best of cheese even under most favorable conditions , and no student has yet been able to give the world a logical , correct account of the changes which take place during the history of a cheese , and of the causes which produce those changes . Until such an understanding of the underlying principles has been more perfectly attained , we can hope only for accidental or fortuitous advances in the art ; when we have reached such an understanding , it will certainly be possible to raise the general level of cheese quality by teaching all makers better methods and closer control of conditions ; and it may be possible to make a better cheese even than the one we now call perfect . " Wide-spread interest in modern methods of butter and cheese manufacture has been aroused and maintained by the establishment of farmers ' dairy schools in connection with various agricultural colleges , where the farmers of a given dairy region may meet during the duller winter months for several weeks ' study tinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not had the advantages of // college training , and the information imparted to them in these schools is of large practical value . The whole subject of dairying from a practical , as well as from a scientific standpoint , presents many features of peculiar interest . It is one of the most attractive , as well as , rightly conducted , one of the most remunerative of all the many departments of the New Earth . // ANIMAL HUSBANDRY r ' HERE is , perhaps , no other department among the many branches of the New Earth which has been so beset with dangers , more open to the attacks of enemies , or which may be approached , for good or ill , from so many different avenues , as the one of which t h i s chapter treats . Perhaps in no other line I ' modern life has there been displayed during t h i s period so much selfishness and so great u determination on the part of unfair capital to take advantage of the necessities of the people ; and yet those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly misused they have been , have not allowed this selfishness to prevent them from advancing . So it happens I hat in the production of cattle , sheep , swine , horses , and the like , the progress made during the last third of a century has been among the significant factors in American farm life . The progress has been along two main lines , im- // provement and enlargement , ? improvement of native stock by breeding and selection and the constant testing of new strains of blood , to see whether or not they may be introduced from foreign countries with success ; enlargement by constantly increasing the number of animals , to meet a demand which has increased more rapidly than the supply . This picture rises in memory : Overhead the blue sky , the air crisp with autumn frosts ; a crowd of country people thronging the paddock at the county fair , all interest lost , for the moment , in the many fascinating features of the fair ; far down the green a proud groom advancing leading an enormous Percheron stallion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while behind him come many other grooms , each at the head of a noble animal , each horse in turn seeming more worthy of applause than his predecessor . Out in front of the throng , watching warily every movement of the great animals , stands a white-haired , white-bearded old man , type of the line of southern gentlemen from whence he sprang , receiving , with fine pride in his eye , the tumultuous applause that // comes up from the throats and hands of the thousands . It was an importation of Percherons from France , put on exhibition by the white-haired old southerner , a pioneer , I think perhaps it would be quite fair to say , the pioneer , in this line of importation ; in any event , he was among the first to begin buying in person on French soil . It would be impossible to form any adequate estimate of the influence of this importer 's stock upon the native stock of the region . These great draft-horses might he supplemented from time to time by other breeds having distinctive excellencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The initial work was all-important , too , i n educating the farmer to the possibilities o f ' ' strengthening his own stock . And so it has gone all along the lines of animal life in the years of the New Earth , ? from the lordliest stallion to the most vociferous cockerel that ever proclaimed the blueness of his blood in the midst of an admiring harem , a determined effort to improve the domestic animal life of America . So wide-spread has been the interest during this period , and so keen has been the rivalry , that no end of // horses on farms , for example , from 1850 to 1900 , increased very nearly 300 per cent . Notwithstanding the fear of many that the horse would give way before the bicycle , the motorcycle and the automobile , the horses in the United States number at present more than twenty-one millions , while their value by the last census was over a billion dollars . On the Chicago market , horses , from 1899 to 1904 , increased in value from ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest to note that the national government , under congressional appropriation , has begun the work of establishing an . American carriage-horse . A series of breeding experiments is now under way , whose object is to produce an entirely new horse , so to speak , ? one which shall be peculiarly adaptable to the needs of Americans . It is intended that this horse shall be the foundation of a race which shall stand entirely independent of foreign breeds . In every department of animal husbandry , efforts are being put forth to strengthen the older types . It is practically in the period of the New Earth that swine-breeding has reached // anything like important results . The years of the first registrations of the different swine breeders ' associations are as follows : American Berkshire , 1875 ; Standard Poland-China , 1877 ; Central Poland-China , 1879 ; American Chester White , 1884 ; American Essex , 1887 ; American Duroc-Jersey , 1890 . But , while great improvement has been made through the introduction of new blood , perhaps the greatest improvement in the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what may be termed animal vulture . This includes not only a strengthening of the stock through the most careful , election in breeding , so that new combinat ons and crosses may be made to produce better cattle , better sheep , better poultry than that preceeded but the most painstaking receded , lid systematic e experiments in feeding . Feedit ig and breeding lie at the base of the progress of animal husbandry in the period of the New Earth . This feeding has been two-fold in object : to produce better animals , stronger , more profitable on the block or on the farm , hut to do it at a minimum of cost . Waste , most foolish and extravagant waste , has been // one of the curses of farming in America . It is one of the objects of these feeding experiments to put a stop to this waste by showing that better results can be reached under new methods by a far less expenditure of money . I know of no way in which the practical value of modern science , ? I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called science which busies itself with things which are only mildly mystical , ? can better be shown than in these great animal-feeding tests which have been undertaken in the latter part of this past generation . Take , for example , as an illustration of the scope of the work , the tests under way by the national government in the feeding of horses . Mere it has been demonstrated , after exhaustive tests , precisely how much of a given food is assimilated by a horse , how much is wasted , how to combine rations so that this waste may be reduced to a minimum and the horse be fed in the most economical manner . It is shown that only thirty-four per cent of the food consumed by a horse is converted into energy or working power , while the remaining sixty-six per cent is devoted to the running of the horse , so to speak , ? to keeping // up its mechanism . So complete are the tests that it is demonstrated that twenty per cent of he energizing value of the oats fed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while experiments show that by keeping a horse in it stall too cold for him , two pounds of oats per day are necessary to supply the waste caused by the cold . It is shown , too , that while the horse makes use of only thirty-four per cent of its food for working purposes , it is yet much more economical than the steam engine , which , at the best , turns less than twenty per cent of its fuel , or food , into energy . In Paris it is shown that the largest cab company in the city saves two hundred thousand dollars a year by taking advantage of the facts developed in the tests of food values for horses . One important feature is the substution of corn for oats , the latter proving an excellent food for producing energy . Years are being spent in some of the experiment stations of the United States upon problems of animal-feeding , with results that are proving of large economic value . How to pro vide the most satisfactory ration at the lowest possible cost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of former years , is one problem ; how to produce a maximum of meat , butter , eggs , or milk at a minimum of cost , is another : It would have been all Greek to a farmer of the Old Earth to tell him of a dual-purpose cow , one that would produce milk and butter profitably for home consumption and at the same time be the mother of calves which , if desired , would make marketable beef . It would have been quite outside his line of vision , too , ? a study recently followed for some years , and successfully , in one of the agricultural colleges , ? to educate , so to speak , the sheep to give birth to their lambs earlier in the season in order to give the farmer early spring lambs to put upon the city market at a higher rate of profit . It would require volumes to describe the many different ways in which practical scientific men are now at work upon the problem of producing better meat products . Take an illustration : In Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has in other states , as a desirable food for stock . The State Experiment Station of Tennessee , after the introduction of alfalfa began , set out to determine the real value of the new food ? was it any better // than the old and , if better , could it be produced as economically ? It was shown , after exhaustive experiments , that alfalfa , cow-peas , and of her similar leguminous plants could be substituted for other and more expensive concentrated foods without loss in product and at reduced expense . Careful and systematic feeding tests were carried on and accurate records kept . It was shown that , with alfalfa hay at $10 a ton and wheat bran at $20 a ton , the saving effected by substituting alfalfa for wheat bran would be $2.80 for every one hundred pounds of butter made and 19.8 cents for every one ? hundred pounds of milk . It was also Town , among other things , that a ton of alfalfa or pea hay could be produced at a cost of from $8 to $5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton . I n a number of states , the experiment stat ions have conducted experiments in the feeding of beet molasses and beet pulp to sheep and steers , materials hitherto considered as waste . The beet pulp has proven an excellent trod and much cheaper than the feed usually given . At the Utah Station one hundred pounds ' increase in a test with a lot of steers , // on a full ration of grain , cost $4.93 ; the same increase in weight on another lot on a full ration of corn , grain and pulp , cost $3.98 , nearly a dollar less . Thousands of sheep and .. steers have been fed at one sugar factory in Utah on the pulp , which provided a profitable food . In Illinois , where nearly or quite four thousand farmers are extensively engaged in beef production , from 200,000 to 300,000 cattle are marketed each year . It is shown that by taking advantage of the more improved methods of feeding stock , based upon a scientific knowledge of foods and food values , an addition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected , resulting in a net annual gain in this state alone of over two million five hundred thousand dollars . As an illustration of the thoroughness of the investigations carried on in this line under the stimulus of the activities of the New Earth , it may be noted that the Illinois Station undertook to find out just what the farmers were doing in this and adjoining states in the way of producing beef . A list of one hundred questions , covering every department of animal husbandry as it applies l // to the farm , was sent out to six thousand cattle feeders . The replies received , when tabulated , showed that they covered experiences of over one thousand one hundred men with a combined experience in cattle-raising of more than fourteen thousand years , during which time they had fed nearly a million and a half cattle . Two significant conclusions were drawn from the investigation , ? that the farmers realized the need of better blood in their herds , and the necessity for more intelligent use of herds . The Storrs Experiment Station in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein needed for the rations of a dairy cow . Various dairy herds in the state were visited by t he representatives of the station , and the dairymen worked in connection with the sta'on in keeping a record of the feed used . A certain ration was recommended by the station and , in so far as possible , this ration was used in comparison with the rations that had been in common use . The results reached showed that rations containing more protein than those usually fed are better , while the value of the manure obtained from the more nitrogenous // ration is noted as an important feature . In comparing the original , or regular dairy ration with the recommended ration of the station , it was shown that the average cow , instead of shrinking in her milk during the period , as she normally would have done on a uniform ration , gained appreciably on the recommended ration ; the increase in milk flow amounting to 1.29 cents per cow per day , which , with the saving in cost of food and the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.02 cents as a result of the substitution of the recommended ration of more protein . A series of tests were made at the Minnesota Station , to determine whether or not steers could be raised on the farm in competition with those raised on the great cattle ranges of the farther west . Calves were selected and fed suitable farm products , such as any farmer could grow , and the management included no details that the average farmer could not follow . The results were very satisfactory , showing that , while the initial cost of producing steers on the range was much less , beef could be grown profitably under normal farm conditions ; that the quality was of the very best ; while it was clearly shown // that the farmer could get better values for his produce thus fed to the cattle than by selling the produce on the market . Other stations pay close attention to the values of commercial feeding stuffs , for which , sometimes , extravagant claims are made . The Vermont Station , for example , made investigation during 1905 into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the by-products of oil mills , distilleries , glucose and breakfastfood factories . These were tested chiefly for protein . While some samples were wholly satisfactory , many were found short in protein . " The gluten goods , " says a bulletin from the Vermont Station , " particularly the feeds , are consistent in their failures to meet guaranties . The shortage in the protein in the distillers ' dried grains is getting to be perennial . A large proportion of the oat and corn feeds , the output of the oatmeal mills or of mixers , failed to meet the claims made for them . " The bull tin makes note of the fact , in considering one ( ) 1 ' the lines of feeds , that there is one redeeming feature , ? the poorer the feeds are the hotter , since such a condition will tend , in the long run , to lessen their sales . // The wide diversity in interests in animal husbandry will soon become clear to any one who attempts a study of the subject . The work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the industry that volumes would be required to describe them all . Simply for illustration , what , it may be asked , would a farmer of the Old Earth have thought had he learned that some public institution of the state had devoted time and money to the investigation of the subject of protecting cows from Hies , and had followed up this investigation with an additional expenditure of money to put the results of the investigation in print and issue it broadcast over the state ? Yet out of this subject the Storrs Connecticut Station has developed some thoroughly practical material . In states where vicious flies are abundant , it had been believed that there was a falling off in milk during the " fly season , " due to the worrying of the cows by the pests . Some one started the manufacture of fly preventives , and a long list of sure-cures followed , The college herd was divided into two sections , which were alternately treated with one of the fly- ' 222 It ANIMAL HUSBANDRY removers , which , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow during the fly season , to say nothing of the comfort of the cow and the milker . The preventive was applied with a spray . The result of the test showed that there was no gain in milk production , no gain in butter-fat , while the hair of the cows became more or less gummy from the application , and the milk , on a number of occasions , took from the preparation a peculiar odor . The investigations showed that the annoyance to dairy cows by flies has been overestimated , and that the benefits from the use of proprietary flyremovers have been exaggerated . In another similar test made at the - Wisconsin Station , one-half of the herd was kept in stable during the day while the fly season was in progress , the other half of the herd being left exposed to the flies in the open . The results of the test showed that the cows protected from flies by being stabled ate in four weeks eight hundred and thirty-five pounds more of green lied and lost one hundred and thirty-three more pounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while , still more signifi- // cant , those confined decreased sixteen and three-tenths pounds in milk flow and one and thirty-five-hundredths pounds in butter-fat production . One more illustration , as showing the remarkable diversity of the investigations in these days of the New Earth , must suffice . Certain portions of California , notably within a radius of a hundred miles from San Francisco , seem peculiarly adapted to the production of eggs and chickens , particularly the former . Near the town of Petaluma , the center of what is said to be the largest poultry region in the world , the state has established a poultry experiment station , where experts study the diseases of poultry , find out the value of poultry foods for the production of flesh , fat , eggs and feathers , investigate questions of sanitation , and , in general , give scientific and practical aid to the industry . One of the first bulletins to be issued as a result of the investigations deals with tuberculosis in fowls . This is a serious matter in Europe , and , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet exists extensively among many large poultry ranches . One rancher lost about two // hundred and fifty fowls out of a flock of fourteen hundred in a single year . The bulletin issued contains a full and clear description of the symptoms of the disease , the diseased conditions to look for when the fowl is killed , with illustrations of diseased parts . Ways of infection are also noted . It is shown also that no known remedy exists for tuberculosis in fowls , ? killing as soon as found affected is the only alternative . So far , there is no means of detecting the existence of the disease until it has progressed sufficiently to produce lameness , or emaciation . The tuberculin test used in detecting the disease in cattle does not give positive results in fowl . The bulletin says , upon the important question of danger to man from tuberculous fowl : " Tuberculosis in man is not noticeably prevalent in the community where most cases of the disease in fowls have been found , for it is not frequented by consumptives in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuberculosis from poultry to man is a matter concerning which it is exceedingly difficult to collect evidence . The fact that chickens , when eaten , are always 225 THE NEW EARTH well cooked , indicates that there is practically no danger from that source . It has not been proven that tuberculosis is transmitted through the egg , and furthermore , most eggs are well cooked when served . It does not appear , therefore , that tuberculosis in fowls is a matter that very intimately concerns public health . " It would be idle to attempt estimates of the future growth of animal husbandry in the United States . That it has now reached large proportions and stands among the great factors of national wealth may be seen from the fact that the total value of the domestic animals of the United States at the last census was very nearly three billions of dollars . Of this vast sum distribution is as follows : Neat cattle , 49.5 per cent ; horses , 30.1 per cent ; mules , 6.6 per cent ; sheep , 5.7 per cent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .2 per cent ; goats , .1 per cent . It is interesting to note that this last relatively small per cent represents nearly two million goats , valued at over three millions of dollars . Nearly all the live stock is on farms and ranges , though 6.7 per cent of the value of all live stock , or $214,6.58,873 , applies to stock not upon farms or ranges . // Recent statistics place the number of swine in the nations which are the chief producers of that animal as follows : The United States , 67,000,000 ; Germany , 17,000,000 ; Russia , 1,000,000 ; Hungary , 7,000,000 ; Canada , 3,000,000 , Spain , 2,000,000 ; Roumania , 2,000 , - 000 ; Poland , Belgium , Denmark , the Netherlands and Australasia , each 1,000,000 , the United States thus having much the larger proportion of the world 's supply . All but f'ourhundredths of a per cent of the sheep of the United States are upon farms and ranges . Since the period of the New Earth the average production of wool per sheep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product has increased 300 per cent . During the same period sheep have increased in numbers in the United States 67 per cent , which , taken in connection with the situation abroad , and with the possibilities for the extension of sheep-raising in this country , forms an interesting situation . Throughout foreign countries there has been , curiously enough , a falling off n sheep production in the same period . A recent United States consular report shows that the flocks of the world outside of the // United States have declined at least ninetythree millions since 1873 . The report , appearing in September , 1905 , written by Consul Williams , of Cardiff , Wales , making note of the fact that this is the American farmer 's opportunity , says , incidentally , as to the causes of the decline : " The world is eating up its sheep . Its flocks have been declining for three decades , and that decline has become perceptible in so many countries that it is regarded as the most remarkable agricultural movement of our times . A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first to be noted is the modern method of studying ' Hebrew history and literature . This has brought to light the fact of the preponderance of mutton in the meat diet of the Hebrews from the earliest times , a preponderance that accounts , in part , for the character of their civilization , and their persistence as a race . The dread of tuberculosis and pleuro - pneumonia in some countries , and of trichina in others , has led to the substitution of mutton for other meats by several classes , especially those influenced by the lurid accounts in the // sensational press . The high price of beef in recent years has forced many others to make a like substitution . But the principal cause of the decline of sheep has been the movement of ' the agricultural population to the industrial centers in the towns and cities . This class , with an already acquired taste for mutton , is able to gratify that liking to a greater degree in the town than in the country , both on account of the better opportunity offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing capacity by the higher wages paid in the towns. ? While from time to time , for one reason or another , objections are raised on the part of foreign countries against American meats , the fact remains that the overcrowded nations of Europe must depend upon outside sources largely , perhaps chiefly , upon the United States for flesh foods . In Germany , during the summer of 1905 , under a meat inspection law of unusual stringency aimed at exclusion , the prices of meats rapidly rose , and the supply decreased until the matter became of greater national significance than the alleged dangers from the foreign meats . The whole- ' 229 THE NEW EARTH sale price of live hogs advanced under the new law from $21.42 per two hundred and twenty pounds in 1900 to $30.94 in 1905 , or more than fourteen cents per pound . Steers advanced at a still heavier rate . In Berlin fresh pork advanced to twenty - four cents per pound , veal to thirty-five cents , mutton to twentyeight and one-half cents , beefsteaks and roasts to thirty-five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working people . Many serious complications followed , not the least of them being the injury to dealers , over thirty meat shops in the city of Frankfort-on-the-Main alone having been closed or announced as about to be closed through the destruction of their trade by the scarcity and high prices of meats . Russia in Europe in 1905 had only 24,000 , - 000 head of cattle and 35,000,000 sheep for a population of over 90,000,000 , and no other country in Europe had so large a number . Great Britain and Ireland had only 11,000,000 head of cattle , 6,000,000 hogs and 34,000,000 sheep for a population of nearly 43,000,000 . In the United States , during the years when there has been a constant decrease in Europe , // there has been a marked increase . In 1850 , t he value of all the live stock in the United States was a little over five hundred millions of dollars . The increase in value from 1850 to 1860 was 100.2 per cent ; from 1860 to 1870 , 12.9 per cent ; 1870 to 1880 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent ; 1890 to 1900 , 29. per cent . While the value of the live stock I ' the United States has now risen to nearly three billions of dollars , and while , with a rapidly increasing population , the home demand must remain large , the opportunity for Amerwatt meats abroad is great and must become huger year by year . With increased demand must come increased prices , and the vital quest ion now before the producer of these supplies in the United States is , how he may receive Ills fair share . Rapidly growing up in these t : ors of the New Earth has been a conscienceless , monopoly in meat products in America . Sonic method of controlling this monopoly and counteracting its brutal rapacity must speedily be devised , if the animal-husbandry interests of the United States are to escape a danger imminent and of colossal magnitude . // the by little the train drew nearer , and when an hour had passed it cut through the green thread , the sands slipped backward into the night , and lo , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble green sweeps of orange and lemon , pomelo and lime , olive and fig , and , further upward along the mountain side , grapes , ripening in the mellow sunshine still aglow on the upper mountain slopes . There were lovely homes , embowered in roses and adorned with stately palms ; there were little towns where penury never stalks , and further on , thriving beautiful cities throbbing with American life . It was a noble prospect . When the New Earth began it was a. sand-strewn waste , part and parcel of the Great American Desert . It was the miracle of the Spirit of the Water . It has taken but a few years to make these oases , and , though they have proven beautiful to the eye and fattening to the purse , they have merely dotted the desert , and millions upon millions of arid acres yet remain . So man has begun to sponge off the Great American Desert from the map . It is now , since the New Earth began , a movement in full swing , ? the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied activities of this period . I passed along a palm-bordered road , one day , where but a new years before sand and , United chaparral and the dreaded cactus marked the region as fit only for the seat and haute of Desolation . On one side of the road , fa toward the blue foothills , spread the glossy green tops of the greatest lemon orchard in the world , full thirty thousand acres , reclaimed by the water impounded in the near-by mountains or pumped here and there from the rivers that run upside down , those curious California rivers flowing through the sands below the sight of the eye . Beyond the mountains of Mexico in the distance stretched the blue Pacific , and in the fair offing you might see white battleships riding lazily at anchor . It was a rare scene , full of placid beauty , suggestive of riches and content . In the other side of the road the trees were dead , their bare branches stretched toward the great hot sun , their lifeless roots held fast in the vise-like grip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circling mountains to the north , unrelieved in their // barrenness save here and there where appeared a leafless tree still bearing some show of yellow fruit , a tree not quite dead , and struggling with all a plant 's silent heroism to ward off its doom . One side of the road had had water and still used it , year following year , and it was a garden ; the other side , sixty feet away , had had water , had profited by it till its trees were large and thrifty , had then been abandoned by some thriftless owner ; it was traveling at steady speed back to the desert . No human being is prepared to say that he knows the preciousness of water until he knows the desert . It is more than a precious thing , it is a great elemental force second to no other in the universe ; indeed , where shall its equal be found for wideness of scope and influence ? But see how the period of the New Earth is transforming those waste places ! Scarce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desert encircling the haunt of death ; today , divided into rich states , while the national government , realizing that the only thing needful to make this desert blos- // som and bear was to take the waters that for uncounted centuries , coming down from their homes in the white mountains , had gone wastefully by these arid lands , harness them , and send them out to the service of man , has begun the greatest reclamation project of modern days , ? in its scope the greatest perhaps in the history of the world . In considering somewhat more in detail ? though , of necessity , in condensed detail the factors at work for the reclaiming of the arid lands of America during this New Earth period , this project of the national government may first be referred to , ? one of four distinct reclamation features which , all told , promise to work the mightiest transformation , ? surely the words are not overdrawn ? ever accomplished in this line . ' ' here are , in round numbers , fifty millions of acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reclamation act of 1902 . It is the purpose of the government , under the provisions of this act , to restore this vast empire to fertility . By the exercise of sound common sense , this national reclamation is in no possible sense paternal . Paternalism , at the // best , among childish peoples is only a sorry makeshift tending toward flaccid mental muscles ; while paternalism in a free republic like our own is a national sin . These fifty millions of acres of arid land will be reclaimed by means of money derived from the sale of the government lands in the thirteen states and three territories in which the irrigation will be introduced ? Arizona , California , Colorado , Idaho , Kansas , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Dakota , Utah , Washington , Wyoming . To begin with , there was a fund already accumulated of thirty million dollars , soon to reach fifty million dollars . The government is taking this money , finding out just where it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , is constructing reservoirs and digging canals and distributing the water over the desert places . It is believed that by the time the fifty million dollars is expended this Great American Desert will afford homes for fully five hundred thousand people : homes where there will be ever at hand in soil and climate and water the means for a comfortable living . Still further to avoid // paternalism , the settlers upon these lands ? divided into farms of not less than forty nor more than one hundred and sixty acres , and not more than one farm to one person will be required to pay back to the government in proportion to the benefit they receive until the total initial cost of the various irrigation projects has been met . The money will then be used over again for further reclamation and allied purposes . The amount of money each settler pays is small , twenty dollars , in ten annual instalments . The settler must be a settler indeed , an actual bona fide resident upon the land . Only by enforcing this provision with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should become , the most important agrarian enterprise of modern days . The . situation stood as follows in the autumn of the year 1905 : 239 The amount of land to be irrigated in these initial enterprises is one million , eight hundred and fifty-nine acres . It is estimated that the reclamation of this section of the arid West will increase land values nearly ninety millions of dollars , with an annual income from the lands irrigated amounting to nearly thirty millions of dollars . The possibilities of this , one of the commanding acts of agriculture in the era of the New Earth , can not be estimated . As the years pass , the occupants of the new region will become more intensive in their farm life , and thus there will be provision for other and still other thousands of settlers , all of them , even unto the millions , sustained and // protected by the mighty Spirit of the Water , the conqueror of the Great American Desert . On June 17 , 1905 , the third anniversary of the passing of the reclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in western Nevada were turned into the huge canal which had been constructed in that state , the initial performance under the reclamation act ; national irrigation in America had begun . This tacit , as it is called , of the entire system of all ' these various states will irrigate over three hundred and fifty thousand acres of land , ? desert land through uncounted centuries . Nine 61 1 lions of dollars will be spent before this nit , is finished . There will be ninety miles f main canals and twelve hundred miles of lateral canals and ditches . The opening was an event of no mean importance . So the work of reclamation goes forward by the national governcnent , the development of each unit in each state , each project for the utilizing of so many more thousands of acres of land , being hailed by the residents of each commonwealth as a new inspiration for progress . Irrigation is no new thing under the sun . Thousands of years before the dawn of the // Christian era it was in practice in Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day , but yet of incalculable value to the regions that border the Nile . Irrigators in America , as a government report sets forth after an exhaustive study of the subject in Egypt , have little to learn from that country . A country still using a crooked stick for a plow will hardly serve as a model . The feasibility of irrigation , its possibilities , its rapid and permanent advancement of land values , its influence in providing homes and sustenance for steadily increasing populations , all this was long ago established on the banks of Father Nile , while the great Assuan dam , far up the Nile , constructed as the result of the investigations of the technical commission appointed in 1894 , has shown conclusively the importance of a far wider utilization of the waters of this great African river . The initial cost of this Egyptian darn was about the same as will be the cost of the completed TruckeeCarson unit , while the added increase in the wealth of the people of Egypt will be at least eleven millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these // states are constructed , when the raising of herds , of forests , of grains and fruits and vegetables is under way , when these fifty millions of acres of desert land are reclaimed for the use of man , who shall be able to estimate the consequent increase in material wealth ? Irrigation is not a dream . It is an unanswerable argumentent , unanswerable , because it has been answered century by century since the beginning of man 's reign upon the earth . The only bider is that national irrigation was not loner commenced in America . Another interesting development of the period of the New Earth , in the reclamation of arid soil , has been brought forth in the state California , which , by reason of its climate , the natural richness of its arid soils , and its moral adaptability , is , perhaps , the most favored state for the prosecution of the work reclamation . With the period of the New Earth began that long series of soil experiments under Prof. E. W. Hilgard , director of c station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . While welcoming every effort , put forth for irrigation , the soil ivestigations had for their immediate aim the prov- // ing of the fact that cultivation , and , with cultivation , a knowledge of the structure and needs of the soil , was not less important than irrigation . All the water in the world will do but little good if allowed to run to waste , or if it is not used with intelligence . Professor Hilgard , for example , took up the study of a certain desert section . He made the most searching analyses of the soil at all depths , determining precisely its constituents and its needs . In the midst of the study of these sections , he arrived at results that have had an important bearing on the cultivation of fruits , and have added great wealth to his state . For example , he proved that the soil in the arid regions was very deep , with an absence of subsoils , showing that cultivation might reach to any feasible depth , and thus crops would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preliminary tests developed many facts both as to the chemical and physical character of the soil itself , and as to the soil in the main , showing thus what crops were best fitted to given soils before the crops or orchards were planted . Some five hundred soils are thus analyzed by this station free of all cost every // year . A fter the alkali lands of the arid region were proven to be unusually fertile , the further demonstration was made that they were rendered unproductive solely by the excess of ions salts , that the total depth of these salts was usually not more than four or five feet in the surface , and that not only could these to be removed to large degree by drainage , but that their re-ascent could be prevented simply by preventing surface evaporation ? and s prevention was effected by means of deeper gat ion , called deep-furrow irrigation , the live being kept dry while the earth around roots is moist . Then , again , extensive chemical analyses of the waters in different portions of the arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water which , of itself , would work harm to the land . Certain portions of the desert had what is led black alkali , or carbonate of soda , which been very difficult to combat . It was found It gypsum spread upon such soil neutralized the alkali . Investigation was at once set on I. and a deposit of the gypsum was found by the station within the borders of the state itself , a never-failing supply . // Thus , this second element in reclamation is seen to be of large importance , for it has resulted in the reclamation of land now worth millions of dollars , in addition to the still greater value , present and prospective , of the crops which come from the orchards upon these soils . Third in the list of factors which have come into play since the beginning of the New Earth for the aid of man in the saving of these waste places is arid farming , now under full swing in the state of Utah , as well as under careful test in other states having arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , or with so small a portion as to make it almost a negligible quantity , together with the adaptation of certain crops to these soils , ? crops which , like the native desert plants , as the cactus and the chaparral , will grow with the very smallest appreciable portion of moisture . The Experiment Station of Utah has taken up this work and has pushed it to most satisfactory ends . In Utah , there are eighty-two thousand one hundred and ninety square miles of land , and even when as much as ten thousand square miles of this shall be supplied with water , // which will be a long time in the future , there will be remaining nearly forty-five millions of acres still arid . Out of the eighty-two thouwinds of square miles in the state , only nine hundreed and eighty-three square miles are now under irrigation . The problem in reclamation here has been , What can be done without water , or with the very smallest amount of Water ? In the answering of this question some exceedingly interesting facts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this farming in defiance of sun and heat and drought , it seems hard by the land of miracles . When the discussion of the subject of arid farming was well under way , as a result of the preliminary experiments of the station , the state legislature of Utah enacted a bill providing for the establishment of five experimental farms in arid regions of the state , and it is largely upon these farms that the work has wen carried on . One of the most important problems has been to make use of what little water does come in the way of rain or snow so to store this water in the soil , which in Utah is of unusual depth , that it may all be saved for // the uses of the plants . And after the water was in the soil , the next problem was to select such crops as would get along with the least possible amount of water and yet yield abundantly . The actual work on a large scale began in 1904 , so that but little time has yet elapsed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arid farming had been carried on by intelligent farmers in certain regions of the state long enough fully to justify the belief that the more extended work of the station would yield rich results . Tests were at once begun in careful analyses of the soils and in the selection of drought-resistant wheats , oats , millet , sugar-beets , vegetables , Kaffir corn , and so on . The farms were desert when the tests began , covered with sage brush , the very antithesis of fertility . The transformation wrought was complete , the desert was made a garden . While some of the tests were not satisfactory , ? as , indeed , was to be anticipated , as the work is essentially experimental at the start , ? enough was developed to show that the arid farming in Utah has absolutely conquered the desert . An exhibition of the products of these dry // farms , held in Salt Lake City , showing the splendid quality of crops grown , aroused the deepest interest , it was an object-lesson in the possibilities of arid farming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands , indeed millions , of arid acres , which re not likely to come under the influence of direct irrigation , profitable crops are now to be used in absolute disregard of the sun and the drought . Fourth among the significant factors in the reclamation of the desert lands of America , is the remarkable work of Luther Burbank in reeding cacti which are food both for man and beast . Through all the centuries , the cactus us been faithful to the desert , however bitter a foe to man and beast . It will thrive where , perhaps , no other vegetation will grow , and , diking this into account , Mr. Burbank spent limy years of his life in breeding a cactus free from spines and thorns , and having a high per cent of nutriment . There were thornless cacti , r those practically so , in various ' parts of the ' odd , but they were not of the type he wished , not so rich , not capable of growing as he planned they should grow in all climates wher- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from various portions of the globe , thornless and with thorns , bred them together in a wellnigh interminable succession of blendings and crossings , planted the seedlings from the crosses by the tens of thousands , and from these thousands made selection . Year by year he repeated the process , in order to secure precisely what he wished , always selecting those which came nearest his ideal . While , in 1906 , he has not gotten the cactus in shape to give to the world as it will be given , free of all cost , still further work being under way upon it , he has demonstrated beyond all question that the thornless , edible cactus , not only rich in food in the juicy leaves , but with a fruit delicious to the taste and also highly nutritious , has come to the world to stay , to help redeem the desert , to be no more a foe to man , but his constant and never-failing helper . This cactus is one of the greatest of all Mr. Burbank 's great works . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropics , the arctics . It is food for man and food for beast . It is to work the transformation of the desert . Take these four great enterprises , ? national // aid in irrigation , the solution of problems in California , the introduction of arid farming , the production of this cactus : blend them if you will into one composite in your mind , and t lien try to estimate what these four steps ire-the advancement of the New Earth mean to the race . Truly , we are living in the age of miracles : best of all , they are practical miracles , rich in service to mankind . // THE FOODS OF THE NEW EARTH IF any man more than another should be well informed on the foods of the race , surely it is he without whom the food supply of the race vanishes . It is this man , the tiller of the New Earth , who supplies this food , wheat , corn , rice , meat , vegetables , fruits ; the whole stock for the sustenance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purveyor of the race . If the material which he provides falls below normal , the race to a proportionate degree loses in vitality . If the maintains the integrity of the elements in his products , permanency is secured . If he increases the nutritive value of his food supplies so that , when prepared for the table , they will afford so many more per cents of heat for the body , so many more of muscular strength , so many of vitality , then he is leading the world upward in the betterment of his crops . But not until the dawning of the New // Earth , not , indeed , in some quarters even yet , have the producers of these supplies had any real knowledge of what food really is , what it does for the body , and how and why it does it . Nor are they alone in this lack of knowledge , for not until within the last generation , notably the last half of it , has any considerable portion of the general public of town and country come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of foods is hot . yet finished , and while there is much divergence of opinion as to food values among those who should be advancing upon the same or parallel lines , yet great progress has been made . Indeed , the investigations into foods , their nutritive values , their possibilities under new and novel conditions , as well as the invesgations into the subject of food adulteration , which adulteration , strangely enough , has arisen and most dangerously persisted in the period of this development of knowledge , - -e revolutionized the dietary of thousands . No doubt there will always be an abundance more or less harmless fads in methods of Taring and eating foods , but out of the new order , nevertheless , is coming a greater meas- // ure of true knowledge and a stronger race of men and women , stronger physically and mentally ; the bearing upon manners and morals may indeed be not less pronounced . I fancy there are few , on or off the farm , who are not becoming convinced that they eat too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to many a worn-out , over-fed stomach pushed for half a lifetime to excess . I question if there is any department of human activity in which men are engaged with greater zest than in the development of the knowledge of foods . In the agricultural schools , the preparatory and training schools , in normal institutions , and in the universities themselves , everywhere the leaven is working . Scientific men , realizing not only that great additions to human knowledge should follow researches along this line , but that out of the investigation should come vast good for the race , have followed these lines of work with the keenest interest . Today the results of these investigations may be the property of the tillers of the soil . They are practical results , having a distinct and helpful bearing 254 ' I'IIE FOODS OF THE NEW EARTH upon health . More than that , for out of the knowledge now made available as to foods and their values comes happiness , too . Of all men most miserable is he who suffers from dyspeptic torture , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to eat and why , who knows why certain foods are harmand how he may supply their place with other foods just as nutritious and toothsome , has found a road that leads through happy rids . I I ow thoroughly practical is this newer knowledge was brought clearly home to me to day as an agricultural chemist in his laboratory was proving the heating power of a vegetable , ? what it would do in the way of giving man fuel to keep up the fires of vitality in is own body . It was a fine illustration of the many ways in which the knowledge of the ' ewe Earth has been broadened and deepened . He had before him on the table a stout tube bout eight inches long by four inches in diameter . It was solid steel save for a small plastinum-lined cavity in the center . In this cavity he placed a little brown pellet , looking ire like a cough lozenge . It had been // pressed into its present shape by means of a powerful lever . It was a condensed squash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable he was testing . He had under the powerful apparatus compressed quite a portion of the squash into this little pellet . Down in the center of the bomb , as the steel receptacle was called , was suspended a tiny , black , thread-like wire of pure iron . The cap of the bomb was screwed on , and the bomb was placed in a pail of water in which stood a thermometer so delicately graduated that it would measure to the one-thousandth of a degree . Then the current of electricity was turned on , the iron wire caught I fire , burned down to the pellet and set it ablaze , the pellet was consumed , and the heat made in the burning passed out through the walls of steel , warmed the water and was measured upon the thermometer . It was not much heat , to be sure , but it was all recorded as accurately as though it had been a thousand degrees . The object of this test was to prove just how much fuel , so to speak , there was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable it would be as a food ; for precisely thel 256 ' 1'IIE FOODS OF THE NEW EARTH same act would take place if the squash were I to a human being , it would give off the Inc heat that was measured on the thermometer , and the body would have made use i t . The steel tube , in technical words , was a bomb calorimeter . In order to get a working basis , the scientific men established what they a calorie . It is simply a unit of measure . is the amount of heat which would be led to increase the temperature of a pound water four degrees by the Fahrenheit thermometer , or one and eight-tenths by the Centigrade . Or it may be measured in energy . Thus the one calorie , if put into power , as in a stream engine , would lift one ton a foot and till ' . Just as in coal there is what is called tit. heat , heat in reality which is in waiting the fire to come and turn it into actual t. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run our mer across the ocean , so there is in foods k latent heat waiting to be given out into body in the processes of digestion . The calorimeter gives the opportunity of measuring - just how much latent heat there is in s , so that it becomes possible to tell of any just how valuable it is for body fuel . // In another room in the same building , three times a day , six young men met to eat their meals . The food given them was under test . It was weighed and measured with the utmost care . One young man had one kind of meal , that is , a certain ration which he kept through the test ; the others , other rations . Every particle of waste was accounted for , so that the actual value of each food was determined . I t was quite as though an engine was being fed a certain amount of coal and a careful record kept of all the refuse , as well as of all the work the coal did in the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week the foods were under test , and , at the end of that time , after having made careful laboratory tests of the value of the foods , determined by artificial digestion experiments , the professor in charge was able to come to a very clear and accurate statement of just what the different foods were worth , and also to determine the relative value of the different styles of rations . Still different and more extensive is the test made in the respiration calorimeter . In this apparatus the small cavity in the steel bomb // is expanded to a large cavity , so to call it , ? a room , ? and the steel walls of the bomb to the copper-lined walls of the room . In place of a pellet of squash in the bomb , a man is placed in the room and on him tests are made , absolute , though not so heroic in character as those which burned the little pellet to ash . Still , the st made is precisely as accurate . Out of this respiration calorimeter is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been developed in the period of the New Earth . A man is kept in this room for a certain number of days say a week or a fortnight . As in the case of the young men under test . referred to above , though they went about their regular work in the open as usual , full and accurate data and records are kept ofeverything pertaining to the man in the cage , together with the composition of the foods fed , their amount , and so on . But much more is done than this . Not only is every particle of waste determined , and how much food is left unconsumed in this waste as it comes from the intestines and kidneys , but how much waste is given off through the lungs in breathing .
