txt The report of the elevated and Subway earnings for the December quarter discloses for the Subway a seasonal movement like that so familiar in the case of Brooklyn Rapid Transit , and also for the elevated the even more familiar steady growth of street railway traffic in this borough . Always Brooklyn rises on the Summer traffic growth as though it would not fall on the Winter decrease . The Subway may develop a movement just the reverse of this , unless indeed it should be able to correct the atmospheric unpleasantness which cost it business last year , and enjoy a steady growth . The attempt is worth while , for there appears a difference of $407,565 between the surplus earnings of the first and third quarters of 1905 . This fluctuation Is necessary to remember , lest otherwise enthusiasm over the very handsome report just made should prove misleading to the unthinking . The December quarter surpassed the maximum made in the March quarter , 1905 , so that it is to be supposed that the quarter now current will be another new record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the average daily movement of passengers in 1905 was 410,280 against 249,880 for 1904 's incomplete quarter . Translated into dollars , this increase of travel is partially reflected in an increase of surplus by $611,485 to $803,679 . Looking backward , the net earnings , or surplus above charges , for the respective quarters have been successively $803,000 , $227,000 , $503 , - 000 , and $035,000 . That growth of profit is Incomplete is apparent from the fact that while charges are for the nearly complete system , the Brooklyn and northerly ends have yet to contribute their full quota . It would be sweetly simple to deduce an annual income by multiplying the last quarter by four , with a corollary of an improvident contract between the city and Subway and potential three-cent fares . The quarterly variations are inconsistent with such deductions . The elevated 's quarter shows a surplus of $159,000 , against a deficit of $117,00 ) for the September quarter . Despite the gain , there Is a loss of $85 , - 000 , comparing the two December quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be showing complete equivalents for the loss suffered ) by the opening of the Subway . There hardly could be completer justification for the choice of linking die Subway in the first place with the elevated rather than with the Metropolitan , for which a better bargain was made by awaiting the course of events . A like remark might be made regarding the acquisition of Brooklyn Rapid Transit . if indeed there be any intention of acquiring it at all . Aggregating the results upon both Subway and elevated for the quarter , there appears an increase of $523,711 and a consolidated surplus $178,000 in excess of the interest upon the bonds to be issued in exchange for the present Interborough stock . How far this would go toward meeting the deficit earned by Metropolitan can not be said upon any information in public possession , for Metropolitan is an unknown quantity in the incomplete merger . And this applies as well to Metropolitan 's prospects for growth as to its deficit . Certain it is that Metropolitan has seen its worst days of loss through Subway competition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitudinally and longitudinally , it contains almost unlimited possibilities of service to the community and profit to the combination of which it is to become part .
