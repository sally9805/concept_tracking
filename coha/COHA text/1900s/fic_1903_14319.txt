SCENE :  --  Small reception room in MRS . ALDRICH 'S house . There are one or two good pictures , two or three good ornaments on table and mantelshelf , two or three chairs and a door . It is evening , and there may be candles . At the back , in the corner , is a table , upon which are heaped many carefully wrapped parcels of all shapes and sizes , which are also piled up on the floor and perhaps on a chair . ( Enter NORA , a tidy maid , carrying an arm load of similar wrapped parcels , which she deposits with the others . As she is about to put down the last of them , MRS . ALDRICH comes in . She is a graceful , gracious , intelligently amused woman of about thirty-five , in evening dress . At the moment , she shows the preoccupation of the hostess . ) BETTY Is that all there are , Nora ? NORA All , is it ? Huh ! They do be more white iliphants to this paarty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William does nothing but carry them down stairs , and Kate and Molly are after wrappin ' and wrappn ' and wrappin ' and niver see the ind of it all . Shall I be after takin ' some of thim in to the gintleman now ? ( Takes up two parcels ) BETTY No , no ! Not until the sale begins , Nora , and then one at a time . Never let them see but one at a time . ( Enter CLIFFORD RAND , a deliberate , humorous , middle-aged bachelor . NORA goes out. ) p. 3 RAND Hello , Betty . They told me you were here . Sorry I 'm so late . BETTY ( Surprised and delighted ) Clifford ! I did n't know you were in town ! RAND I 'm just in . Found your card inviting me to a White Elephant sale , and it excited my curiosity . What 's it all about ? BETTY ( Still glowing with hospitable greeting ) I 'm so glad you could come ! RAND Thanks . As a matter of fact I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and you interrupted a perfectly good train of thought . But where you are concerned ( with a smiling little bow ) all my trains are accomodations ! BETTY You nice person ! RAND Say , what is a white elephant sale ? BETTY Dear man , did you never own a White Elephant ? RAND Never . Somehow , mine always prove to be blind kittens and come to an untimely end . BETTY You must be loved of the gods if in that " annual exchange of something you ca n't afford for something you do n't want , " you have never achieved a White Elephant you could n't drown . ( He shakes his head ) Have you no sentiment ? p. 4 RAND My dear Betty , ( whimsically ) ther 's no end to that ! Whistler 's " damned little thing on the mantelpiece that gives the whole show away " increases and multiplies in the sunshine of sentiment , until it 's all over the place . BETTY ( Laughingly indicates the pile of parcels ) And then one acquires merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it immediately becomes a pig in a poke for somebody else . That 's what a White Elephant sale is ! It 's the rich relation of the rumage sale . RAND ( Looking at the pile of parcels ) And all the world contributes to it , apparently . By the way , who 's the man out there who looks like Grove Carrington ? BETTY It is Grove Carrington . RAND I thought he was building bridges and draining swamps and cutting roads through the jungle somewhere ? BETTY He was  --  and is . He 's going back next month . Eleanor Baird 's here to-night too . RAND ( Quietly , with interest ) Is she ? I wonder  --  BETTY Yes , we all wonder . You were with us that summer at Murray Bay , Cliff , and you knew Grove awfully well . What broke off that affair ? p. 5 RAND I give it up ! BETTY When we went up there we all thought she was going to marry Clayton Page . I think she thought so herself . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than friends  --  everybody thought it was serious , until  --  one day it was n't and he was gone . RAND Still , the whole thing was so sudden . When he went out he did n't expect to stay . Do n't you remember , he was summoned by cable  --  as consulting engineer in an emergency ? Eleanor had nothing to do with his going . BETTY No . But even when the work went wrong and he had to stay , she never spoke of him . Cliff , something happened . What was it ? RAND I wish you 'd tell me ! He is n't the sort of chap one questions . He 's always on guard against daws . BETTY They 're well matched there ! Eleanor does n't wear a decorated sleeve , either . RAND Something happened ! BETTY Yes , but what ? People said she had decided to marry Mr. Page , but she did n't . ( Hesitates ) I thought Grove might be going to marry Miriam Latimer , but that 's never been announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Bay just after his arrival and Miriam 's interest was manifest . p. 6 RAND But she 's his cousin ! BETTY What has that to do with it ? Something evidently came between Grove and Eleanor . Why not an earlier attachment ? RAND Oh , woman ! woman ! I 'll bet it was a woman who first said , " Cherchez la femme . " BETTY I dare say . Women have said most of the clever things men take credit for . RAND Wo n't you concede that honors are sometimes easy ? BETTY ( Laughs , then speaks earnestly ) It may be absurd , but I 've never been able to convince myself that Eleanor 's decision was not influenced in some way by Miriam 's arrival  --  and I 've never really liked Miriam since . RAND Poor Miriam ! BETTY ( Earnestly ) I always want to fight Eleanor 's battles ! She is so dear to me  --  and much too generous . ( Whimsically ) Her claws are atrophied . RAND ( Warmly ) My dear Betty , adequate defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the mere sight of blood you run for your first-aid kit ! ( Enter hastily , ELEANOR BAIRD , a woman of thirtyfive , fastidious , discriminating , humorously intellectual , and charming . She still wears her coat , having just arrived. ) p. 7 ELEANOR ( Agitated ) Oh , Betty ! Betty ! ( Sees RAND ) Oh , Cliff ! I did n't know you had returned . ( Gives him her hand carelessly and turns at once to BETTY ) Betty , where is my parcel ? I want it back . RAND Here 's one whose candle burns dimly on the altar ! She wants it back ! ELEANOR ( Poking in the parcels ) I 'd know it anywhere . Do help me find it ! You ca n't miss it . It 's tied in green rafia . BETTY But everything has been re-wrapped  --  and a lot of them boxed  --  so nobody can recognize his own . RAND Did n't you know this was a domino party ? ELEANOR Oh , Cliff , do be still ! Ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Takes up parcel , BETTY gently takes it out of her hand and ELEANOR , after slipping off her coat , immediately takes up another parcel and begins to untie it ) BETTY But why ? Do n't do that , Eleanor ! ELEANOR Do n't ask me why ! I 've got to find it ! ( Gets parcel open and discovers a piece of art nouveau pottery . Puts it aside with ejaculation and goes on opening others ) p. 8 RAND ( Takes up the art nouveau pottery , regarding it with whimsically appraising eye ) Betty , the vintage of that might almost place it as one of your wedding presents . BETTY ( Dryly ) My dear Clifford , you underestimate the devotion of my friends ! On that happy occasion they scorned clay , and cast their bread upon the waters in the form of imperishable silver  --  lest I forget ! ( With a whimsical grimace ) It 's with me yet ! RAND ( Laughing ) It should have been soaked before this . BETTY Well , it has n't been ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned breakable crusts ! ( ELEANOR , continuing her search , uncovers a small piece of sculpture of the sentimental school , which RAND takes from her . ) RAND ( Holding it at arm 's length with an air of bravado ) Oh , art ! How many crimes in thy name  --  ! ELEANOR ( Impatiently ) Oh , Cliff , do n't be ridiculous ! This is serious ! RAND ( Holding out sculpture ) Does n't that impress you as serious ? Yesterday that was Art ! ( BETTY laughs ) To-day  --  ( Looks about , takes up a really choice bit and holds it out to her in the other hand and pauses , with a whimsical shrug before adding ) But how about to-morrow ? p. 9 ELEANOR ( Preoccupied , still poking at parcels ) Never mind about to-morrow ! I ca n't wait ! I must have it now ! I must ! BETTY ( Taking ELEANOR 'S hand , in an endeavor to stop her search ) But why ? why ? ELEANOR Because , I just happened to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BETTY ( Laughing ) But we are all in that boat ! RAND There are boats and boats , Betty . Yours may be a pleasure craft , but hers seems to be a destroyer . ( Enter NORA . ) NORA Plaze , Mrs. Aldrich , they 're after wantin ' to begin . Which 'll I take first ? ( BETTY hands her a parcel and she goes out ) VOICE OF AUCTIONEER ( Outside ) Now , ladies and gentlemen , I am about to offer you an unparalled opportunity to secure some masterpieces of art and nature , which you will readily  --  RAND ( Cocking his ear , interrupts on " which " ) Me for the firing line ! Coming ? BETTY We 'll be there presently , Cliff . ( RAND goes out. ) p. 10 BETTY Eleanor , stop it ! You must n't open all those parcels ! Anyway , there are hundreds of them . You ca n't find it , dear . ELEANOR ( Desperately ) Betty , I must find it ! Grove Carrington gave it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELEANOR He was the first person I saw as I came in  --  and there 's a reason  --  a reason why I must have it . I 'm wild at the thought of his seeing it here ! He must n't see it ! You do n't know and I ca n't tell you  --  but it ca n't happen ! It ca n't ! BETTY There is only one way to prevent that . Distract his attention until your thing has been found and I have suppressed it . ELEANOR ( Much perturbed ) Oh , I could n't ! I could n't ! BETTY My dear child , you are a woman are n't you ? Talk ! Talk ! That was Eve 's first garden implement ! ELEANOR But Eve had no temperamen  --  and no competition . ( BETTY laughs ) Besides I have nothing to say to him now . BETTY Then talk patter  --  high brow art patter . ( Laughs a little ) You can do that in your sleep . p. 11 ELEANOR Maybe in my sleep , but this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go and find him . I 'll see every parcel opened until your thing turns up . By the way what is your thing ? ELEANOR My Ming statuette.Any choice piece of bric-a-brac may be substituted for the Ming statuette , BETTY Your near-Ming statuette , you mean . Why on earth do you want that back ? ELEANOR I tell you he 's here . BETTY ( Incredulous ) Grove Carrington ! Are you telling me that Grove Carrington , with his rare collection , gave you a spurious Ming ? ELEANOR ( Wretchedly ) Oh , Betty , do n't talk about it ! That 's what I ca n't explain . But I must find it ! BETTY ( Starting toward door ) All right . You find him and I 'll  --  ( Stops short speaking quickly ) Eleanor , here he comes ! Brace up ! ( ELEANOR drops limply into a chair . Enter CARRINGTON , a virile , tanned , crisp-haired construction engineer , whose manner shows a sophisticated background . Briskly , to cover ELEANOR 'S confusion ) What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 12 CARRINGTON ( Looking about ) I 'm on the trail all right , but it 's not elephants I 'm hunting . Did n't I catch a glimpse of Eleanor Baird ? BETTY Oh , have n't you seen her yet ? Eleanor , here 's Grove . ( BETTY slips out , and as she opens the door , the voice of the auctioneer and the hum of the amused audience can be heard ) CARRINGTON ( With emotion ) Have I really found you  --  at last ? ELEANOR ( Coldly to cover her perturbation ) Why , how do you do ? CARRINGTON ( Eagerly ) Did they tell you I called yesterday ? And again to-day ? ELEANOR ( Still coldly ) Yes , they told me . CARRINGTON I saw you come in here , and I had to follow . I was afraid I 'd lose you in the crowd . Why have n't you answered my letters ? ELEANOR ( Carelessly ) Oh , no one writes letters these days . CARRINGTON But you did write  --  Eeanor , why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evidently yours is a " great soul . " You scorn consistency . First you take me to task because I did n't write and now because I did . ( Throughout this scene she employs a light , almost flippant tone , to conceal her real emotion ) p. 13 CARRINGTON But that last letter  --  you might explain that ! To be followed into the wilds by an extinguisher like that  --  and then nothing ! Months  --  and years  --  and nothing ! I wrote  --  twice . And when you did n't answer I knew I must wait until I could see you , face to face . Then I began to hear that Page was going about everywhere with you , and I thought  --  ELEANOR ( Surprised , interrupting ) Page ? Clayton Page ? I have n't seen him for nearly a year ! CARRINGTON What ? But I certainly heard  --  ELEANOR Who wrote you that ? CARRINGTON I do n't remember . My cousin Miriam , I think . Anyway , Betty wrote afterward that he had disappeared , and I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I could n't get away until now  --  but I 'm here at last ! Now tell me ! What does it mean ? ELEANOR Oh , why talk about it ? It 's all ancient history now and there are so many nice new things to talk about . New people , new books , new music , new art  --  Why , it 's a bran new world you 've come back to . How does it seem to be born again ? CARRINGTON I do n't want a new world ! I want the old world  --  and you ! p. 14 ELEANOR That 's because you do n't know how many amusing things there are in all these new ones . And there are such a lot of them ! It 's a poor creator who has n't a new heaven and a new earth of his own these days , and the rest of us are breathless keeping pace with his creations . CARRINGTON I do n't care anything about that ! Eleanor , I 've come all the way back to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you wrote that last letter ? ELEANOR You 're reverting to an earlier manner , Grove . One is n't definite these days . CARRINGTON These evasions of yours make me want to revert to type ! I feel like a cave man . ELEANOR ( Laughing a little ) Get you to a studio , then . Primitive impulses are encouraged , at the moment , in the arts . CARRINGTON Only in the arts ? Eleanor , ( with emotion in his tone ) wo n't you at least let me tell you what this means to me ? Just for a moment , wo n't you be serious ? ELEANOR Oh , you forget this , is n't a serious occasion . CARRINGTON ( Offended ) Oh , I 'm sorry . I had an impression that it was . When a man has traveled half around the world to say one thing to a woman , he thinks he has earned the right to be treated seriously . I 'm sorry if I have bored you . ( Bows and turns away ) p. 15 ELEANOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry if I seem unsympathetic . Time was when you modulated into my key . CARRINGTON ( At the door ) But in the long silence you 've imposed I seem to have lost the pitch . ( Again approaches her ) Eleanor , I do n't know you ! I do n't know you in this mood . What has come between us ? ELEANOR Three years and several thousand miles are not to be  --  ( Interrupting herself breathlessly , as BETTY comes in hastily ) Oh , Betty  --  have you ? BETTY ( With a quick breath , after looking around ) Cliff has n't been here yet ? ELEANOR ( Agitated ) No ! Yes ! Why  --  he was here , you know . BETTY ( Very quickly ) Yes , yes , but he 's looking for you now ! ELEANOR ( Dismayed ) Clifford Rand ? Did he get it ? ( BETTY nods ) And he does n't understand ! ( Desperately ) Oh , Betty , why did n't you stop him ? BETTY You forget this mob of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . p. 16 ELEANOR Well , do n't waste time here ! Go and find him . CARRINGTON Let me go . ELEANOR ( Sharply , to prevent his seeing RAND ) No , no , you ca n't go ! ( He looks at her eagerly , and she smiles uneasily , trying to cover her agitation ) Clifford Rand sha n't interrupt the first talk we 've had in years . ( To BETTY conversationally ) We 're having a lovely time building bridges . BETTY With Grove 's help that should be easy . Building bridges is his genius . CARRINGTON ( To ELEANOR ) But my bridges demand solid foundations . ELEANOR Do you always find bed rock on the surface ? Betty , do go and find Cliff ! ( BETTY goes out . ELEANOR to CARRINGTON , lightly ) You remember Clifford Rand , do n't you ? CARRINGTON I know him very well . ELEANOR Then you also know his overdeveloped sense of humor . We rather dread him , at times . CARRINGTON ( Watching her ) Coming back to this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any facetious point of view , apparently . But I suppose it does make a difference whose ox is gored. p. 17 ELEANOR ( Turning toward door ) Oh , well , if you 're homesick for the jungle , let 's go and buy white elephants CARRINGTON ( Without moving ) And leave our bridges resting on shifting sands ? I ca n't do that ! ( Approaching her ) Wo n't you help me to make a solid foundation ? ELEANOR ( Evading him ) Why is a bridge without a foundation any worse than a foundation without a bridge ? CARRINGTON The foundation may safely wait for years for the bridge , but the bridge without the foundation comes to grief . ELEANOR Even an ephemeral bridge may be a thing of beauty on the sky line . CARRINGTON But I want a bridge that will span the years  --  a foundation on which I can rest my life . And only you can help me build it . ELEANOR ( Lightly but significantly ) Your life rests lightly on its foundations . You keep bed rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Eleanor , what do you mean ? There 's something under this that I ca n't understand . p. 18 ELEANOR ( Impetuously ) Oh , why equivocate ? You know perfecty well ! CARRINGTON ( Puzzled ) Know ? Know what ? What do you mean ? ( Enter RAND , displaying the Ming statuette . ) RAND ( Rather grandiloquently ) Behold in me the proud possessor of the most unblushing elephant now in captivity . ( Bows ironically to ELEANOR ) A glowing spark from your burnt offering I think . ELEANOR ( Confused ) Mine ? ( Laughs uneasily ) It does look a little like mine , does n't it ? ( CARRINGTON examines the statuette with amusement . ) RAND ( Teasing ) Like ? I 've heard the authenticity of his every seductive curve defended in your drawing room ! After being so gallant a champion in private , do you repudiate him in public ? ( With mock reproach ) I would n't have believed it of you . CARRINGTON There can be only one reason why Eleanor should defend a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . ELEANOR ( In a gasp ) Well ! I assure you I have never been able to find an excuse for that . p. 19 RAND Can it be possible that I have been rendering honors where no honors are due ? ( Smiles quizzically ) CARRINGTON ( To ELEANOR ) Then this was not yours ? ELEANOR ( Coldly ) I have been the unhappy possessor of one like it . RAND ( Teasing ) Can I believe my senses ? Is that an admission ? ELEANOR If it is , it 's not for publication . RAND ( Slightly grandiloquent ) I 'll guard your secret as my own ! But that empty niche in your drawing room will bear mute testimony to woman 's emancipation from sentimental slavery . CARRINGTON ( Dryly ) It must have been a strong sentiment that gave a thing like that even temporary place in your drawing room . RAND Temporary ! He 's been there almost long enough to have acquired squatter 's rights ! ( Maid comes in and auctioneer 's voice is heard ) Hark to the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more sentimental misfits . But I think Jumbo will be happier with you . He has n't learned to know his master 's voice yet . Will you guard him for me ? p. 20 ELEANOR No . Take him away . RAND ( Honestly surprised ) But I thought you were so anxious to keep it dark ! ELEANOR Oh , yes , I am . Leave it , by all means ! RAND But treat him tenderly , you two ! He has been told he was genuine until his faith in himself is akin to hope . CARRINGTON Well , there 's no question that the blind god inspired this gift . He could n't see the difference between 1519 and 1915 . RAND ( At the doorway ) Here 's a new beatitude ! Since blindness and gifts go hand in hand , blessed is the receiver who is also blind . ( RAND goes out , laughing ) CARRINGTON But you were n't blind , Eleanor ! You knew ! ELEANOR ( Sadly ) Our eyes are holden sometimes from choice . Grove , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , could you send this here ? Since you have treasured it all this time , you must have cared for the giver , if not for the gift . How could you send it to a place like this ? ELEANOR ( Coldly indignant , looking at him ) Remember your own words . A flawed foundation brings any structure to grief . And even now you wo n't admit that the faulty stone was yours . p. 21 CARRINGTON Mine ? What do you mean ? ELEANOR ( Suddenly frank ) Oh , why ca n't you be honest ? You know I kept this statuette because you gave it to me . CARRINGTON ( Amazed ) That ? I never saw the thing before ! ELEANOR ( Impressed and puzzled ) But  --  Grove ! You sent it to me ! It was your parting gift ! CARRINGTON That ? I sent you my own Ming figure , that I bought at Christie 's ten years ago . ELEANOR ( Shakes her head ) That 's what came to me . CARRINGTON But how could you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not genuine ? ELEANOR But here it is ! And with it came your letter saving that this would remind me during your absence of the lasting quality of your devotion ! CARRINGTON ( With sudden perception ) That 's why you wrote that cruel letter ! ELEANOR I was cruelly hurt . CARRINGTON Could n't you see it was a hideous mistake ? p. 22 ELEANOR How could it be a mistake ? CARRINGTON You knew I had n't sent it myself . How could I ? I was on my way to China . ELEANOR But you gave instructions ! ( Brokenly ) I 've tried  --  oh , I have tried to find excuses ! And if it had been something you bought for me  --  sent from a shop  --  But you wrote that you were sending the first piece you ever owned  --  the foundation stone of your great collection , and I knew that it was numbered , labelled and catalogued  --  and that is what came to me , as a reminder of the lasting quality of your devotion ! CARRINGTON ( In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can only say that it is a hideous mistake . Eleanor , wo n't you believe me when I say that I never saw the thing before ? ELEANOR Then may I ask how it reached me with your card and your last message ? CARRINGTON ( Unhappily ) I do n't know . I ca n't explain it . I supposed until this moment that mine had been sent to you . ELEANOR ( Perceiving ) To whom did you give the instructions ? CARRINGTON I do n't yet understand how a mistake could occur ! p. 23 ELEANOR ( Urgently ) How could there be a mistake about this ? Tell me , who had your instructions ? CARRINGTON ( Apologetically ) You see , she 's not a judge of these things . She did n't know . ELEANOR Who did n't know ? CARRINGTON My cousin Miriam . You may remember she and her mother were living in my apartment that winter . I gave her the card the night I left Murray Bay , and asked her to send it to you , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Indicating the statuette ) But what about this ? You insist that you never saw it before . Was this in your apartment ? CARRINGTON ( Evasively ) I did n't know it was . I do n't remember it . But I suppose it must have been  --  and you know Miriam is not a connoisseur . She would not appreciate the difference . ELEANOR ( Scornfully ) Oh , would n't she ? It was Miriam who came the day after I received this , and pounced on it instantly as a brilliant imitation ! She said that she would never have suspected that it was not genuine if she were not living in such close proximity to your real porcelains ! Miriam knew ! p. 24 CARRINGTON ( Uncomfortably ) I ca n't explain it . ELEANOR ( After a slight pause , archly , with a little smile ) Do you really think any further explanation is necessary ? CARRINGTON ( Starts toward her ) Eleanor ! Do you mean  --  ( Enter BETTY and RAND . ) BETTY ( With a quick comprehensive glance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) They are strong enough to carry all your white elephants . RAND ( Humorously ) Heaven forbid ! I 've seen ' em and you have n't . Apropos of elephants , where 's my property ? ELEANOR ( Radiantly ) Here he is  --  quite happy  --  his authenticity once more unquestioned . CARRINGTON Cliff , what will you take for that object ? RAND It 's not for sale . CARRINGTON Oh , come on ! I have a use for it . RAND So have I. I 'm going to suspend it over Eleanor 's head as long as she lives . p. 25 ELEANOR No , nothing will ever suspend it over my head again . At last it 's on a firm foundation . CARRINGTON I 'll buy it back at your own price . BETTY Oh , sell it , Cliff , we need the money ! RAND Look here , what is this critter ? I always was weak on zoology . What I want to know is whether this is a White Elephant or a blind kitten ? ELEANOR ( Laughing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
