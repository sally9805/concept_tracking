txt A FRIEND OF ORDER AND PEACE . Mayor R. J. BLACK of announced this week that he would not allow the police of that city to be used to protect the men brought there ty the managers of the steel mills to take the places of employes out on strike . " I for one . " said Mayor BLACK , " am opposed to bringing the offscourings of the United States into a quiet , orderly , and peaceful city like only to cause trouble . If the steel men ship men here when they know the men will cause a riot , should n't I arrest ' em : " He has declared that his sympathies are wholly with the strikers and that he shall treat all non-union strangers as " suspicious characters . " PERSIFOR F. SMITH , District Manager ot the American Sheet Steel Company , yesterday made the following statement : " I have orders from President : of the American Sheet Steel Company to tear down at once the Dewees Wood plant at and remove the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . " The Dewees Wood plant , Which was established forty years ago , covers some twelve acres of ground and employs from 900 to 1,200 men . It cost several millions of dollars . The decision to remove the plant from has been taken , it is said , because of the hostility of the people of that city to the . employing corporation . To-day is pay day at . About $240,000 will be distributed among 12,000 men . To-night President SPTArFER 's strike order goes into effect . There may be no more pay days in for months . It is reported , even , that the great National Tube Works will be removed  --  for the same reason that has led to the removal of the Dewees Wood Mill . The Vice President of the First National Bank of says that the average weekly deposits of the men employed by the steel companies have been $32,000 . The aspirations of R. J. BLACK , Mayor of , run strongly to peace and order . The city is evidently about to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel mills . The owners of the steel mills , finding it impossible to carry on their business amid a hostile population and under the rule of an Anarchist Mayor , have ordered one of their important mills to be dismantled , and may get out of the place altogether . The perfect peace and order of the desert will then prevail . This is perhaps the finest illustration the world has ever seen of the ways and works of organized labor in the temper and under the leadership that have of late determined its procedures in this country .
