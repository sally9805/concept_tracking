I , write another word on Julius Caesar , whether the man be the subject or Shakespeare 's play , is almost to make oneself one of those who scratch their miserable names on antique statues , on the face of the rock , on " the lone and level sand . " Calvary alone can surpass in awe the murder of Julius Caesar , which is the tragedy of time , as the Crucifixion is the tragedy of eternity . So tremendous an event is too full of compelling human interest to need the finger - mark of the commentator . I certainly would not dare to shoot my rubbish-heap at the door of Shakespeare , as once Mr. Swinhurne brilliantly described a certain editor 's introduction to Dickens , were there not one commonplace , one convention , of the crowd of commentators that seems to me to be an injury to Shakespeare . It is not a desecration to try to wash off hand-prints obscuring the figure 's true proportions . We are accustomed to be told that the Marcus Brutus of Shakespeare 's play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero , an unsullied patriot , a lofty character . struggling greatly and ultimately overborne by evil fortune . This reading , right or wrong , does not at any rate agree well with the conception of the play as the march of nemesis on crime . If Brutus was right , he committed no crime that nemesis should overtake . Poetic justice is irremediably violated by the climax of the play , which at one blow crushes Brutus and his whole cause , crushes him by the hands of the mere man of the world which the godlike reading of Brutus makes of Antony . The situation leaves the spectator unsatisfied : a deed which abstractly is a great crime has been committed ; it has been followed surely , inevitably , by the vengeance that ought to attend on crime ; yet the doer of the deed is a man that has no faultin him , who sacrifices himself for his country , while the sacrifice brings about only his friend 's murder , his own and in his view his country 's ruin . This is a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid sacrifice absolutely in vain , wrong everywhere triumphant . A tragedy indeed ; a modern might think it exactly the tragedy of real life , but the modern view is not dramatic . The novelist may take life as " all a muddle , " but the dramatic poet must find some meaning in the muddle , some end to which all moves . The novelist 111t1 y look only on the surface ; the poet must look beyond . Life is ordinarily quite undramatic , and therefore fails as a theme for drama ; the dramatist has to read much into it , or , it may be , to zee in it what is there but invisible to the common eye . One thing is certain : a passage in life or history capable of an intensely dramatic reading the poet will never represent . as undramatic . And that , as it seems to me , the idealist reading of Marcus Brutus and of the murder of Cnser makes Shakespeare do . Taken as the march of nemesis on crime , as the righteous punishment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the play of Cmar moves swiftly and consistently to its appointed end ; but it excludes the conception of Brutus as a single-minded patriot . In order to get over this difficulty the idealizers of Brutus have suggested as the motive of the play not nemesis , its natural and obvious theme , but the failure of ideals in practical politics . That is a very modern , a very subjective , way of looking at life ; still it is a possible dramatic theme , though the murder of Owsar is very illsuited for its setting . To make it fit , wrong has to be made right ; murder abstractly is always wrong . That in itself is no small obstacle to get over , no small hindrance to appreciating the intended motive . it is diffieult , too , to conceive that a dramatist who turned to Roman history for the groundwork of this theme would have taken the murder of Julius Cesar rather than the death a Tiberius and Camels Gracchns . The aims and end of the Gracchi illustrate the failure of ideals in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the republican conspirators . No crime has to be explained away ; the misdeeds of the Gracchi , if allowed to he misdeeds , are splendid mistakes : they are not against nature . If it is held that the Gracchi justly paid with their lives for aspirations dangerous to the state , still their dreams were noble ; if they were true reformers murdered by those who feared the effect of these reforms upon themselves , still more powerfully does their career show forth the failure of ideals in practical politics . Either way the fate of the Gracchi would serve that theme : while the history of the murderers of Cesar will tit only on a great assumption , with difficulty accepted . That a dramatic genius should have tried to find such a motive in the murder of Cesar , while it lay ready to hand , waiting for him , in the death of the Gracehi , is to me incredible . It is true , however , that the theme might be there in the play , whether Shakespeare meant it or not . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all : he merely wanted to dramatize an intensely impressive and obviously dramatic episode in history . Either way , what a writer means is usually small evidence as to what he has said ; it could not be conclusive evidence even in the case of a genius such as Shakespeare . We must exclude Shakespeare 's intention , which for one thing we can not know , as an illegitimate argument . We must take the words as they are and see what is in them . It is hard to believe that but for the character of Brutus any other than the nemesis interpretation would ever have been mooted . But Brutus of the play has imposed on Shakespeare 's readers and on his actors as did Marcus Brutus of history on Ctesar and on the Roman public . They have taken him at his own description of himself . A great tribute this is to the truthfulness of Shakespeare 's portrait . Indeed , it is probably only too faithful , as not flattering , to those who have eyes to see . Brutus is very fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eye , the loftiness of his motives : Let the gods so speed ins as I love The name of honour more than I fear death . There is no terror , Cassius , in your threats ; For I am arin'il so strong in honesty , That they pass by me as the idle wind . No , Cassius , no : think not , thou noble Roman , That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome ; He bears too great a mind . These testimonies to his own nobility , so natural a habit of thought with him that they come out from time to time even to the end on the battle-field , fall on the ear first with a sound of persuasive rotundity ; but thought over , they leave an unpleasant impression . There is rather too much protesting . It is perhaps hardly en impression of " swagger , " but one does feel very strongly that this man was deeply impressed with his own goodness ; he had become an ideal to himself : so much so that anything that jarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing not to be considered . Evidently , too , this was the popular conception of - Brutus . The man that has unbounded regard for himself , and expresses it often enough and loudly enough , will in the end get the vulgar mind to take him at his own measure . it was , as it were , a settled thing that Brutus was inunacuIate . That was the character he had to play to ? and behind : 0 , he sits high in all the people 's hearts ; And that which would appear offence in us , His countenance , like richest alchyrny , Will change to virtue , and to worthiness . This pose of Marcus Brutus , by which I do not mean that he was an intentional deceiver -- he really believed that he was supereminently good , and assiduously cherished himself in that capacity , ? lets us into the secret of his whole character . It is a character we of this day should find it easy to appreciate ; for we have had one or two striking examples of it . Profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rigid aims motive for his every desire . What he does he believes to be right , but he can always persuade himself that that is right which he wants to do . Ile tests his motives by his own character , and reasons infallibly that such a man eannot wish for anything that is wrong ; therefore what he desires is right . Thus he never violates his own conscience , and his conscience in return never stands in his way . Nothing but a very cataclysm of soul can stir this man into seeing himself ; hence a magnificent calmness about him . It may be urged that this analysis might dissolve the goodness of an archangel . Truly it might be applied fallaciously ; mortals have no magic crucible : but the test of a man 's deeds , of the influences that move him , of the impression he leaves on strong men who are his intimates , is a fairly good corrective . Try Brutus by it . The record of Marcus - Brutus is this : he accepts mercy at the hands of his conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ) . receives from him special favors and marks of love , is willing to bask in Ctesar 's sun : then when the opportunity comes , and he is offered the leadership of a conspiracy to assassinate his benefactor , he takes it ; he takes part in a bloody and cowardly murder , some twenty armed men setting on one unarmed ; and by this means becomes the first man in Rome . These are the unvarnished facts about Marcus Brutus : these are his spontaneous acts : to all that follow he is compelled , so they do not help in the understanding of his character . What did other men think of him ? The crowd took him at his word ; Antony , the " plain blunt man , " necessarily is imposed on , arch-enemy though he was . It would have been strange indeed had the careless soldier seen through such a charcter : so one is not at all surprised thatAntony , ntony , with a generosity that does him credit , pronounces Brutus " the noblest Roman of them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con-cfi irators . That is precisely the impres- on such a man as we are taking Brutus lo be would leave on a man like Antony . ho was so little of a judge of men that e could tell Cressr there was nothing to rear in Cassius : He 's not dangerous : 0 Bc is a noble Roman and well given . Not so Cassius himself ; he knows his man : he knows Brutus well . Cassius in acumen is right all through the story . Ile was right about the danger of leaving Antony alive : he was right about eases ; Cases did not fail them : he was right in his counsel of war ; Brutus was disastrously wrong : he was right in the quarrel ; Brutus was extremely unfair to him : he was probably right about Pella ; to be extreme to mark the taking of a present of money by a good friend was in such critical times absurd ; Cassius saw that it was just part of Brutus ' pose as the impeccable man , and felt . the contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how does Cassius , who was thus right all through , handle Brutus ? Re wants to get him over ; the plan , the initiative , comes all from Cassius : he plays Brutus like a fish . He begins by praising Brutus to his face in language that hardly falls short of rank flattery : It is very much lamented , Brutus , That you have no such mirror as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye , That you might see your shadow . In other words , " you are so good that no one else is good enough to give you an idea of yourself . " All through Cassius has no fear of offending Brutus by praising hint unblushingly to his face . Raving thus put Brutus on good terms with himself , Cassius proceeds to appeal to jealousy : " Are not you and I as good as Caesar ? Is not he human like ourselves ? " Then to envy : " And now he is a god and we are nobodies . " He ( loth bestride the narrow world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in that " Cmsar " ? Why should that name be minded more than yours ? Write them together , yours is as fair a name . And a last dexterous appeal to ambition : just a suggestion that Brutus by removing CsNar should emulate the glory of his ancestor Lucius Junius , who drove out Tarquin . In the whole of this great piece of advocacy Cassius lays no crime to Caesar 's charge : attempts no case against him ex- cept that he is great : does not even suggest a single public ill beyond that Cwsar was above and they below . And that is the line of argument which the acute Cassius selects as best calculated to tell on Marcus Brutus . And he proves absolutely right . He wants Brutus to join their conspiracy : and Brutus does join it . His faith in appeals to Brutus ' vanity is further shown in the device he selects to drive home what he has just been saying ; I will this night , In several hands , in all his windows throw , As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name ; wherein obscurely Ciesar 's ambition shall be glanced at : And , after this , let Czesar seat him sure . Cassius knew his Brutus well . Alone after Brutus had left him , Cassius gives us his impressions of their talk : * " Well , Brutus , you have a great reputation for nobility ; but I see now that with all your high character you can be perverted like other men : you should keep only with good men like yourself . You are not strong enough , after all , to stand up against men like me . I have a grudge against Caesar : you have none . If I were in your place now , you should not turn me against Caesar as I have turned you . " It has been pleaded that it is not Cassius ' arguments that decide Brutus . But there stands the fact that certain arguments are used to produce a certain result , and that result is produced . In such circumstances denial of cause and effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that it was Cassius that moved him : Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I have not slept . Then we have Brutus ' testimony to himself : a painfully eloquent testimony . ? Act I. , Scene IL , lines 313-320 . These lines may be interpreted differently . I am aware , but " I see " in line 313 must surely be an inference from Cassius ' recent talk with Brutus , and can not mean that he sees Brutus can be seduced by Caesar . The conversation and its result pointed all the other way . But he does see that Brutus can be influenced by himself . Vor CUI. ? No. 869 ? 46 Alone in his own house he weighs the matter of Caesar 's murder . He was determined to do this thing . " It must be by his death " are his first words . Being by no means a conscienceless man , he has to satisfy his conscience , he has to square the assassination with his high moral character . He can find nothing against Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Caesar to allow passion to sway him against reason . There is no charge to be founded on his past ; ah ! but who knows what he anav do ? Crown him and he will leave all his goodness behind . We will prevent his coronation by killing him and so save him from himself . We shall be serving a high moral purpose. * Was ever man more easily self-persuaded ? Conceive a really honest man justifying assassination solely on the plea of what the victim might do , his past admittedly giving no ground for evil foreboding ? If he is crowned ? Caesar had just refused to be crowned ; and it was purely conjectural that there was any intention even to offer him a crown again . The whole soliloquy is the sophistic device of a man squaring his moral character with his intention . The situation is clinched by the eagerness with which Brutus snatches at the papers thrown in through the window . " Brutus , thou sleep'st . . . speak , strike , redress . " Then comes the melodramatic apostrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make thee promise : If the redress will follow , thou receiv'st Thy full petition at the band of Brutus ! What true man , unusually philosophic too in temper , could be influenced in a tremendous enterprise , to which public necessity drove him against his will , by an anonymous scrawl thrown in at the window ? Cassius knew his man . Where again was the reality in this splendid talk ? Let us be sacrificers , but no butchers . But , alas ! Cicsar must bleed for it . And , gentle friends , Let 's kill him boldly , but not wrathfully ; Let 's carve him as a dish fit for the gods , Not hew him as a carcass fit , for hounds ! * Act IL , Scene I. , lines 10.34 . Brutus is noble when it is a question of words before the deed , but when the time comes to act on them he and his " gentle friends " forget their gentle words and turn butchers , while their " vile daggers hack one another in the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaculate poser shows clearer with each successive step . The murder done , Cnsar 's body not yet cold , Brutus takes up Casca 's pleasantry that to cut short life is merely to abridge the fear of death , and argues solemnly that therefore they are Caesar 's friends , and have conferred on him a benefit because they have lessened his time of fearing death . Such callousness will hardly be found even in an enemy ; how then in a patriot who had done an awful deed , had murdered a dear friend , impelled thereto solely by a sense of duty ? The next moment Brutus bids his friends bathe their hands in Calsar 's blood up to the elbows . in him this is not mere vindictive savagery , as it seems , but just his incurable posing . At this supreme moment Brutus , and even Cassius , think first of making a solemn show , by producing a theatrical effect : How many ages hence , Shall this our lofty scene be acted over ! says Cassius . How many times answers Brutus shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies along No worthier than the dust " ! Brutus ' first thought is of the figure he will cut in history ; how will he look in groups representing Casar 's murder ? Comparing this revelation of Brutus ' mind with his previous protestations and fine sentiments , we are forced to the conclusion that lfarcus Brutus was a solarm humbug . A significant touch is added when Antony comes on the scene of the murder . While Brutus maunders on about their hearts being pitiful , and the general wrong of Rome and ? truly a nauseating remark ? his love for Caesar when he struck him , and the brotherly love they would all bear Antony , Cassius cuts in with the straightforward practical proposition to Antony : Your voice shall be as strong as any man 's In the disposing of new dignities . The difference between Brutus and Cassius is that Cassius is frankly unscrupulous , Brutus most scrupulously so . Instinctively one looks to the end of these men ; and the end one feels is as it should be . The murder " most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last great day , the day of account between him and Caesar , is made at last to see something of his true self . Never quite happy in his inmost soul about the death of Caesar , on the field of battle , when he sees things are going against him , Brutus cries out : 0 Julius Caesar , thou art mighty yet ! Thy spirit walks abroad , and turns swords In our own proper entrails . Conscience at last is allowed to speak unprompted . And , dying , Brutus says : Caesar , now be still : not thee with half so good a will . That is at once his confession and hi : absolution . By his own voluntary death he is expiating Cresar 's . And Antony , Caesar 's avenger and rep resentative , in his eulogy of Brutta pronounces the forgiveness which tin unparalleled clemency of Caesar wouli certainly have granted .
