txt The Panama Canal deal has reached the crucial point where a compromise may be expected at any hour . It Is stated on good authority that the opposition in the Colombian Senate has resolved itself into a stand merely on the matter of a payment by the new Panama Canal Company to the Colombian Government for the privilege of making the transfer of its franchise . The bill before the Colombian Senate asks that the payment be $10,000,000 . The Directors of the new canal company have stoutly refused to accede to this demand . The argument has been made by the Colombian Government that in equity the company should pay something for the privilege of makilig the transfer . Inasmuch as the company is really selling for $40 , - ( 100,000 only its extension , and that extension was obtained at a time and in a manner which involves it in a cloud , and the company , according to the Colombian view of the transaction , took advantage of circumstances to get the new lease of life for an inadequate compensation , the Colombians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of indemnification for the previous bad bargain . The old franchise lapses next year and ' the extension runs to 1010 . The amount Paid for it was $1,000,000 . The Congress ; did not sanction the extension , but it was obtained by executive action while the Congress was not in session , and under a constitutional provision giving a color of law to the grant . The Colombians now put up the argument that the parties who own the new canal company got their stock for probably not over $1.5,000,00 or $:20,000,000 , and the rest of the $40,000,000 to be paid by the ' United States is all " velvet . " Therefore the company should be willing to pay at least $5,000,000 ' to Colombia in order to get the necessary deal . The Colombian Government in effect . says to the company : " It is that or nothing for you . If you do not pay us we do not agree to the , treaty and you lose not only the forty millions which the United States stands ready to pay you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your speculation . Pay us and you make two or three hundred per cent . " The clause in the bill pending before the Colombian Senate asking the United States to pa.g twenty millions was put in simply to buttress up the ten million demand on the canal company . The demand on the latter was made ten millions in order to afford leeway to come down and make the Directors of the company feel that they had not been mulsted r as much as they might have been . This Government has nothing to do with the situation to-night as it stands . That is now between Colombia and the Directors of the canal company in Paris . Tile news which will tell that the treaty is to be ratified and the Panama Canal completed will come by cable from Paris to I ' Bogota , from the Panama Canal Commissioner for Colombia stationed in Paris , who has the negotiations in hand . All that this Government can do is to be ready to extend the time for the formal exchange of ratifications . Mr. Hay is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in readiness for signing the protocol if necessary . The different features in the buncombe bill now before the Colombian Senate will be swept aside if the canal Directors signi'y their willingness to pay . Even the sovereignty quibble will not stand in the way of the deal . The whole situation is at a white heat at Bogota , and there will be an almost continuous session of the Senate till Tuesday , 1 including Sunday and Sunday night . The opposition is still making faces at President Marroquan , but enough Senators to Pass the treaty are waiting to hear from the canal company . Neither Dr. Herrin. the Colombian Minister . nor Mr. Hay has made any overtures as yet for an extension of the time in which the exchange of ratificzhions may be made . IDr . Herran has finally been fully informed by cable from his Government of the progress of the Senate , and has submilted his advises to the State Department . They may be made the basis for the extension of time at any moment after Mr. Hay returns to Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news received at Bogota from Paris is satisfactory . The danger at Bogota from the supposed stubbornness of the opposition in the Senate to Marroquin has been a good deal modified . The idea that the Nationalists can get control of the canal question by defeating the Hay-Herran treaty in the hope of electing Reyes President next year is pronounced wild . Such a scheme would postpone all action until after Aug. 7 , when the new President would be inaugurated , and , the chances of electing any one on a canal /issue is practically as wild as the whole suggef.tion. because the people of Colombia are , for the most part . indifferent to the canal matter . Many do not want it built , and a large proportion do not care anything about it . i The project is in the hands of the half a 1 dozen needed votes in the Colombian Setif ate , aed will remain there until midnight I next Tuesday . ! The whole matter has now resolved itself l into a plain business deal with the canal : authorities in Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
