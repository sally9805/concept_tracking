' It was fitting that ex-President Cleveland should make his single speech of the campaign , as he did on Thursday night , in the Fifth Congressional District of New Jersey . The Democratic candidate , Mr. Dewitt Clinton Flanagan , was making his aggressive canvass in the face of a normal Republican majority in the district of about 2,000 , and on a genuine Cleveland platform . His convention not only gave Bryanism the go-by , but repudiated it in set terms ; and tariff reform , with measures against the Trusts as well as against the bulwark of them , has been the chief issue urged . Very naturally , therefore , there was a great rallying of Cleveland Democrats to Mr. Flanagan 's support , and the ex-President could not deny his own when pressed to go to korristown to aid in this revival of the policies and enthusiasms associated with his name . Mr. Cleveland might be pardoned for recalling with pride his part in revivifying the Democratic party by giving it the tariff issue . His message of 1887 determined the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own party , it created a soul under the ribs of death . The Republicans it drove to the full display of the selfish and baleful power of protection , and to overwhelming defeat in 1892 . The man who did all this may justifiably speak of the work of his own hands . Mr. Cleveland 's gift of political prescience was never more clearly shown than when , at the opening of the Tilden Club , some months ago ; he indicated tariff reform as the great issue of this campaign . The Remiblican newspapers shook with pitying laughter . Poor man , with only one idea , But they have lived to see the canvass fought precisely along the lines marked by the ex-President . The tariff and Trusts , with the relations of one to the other , have been the staple of political debate in every newspaper and on every stump in the country . It - is a striking evidence of the sense of the popular drift which Mr. Cleveland possesses in so eminent a degree . His letter to a Southern correspondent shortly after his election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubles on the money question , with the breaking away of the silver wing of the party , showed him , as has the present campaign , to be endowed with a prophetic soul in matters political , brooding on things to come . Not the least remarkable of Mr. Cleveland 's predictions was that which he made in his tariff message of 1887 , relative to the way in which the historic defence of the protective system would be undermined by Trusts . Competition will undo all the evils of tariff favoritism , cried the protectionists ; but " this competition , " said Mr. Cleveland fifteen years ago , " is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this time and frequently called Trusts . " The Re publicans laughed the doctrine to scorn at the time ; but to-day they are confessing with visible alarm that it is Gospel truth . Nothing else accounts for the agitation for tariff reform within their own party . Republican nominees for Congress in Massachusetts and in Iowa have echoed Mr. Cleveland 's words , and placed themselves upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess , in the presence of cheering New York Republicans , that many tariff schedules should be revised , Mr. Root , however , had to make the solemn old proviso that " when the tariff is to be revised , it should be revised by its friends . " By a happy coincidence , Mr. Cleveland was referring to this humbugging pretension at the very moment Secretary Root was speaking , and called it , with more truth than elegance , a " hoary-headed , bloated , and malodorous old fraud and pretence . " Strong words might be excused in referring to Mr. Root 's preposterous assertions . They amount to this : The tariff ought to be revised ; but the Democratic party ca n't do it , the Republican wo n't . We say that his attitude is practically one of denial of any tariff relief , for that is what it amounts to . His idea of a Republican " wise and conservative " revision , the work done by scientists instead of politicians , is nonsense . The thing will never be achieved in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a colleague Of Mr. Root 's in the Cabinet , whose words were telegraphed to the Chicago Record-Herald as follows : " Our friends out in Iowa think they want some revision of the tariff . So do our other friends , the retail butchers . But I 'll wager something pretty they ca n't agree as to where the protection shall be taken off . The tariff is largely a local question , after all . One section wo n't have one schedule touched , and another wo n't have an other schedule touched or fooled with , and then there are men like Aldrich who well raise hades if the deities on dolls ' eyes are shaded a hair 's breadth , and who will log-roll and make combenateens and help everybody who well help them to take care of dolls ' eyes . " We believe that Mr. Cleveland is right about it . The Republican party is in the grip of men who will ? not renounce the pound of flesh nominated in the bond . Touch one of them , and they all band together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break up the alliance of " one for all and all for one " is to notify all concerned that this thing has got to stop . Electing a Democratic House is the shortest and sharpest way to serve that notice . AN ADVANCE WARNING . Mr. F. A. Vanderlip 's address before the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce , which may be read in Sunday 's Herald , sounded a note of grave but needed warning in respect to our existing trade and financial situation . On Mr. Vander-lip 's qualifications as an expert authority , we need not remark . His service at the Treasury in Washington , together with his more recent banking connections , gave Mr. Vanderlip unusual opportunities for the study of finance ; and his investigations of European commerce and the " American invasion " have been too recently put before the public to need fresh reference . Without any political bias whatever , and speaking purely as a financier closely watching the course of events , Mr. Vanderlip pointed out certain ominous conditions and tendencies for which , he said , , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " disaster and humiliation later on . " Taking up first the signs of the times in the sphere of international trade , Mr. Vanderlip asserts , what the cold figures demonstrate , that " if we are honest with ourselves we must admit that the edge is off our invasion of foreign markets . " The state of European opinion about our potential power as exporters has undergone something like a revolution within two years . When Mr. Vanderlip was on his travels early in 1901 , he found European bankers and statesmen nervously apprehensive on the subject of American competition . They had an almost credulous belief in the unlimited possibilities of our development and in the danger to their interests involved in it . But this year he saw the same men again , and their tone was entirely different . Instead of fears that we might ruin them by taking away their markets , he found an " anxious interest in our future " ? an anxiety , that is , lest the enormous American borrowings on the European bourses prove too great a strain for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has heard estimated in Europe as high as $300,000,000 . He thinks that figure too large , but does not deny that the true total is very large or that it is a real cloud upon our financial horizon . It certainly makes the talk of our " trade balances " look uncommonly silly , and is the best explanation of the perturbing fact that now , " in the midst of extraordinary bountiful harvests and at the season when a movement of gold in this direction might normally be expected , we are concerned lest a high rate of sterling shall lead to gold exports . " On the domestic side , Mr. Vanderlip is no less trenchant . The signs abound that an era of inflation and speculation has strained our credit . The surest sign is the condition of the banks . Since 1899 there has been an expansion of $1,300 , - 000,000 in the deposits of all the national banks , " while the basis of gold and legal tenders , upon which that inverted pyra ' mid stands , is actually slightly smaller than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen , that is , from $509,000 , - 000 to $508,000,000 . In other words , there has been a phenomenal increase in lia-
