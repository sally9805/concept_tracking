txt Commissioner Greene , in an address last night at a meeting of the Order of Acorns , reviewed- his work as the head of the Police Department and declared that he was using every effort to prevent a restoration of the " system , " at the same time declaring that efforts were being made for its re-establishment by members of the uniformed department . The meeting was held in the West Side Lyceum , at Seventh Avenue and Fifty-second Street , being the thirteenth in the series which the organization is holding in various sections of the city . Joseph Johnson , Jr. , head of the organization , presided at the meeting and presented the Commissioner . " The only reason why you find me taking part in this meeting , " said Gen. Greene , " is that I do not consider this a political meting , and I have been promised that in speaking here I do not commit myself to this order , nor is it committed to me . When first I became the head of the Department one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed limbs of a creatue in the uniform of a policeman , and representing the Police Department . THE AVERAGE POLICEMAN . " Now , the Police Department is not as crooked as that , and never has been . The average policeman is not crooked at all , and yet he has more temptations than any other person in any walk of life . He has the opportunity to make in one minute what he would earn in his salary for a month , and by simply turning his back . On the other hand , there have been cases where it would be absurd for me to deny that policemen have yielded to temptation and where the department has been crooked . These , however , are generalities. and we will now come down to specific cases . It has been generally believed that the police , or at least many of them , have taken money to protect lawbreakers in the violation of the law , and that the machinery through which they operated was the precinct detectives or plain clothes men , the wardmen . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of a friend of far greater experience in police matters than myself , 1 abolished the wardmen. and sent the 306 on duty as wardmen back to patrol duty and thus broke up the system . I do not say that blackmail is absolutely broken up , as it does not die so easily , but the organized system was broken in two , and it has not yet been put together , although some efforts may be making in that direction . I think , however , they can be prevented by preventing any such chain being forged and linked as under the former system . " Another trouble was in the condition of the bureau presided over by the complaint clerk . This clerk had charge of the records of every man in the Police Depart , ment , and these records were consulted and have a certain definite value in examina'lions for promotion . Airy falsification of these records , of course , would enable a man to ' get his promotion when he was not entitled to it . And such falsification , it seas natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . " The first day I was in office I discovered that a man 's record had been tampered with and the false returns made to the Civil Service Commission . Pages had been torn from the book of record and erasures made . The Complaint Clerk was placed on trial and the charges against him were proved . He was dismissed , and the uniformed man benefited by his work was transferred to - another precinct on patrol . " There also was a complaint made that in the Boiler Inspection Bureau inspections could not be had in some cases unless something was paid outside of the usual fee . Before long I discovered a case where money had been taken and a dismissal followed . A complaint came to me about a man connected with ttaw Health Department taking money to make false reports . The man was put on trial and dismissed after having a fair ' hearing . Another complaint concerned the man in charge of the policemen assigned to schools and officers on probation taking up a collection at the close of school . This case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found guilty , will be dismissed . If he is not he will be restored to duty promptly . " So it runs through the various branches of the department . There have been cases where things were given for money considerations , and just so far as I have found or can find any- evidence of them the man guilty is going to get out , and there will be no influence of any kind that can keep him in . On the other hand , and this is important , if the charge against an officer is not proved he is going to be restored to duty , and the fact that any charge was made will not count against him . " Commissioner Greene referred to the duties of the police and declared that with the Penal and Criminal Codes , the general statutes , and the city ordinances it is difficult for an officer to perform his duties , for the reason he might be liable in a elvil or a criminal action if he oversteps his authority , while , on the other hand , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill the requirements of the law . " The police are required to do five things . by law , " said the Commissioner . " The first is to enforce the law , the second to preserve peace , the third to protect life and property the fourth to arrest all violators of the law , and the fifth to detect and punish crime . To carry out these rules it takes 7,500 men in uniform and between 300 and 400 clerks . matrons , and other accessories . and costs between $10,000,000 and $11.000.000 a year . What interests the people is knowing whether or not they get the proper return for their money . " The police force of this city is better than any other police force in the world in the matter of protection afforded to life and property . During the last six weeks we have had 10,000 men on strike ' in this city , and there have been no outbreaks . There has not been a man shot , and not a man killed . The police were ready for the emergency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riot and kill 100 people . " Concerning the work of the department in detecting and punishing crime . I think the work now is being effectively done under the Inspector in charge - of the Detective Bureau . But if the results desired are not achieved under his management , then I win find some one else who will accomplish the desired results . There are no politics in the department , and politics shall not enter it while I am Commissioner . " " WET " AND " DRY " SUNDAYS . At this point a man in the audience asked the Commissioner what - he had to say on the subject of excise . " Well , we no longer hear of ' wet Sundays and dry Sundays , " said the Commissioner , " so ' I gather that the people do not longer consider excise a burning question . The law does , not compel people to go without a drink on Sunday in this city . There are 12,000 saloons , and of them 2,000 have hotel licenses . I am trying only to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires : The courts have passed on the questions of what are guests and what are meals , and I do ' not think any one in the city can buy a drink on Sunday without buying a meal . " The interrupter questioned this . saying he was from-England and that in England a policeman was . kept in front of every saloon to see that the law was enforced . i ? For ' every report of a violation of the law made to me , " declared the Commis qwq sioner , " I will undertake a careful investigation , and no ' one can apply sooner the remedy for cases where violations are allowed for a consideration . " The Commissioner stated , however , that . with 12,000 saloons and only 7,500 members of the force , of which no more than 2,500 are on duty at any one time , the plan of stationing a policeman at each saloon was out of the question . He also declared that he would not attempt to enforce any law for the purpose of bringing it into disrepute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meeting proposed a vote of the persons present who were in favor of opening saloons on Sunday after church hours . There were then some 300 in the hall , of which about 50 voted in favor of the Sunday opening , signifying their intention by raising a namL Five only voted in opposition . NO SUCCESSOR TO MORRIS . ? Sheldon . Finally Refused - President Roosevelt 's Appeal  --  Goddard Was Not Discussed . There was no election of a President of the Republican County Committee at the regular monthly meeting held last night . With the return yesterday of George R. Sheldon from his visit to Washington in response to a message from President Roosei:eit to lunch with him and discuss the Chairmanship , the matter was left higher in the air than ever . Mr. Sheldon absolutely declined to take the office , and last night 's meeting lost all its interest , scarcely more than the proverbial Corporal 's guard being present when W. H. Ten Eyck , Chairman of the Executive Committee , called the meeting to order . A resolution was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carrying out the requirements of the primary election law this Fall . Senator Platt admitted yesterday that he was all at sea concerning the Presidency of the County Committee , and said laughingly that lie was so anxious to have the matter settled that , if the newspaper reporters would get together and unite upon some man for the Chairmanship , he would give such a candidate his hearty indorsement for the place . The Senator had been fully confident that President Roosevelt would secure from Sheldon an acceptance to take the post and not until Mr. Sheldon , on his return from Washington yesterday , handed out a statement of his declination of the office , did the Senator believe that the President would be unsuccessful in his attempt at persuading him . " For business reasons I can not accept the Presidency of the County Committee , " said Mr. Sheldon at his office , at 3 Wall Street . " I should not be able to give the necessary time to the work , and I told this to President Roosevelt , making the matter clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively that I will not accept the position . " Senator Platt , when he heard this , looked disappointed . ell , that statement is strong enough . " he said . " I have not talked with Mr. Sheldon , but I guess we will have to look for some other man . " " Senator , have you any one in sight ? " " Not a single soul . But I would like to receive suggestions , and if you fellows will suggest some one I 'll support him for the office . " The Senator then was asked if there was anything new in regard to Capt . Norton Goddard for the position , suggesting that President Roosevelt- might fayoshim . Senator Riau , however , said , emphatfcally that this ' was . only guesswork and that some one besides Goddard or Sheldon would have to be found . The general talk among the Republican leaders last night was that the selection of a President to succeed Robert C. Morris is as far tram being settled as It was when Mr. Morris- resigned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the leaders . Capt . Goddard . who has been mentioned throughout as the candidate- of Gov . Odell for the Presidency . and who also was in Washington this week in conference with the President , returned to the city last night . The subject of my conference with President Roosevelt was far from being my selection as Chairman of the County Committee , " declared the Captain last night . " It is true that the headship of the committee was discussed , but not my con- . nection with it . I suggested to the President that the opposition press in this city was suggesting that he was ' interfering ' with local political affairs , in that he was urging Mr Sheldon to take the place . President Roosevelt told me that no such reports or rumors would disturb him as long as he knew they were not so . " Gov . Odell. too , was in the city last night , but did not see Senator Platt . The Governor and Major Bird arrived at the Fifth Avenue Hotel soon after 6 o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went to the theatre , accompanied by Col. Fox . He remained over night , and probably will see Senator Platt this morning . He would say nothing concerning the county Presidency .
