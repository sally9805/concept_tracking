IT was just a month since I disembarked at the desolate Peruvian port of Quilca and followed the pack-train one hundred and four miles across the desert to the railroad at San .1-054 . Five days later , on the weekly train from Arequipa , we reached Lake Titicaca ; a night on the steamer Coya from Puno to %aqui. , and then a narrow-gauge railroad and stage-coach landed us in La Paz . At La Paz a fortnight was spent collecting supplies and organizing the outfit that . was to take us into the unknown interior of South America , over the Andes , and across the continent out into the Atlantic by way of the Amazon . Food-supplies for weeks , tentage , machetes , and tools had been sent off ahead when we had been able to get pack-mules , and now with the last and most valuable part of our cargo we were to follow . In ta Paz we left the last vestiges of civilization ? the plazas and the crowds of Paris-gowned Bolivian society that attended the biweekly concerts of the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings at the club , and the gay life of the capital . Before us stretched the long , undulating level of the high table-land , quivering in the atmospheric distances and sparkling in the crisp sunlight and the cool morning air of the high altitude . Low banks of cumulus clouds faded into the lire of the horizon , and above them rose the ragged blue silhouette of the last and most easterly range of the Andes Beyond ? on the farther side was the montaha for which I was bound ; to the northeast , something over a hundred miles ahead , was the glisten of the white , snow-covered slopes of the giant Mount Sonia . We had halted at the edge of the mesa beside the rough cairn which the Indians of Bolivia build at the crest of every mountain trail in accordance with an old superstition , and to which , out of deference to their Christian conversion , they now add a small cross of twigs . Below us we could see the road up which we had just climbed winding and twisting down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to the south , over rough mule-trails , was Sucre , the old capital . Already ? for we had started at sunrise ? the road below was filled with the long lines of llama-trains crawling to the city , each beast with its load of fifty pounds lashed to its back , an absurd mincing gait , long wagging neck , and a startled affectation of timidity at each familiar object on . the trail . For a few moments we rest while the arriero tightens a cinch here and there and lashes securely in place a shifted load , then we follow in behind our line of pack-animals and start out into the long flat distance . The lines of llama and burro trains grow fewer and fewer , and finally disappear alto-gether ; occasionally a solitary Aymara passes us on foot , his hat humbly carried in. his hand , and with a guttural , Tata , asqui urn chnrutam " ? " Father , a good day to thee . " We cross a dozen arroyos that reveal themselves suddenly as great cracks in the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season of the year , there is generally the trickle of a tiny stream of water . Often . in the shelter of the arroyo is the camp of an Indian family leisurely awaiting until to-morrow to make their way to the market . Presently even these signs of life disappear , and we are alone on the high plateau . In the thin cool air sounds carry for miles . The tinkle of the bell-mare is like a brazen gong , and the soft pad of the hoofs on the earth and their click against the loose stones in the trail rise with a sharp distinctness . We are thirteen thousand feet above the level of the sea . We ride on ahead and out of the dust of our train . At Cocuta we breakfast . This is the " tambo , " or the hotel , of the Indians of the high plains . They are scattered at intervals along all the trails of the Bolivian interior . Cocuta proved to be a high mud wall , loophoIed and battlemented , that enclosed a few rough mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which animala might he driven . It is the headquarters of two bands of ladroncs that infest the mesa. and both of which I afterward met under most unpleasant circumstances . It is modelled on the lines of an old Spanish citadel , and for much the same protective purposes . The cholo ? half-breed ? haciendado comes forward to welcome us , his heavy rowelled spurs clanking on the ground , and a cartridge - belt and gun showing beneath his coat . For breakfast he would cook for Us some eggs and " lomitas " ? a fried filet of beef . These were served on a mud table built like an altar at one side of the room , while we sat on the farther side on a mud bench that ran along the wall . There were no windows in the room , only an empty doorway that opened into the corral , and from over the mud partition that separated us from the next room the thin acrid smoke from the fire of llama dung floated freely . While at breakfast we had an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . The cholo haciendado came into the room and Look down from the wall a heavy rawhide whip . Stepping just outside , he called over one of the Indians who were lounging against the sunny side of the corral , and spoke a few words to him sharply in the Aymara tongue . The Indian took off his hat and knelt silently on the ground . Thereupon the chub() counted cut six lashes as he coiled the heavy thong over the shoulders of the kneeling Aymara . The pain must have been severe , but the Indian never lost his stolidity , and when the last stroke was counted out he got up sheepishly without a word and walked off and rejoined his companions , who had been impassive witnesses of his punishment . From Cocuta we left the main trail and started out over what is known as the inside trail to the village of Sorata . It is a distinctly dangerous trail , for the Aymaras living in that section of the country are known to resent intrusion into their territory , and are hostile toward all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braided from llama wool , and they use stones of about the size of a large lemon . That night we camped in another lembo similar to the one at Cocuta . During the day the air had been soft and balmy , although hardly warm , and with the fresh suggestion of a mild spring . After sunset it changed at once to a thin bitter coldness , while a shrill wind seemed to penetrate every corner of the but and every crevice in the blankets . It was a relief when we were awakened the next morning , and with a little brisk exercise loosened up the chilled stiffness of our joints . In the dim half-light of the dawn we blundered around , throwing the saddle with numbed hands on the mule that with unerring instinct the arriero led up to us as the one we had ridden the day before . In the gray light they all looked alike . A few moments ' delay , while we brewed a thin cup of tea over an alcohol flame , and we were off . Over the mesa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun slowly rose , the biting cold of the night disap-peared , the soft covering of the frost was succeeded by the dull brown of the mesa , and we plodded on through the balmy spring of the day before . This was to be the long day . It would be after dark before we would reach the next tambo . A few miles from the tambo where we had slept we rode through herds of thousands of llamas wandering over the plain at will , nibbling at the sparse patches of the wiry bunch-grass . Sometimes scattered among them were their herders , playing on their shrill In-dian flutes , or spinning wool on a top-like distaff as they kept a sullen eye upon the passing gringo cavalcade . Then the little mud huts of the Indians appeared in the distance , and closing in , we rode through a thickly settled farming coin- community . Little Indian children sat on guard over the tiny patches of cultivated ground , keeping off the herds from the newly sprouted grain , while near them and apparently also under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earth . Ikre and there an Indian would be busy in some late ploughing , with a pair of hulls yoked by the horns to a crooked stick that scratched a narrow streak in the soil . His wives followed , And harrowed the field by breaking the clods of earth with stones lashed to a stick with strips of rawhide . By this primitive process perhaps half an acre could be tilled in a day . Occasionally a gaunt Indian dog would rush savagely at our train , but invariably halted safely out of range of the arricro 's lash . Then for hours would stretch the en-varied monotony of the long , level mesa , interminable in its distances and monotonous in its flatness . It was oppressive in its very vastness . At sunset the wind again blew up strong and cold . Tiny particles of sand stung our faces , and out over the plain a score of 0 dust devils " ? remolinos ? chased each other in erratic courses . The mountains had crept closer , and , until long after the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heights the cold yellow gleam from the sun 's last rays . Mount Sorata lay directly ahead to the north . The sharp outlines of its crest , over twenty miles in length and ending in the high peak of Illampu , over twenty-six thousand feet above the sea , was plainly outlined against the cold sky . To our right was the mountain of HuaynaPotosi , but slightly less in height . Small in the distance behind us sank Illimani , and connecting these three points was the low , ragged line of the last range of the Andes ? a jagged , snow-capped wall that guards the rich basin of the interior of South America . For two hours we rode through the darkness , until we found ourselves riding between low mud walls that lined the trail on either side ; beyond them the dim shadows of mud huts announced the presence of an Indian village . It was in this village that we were to sleep . The arricro rode into a corral at one side of the trail . In the litter about the corral were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest attention to us as we picked our way among them . A few shaggy burros nibbled at the cebada that was strewn about , and a couple of Indians raised themselves sleepily and grunted to the arriero . He turned to us and explained that the place was full and that they had told him that we must camp elsewhere for the night . Against the farther side of the corral was a mud hut , and we dismounted , and by the aid of a match took one look inside . The place was choked with sleeping Indians , and , despite the open door , the air was foul inside . We slept outside . The day had been hard and exhausting , and it seemed as if we had but just settled fairly to sleep when we were awakened into broad daylight by the arriero . For a hundred yards we rode between the low mud walls of the night before , then the trail began to rise slowly up into the hills of the pass over into Sorata . The long monotonous levels had disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in the daylight by long rolling hills , on which there remained hardly the vestige of a trail , Close by , to our right and almost in its shadow , arose the great peak of Illampu . The wind from its snow-fields blew directly in our faces , and although the sun was shining brightly , it was bitter cold . Steadily the trail grew sharper and more abrupt . In places it followed the steep sides of narrow gorges and canons . Over each crest that we passed was the cairn built of the stones thrown there by the centuries of Indians that had passed this way . Some had been recently decorated with offerings of flowers , and often in the crevices we could see the propitiatory offerings of coca and tobacco to the god of this particular place . At fourteen thousand feet we rode through the ruins of an old Indian city that bears the marks of occupation at a time probably long prior to the period of the Aymaras . There were still remaining the perfect traces of the streets and houses and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been chinked had long since disappeared , and nothing was left but the huge boulders and stones .
