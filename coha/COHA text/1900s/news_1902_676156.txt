txt While M. Lessaes notice of the intention of the Russian Government to expel foreigners from Manchuria has not been formally brought to the attention of the State Department , it can be predicted safely that , for the present at least , the ' United States Government will look upon this matter as one involving Russia , China , - and Great- Britain , and as One in which - it is not directly concerned . So far as is known here there are no Americans in that section of China , and if it should appear later that there are some American prospectors in the country it is not probable that the order would be enforced in their case , as , while general in terms , it is really aimed at the British , and marks a determination on the part of Russia to retain the control of the customs in Manchuria , while nominally recognizing Chinese sovereignty . The British customs employes referred to are British by nativity , but are actually In the employ of the Chinese Government . and it may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's order concerns only Russia and China . It improbable , however , that tile ; British Government will take this view of the matter , and it is fully expected that the British Minister at Peking will call on , the Chinese Government to retain these British officials despite the Russian order . . By this time , according to the ChineseRussian convention in regard to Manchuria . ? concluded as the result of many protests .. on the part of the powers and prolonged labors by diplomats in China , Europe , and America  --  the evacuation a Manchuria by the Russian troops ought to have been ' begun . No definite word to that effect has , however , been received , and the , latest pre . vious news in regard to Manchuria was in the form of a dispatch from St. Petersburg . which stated that Russian journals were forbidden to mention anything about the movements of the Czar 's troops in the Orient . The Imperial Chinese Customs Service , of which Sir Robert Hart is head , is not a British institution , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese Government . The understanding is that so long as British trade with China is greater than the trade of any other nation an Englishman is to be the head of the , customs service . Some of the powers have long been jealous of this arrangement , and have done tilt i ? best to oust Sir Robert , in spite of the fact that the positions which lie controls are given to men of all nationalities . Several Russians are among the employes of the service . Russia has been encouraging immigration to her Manchurian towns . It was recently stated by the correspondent of the Odessa Listok , in . Port Arthur , that for months past the flow of immigrants into Harbin had been continuous , the newcomers hailing from the banks of the Volga , from the Crimea and the Caucasus , from the Urals , from the banks of the Don , and even from the Danube .. The same correspondent said that great efforts were being made by Russia to counteract the influence of British and German traders in Manchuria . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , copper , and - general manufactures , and her requirements were principally met by British and Ger , man traders . Even before the appearance of the Russian railway at Harbin that tOwn . served as a centre of distribution for a ? very large area . The advent of the railway at Harbin , however , seemed to leave thb Russians masters of the situation . With - the avowed object of cutting out British and German trade in those quartew. an exhibition of samples of Russian gir tals- and general manufactures has been ' arranged at Harbin , and a commercial bureau which is to be established there will serve the purpose of middlemen between Russian and Manchurian traders . It is said that the Russians are considerably annoyed owing to the criticisms of their rule in Manchuria which have been appearing in the papers of Great Britain and other countries . One of the most severe of these criticisms was printed on Aug . IS in The Glasgow Herald . The paper began by mentioning the conviction generally prevalent among intelligent Russians that it is the " mission " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia . It then spoke of Russia 's shortcomings in ' governing - her . European and Asiatic possessions , and added : - Perhaps the most striking proof . how . ever , of Muscovite unfitness for the selfimposed task of the regeneration of Asia is furnished in the condition of the ' Amur region and of Manchuria since they . came under the control of the Government of St. Petersburg . The'reports and descriptions I supplied by Russian writers , and amply ' confirmed . from other sources , prove that the state of these countries is one of almost unmitigated misery and widespread . desolation . " The Chinese rule was bad enough : it was thoroughly corrupt and lax or inefficient in the discharge of almost all adminis , trative functions . But in respect of both j corruption and inefficiency the Russian oft ficials are not one whit better than the Mandarins , while they have the additional 1 defect of ' regarding the native population as an inferior race who may be ' squeezed ' and oppressed without scruple . Even in the chief towns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , and epidemic disease are universally prevalent . An outbreak of cholera of extraordinary virulence is carrying off the inhabitants , and their . conquerors as well , by thousands . " Outside these places , the country seems to be to a great extent in the hands of troops of native brigands , who wage an unremitting warfare with the Russians , and rob and murder at their will among their lucl4less compatriots . The railways which liar been carried through the country are , accdrding to the approved Russian tradition , badly built and inadequately staffed ; and though efforts at improvement in their working are now being made , there is very little reason to expect that they will be successful , for the simple and sufficient reason that the efficient working of the lines would involve a much larger expenditure than could possibly be recouped by the traffic receipts , and that the authorities are by no means in a position to face . the ? pecuniary loss which would thus be involved . The simple truth is that the Russians have not the qualifications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken in Asia . How is it possible that they should give to that vast continent the blessings of good government and capable economic administration which they have never yet been able to gain for theniselins ? The attempt is doomed to failure , and it must entail heavy penalties on those who have pledged Russian strength and resources for its accomplishment . " SNUFF FACTORIES RAIDED . Four Places Closed and Seven Men Arrested ? Allegation that Product Without Revenue Stamps Was Sold . United States Deputy Marshals yesterday raided four snuff manufactories from which they alleged snuff without revenue stamps had been sold . The prisoners are Jacob Scharlin , a deaf mute ; W. Hirschberg and Sol Weiner , from the factory of Simon Scharlin &; Son , 110 Division Street ; Sandel Weingarten and his son , Morris Weingarten , composing the firm of S. Weingarten S. Co. , 229 Broome Street ; Charles Rosen of 157 Rivington Street , and Louis Meister of 244 and 246 Madison Street . The value of the plants is estimated at $25,000 . The Marshals seized about 100,000 pounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by United States Commissioner Hitchcock for a hearing on Monday . Scharlin was released on parole , bail in the case of each of the others being fixed at $2,500 . Bonds were given by all except Meisler . The Marshals also wished to arrest Simon Scharlin , the head of the Scharlin firm , but they were told that he is very ill at his home in Mountaindale , N. Y. He is not in active business . He has been in the snuff business for a generation or more , and he was at one time a very important factor in the tobacco trade . Counsel for the firm promised to produce him if he could be moved safely . The raiding party was headed by Special Treasury Agent Charles H. Seawell of Chicago , who expects to prove that there has been a regular organization in this city for the last twenty years which put unstamped snuff on the market , and that it has defrauded the Government out of at least $250.000 in stamp taxes . Other arrests are expected Jacob Seharlin , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long series of persecutions by " the Trust . " HENRY W. GRADY FOUND .
