The holders of concert and theatrical licenses who give Sunday entertainments met Commissioner Bingham yesterday . morning by invitation . The invitations had been conveyed to the vaudeville houses on Christmas Eve by the Captain ? of the precinct and said briefly that- Commissioner P.ingharn wished to see them at ' Police Headquarters at 10 : : 30 o'clock on Dec. 20 . The managers went to the trial room , accompanied by their lawyers . The general feeling among the managers was that they were going to get an interpretation of the law . Commissioner Bingham 's first remarks were brief : " I want to speak to you in regard to the Sunday theatres , " he said . " 1 understand that there are many moving7picture men here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled . " He then read to them Mayor McClellan 's letter to him , dated Dec. 24 , stating that evidence had been laid before the Mayor to the effect that the holders of concert and theatrical licenses were violating the law in regard to Sunday performances . He also read the notice inclosed in that letter , instructing him to enforce rigidly the ordinances and stat utes relating to Sunday performances . " That 's all , " Gen. Bingham told the managers . " got my orders , and I shall enforce them . " Percy G. Williams , the vaudeville man- ' ager who controls a number of houses and Is business manager of the United Booking Offices of America . the organi- ' zation which controls all of the vaudeville houses in the city except two , wanted to know if there was any objection to counsel for the managers going to the Corporation Counsel and ? finding out what was his interpretation of the law . Law a Puzzle to Bingham . " I 'd be glad to have you do so , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it immediately . I 'd like to know what the law is myself . " Somebody wanted to know if there was a ruling upon the Sunday question . The Commissioner said that he had asked the Corporation Counsel for an opinion , and that he ' had ' received many letters asking for a ruling . " I would n't take any chances , " he said . " I 've got my orders . and shall carry them out . Do n't take any chances . " Mr. Williams asked how Gen .. Bingham construed ' the law . " I ca n't construe the law , " the Commissioner said . A little later , in answer to another question , the Commissioner said : " Oh , 1 do n't know the law myself . Why do n't you go at once to the Corporation Counsel 's office ? " Then some one wanted to know if moving pictures could be put on at the end of a vaudeville show . Mr. Bingham thought not . There was an argument over this . Finally some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent their attorneys . William Hammerstein had been present for his father at what the managers termed the " illustrated lecture . " " It 's a scream , " said one vaudevillian . " It 's a framed egg , " said another . " It 's a sketch , " said a- third , " and it has lines like this : Bingham  --  Gentlemen , I 've brought you down here to tell you about the law . Managers  --  What is the law , anyway ? Bingham ? I do n't know . Go down to the Corporation Counsel 's office and find out . But if you violate it I 'll arrest you anyway . Law on Diluted Vaudeville . At the Corporation Counsel 's office those of the managers and lawyers who went were told to return at 2 o'clock in the afternoon . They did , and after a halfhour wait copies of Corporation Counsel Pendleton 's opinion , in the form of a letter to Commissioner Bingham , were given out . The letter was a brief statement for the guidance of Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency , " and left till another time a complete statement of the law . The opinibn then continued : The provisions of the law relating to the observance of Sunday are contained in Sections 203 and 277 of ? the Penal Code and the ordinance adopted by the Board of Aldermen on Dec. 14 , 1307 . Without further discussion as to the provisions of these various enactments I think that the following public performances are forbidden : 1 . The performance of any tragedy , Comedy , opera , ballet , or farce or any Part thereof . 2 . Negro minstrelsy. 3 . Any dancing ( dancing by persons who are not performers and which forms no part of any exhibition , but which is merely for the pleasure or the participants , as in the case of a ball given by a club or association , does not come within this prohibition. ) 4 . Wrestling , boxing , with or with-. out gloves , sparring contests , trials of strength or any part thereof . 5 . Circuses or equestrian performances . R. Dramatic performances or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Acrobatic or club performances . 0 . Rope dancers , .10 . Any theatrical play or sketch or a part thereof , with or without theatrical costume . 11 . Any vaudeville show . . 12 . Any impersonation of any character , with or without costume . 13 . Any singing which is given in costume . 14 . Any moving pictures giving a play or part of a play . The following are permitted , and should not be interfered with by you : 1 . Orchestra or other instrumental music or vocal music played or sung but not in connection with any theatrical exhibition , nor in costume . 2 . Lectures and recitations , forming no part of any theatrical piece . 3 . Moving pictures , illustrating lectures of an . instructive or educational character . In conclusion , I will say that , in view of the very drastic and comprehensive terms of the law , I think if any doubt arises in the mind of the officer sent to enforce its provisions as to whether or not any particular thing is allowable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion and allow the court to pass upon the question . Respectfully yours . FRANCIS K. PENDLETON , Corporation Counsel . ? After this opinion had been given out Mr. Pendleton said to reporters that Harry Lauder singing a song in which he assumed a character would be vaudeville .. Not Legal Even to " Crack a Joke : , Suppose a man and his wife come on , sing a song , and crack a joke ? " asked an anxious vaudevillian , " would that go ? " " I think not , " said Mr. Pendleton ; " that would be vaudeville . " Mr. Pendleton added - that the Metropolitan and Manhattan ' concerts were legal . After Commissioner Bingham had received the Corporation Counsel 's opinion it was sent out to the various Police Captains , who were told to be guided by it in their action to-day , , The managers who read the opinion did not like its concluding phrases . " If a policeman is in doubt , " said one , " the opinion says to let the courts pass On it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters of the United Booking Offices of America , 1,133 Broadway , it was said that all of the vaudeville houses in New York controlled by the organization of managers , which included all1 vaudeville houses save two , would live up , T to the Doull ordinance. here would be no dketches . There would be only singing , playing on musical instruments , lectures , and moving pictures which were not a part of a play . Hence there would be no trouble . Sketches were eliminated from Sunday vaudeville houses last Sunday . After word that the injunctions of the moving-picture men had been served upon the Police Department got about the city last night many of the moving-picture shows started operation . Such of the larger places as have concert licenses have made arrangements to have " instructive films " presented to their audiences with an explanatory " lecture , ' to keep within the law . It is thought by some of the men in the moving-picture show business that the police may make all of the places whose licenses have been revoked show only instructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an effective way of getting back of the injunctions , they say , if the police wish to do so. - Many of the proprietors of the five-cent places did not wait until they had secured copies of the omnibus-injunction before opening their places , and were arrested bys the police before the latter had learned of the injunction . These prisoners were released when Gen. Bihgham 's order was promulgated . Capt . Hayes of the West Twentieth Street Station , in whose precinct are a , number of vaudeville houses , said last night that he had had a conference with Inspector McCluskey , and it had been decided to stop all vaudeville on Sunday except that of an educational or sacred character . He said the . policeman would be instructed to enf arce the law on strict rather than lax lines . - " ? Singing If not educational , he said . might be interpreted as a violation of the law and result in the singer 's arrest . The vaudeville managers were notified that no act not educational in character must be attempted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
