 | To have been the trusted friend and helper of a number of great men of letters , to have been their chosen literary executor , to have been faithful after their death in seeing that their genius got itself fairly and adequately before the world , to have been thought by men of such widely differing temperament and gifts as Matthew Arnold , Thomas Carlyle , and John Ruskin to be the leading representative of all that is best in American life , are considerations sufficient to make noteworthy anything Professor Norton gives us . It is good to think , moreover , that this comparatively new American society can grow such as he . Of political and military heroes , of clamorous exponents of the strenuous life , of coarse unrestrained leaders in every phase of our energetic and manifold activities , we have had enough and to spare . The danger is that we shall not have enough of any other sort , ? especially of the sort that gives itself to the interpretation of the finer , the saner , the more permanent things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited class in our history Professor Norton belongs . Born in Cambridge , Mass. , in 1827 , graduated from Harvard in 1849 , after a short apprenticeship in commercial pursuits , he gave himself to literature , scholarship , social reform , and art . For a time , 1864 to 1868 , he was , with Lowell , editor of the North American Review . Since 1874 he has been professor of the History of Art at Harvard . Much of his time he has spent in travel , especially in Italy . The fruits of his Italian j ourneyings and studies have been particularly rich : ? " Notes of Travel and Study in Italy " ( 1860 ) , a translation of Dante 's " New Life " ( 1867 ) , " A History of Church Building in the Middle Ages " ( 1880 ) , and a prose translation of the " Divine Comedy " ( 1892 ) . Perhaps no man has done more for that serious and really creditable contribution which America has made to a better understanding and appreciation of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents achievement which is reckoned among the best things in American scholarship . To this must be added also his influence in the direction of social comment and interpretation . He has not remained so closely shut up in the cloistered pursuits of mere scholarship as to keep silent when he sees facts and tendencies in our life that need rebuke . He has spoken out so bravely and frankly on our crude excesses , our raw coarseness , our only too frequent failure to recognize and possess the permanent in the temporary , that there have not been wanting those who accuse him not only of being out of sympathy with American progress and ideals but also positively un-American . Of loud-mouthed flatterers and blind shallow optimists , we have had more than our share . Consequently , we have been prone to be impatient with the few who strive to see life steadily and see it whole , and from this wider standpoint , tell us our weaknesses and defects . However , by and by when we shall have attained a better perspective , we shall then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true value . But with all that he has done , he has perhaps rendered no greater service than that rendered as the friend and chosen executor of men of letters . We are indebted to him for editing the writings of George William Curtis , the letters of James Russell Lowell , the correspondence of Carlyle and Emerson , and now the letters of John Ruskin to himself . His special fitness for this last task comes from a singularly beautiful friendship , lasting from 1855 to Ruskin 's death in 1900 . To his task Professor Norton has brought taste , tact , and judgment , and knowing Ruskin as he did , he has revealed enough and no more , to let us into the secret of Ruskin 's genius and the moods under which his work was done . Taking these letters , therefore , in connection with Ruskin 's own singularly frank account of himself in the " Prterita , " one may doubt whether we shall ever have need of any other " life . " Of course Ruskin the Art Critic , Ruskin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be re-interpreted in the light of a later and a less biased perspective . But here , in these letters , one must feel that Ruskin the Man is faithfully set before us . And he himself has said the final word as to Professor Norton 's peculiar fitness for this work in the well known account of their  | meeting in Switzerland in 1856 : " That morning gave me , I said , my first tutor ; Dr. John Brown , however far above me in general power , and in the knowledge proper to his own profession , yet in the simplicity of his affection liked everything I wrote , for what was true in it , however imperfectly or faultily expressed ; but Norton saw all my weaknesses , measured my narrownesses , and , from the first , took serenely , and as it seemed of necessity , a kind of paternal authority over me , and a right of guidance ; ? though the younger of the two , ? and always admitting my full power in its kind ; nor only admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To such a friend as this we may be perfectly sure that Ruskin , always even extravagantly frank , would without reserve open his whole nature , and one can be further sure that out of the mass of his correspondence such a friend would be able to select those things which are characteristic and essential . It is interesting to note the growth of this friendship as marked by the changes in the mere forms of address which Ruskin uses . The correspondence begins with the acknowledgement of a formal letter of introduction in 1855 . " My dear sir " is the conventional way it begins . In the following July they meet again on a small steamer on Lake Geneva . For a few months after that it is " Dear Mr. Norton ; " a little later " Dear Norton , " and signed " Ever yours affectionately . " By 1868 the intimacy had become so deep that we read " My dearest Norton , " and after that it is " My dearest Charles . " So it continued to the end , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship as of correspondence , due to Ruskin 's utter lack of sympathy with the civil war , in which Norton 's heart and soul were so deeply concerned . During the first two years of it Ruskin sent one fierce protest after another , hot with anger and tremulous with horror over the whole business . Finally , October 6 , 1863 , he writes : " I 've no heart to write you while this war is going on . " Then follows a ten months ' silence broken with these words : " And your American business is so entirely horrible to me that , somehow , it cuts you off from all possibility of my telling you any of my thoughts . It is just as if I saw you washing your hands in blood , and whistling ? and sentimentalizing to me . " Another year goes by , bringing the war to an end , and Ruskin resumes the correspondence with ? " Now you 've done fighting , I can talk to you a little again . "  | His special indignation over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one phase of his general dislike of America and American conditions . Even his abiding tenderness for his American friend did not keep him from speaking out with his usual unalloyed frankness . To him Norton 's pleasure in ruins generally must have its source in the fact that America is " a very ugly country , " and " the very sense of despair about Rome must be helpful and balmy after the over-hopefulness and getting-onness of America . " Indeed , after seeing some landscapes by " an American painter of some repute , " he says that " the ugliness of them is wonderful , " and that therefore the " ugliness of the country must be unfathomable . " But if to the artist in Ruskin the country itself was intolerable , it seems even worse to Ruskin the social reformer . In a group of American tourists with whom he traveled from Venice to Verona , he thinks he sees a typical product of American conditions . Though traveling in " the most noble part of all the world , " they have " no thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had in their den or menagerie , being dragged about on a hot day . " " Add to this misery , " he continues , " every form of possible vulgarity , in methods of doing and saying the common things they said and did . I never yet saw humanity so degraded ( allowing for external circumstances of every possible advantage ) . Given wealth , attainable education , and the inheritance of eighteen centuries of Christianity and ten of noble paganism ; and this is your result ? by means of liberty . ' " With such as these to represent America , it is no wonder that he could get even some consolation in the midst of European abominations when he considered conditions on this side of the Atlantic : " It really makes me a little more indulgent to the beastliness of modern Europe , to think what we might have got to see and feel by this time , but for the various malaria from America . " This attitude toward America is not the mere by-play of his mind . Even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could hardly have thought otherwise of this new land with its excessive practicality and intense modernness . His impatience , therefore , with America is but a phase of his war with the whole modern world and its ideals . America was simply irretrievably given over to the worship of  | the idols which he with his whole soul was seeking to pull down . And in these letters we perhaps see more of the social reformer than we do of the artist or the art critic . It should be remembered that Norton 's friendship with him began just at the great turning-point in Ruskin 's life , in the beginning of the ferment which resulted in the transformation of the revolutionary art critic into the equally revolutionary critic and reformer of social conditions . He was thirty-six years old , and was engaged at the time with the preparation of volumes three and four of " Modern Painters . " As many as seven other volumes on subjects pertaining to art and its principles had brought him largely into the public eye and made him the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a man whose " whole air and manner had a definite and attractive personality , " and with " no self-consciousness or sign of consideration of himself as a man of distinction , " having " on the contrary , a seeming self-forgetfulness and an almost feminine sensitiveness and readiness of sympathy . " But his previous training and the conditions that conspired to shape his life had not prepared and fortified him for the new directions into which his genius was now to pour itself with such fiery fervor . He had been brought up under the unsleeping , unremitting authority of his parents , and his religious nature , by temperament so profound , had been wrought upon by the stern , unquestioning puritanism of his mother . What he had really needed , as Norton says , was " a discipline which should develop his power of self-control , and no child was ever more trained to depend upon external authority . " As a matter of fact he had in childhood no companions and in maturity no friends with whom he could associate on terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gather the practical wisdom of " independent action . " He himself confesses in a letter to Rossetti just before his meeting with Norton that he had " no friendships and no loves , " and Norton adds , " of all men he most needed friends , and in their place he had admirers and dependents . " Nevertheless , though clearly a spoiled child of genius , the victim of over-parental care , and the unfortunate upon whom too early beat the strong glare of publicity , his American friend could say of him : " I have not a memory of those days in which I recall him except as one of the pleasantest , gentlest , and kindest  | of men . He seemed cheerful rather than happy . The deepest currents of his life ran out of sight , but it was plain that they did not run calmly , and their troubled course became manifest now and then in extravagances of action and paradoxes of opinion . " These " extravagances " and " paradoxes " and the " troubled " nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters from this time on . Indeed , it is the sad story of the sorrows of genius that one reads . His whimsical , unrestrained , yet none the less serious and sincere impatience with all so-called modern improvements which men were misnaming progress , with the results of the new industrial and mechanical forces , to him hideous beyond expression , furnish the note of wildly uncompromising protest . His labors at the Workingmen 's College at this time ( 1855-1859 ) show in a practical way how deeply in earnest he was . He desired with all his soul to make conditions better , and yet hated with hot anger the very conditions he was trying to improve . He was like a knight seeking with unrestrained eagerness the dragon , yet not knowing just what it was nor where . " Some day , " he writes , " when I have quite made up my mind what to fight for , or whom to fight , I shall do well enough if I live , but I have n't made up my mind what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an invention of the Devil or not ; whether art is a Crime or only an Absurdity ; whether Clergymen ought to be multiplied , or exterminated by arsenic , like rats ; whether in general we are getting on , and if so , where are we going ? " This was written in 1859 , and , in the same year , to the confusion and confusing ferment of his general dissatisfaction with all modern conditions , must be added another element which , by disturbing violently the very foundations of the faith in which he had been brought up , set to seething the deepest currents of his thought and feeling . So , beneath the apparent gayety of the words just quoted , one may read something of the wrench of his Turin experience . On Sunday he went into a little Waldensian chapel , and heard a wretched interpretation , from a narrow evangelical standpoint , of life and its meaning . Thence he went into the art gallery , and stood in the presence of Paul Veronese 's Solomon and the Queen of Sheba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which , " he says , " seemed to me more devotional  | than anything I remembered of Evangelical hymns . " " And , " he continues , " as the perfect color and sound gradually asserted their power over me , they seemed finally to fasten me in the old article of Jewish faith , that things done delightfully and rightly were always done by the help and in the spirit of God ! " Thus , in his fortieth year his " Evangelical faiths were put aside . " This necessitated a complete readjustment of his thinking with reference to both art and religion , for both were inextricably intertwined in Ruskin 's nature . " It was a hard , unsettling revelation , " Norton adds , " and from the effects of it I believe that he never wholly recovered . " From this time on the record of the letters is the story of spiritual , moral and physical tragedy as painful as that of Lear 's . His war with the world rages with a wild and extravagant fierceness , made resplendent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lack of self-control and sanity . His sense of all but utter loneliness is not the least of the poignantly pathetic elements in the tragedy of his struggles . " You are almost the only friend I have left , " he writes to Norton . " I mean the only friend who understands or feels with me . . . . I do n't believe in Evangelicism ? and my Evangelical ( once ) friends now look on me with as much horror as one of the possessed Gennesaret pigs . Nor do I believe in the Pope ? and some Roman Catholic friends , who had great hopes of me , think I ought to be burned . Domestically , I am supposed to be worse than Blue Beard ; artistically , I am considered a mere packet of squibs and crackers . " So this was the mood in which he was closing the middle year of his life , 1860 . As Norton says : " His sense of evil in the world was growing daily more intense and bitter , and in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poor , he was rejecting with scorn the popular and accepted theories of social duties and political economy . " Then to the pain of this reconstruction of all his thinking must be added other elements that wrung remorselessly his heart . Rose La Touche , on conscientious scruples concerning his change of faith , refused to marry him , and , due largely to this same change of opinions , was the breaking up of whatever sympathy there had existed between him and his parents . His only resource seemed to be in unremitting work , ? so unremitting as finally to complete the disasters that were fast crowding upon him by wrecking him nervously and physically .  | These , then , were the influences which were working in him when , in 1860 , he began in the Cornhill Magazine the " Unto this Last " series . One is not surprised that the series brought about his head an even greater storm than that brought by " Modern Painters . " His own mood at the time is clearly mirrored in the letters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his writings from then on . It is almost one of pathetic hopelessness as to the fight he was waging , yet stirred by fits of flaming anger . " I get into states of disgust and fury at the way the mob is going ( meaning by the mob , chiefly dukes , crown princes , and such like persons ) that I choke , " he writes : " and I have to go to the British Museum to look at Penguins till I get cool . " But added to his sense of despair and dissatisfaction with the world , there grows up in him the same feeling with reference to all he himself had done . This finds repeated expression in his usual whimsical , extravagant manner which can not quite conceal the bitter earnestness beneath . " Intense scorn of all I had hitherto done or thought , still intenser scorn of other people 's doings and thinkings , especially in religion , " is the way he puts it . Besides his own life at times seems wholly a failure : " I 've written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't draw , I ca n't play or sing , I ca n't ride , I walk worse and worse , I ca n't digest . And I ca n't help it . " In the midst of it all there come out of the depths of his nature passionate cries for peace and rest . He would turn with new interest to the study of natural history in the hope of relief for body , mind , and soul . But even this makes him " giddy and desolate beyond speaking ; " still , " it is better than the effort and misery of work for anything human . " So there is no hope in anything , ? none in himself , in God , in the church , nor even in nature . The foundations seem all but gone from under him . Now and again he returns to Switzerland , the source of so much of his happiness in the past . But while this may give a kind of peace to the tired body , it brings none to the soul . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of me having disappeared for the present , " he piteously writes : " Only do n't let me lose you , but stay for me to come and ask for affection again when it will be good to me . " His father died in 1864 , and there came upon him the responsibility of managing a large fortune . His new duties and practical  | activities in various efforts of reform brought him a kind of peace for the next few years , and something of the old-time playfulness sparkles in the letters . But this mood lasts for only a short time . Over-work brought its penalties , though it was a kind of " opiate . " In 1869 he accepted the Slade Lectureship at Oxford , and got no little satisfaction on in the thought that he might now be really accomplishing something by training the students who flocked to his lectures in great numbers . Hence when Norton met him in Siena in 1870 , " he was in a delightful mood ; the clouds which darkened his spirit had lifted for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the pity of it was that this was only an intermittent flame ofjoyplaying over depths becoming more and more sombre . His mother died in 1871 , his " Rosie " a few years later . He kept at his work with furious pace , and a heavier darkness begins to gather . In 1875 he writes : " It is very strange to me to feel all my life to become a thing of the past , and to be now merely like a wrecked sailor , picking up pieces of his ship on the beach . " More and more the present seems not for him , and he turns away toward the past , ? toward the Middle Ages with a new zeal , preparing the way for another fundamentally disturbing change in his attitude toward life . " The Middle Ages are to me the only ages , " he says , and " all modern science and philosophy produces abortion . That miracle-believing faith produced good fruit ? the best yet in the world . " A kind of spiritualism , strange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself to the naive , trusting faith in the Middle Ages . To this his war with the whole modern scheme of things had brought him . He says that it is " no new faith " that he now has , but he is able " to get some good " out of his old one . At any rate , the change seemed to help him , and to induce a more cheerful mood . " Every day , " he writes , " brings me more proof of the presence and power of real Gods , with good men ; and the religion of Venice is virtually now my own ? mine at least ( or rather at greatest ) including hers , but fully accepting it , as that also of John Bunyan , and of my mother , which I was first taught . " But again the peace was only a pause in the troubled course of his life . Prodigous work , the trials of brain and heart , and the ferment incident to his new spiritual passion brought on a stroke  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
