 | In the light of recent developments , Imedical observation has revealed remarkable facts concerning the sanitary value of the Jewish food . This discovery has been corroborated by the history of the Jew himself . Despised by his fellowmen , oppressed by his neighbors and persecuted by the nations throughout the ages Israel has outlived all its obstacles and stands to-day a living testimony of an indestructible vitality . The immunity of the Jews from certain infectious diseases and their unusual longevity has long been recognized . Even to-day , the writer is informed by some life insurance men that their respective companies still regard the Jew , because of his prolonged age , as an excellent risk . Since most authorities agree that this remarkable endurance of the Jew is due to the nature of his food and to his mode of living , it may be of interest to some to glance for a moment upon the cookery of a people who for centuries have realized the fact that nothing is so important to the sense of happiness as perfect health and nothing more essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . The fundamental principles of the Jewish cookery are based upon the dietary laws mentioned in the Pentateuch and elaborated in the Talmud , the commentary of the Bible . Foods that have been prepared according to the ordinances of this law are known in the Jewish household as " Kosher , " i e , clean , and those not so prepared are " Trefah , " i e , unclean . This distinction , however , does not apply to vegetables , as their uses are unlimited ; the only precaution that the housewife must take is to see to it that all vegetables used as food are free from the slightest tendencies of decay . The  | sanitary importance of this rule is particularly notable when we realize the fact that among the orthodox the minute examination extends even to every leaf of the cabbage . The species of the animals sanctioned for use are based upon these general classifications : quadupeds must chew the cud and be cloven-footed , fowls must be clean and not birds of prey , fish must have fins and scales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three groups their food is unreservedly of a health ful character . For example , among the quadrupeds , such animals as the rabbit and the hog are forbidden . The former is said to be full of bacteria and the latter , because of his filthy and loathsome habits , is by nature a scavenger and is regarded by prominent physicians as unfit for food . Ravenous birds among the fowls are excluded because the eating of their flesh tends to develop voracious animal appetites . The classification of fish having fins and scales is a good one , as it permits only the use of such excellent fish as trout , pickerel and mackerel , and prohibits the eating of all shellfish . GENTILES AND KOSHER KILLED MEAT Not only is great stress put upon the selection of the animal , but also upon its preparation . All animals , except fish , must be put to death according to a prescribed method , known as p 391 " Shechita . " This must be done by the " Shochet , " who has studied the art thoroughly and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists mainly in cutting the throat of the animal , with a knife sharpened to its highest capacity , to such a great depth that it will easily bleed to death It is found that this method of slaughter is superior to others , both from a humane and hygienic standpoint . The blood contains many poisonous bacteria , and when it is drained off the greatest danger of infection to the human among its system is avoided . T'his method also produces a greater tenability in the meat . Dr I. A. Dembo of Russia , who has recently tested in his laboratory the phy-@# sical and chemical properties of meats slaughtered by the several methods , has found in his analysis that the process of decay sets slaughtered in tnuch sooner in meats by non-Jewish methods . As a result of his investigation many European cities are already adopting this method of slaughtering . The writer has had occasion to visit the largest slaughtering establishment in New York city where only this method is in vogue and learned from the management that it has patronage not only Jews but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a taste for Kosher killed beef . The process succeeding shechita is that @#  | of the " Bedika , " i e , the examination of its chief organs , done by inflating the lungs and testing the perfection of their expansion under water . This procedure is so exact that the slightest suspicion of diseased lungs will cause the rejection of the whole carcass and thus the danger of the transmissibility of disease is avoided . It is to this vigilant and delicate method of examination that the Jew largely owes his immunity from tuberculosis , a fact recognized throughout the world and lately demonstrated by Dr llorris F'ishberg to exist also in this country . The principal veins are next removed by the butcher , and the meat is then sold to the consumer . Because of the c o m plexity of the veins in the hip sinews and the grea , t difficulty in removing them they are not ordinarily used . The final process is accomplished by immersing the meat in cold water for half an hour and it is t h e n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This produces satisfac- tory results , as the water removes any poisonous matter that might have accumulated by handling , and the salting process acts as a good purifier and antiseptic and besides adds to the flavor . We must not lose sight of the fact that the Jewish meat is always fresh , as it must he consumed within a few days after it is slaughtered . This , on the whole , gives better results than meat kept for any length of time . In an interview , Rev Dr H. Pereira Mendes , l-7 D , rabbi of the Shearith Israel ( Spanish and Portuguese ) congregation of New York and president of the board of Jewish ministers , had the following to sav , after a close observation of fifteen years upon this subject : " The dietary laws are designed , first , as a means of spiritual discipline , to help to keep all animal appetites in check , to keep both soul and body pure and free from disease . The reason for them is obvious , especially in the light of modern medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the health of the consumers thereof . This law forbids all shellfish or other scavengers of the sea . These flourish espe-@#  | cially in or near rivers or on coast lines where the sewerage of cities is washed out . To such food has been traced out bearers of typhoid due to typhoid germs found therein . The connection of such a food with certain bodily ailments , especially certain skin diseases , is recognized . How far lobsters , crabs , mollusks , oysters , etc , are scavengers of the sea is another point to be considered . " A disease from which an animal suffers may be transmitted to the consumer . The communicability of the diseases of animals to human beings eating their flesh is recognized to-day as among th : : most serious causes of our ill health . " When meat is carried to a home it is placed in cold water for at least half an hour , according to its size ; it is then left , sprinkled generously with salt , for an hour , washed off and only then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water loosens coagulation and any contamination from handling . The salt kills any noxious germs that may have lodged upon its surface , and the final washing removes them . Orthodox Hebrews refrain fror.l using milk or food made from milk with the meat of an animal . " These dietary laws have given the Jews their tremendous constitution , without which they would have been crushed out of existence . " Dr A. E. Isaacs of the Beth Israel hospital , an institution in New York city which adheres to the dietary law , when asked for his opinion on the subject said : " The Jewish food is very healthful and in its hygienic value is even superior to other foods . This is especially true of meat , because it must be consumed while fresh . The formation of ptomainespoisonous matter-is often found in non-Jewish meat as the result of long exposure . " In my practice I have found that as soon as the Jew departs from his prescribed diet he becomes subject to those diseases which were unknown to him before . " Dr H. Illoway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when interviewed , made this statement : " Recent medical research has shown that most of the forbidden food of the Jews is really injurious to the health . Pork was once said to be the direct cause of leprosy . We find nowadays that it is instrumental in bringing about hydates - tapeworm- s- and also the fatal disease trichinosis . " The Jew owes his extraordinary vitality and unusual longevity , which until recently has been ten years above the average , to his hygienic food . It is to this that he owes his adaptability to the various climates . The climate in the island of Java is the hardest to endure and many people have succumbed to it , and yet , there the Jew has been able to hold his own . Another remarkable phenomenon is the fact that the Jew , although not by any means a temperance man , has seldom been a drunkard . This goes to prove that his food is of such a nature that it does not irritate and excite a craving for liquor . " In an interview J. P. Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , Iortality statistics , supplemented by the observations of medical authorities on problems of race pathology , show a remarkably low death rate among the Jewish race as compared with other races . In spite of their conditions of life , among the poorer classes , the overcrowding in unsanitary areas , employment in unhealthy trades , especially tailoring , long hours of labor and low wages , the most distinctive feature of the data is the very low mortality of the Jews from consumption and other respiratory diseases . This remarkable tenacity of life and disease resistance among a people who have for ages been the objects of race hatred and oppression , is to be attributed to right conduct and a dominant , and an abiding , unquestioning faith in themselves as well as their strict adherence to the Biblical dietary laws .
