txt This was one of the hardest days William D. Haywood has had in his trial for the murder of exGov . Frank Steunenberg , so far as the evidence brought out is concerned . The prosecution succeeded in introducing four letters showing an arrangement between Haywood and Orchard in the Summer of 1905 , by which the Cripple Creek wife of Orchard was to be deceived as to his whereabouts . One of the letters was from Haywood himself on the official stationery of the Western Federation of Miners . It was dated Nov. 18 , 1905 , and told Mrs. Orchard that the last he had heard of her husband he was in Alaska . Orchard , in fact , was at that time in Caldwell with Jack Simpkins arranging the murder of Steunenberg . The letter was in complete accord with the story of Orchard , which he had told on the witness stand regarding the arrangement to fool his wife , and links . Haywood up to him at the time when he was preparing to carry out what he declares to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these letters made a decided impression on the jurors . They sat up and took more notice than they have for several days , and when the letters were passed around among them each man scrutinized them closely . Harry Orchard occupied the stand most of the day on redirect and recess examination . He was preceded by Jasper Nichols , Sheriff of Caton County , who laid the foundation for the introduction of another letter , the unsigned one , to which Mr. Hawley referred in his opening statement . Nichols was in charge of the jail where Orchard was held on his arrest in Caldwell , immediately after the Steunenberg murder . He received the letter for Orchard , opened and read it . and made a copy of it before delivering the original to the prisoner . Letter from Pettibone . Orchard destroyed the original as soon as he had read it . This morning Nichols I identified the copy he had made , and then Ofhliateatified that he remembered very clearly the contents of the letter he had received , and that this was an accurate copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from Pettibone , although it was unsigned . He said that he was familiar with Pettibone 's handwriting , and had seen it often , and was sure of it in this case . On that showing It was admitted . It merely acknowledged the receipt of a letter and proceeded with these significant sentences : " That was sent to Jack Dec. 21 , for you . He should send It to you so that you ought to have it by this time . " Orchard then testified that he had written to Pettibone for $100 , and that this was the response . In the bunch of drafts admitted in evidence the other day there was one from Haywood indorsed to Jack Simpkins , for $100 , the only one for that sum in the lot of six . This was one dated in December , some time after the 20th , the exact date being illegible from the fact that the second figure had been punched out by the bank 's canceling stamp . Message from a Lawyer . While Sheriff Nichols was on the stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orchard from Spokane after his arrest . This was the message from Fred Miller , the Spokane lawyer , now associated with the defense , announcing that he would start for Caldwell the next day . It was dated Jan. 3 , 1909 . When it was sent Orchard had not attempted to communicate with any one , or to make any arrangement for his counsel . When ' Orchard was recalled this morning he also identified this message , and it was admitted in evidence . Orchard then explained that he had often had talks with Moyer , Haywood , and Pettibone regard ' ing his action in case he should be arrested , and that he had repeatedly been warned by them not to write or telegraph any of them under such circumstances , promising to see that a lawyer was sent to him at once wherever he might be . He also declared that when in Spokane with Jack Simpkins , before going back to Caldwell in the Fall of 1905 , he met Miller and Robertson , two of the members of the Miller firm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detention of his trunk . Ile was then going under the name of Orchard and had not told Miller or Robertson that he had ever used the name of Hogan . But the telegram from Miller was addressed to Thomas Hogan . When Orchard took the stand Mr. Richardson took up the formal impeachment questions which he had been unable to ask at the conclusion of his cross-examination last week . He explained that he did not now have the information on which to base certain questions , but would go ahead as far as he could and ask the others later when the witnesses on whom he relies for the further impeachment of Orchard reach Boise . Impeachment Questions . The Idaho law requires such questions to be in specific form , and Richardson could not comply with it without consultation of his witnesses . He had the information , however , from six witnesses on which to base his question . The first was Max Malich , the boss of Globeville , the Denver suburb where the employes of the Globe smelter live . Orchard , has involved Malich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Malich who suggested the blowing up of the Globeville boarding house and 150 scabs " within it . Mr. Richardson 's impeaching question was as to whether Orchard had not said to Malich in the store at Globeville that he was going to kill Steunenberg if he had to swing for it , within twenty-four hours , and that if it were not for Steunenberg he would be a millionaire , with an income of $20,000 a day . Orchard denied that he had ever - said any such thing , either in substance or effect . This was ; of course , following-ont. " - sal Mr. RichArd- : son 's part the suggestion of persona ! MOT . tivei on Orchard 's part foe the murder ' of Steunenberg ; - which he made when he was tioSS4xamining Orchard about his visit ' to'Wallace in the Fall of 1905 . , Orchard Denies Question . Richardson followed it-by asking if Orchard had not said substantially the same thing to Gen. Eugene Engley , ex-Attorney General of Colorado . in his office at Cripple Creek . Orchard made a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of the . . questions : - The third question was of similar import , and involved an alleged conversation between Orchard and Lottie Day in the Belmont Hotel , ' , in Denver . Dr. J. S. - of Wallace and . David Coates were also named by Richardson as witnesses to . whom Orchard is alleged to have made similar declarations regard-. ingthe loss of his interest in the Hercules Mine-through the action of Gov . Steunenberg and of his hatred of Steunenberg on that occasion . The- wife of " Kid " Waters , whom Richardson described as-the " chief thug of Cripple Creek , " was indicated as the sixth impeaching witness . Waters is dead . but It was evident from the question that his wife will testify that Orchard came to her house on two occasions and asked to have a private talk with the " Kid . " Orchard declared that he never saw Waters , eo far as he knew , and did not-lea/ow. of such a person until after his aerest . That ended the impeachment questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that Orchard had sold his interest in the Hercules Mine two years before he went to ' Work in the Tiger and Poor Mah Mine , and became a member of the Western Federation . After the sale of this interest Orchard said he had owned no property in Wallace . The only time he ever saw Gen. Engley was once in the Fall of 1902. when he went ' to the office with Jimmy Laughlin as a witness --  in a case ? Engley was trying . As to Malici ? - and the other impeaching witnesses , Orchard repeated his denials . Letters Admitted . ' The unsigned letter and telegram - from Fred Miller were taken up over the vigorous objection to the letter , which was that it did not connect anybody with this case or with anything else . When the fight over this letter and the telegram was over Mr. Richardson recalled that he had not made his customary motion to strike out all the testimony of Sheriff Nichols . - ' 1 overlooked that motion , your Honor , " be said . " and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court overlooked calling your attention to it , Mr.Richardson , " - replied the Judge . You May make it now . " Then Orchard went on to tell about having had an understanding also with Jack Simpkins , as well as with Haywood and Pettibone , about the furnishing of counsel in case he got into trouble . It was a specific arrangement with Simple kins , calling for the services of Robertson at Miller in case he was arrested at Caldwell . The last time he talked with Simpkins about it was in Caldwell the night before Simpkins left there , just before the murder was committed . After that Hawley took up the arrangement with Haywood for the deception of the Cripple Creek Mrs. Orchard as to her1 husband 's whereabouts . It was in April , 1905 , Orchard said , that he and Haywood talked it over . Deceiving- Mrs. Orchard . " Haywood told me , " he said , " that my Wife had been writing to him to find out where I was . I said that I would write some letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to Paddy Maloney , to Live to her . Paddy was the representative of the Western Federation at Cripple Creek , looking after the giving out of money and the distribution of relief . I told Haywood that I would also write a letter to be dated in Alaska , that Summer , and we agreed that he ctooid take the letter and mail it from Cape I left the date in that letter blank , for him to fill in when he mailed it " Two letters were then shown to Orchard . and he identified them as the ones he had written under the Sam Francisco - date . He said that he had written them in Denver , and had given them to Paddy Maloney . The first one was written in Pettibone 's store , and he talked . with Petti-hone ? about it , as well as about the second one . They were introduced in evidence , ever the strenuous objection of the defense . And then Orchard identified the third letter , the one mailed from Nome . The envelope accompanied that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 192i Orchard said it was alt in his heed : . - writing , except the date . He thought he - wrote this letter in Pettibone 's store and gave it to Moore there . Then came the most interesting and important letter of all , the one to Mrs. Orchard from Haywood . Orchard testified to his familiarity with Haywood 's handwriting , and identified the letteras gene nine , thus qualifying it for admission as evidence . Haywood 's face was a study when all this was going on . He understood as well as anybody else in the courtroom the significance and importance of the connection thus established between him and Orchard at the very - time that Orchard was busy trying to kill Steunenberg , and he could not help showing that it was hard for him to take . Jurors Keenly Interested . The jurors were keenly interested , and when the letter was passed to them after having been read , . - they examined it with minute care and read it With-Slow deliberation , as if reluctant to pass it along . It is a singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orchard as to any place in Alaska . In fact , from the way in which he spoke always of " Cape Nome , " as if that were the name of the place . it was evident that he was very poorly informed about that territory . Ye-t Haywood volunteers the name of Fairfield , thereby showing that he . too , was not familiar with Alaska . And then , apparently , just by way of lending verisimilitude to his interest , Haywood adds the incongruous but significant statement that " an awful condition prevails among the law and order element . ' The reading of his own letters was very hard for Orchard to take . It upset him more than anything that has occurred to him in the courtroom except his explanation of his conversation with and his motive for making his confession . His face changed color several times , and he shifted his glance repeatedly from the floor to the ceiling and back again . - Whether it was the disclosure of his deceitful treatment of the woman . or the ' revelation of the-cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing to show . But the Incident was about the most trying to his composure that has occurred dn court . When the letters Were  - -  all in , Mr. Hawley brought out the fact that the : fishline used by Orchard-on the Goddard ; bomb in Denver was part of the-came ? line he used in the Steunenberg bomb . It is a. little point , but confirmatory of the story he hat- told : The prosecution has portions - of-  the - line , one- frotiveahh ; Place , and will show that they are identical . Orchard also explained his . going to gee D. C. Scott after the Vindicator explosion by saying that Scott sent for him , and , as he had. previously talked tit Scott about the train-wrecking attempt , he thought it would be suspicious if he did not respond then . ? Steve Adams 's Confession . .1'hen cattle the hardest ' fight that has been made so far ' - in the . trlalarin which the prosecution was partly successful and partly defeated. - Richardson - had asked . Orchard , ' on ' cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . et:Stete Aoams to confess , . and- had ? talkedettbout the repudiationof his - confession by Adams . Hawley now : tried ' - to . show that Adams had made that confession voluntarily , and , that it had not been extorted from him . To every question ' Richardson objected , but the special- fight was over a questicn as to what Adams had said to Orchard on an occasion after ? they had talked for some time on . ' the . - subJent:ofe confessions , and before saw Adams . Richardson protesteCthae it ' could not be admitted as - the declaration of a coconspirator , - because it was ratter the purpose of the econspiraey .. had , been accomplished , and'they weraliQthaltrfall , unable to do anythiliefurther for the conspiracy . Darrow fought it as not proper . redirect fe ) i gone into it on Croae .. eX. , ' Insinationsealsi.wley read reams of record to show that the defense had gone into it , and Borah argued the right of the State to have the subject elucidated . The Judge finally permitted ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He told me he did not think I would be alone in making a confession , that he was going to do it , too . " Then Hawley brought up a meeting which he had had with Borah and Orchard and Adams ; at ' which the Adams con- ' fession had been talked of . He tried hard ' to show that at that time Adams had neither repudiated his confession nor made any protest about its having been extorted frome him : Buts the  --  court ruled against him , and he had to give it up . Orchard Insists . On recross-examination Richardson tried to show that Orchard had told Dave Coates and others that he ? had merely Pledged his interest in the Hercules Mine instead of selling it , and that up to the ' time when he ran away from the Coeur d'Alenes he might . hay.e , .. redeemed it . Orchard stuck to it that-the transfer was a sale outright .. and- that he never had m. any interest In the mine from that time . He said he had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1905 , and had said to him jokleglY , " I heard you were looking for me to give me $ ? , 000 or $5,000 , you have done so well out of that investment . " But the other man did not see the joke . Orchard said in further explanation of the writing of the letters to his wife that he has heard that she had said she was going to tell the officers where he was . " I heard that she said she wouldrather see me in jail than not know where I ' was . " he said . When Richardson questioned him again about his explanation of going to see Scott , the railroad detective , after the Vindicator explosion , Orchard reiterated his assertion that he was afraid Scott would suspect him of that crime if he did not go . " I thought I had better stick a string through that then the best I could , " he said . When Orchard ; was excused , Ed Boyce , the former President of the Western Federation , who is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hercules Mine , was called . He is a tall , thin man , with a washed-out complexion and a nervous trick of screwing up his face as he answers a question . He has got bravely over loowing like - the man-who used to talk - about the music of the tramp of 25,00S armed miners , " as be did when he was urging the members of the Federation to arm themselves.a.nd drill , - so as to be able to fight the militia . Mr. Borah examined him to lay the foundation for the introduction of a lot of articles from The Miners ' Magazine , the official organ of the Federation , which will be . submitted tomorrow
