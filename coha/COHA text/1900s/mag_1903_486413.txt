The Life of Lowell for the American Men of Letters series of Houghton , Mifflin &; Co has been undertaken by Dr. Samuel M. Crothers McClure , Phillips &; Co. have nearly ready ' Great Masters , ' by John La Farge . From Lemcke &; Blichner we receive the thirteenth issue of the ever welcome and as indispensable Ilinerva , swollen , as the editor points out , by more than a hundred scientific and learned institutions , many of them new foundations , but not all nor most . The index of names  --  the ready " Who 's Who " of the learned world  --  shows 4,000 new entries : a greater boon For portrait frontispiece we have Herkomer 's etching of Prof J E B.

Another of R. Ackermann 's sporting books , ' The Analysis of the Hunting Field , ' " a slight souvenir of the season 1845-46 , " is revived by Messrs . Appleton . The colored illustrations are by -H . Aiken , and so are the clever initial letters and vignettes , not always as well reproduced and sharply printed as the I on p 115 . We can not predict a general consensus in the implication of Elia W.

Still , we think life could be passed without repentance for ignorance of Francis A. Durivage 's " All , " in spite of Bayard Taylor 's encomium . And ought we even to know who Dunvage was ? We may say the same of Gen Henry R Jackson 's " My Wife and Child , " of Gen William H Lytle 's " Antony and Cleopatra , " of Father Ryan 's " The Song of the Mystic , " of J. L McCreery 's " There Is No Death , " and of many more pieces and authors . We can hardly admit that the inclusion of such as these was a sufficient excuse for reprinting ( in a book ) old favorites . ' The Thoughtless Thoughts of Carisabel , ' by Isa Carrington Cabell ( Henry Holt &; Co ) , is the title of a set of social satires , written originally as newspaper articles . They do not pretend to literary merit , but they are the reflections of a shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront. ? " Servants , " the " New Man , " the " New Child , " and " Nervous Prostration , " that disease of the rich , on which Carisabel remarks : " The ' Life and Letters of Stevenson ' is the best tonic for nervous prostration . It costs two dollars , but then the starchy angel will cost her society and twenty-five dollars a week . " Carisabel 's lively descriptions of her college-bred daughter express the conservatism which is the keynote of this domestic philosophy . In ' The Nature of Goodness ' ( Houghton , Miffiin &; Co . ) , Prof. George Herbert Palmer carries on in an interesting manner the discussion on which he entered in his ' Field of Ethics ' The treatment here , as there , is extremely fresh and vital , the style , not far behind Professor James 's in point of homely vigor . Professor Palmer 's expectations are not extravagant . Wishing merely tr. make people aware of what has always been in their minds , he feels that his readers may " know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did at the beginning " ; yet he hopes they will henceforth " find the world interesting in a degree they never knew before . " This hope will doubtless be made good through a wide range , but the better informed of Professor Palmer 's readers will enjoy his book much more than the worse informed , because they will recognize that they are , through much of the way , enjoying a criticism of various ethical books and writers whose names are given at the end of each chapter , but do not disfigure its course . " From the Double Nature of Goodness , " as extrinsic and intrinsic , we pass to " Misconceptions of Goodness , " and a set of well-considered definitions The succeeding chapters treat of " Self-Consciousness , " " Self-Direction , " " Self-Development , " " Self-Sacrifice , " " Nature and Spirit , " and " Three Stages of Goodness . " Some of the apparent paradoxes are resolved in a suggestive and not too ingenious manner At every step of its advance the argument hugs close the shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded with morality , the book is likely to prove morally helpful in not a few of its particulars A large enterprise has been begun by MM Jules Gillidron and B. Edmont in an ' Atlas Linguistique de la France , ' of which 4 numbers have been published , each containing 50 maps ( Paris ? Honord Champion ) . There are to be at least 1,800 sheets in 36 parts , at the price of 20 francs the number ( 25 francs after the sixth livrazson ) . Every map will be devoted to a single word or single morphological type . It is supposed that 4 numbers will be published every year , and that the publication will be finished in 1908 The first map is devoted to the Word abeale , and the patois equivalents throughout France In the north of France mosohe prevails ; in the south obetlle ; and it is strange to note that in some localities ruche , essam , gape , bourdon are used for abedle , contrary to the linguistic processes of other peasants who say ups , eys , 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apis M Rogues , in the Debats , quoted in the publisher 's circular , gives a skilful study of the Latin history of the word , and of the advance on the country dialects made by the speech of Paris . M. Edmont is the author of the ' Lexique SaintPolois , ' an excellent dialectal study , and is the chief worker among the investigators . It is quite unusual to be assured , of so large a work , that all the maps were ready for the printer in January last , and that only funds are needed to complete the publication One would expect the General Atlas to follow a special study of all departments and localities . The order seems to be somewhat reversed in the case of this atlas , but it is evident that a large mass of valuable material will be lost if the plans of the editors fail Pierre Decharme 's ' Compagnies et Sod- " ads Coloniales Allemandes ' ( Paris , 1903 ) bears for its epigraph the Bismarckian sentiment , " Avant le soldat , le marchand ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume throws weight upon the action of the German Chartered Companies as pathfinders for the imperial development to come . Decharme thinks that the inefficiency and final collapse of the companies mark a failure of the Chancellor 's policy . This is doubtful ; for , admitting the dangerous premise that any one knew or knows the workings of that subtle and not unscrupulous mind , the fact still remains that the original desire of Bismarck as expressed , namely , to organize the German colonies after the British Crown Colony model , has been fully realized . The colonial societies and their activity are treated in an interesting and exhaustive manner . Decharme thinks that their operations have resulted in " confounding colonization with external commerce , " and that they have led to the easy launching of questionable enterprises . Especially valuable for the student is the series of statutes , charters , treaties , etc. , appended to the 7 , olume , and the list of companies and colonial societies with their dates of founding , capitalization , and the like . The bibliography also contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colonies . Part III of the Transactions of the German Asiatic Society of Japan , for 1903 , completing volume ix , contains five pa ' pers , every one of interest , and two of more than usual importance . Dr. Koganei furnishes a rigidly scientific paper on " The Original Inhabitants of Japan . " He proves , from profound researches and careful comparative examinations , with measurements of the physique of the Japanese and their habitations , the substantial identity of the Aino of Yezo and the Kurile Islands with the natives of the more southern old Japan , or the long civilized part of the empire . He makes language , the shell-he-aps and other subterranean evidences , besides various constants in superficies and proportions , tell their story . His conclusion is set forth in his final sentence , which confirms his previous deliverances on this point : " The Japanese realm ( Retch ) was once an Aino realm . " Rev I-1 Haas treats of the origin of the name Nippon , showing its Chinese origin . The same scholar presents a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a survey of the literature of the subject , pointing out the store of materials for a study of Shinto , Buddhism , and Confucianism , now awaiting the foreign student . The tables of statistics , with names and founders of the different sects , with dates , is very valuable , showing that the Shin , or Protestant sect , which teaches justification by faith , leads all in the number of temples Those who have noted with interest the great part which gifts of sustenance , both of uncooked food and of delicacies and decorated eatables , play in the social system of the Japanese , will find a very pleasing and correct study of the Japanese custom of food presents . The paper is reinforced with eight pages of illustrations concerning the arrangements of tables , trays , tying cords , and the peculiar folded papers containing , as ' insert , a bit of dried fish In this we see a survival and elaboration of very primitive rules of life . There is also a good paper on the Imperial Realm or Crownland of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly held show the flourishing state of this learned society . Prof. Dr. Karl Krumbacher of Munich , the only occupant of a chair for Byzantine Greek in a German university , is publishing in the reports of the Royal Bavarian Academy ( Historical Section , 1903 , Heft III. ) the text of an entirely new specimen of a peculiar kind of mediaeval literature , of which only a very few samples have been issued This is the famous ' Fish Book ' 64.31.0,4os ) belonging to a larger group of Animal , Plant , and Stone Books , - and closely related to the Quadruped Book , the Bird Book , and the Fruit Book , of which Krumbacher gives an interesting account in his Byzantinische Literaturgeschichte ' ( II. , p. 877 sq . ) It is nearest akin to the last-mentioned , both describing tricks which take place before the King , with the object of satirizing the abuses of title and office in the Byzantine Empire . In the Fruit Book the grape raises some false charges of treachery against a number of officials ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Majesty King ' Whale , in which also Count Sardine has taken part . This edition of the Fish Book is based on the only codex in existence , a Middle-Greek Manuscript in the Escorial , of which Krumbacher managed to secure a photographic reproduction . The best-known specimen of this curious type of literature is the ' Reinecke Fuchs ' story , of which Goethe gave so masterly a version . Only two years ago an attempt to introduce the translation of the New Testament into modern Greek created a students ' riot in Athens that resulted in bloodshed . Quite recently Angelos Simiriotis , a professor in the theological seminary in Smyrna , sought to introduce such a translation as a part of his lectures to his pupils , and then to publish the work . At the instigation of the local synod in Constantinople , the Metropolitan of that city , who is the head of the Eastern branch of the orthodox Church , published a bull addressed to the Archbishop of Smyrna demanding that Simiriotis 's work be suppressed , and that the copies which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gratifying announcement is made ? that the new Pope will continue the policy , adopted by his predecessor twenty years ago , of giving free access to the savants of all nations to the treasures of the Vatican . Some time after the election of Pius X , Dr. Pastor , the director of the Austrian Historical Institute in Rome , in an audience with the pontiff , when presenting to him the fourth edition of the first volume of the ' History of the Popes in the Age of the Renaissance , ' gave expression to the hope that the liberal policy of Leo XIII . would be continued The Pope in strong terms declared such to be his intention , and closed with the words : " Non 0 da temere la writ &; " Only recently has Denmark communicated its formal acceptance of the Bern Convention for the international protection of authors ; and now the Swedish Society of Authors has united in a petition to the Government to have the authorities of their country take a similar step . The promise has been officially given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iceland during 1903 ' the long struggle for a revision of the Constitution was finally crowned with success ; and the unpoetical split codfish , which for centuries has been the coat of arms , has given way to the Icelandic white falcon The first change is of a practical character , and it is hoped that , by having a resident minister , instead of half a minister , in Copenhagen , the Icelanders will in the next generation show an even greater advancement than in the immediate past As a matter of fact , the desire for a worthy national sybabol is an even more encouraging sign , showing , as it does , that the growth of material prosperity has not deadened the minds of the people to an appreciation of the higher things of life . For particulars regarding the above changes and Iceland 's general progress , one may consult a letter in the London Tunes of October 13 , 1903 , from the pen of a well-known American scholar . The six-sheet Omar calendar of Fox , Duffield &; Co. frames two of FitzGerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of the year 1904 , the text in brown ink on an elegant uncalendered Japan paper ( a paradox to the ear ) Another novelty is the pad of the Pope Manufacturing Co. , which affords for each day of the year a fresh , up-to-date testimonial from some person of distinction to the healthful uses of the bicycle ; substantial proof that this vehicle is not so much gone out of fashion as would appear . ? One of the best numbers in the valuable series of " Our European Neighbors " ( Putnams ) is that on ' Austro-Hungarian Life in Town and Country , ' by Francis H. E. Palmer , the well-informed author of a similar volume on Russian life . He is at his best in the chapters-conveying solid information , of a kind very much needed in newspaper offices , as to Austro-Hungarian nationalities and political and official life . If he is not quite as satisfactory in dealing with the aspects of town and rural life , he may plead that limitations of space made anything like adequate treatment of so complex a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better at his hands than Austria , the description of life in Transylvania being particularly good . On the other hand , the account of the intellectual life of the monarchy is lamentably meagre . Not a name of any writer occurs in the chapters devoted to Austro-German , Magyar , Polish , AustioServian , Wallachian , and Czech literature . ( Indeed , aside from royalty , the only names of Austro-Hungarian celebrities of any kind mentioned in the volume are those of Desk , Kossuth , Beust , and Hentzi . ) Still poorer is the attempt to depict the social life of Vienna , the pages being disfigured by the writer 's unreasoning anti-Semitio prejudice . Author and publishers are probably equally responsible for the omission or misplacement of Hungarian accents , the misspelling of German words , and the erroneous designation , in a footnote , of Kolozsvdr as the Magyar equivalent of Kronstadt , instead of Klausenburg ; but the indiscriminate use of French and semi-German transliterations of Russian words ( such as " Moujic " and " Tscherop Spiridonowitch " ) , the preference for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Servians , " must be laid to the author 's charge . The publishers , however , are answerable for the mediocrity of the illustrations ( with such a subject as Austria-Hungary before them ! ) . The tautological " Austrian Tyrol " appears so constantly in books and papers that one looks for it almost as a matter of course in a work like the present . But , with all its blemishes , Mr. Palmer 's volume can be recommended as a sensible , pleasantly written , and generally safe guide in the maze of Austro-Hungarian nationalities . ? G. P. Putnam 's Sons are the American publishers of Prof. Paul Wernle 's elaborate study , ' The Beginnings of Christianity , ' in two volumes , the first of which , ' The Rise of the Religion , ' has now come to hand . Professor Wernle occupies a distinguished place in the University of Basel and among Continental theologians , but his book is not so written as to convey definite impressions . A sandy diffuseness is its most characteristic note . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian origins , others upon the life and teachings of Jesus , then a series on the Jewish-Christian development , a longer series on St Paul , and a concluding set on the Apocalypse , which is accepted as a Christian document fundamentally . Corresponding to the opinion of Harnack and others , that it is a Jewish writing which has undergone Christian redaction , we have the acknowledgment that its use of Jewish apocalyptical machinery is extremely free and bold . An English introduction assures us that the idea running through the whole book is a simple one : " It is , first of all , to ascertain what the Gospel is as seen in the teachings and character of Jesus , and secondly , to measure all the later expositions of the Gospel contained in the teachings of the New Testament writers by the Gospel itself " The idea is simple enough , but the working of it is extremely difficult , and requires for its efficiency a tar more delicate critical apparatus than Professor Wernle has at his command . For it is not as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their face value . Even in those teachings he finds a temporal element , an historic envelope , which must be stripped away before the essential truth of Christianity can be disclosed . Where , for example , Martineau found no " Messianic consciousness " in Jesus ; Prof. Wernle finds ft unmistakable , but regards it as a misDec. taken consciousness , bred by the conditions of the time . Passing from Jesus to his disciples , the " historic envelope " is stripped off with a bolder hand The early Christian theology is described as " a wretched jumble of Jewish words and conceptions , and Christian insertions and additions . " If a partial exception is made in favor of St. Paul , he is nevertheless found guilty of fanatical narrowness and of confining the Gospel within a form that does not harmonize with the teachings of Jesus . In its main effect the book is one more sign of the general drift away from the traditional Christianity . ? Robert Kilburn Root 's ' Classical Mythology in Shakespeare , ' one of the Yale Studies in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of the classical allusions altogether , but of the classical mythology in Shakspere . The subjects are arranged alphabetically , as Achilles , Actaeon , Adonis , etc. ; the passages from the authors that Shakspere probably had in mind are quoted , mostly from Ovid , more rarely from Virgil , but occasionally from the Greek ; and the various topics are further illustrated with much comment from a wide reading The essay , of 134 pages , begins with an introduction , in which the author considers the possibility of obtaining an argument for the genuineness of the Shaksperian authorship of plays from the different ways in which he uses mythology at different times ; and a final section mentions the plays in the order of their origin according to Mr. Root , with a brief notice of the mythology in each . Classes in Shakspere will find here many interesting and instructive notes , as on poppy under " Lethe , " on tent under " Hecuba , " on " Ilium , " on dragon under " Night , " on Thomas Scarlet under " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one , of course , will expect to see Shakspere here published as a plagiarist ; the magisterial way of the old Elizabethan in dealing with his authorities is too well known for any one to fear to see him cast from his eminence . It is also understood from the days of Farmer that Shakspere relied chiefly upon the translations of the classics , mostly on Golding 's translation of Ovid . In such a play as " Titus Andronicus , " and also in " Henry VI. , " it is curious to learn that Shakspere introduces classical myths not to be found in any other of his admittedly genuine plays . Mr. Root 's essay is well worth consulting when a comment on the topics he discusses is required . Under " Hector " it might have been mentioned that Hector quotes Aristotle , who lived 800 years after the siege of Troy ; and the note on the " Sibyl " and her " prophetic fury " might be compared with Mr. Grant White 's comment on page 35 of his ' Memoirs of Shakspere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando Furioso ; and that the line furnishes proof that Shakspere knew Italian . Mr. Root ( p. 62 ) discerns a reference to Fortune and her wheel in Horace , Ode 3:10 , 10 ; but this seems hardly necessary for an explanation of the passage . ? To " The Library of Literary History , " best known in this country as containing Prof. Barrett Wendell 's ' Literary History of America , ' has recently been added a volume on the ' Literary History of Scotland , ' by J. H. Millar , author of ' The Mid-Eighteenth Century ' in Saintsbury 's " Periods of European Literature Series . " This writer has boldly attempted to cover the whole history of letters in Scotland down to the present day , omitting only authors ( like Carlyle ) whose work was for the most part done in England In the Pre - Reformation period , though the estimate of literary quality is based on his own reading , Mr. Millar makes no pretensions to authority in dealing with technical or controversial topics , and seems as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Henderson . His treatment of the Ballads is not remarkable either for discriminating appreciation or for grasp of the technical problems involved , his qualifications for dealing with the subject being indicated by his choice of three supposedly typical examples for quotation , two of which are not recognized by Child as genuine traditional ballads at all , while the third is quoted in a doctored version . His discussion of later writers is marked by frequent and often grave inaccuracies , and by a strong bias against what he delights to call " highflying , " 4. e. , all kinds of enthusiasm for reform and covenanting zeal The reader familiar with Scottish history and the Scottish temperament will perceive that this implies an unsympathetic treatment of much that is-most characteristic in Scottish literature . In the case of some contemporary writers , the author 's partisanship leads him at times to unjust verdicts and the most unworthy insinuations . It is only in the case of men of his own political and theological bent that Mr. Millar is capable of rendering an estimate at once sympathetic and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sir Walter Scott , perhaps the most satisfactory in the book . It is extremely regrettable that a volume giving the most convenient account of Scottish literature as a whole should be disfigured by so much that is ill-natured and untrue . ? The fifth edition of M Paul LeroyBeaulieu 's notable work , ' De la Colonisation chez les Peuples Mdfiernes , ' deserves almost the notice accorded to a new book . It is about twice the size of the fourth edition , and contains much new matter , besides that necessary to bring it up to date The general character of the treatise remains practically the same . The French colonies receive an even more disproportionate amount of space than formerly , the English colonies are relatively the more restricted , although the author has always been strong in his approval of the general type of British policy . The standpoint of the work is that of the economist and statistician rather than that of the social scientist ; Leroy-Beaulieu seldom vies with Roscher in breadth of philosophical view . He is at his best when dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " SOciologie Coloniale , " etc , are by cemparison much weaker A rather amusing self-gratulatory vein runs through this edition , indicated by frequent verbatim extracts from former editions , followed by a complacent " I told you so . " But this is a minor matter , and the faults of the work are minor ; it remains the best treatise we have on colonization . Several additions have been made . Some time ago Friedrich Ratzel complained that no book on colonies paid any attention to the colonial activitiesof races other than the white ; he wished to include what may be called primitive colonization , e g , that of the Malays and Polynesians . Leroy-Beaulieu does not meet this objection fully , but he does give a respectable section to the late colonial labors , in Yezo , Formosa , and Korea , of the Japanese . Furthermore , he expands the story of Russian colonization to a considerable extent , much to the profit of his readers . Among the new parts of the work is to be found , likewise , a chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we have , from a recognized authority on colonies , and from a friend of colonial expansion , a lucid and wholesome statement of the economic and other incongruities of our late exploits It does not appear that Leroy-Beaulieu is in any sense an enemy of America and her greatness ; yet he takes substantially the attitude toward American " colonial " enterprise and toward the late President and his policy which has been decried as the view of narrow-minded enemies of their country The exploit of Gen Funston in capturing Aguinaldo is euphemistically described as " une sorte de trahison . " ? Mr. Alfred Marks has had reprinted , in pamphlet form , from the transactions of the Royal Society of Literature , his paper on the probable extent of the collaboration between Hubert and John van Eyck which was read before that society on the 24th of last June . His conclusion is that both brothers worked on all the pictures properly attributable to either until the death of Hubert in 1426 , and , indeed , that the collaboration can not be said to have ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of his brother 's death , ending with the completion of the great Ghent altarpiece , " The Adoration of the Lamb , " on May 6 , 1432 . He believes that John , who is supposed ? to have been some twenty years younger than his brother , worked as the latter 's assistant , being specially intrusted with the landscape backgrounds , of which he made a specialty , and that there are probably no pictures entirely by Hubert and none entirely by John earlier than the first authentic signed and dated picture , which is of the same year with the completion of the Ghent altarpiece . We do not pretend to the expert knowledge necessary to a definite opinion of our own in such a matter , but Mr. Marks 's arguments are strong and , as he puts them , fairly conclusive . He examines all of the well-known and important works of the Van Eycks , excepting , of course , those signed by John , and finds only two in which the evidence of collaboration seems to him doubtful . His reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyck was specially praised as a landscape painter in his epitaph , and by the earliest writers - on his work , who also record the tradition of collaboration . Some of the landscape backgrounds of Van Eyck pictures contain the palmetto , which grows in few places in Europe , but does grow , in abundance , in a part of Spain which we know that John van Eyck visited . This visit took place after Hubert 's death , and these pictures , as hypot7bcsi , were completed after the return from this journey . There are other tropical plants in many pictures which suggest a journey to Italy , and there are snow mountains ' which would have been seen on the way . We have no knowledge that John van Eyck ever went to Italy , but the presence of similar plants in pictures which he signed leads to the inference that he painted these parts of the unsigned pictures . Certain resemblances in the treatment of architecture and the observation of the flight of birds lead also to the conclusion that the hand of John van Eyck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here it might be suggested that the argument rather tends to eliminate Hubert altogether , and that John may have painted the pictures alone . The answer is , first , the tradition of collaboration again  --  in the case of the Ghent altarpiece it is , of course , explicit statement ; then the fact that the portraits of the brothers occur , side by side , in two of these pictures , then that John was a realist and a portrait painter , and that some of these pictures contain figures possessing a beauty of which we have no reason to think him capable . Finally , if John painted these pictures , why did he not sign them ? And why do his authentic signed pictures begin precisely in 1432 and continue until his death ? There are only two earlier dates , and they are shown to be on doubtful or more than doubtful pictures . John van Eyck sometimes affixed his signature to the frame of a picture , and some of these frames may have been lost . " Subject to this reservation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders doubtful an ascription to John van Eyck " In conclusion Mr. Marks devotes some space to the consideration of certain objections to his theory , which hardly seem very formidable , and raises the question of what work Hubert did before 1410 , when John , then about twenty years old , is supposed to have become his assistant . ? European scholarship in Chinese suffers severely by the decease on October 15th of Prof. Dr. Gustaaf Schlegel , who held the chair of the Chinese language and literature at Leyden University from the year 1877 . He was undoubtedly one of the greatest sinologues of out time , and eminent even in the long list of scholars associated with Leyden . The son of the renowned zoologist Schlegel , he was born at Oegstgeest , South Holland , in 1840 , and was early the pupil of the sinologue and pioneer professor of Japanese in Europe , Dr. J. J Hoffmann . - On August 20 , 1862 , he was appointed Government interpreter in Chinese at Batavia , holding the office until 1872 , and being also , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision of the civil law of the Netherlands Indies . His degree of Doctor of Philosophy came in 1869 , from the University of Jena , his thesis being on Chinese recreations and customs . On October 3 , 1877 , he delivered his inauguration discourse as professor in Leyden , which was concerned with the peculiarities of Chinese linguistic studies . Besides his great dictionary , the number of his writings surpasses 250 , and these cover the various subjects of ethnology , epigraphy , law , agriculture , astronomy , and many matters of recondite scholarship . He was especially strong and felicitous in archaic Chinese Many a " rubbing " from weatherbeaten monuments , after others had given them up , was made to talk clearly and coherently about things that happened long ago . Schlegel knew well the pragmatic cast of the ancient Chinaman 's mind , and whereothers looked for high-flown sentiment and missed , he , in the dry light of sheer patience and practical genius , saw clearly and interpreted aright . We remember one inscription from a tablet on an old battlefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of the puzzling sentence which none other could make out . It contained the idea that , owing to the perduring stench of the field , neither the habitation of man nor work of the sculptor could be reared in the neighborhood of the great slaughter .

Sir George Otto Trevelyan , Bart , Author of ' The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay ' and ' The Early History of Charles James Fox . ' In two volumes Longmans , Green &; Co 1903 . It is twenty-three years since Sir George Trevelyan followed up his Life of Macaulay with the ' Early History of C. J. Fox . ' This volume ended with the year 1774 , and readers all over the world were looking eagerly for more of the great statesman 's life from one who had proved himself so eminently competent to write it , when it was announced that the author had determined to take up the larger topic of the ' American Revolution , ' a subject no doubt exhibiting Fox in some of his best efforts , but which , even if completed , would leave the most eventful half of his life unwritten The publication a few years ago of the first volume of the ' American Revolution , ' while confirming and increasing admiration of Sir George Trevelyan 's talents , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these volumes , that he abandoned a subject so unique to take up one which , however well he might treat it , some one else was pretty sure to take up ; and one on which we can hardly believe he has said the last word , as on Fox he might have done . With this one word of protest , we pass to the volumes themselves  --  a monument of industry , impartiality , and generosity in a most vivacious and attractive form . - The first volume carried the story of the Revolution through the evacuation of Boston The second part consists of two volumes . They begin by retrograding to the reception of the news of Lexington in England , and continue the narrative of action and opinion on both sides of the ocean to the abandonment of the Jerseys by Howe , and Washington 's establishment at Morristown early in 1777 . It will be seenthat Sir George travels almost as slowly as his uncle , and with less excuse ; for the career of Washington is a good deal better known than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish away ; but when we think of what remains to be told , we recall with apprehension what Macaulay says of Orme 's ' History of Indostan ' . " He is minute even to tediousness , so that his narrative , though one of the most authentic and picturesque in our language , is scarcely ever read . " That Sir George 's narrative is authentic as far as any book not contemporary can be , no one will question . He has extended his researches wide and deep among records ancient and modern . He is well acquainted with the " American Archives " and with Amos Farnsworth 's Diary , he is equally acquainted with Tyler and Fiske , with E. J. Lowell and C. F. Adams , jr . It would be hard to name the books he has read ; perhaps harder those he has not . If a few can be named which would have helped his narrative , it must be said at the same time that he has availed himself of many sources of information rarely studied even by Americans . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has enriched his narrative from a store of family documents . Of this mass of hardly collected and deeply studied materials he has made excellent use . He deserves the title of picturesque as much as Orme , or Macaulay himself .
