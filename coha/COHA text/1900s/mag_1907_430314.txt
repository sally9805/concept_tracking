WE are living in an age or big things . It is a creative epoch . Our perspective has broadened to such an extent that it is no longer confined by fixed geographical lines . It embraces the whole world , the undiscovered Poles not excepted . It is the day of the engineer , and in no previous period of our history has he occupied so prominent a place in national affairs as he does today . The National Treasury and the surplus of huge corporations are at his command . Unafraid , he is proceeding to cut a great gash across a continent , through which the shipping of the world may pass . Eighty millions have been appropriated this year to deepen our waterways to relieve congested traffic conditions . He has tunneled the streets of our great cities for many miles to furnish readier transportation . Thousands of miles of steel are being laid to connect new regions with the nation 's markets . We are today launched upon a policy of internal expansion which many have declared to be the most paternal ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens and making homes for them , and is loaning it as a father to a son ? on long time , without interest . On June 17 , 1902 , Congress enacted a law known as the National Reclamation Act . Briefly , this act provided that the money received from the sales of public lands in fourteen arid states and two territories should be used as a reclamation fund for the construction of the works necessary to irrigate arid lands in those states and territories . By wise provisions in the law this fund was made revolving . As soon as any work is completed the owners of land benefited must begin to return the cost thereof , payments being made in ten annual installments without interest . The money so returned  | can be used over and over again in the construction of other works . To eliminate speculation and to put a stop to the greedy acquisition of large areas , it was further provided that no man could own more than 16o acres under any of these works , and such owner must actually reside upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broadly paternal , yet it is so thoroughly common sense and business-like that the wonder is it was not adopted long ago . With the examples of other nations in similar works constantly before us for years , it is well nigh inexplicable that our nation , the most progressive in the world , should have been so tardy in initiating the work upon which it finally engaged less than five years ago . THE PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION WILL RECLAIM AN AREA EQUAL TO THE TOTAL ACREAGE IN CROPS OF CONNECTICUT , MASSACHUSETTS , NEW HAMPSHIRE , AND FLORIDA The full importance of national reclamation is obtainable only by comparison . The twenty-five projects upon which the government is now engaged , when developed to their full extent , will add 3,198,000 acres to the crop-producing area of the United States . Add to these thirteen other projects which are held in abeyance , pending the completion of the first mentioned , and which will reclaim 3,2 70,000 acres , and we have a grand total of 6,468,000 acres . This enormous area today is practically worthless . It returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor to the nation to which it largely belongs . It is utilized only a short period in each year for grazing nomadic herds that are driven over it . Potentially , it is the richest , the most fertile and productive land in the world , and is capable of supporting in comfort an agricultural population as dense as can be found in any of the older settled parts of our country . By expending $6o,000,000 on the 25 engineering works now in process of construction , the Reclamation Service will reclaim 3,198,000 acres , or a cultivated area equal to the total acreage in crops in the four states of Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Florida . The diversified crops , enormous yields from irrigated lands , and the excellent prices for all farm products in the West warrant the assumption that this land will return annually an income larger than the farmers receive in the four states named . For comparison , let us say that the revenues per acre will be the same . It is apparent , then , that this area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by $6o,000,000 ; it will add $232,000,000 to the taxable property of the people ; it will furnish homes for 8o,000 families on farms and in villages and towns . The settlement of the desert will be followed , and in some instances preceded , by the construction of hundreds of miles of railroads , of electric lines , by the development of power for manufacturing and for municipal and domestic use , by a great building movement , and by innumerable investments which accompany the creation of commonwealths . All these will aggregate millions of dollars , assuring employment for thousands of skilled and unskilled laborers , and furnishing a home market for the bulk of the products of the new farms . This immense development of agriculture in the West does not menace the prosperity of the eastern and middle western farmer . Our statistics show that nearly 8o per cent of the desert crops are forage and consumed at home . The products exported are special crops , which are in no sense competitive with eastern grown . The desert 's cereal crops do not come east . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barley , for the various forest products , and for the output of western coal mines . Western development means additional markets for eastern manufactured products ? cotton , woolens , steel and hardware , boots and shoes , and the high-grade household commodities . With the enormous increase  | in the demand for such articles , the manufacturers will be compelled to enlarge their plants and add to the number of their employees . Such increase will add to the demand for home-grown crops and assures the continued prosperity of the eastern farmers . Thus we see that the eastern farmer and manufacturer are both directly concerned in the work of reclaiming the great American desert . Aside from the fact that the limitless West is the safety-valve against the threatened overcrowding of the East , it is also the treasure chest from which the East may draw fat revenue for all the years to come . $I , 000,000 EXPENDED EACH MONTH Although only four years have passed since the enactment of the law , the engineers are today employed upon the construction of twenty-five great projects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a million dollars a month . Three of the great projects are practically completed , and six more will be in service this summer . On many of the projects the work goes forward night and day , and the rate of progress is strikingly at variance with that at which government work usually proceeds . There is , of course , a reason for this . The Reclamation Service is absolutely divorced from politics ; it is a business organization and its motive is to build engineering works and to erect an empire in the desert . The reclamation fund available for the 25 projects now under way amounts approximately to $33,000,000 . Before these are completed it will be about $41,000 , - 000 . When this has been expended , 1,400,000 acres will have been reclaimed and will begin to return annually $4,000,000 to the fund . The vast area in these projects and their remoteness from each other make it impossible in one short paper to describe all of these works . SALT RIVER PROJECT IN ARIZONA Let us go in fancy to the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land whose civilization was old when Rome was in the glory of its youth ? Arizona . " In that weird land , where the wild winds blowing Sweep with a wail o'er the plains of the dead , A ruin , ancient beyond all knowing , Rears its head . " Antiquity is associated so seldom with things American that most of us confess to an extraordinary interest in the prehistoric on this continent . Owing to the absence of decipherable hieroglyphics and to the few poorly preserved examples of aboriginal workmanship which our ancient Americans have left us , an atmosphere of impenetrable mystery envelops the age in which they lived . Today their ruins stand alone in the desert , and the passage of time is marked in the crumbling walls or in the ancient canals , choked with the wind-swept drift of centuries . They were the first American irrigators and their works evidence no small skill in engineering . The modern canals of today follow closely the line of their ancient ditches . A splendid compliment to the intelligence of this prehistoric race is being paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they dwelt for the initiation of one of the greatest irrigation works ever attempted . No national work under the Reclamation Act has attracted more general interest and none has been more widely advertised by the press than the Salt River project , surrounding the city of Pheenix , Arizona . While the engineering features are stupendous and spectacular , the charm and mystery of the region in which the work is going on appeal even more strongly to the visitor . This is the land of uncorrupted distances , of opal-tinted landscapes and perpetual sunshine . Its atmosphere is one of enchantment and its silence holds a voice of the vanished past .  | In the midst of a vast stretch of desert a wonderful oasis has risen , its vivid green standing out in marked contrast with the dusty plain and the distant purple hills . Three fair cities lie in the heart of this emerald island ? Phmnix , Tempe , and Mesa . Their future growth and prosperity depend upon the success of the work now going on under the supervision of the Reclamation Service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and day to make that growth and prosperity enduring . Let us now enter the automobile and speed away to those distant mountains , where the silence of ages is being broken by man 's machinery . It is early dawn , and eastward the summits of the hills are glowing richly red , their western faces covered with a soft , nebulous veil that trembles in the morning breeze . For half a dozen miles we traverse a region of almost tropical luxuriance , where there is a riot of vegetation . Then , with a suddenness that is almost startling , we enter upon a wide expanse of desolation wherein the giant cactus , the gnarled and distorted mesquite , and the dusty green sage-brush are prominent features of the landscape . Every living thing bears mute evidence of a fierce battle for life . For twenty miles the government road stretches out across the plain to the foot of Superstition Mountains , which stand like desert sentinels , immutable and everlasting . Entering the mountain area , the government road winds by easy grades up the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marvelous colors . For twenty miles we journey see-saw fashion , up and down , through a region  | of scenic wonders , until we reach the summit of Fish Creek Hill . The panorama spread out before us is indescribably beautiful . To the northward the Mazatzal Range culminates in the famous landmark , Four Peaks , 8,000 feet high . Below us a sheer thousand feet lies Frasier 's Road-house , where we shall spend the night . The dwellings and stables look like toy houses . Along the edge of that dizzy cliff the road has been literally carved from solid rock . It would be simply terrifying but for the broad and comfortable roadway which we pass over . At the lower end , where Fish Creek emerges from a narrow box canyon , we cross a substantial bridge 5o feet above the stream , and then descend to the little flat on which the road-house is built . The comfortable quarters , the excellent meals , and the inspiring scenery make this night one of delightful memory . We have slept in a canyon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canyon of the Colorado . The climb out of Fish Creek flat to the government camp above Roosevelt is a repetition of the experience of the day before . Great cuts have been made through solid rock ; at places we skirt the edge of dark chasms , at others the road seems to terminate in blind canyons . After a long swing on the brink of a profound gorge we reach the top of the mountain through which the Salt River has cut its way . Here is another inspiring view . Below us the river , like a silver thread , rushes through a deep and shadowy canyon . Looking down through a confusion of cables and wires , we see an army of men at work far below the river bed , laving massive rocks two and three tons in weight in lavers of cement . The bedrock has been swept as clean as the floor of a careful housewife 's kitchen , and every rock that goes into that structure is washed thoroughly before being set in place . Watchful inspectors hover about , carefully safeguarding every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TORN DOWN Eastward and northward is a broad flat , across which the Salt River and Tonto Creek flow , to mingle their waters just above the mouth of the gorge . In the foreground is the bustling city of Roosevelt ? a city of transient renown , for it was actually built to be torn down ? a city well lighted , with its own water supply from distant mountain springs , with schools and stores ? all doomed to extinction in a short year . On our right the government cement mill gives noisy evidence that Uncle Sam is a manufacturer . Night and day his plant is grinding out the best cement ever made , and ere the mill has finished its work 240,000 barrels will have been used in the clam . The skips swing ceaselessly back and forth on cables from the mill down to the darn site , carrying alternate loads of cement and sand , the latter from the rock crusher just below the mill . Several hundred feet below where we stand , in a niche cut in the solid walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 220 feet by means of a tunnel and supplying 4,000 horse-power for all purposes . It operates the mill , sand crusher , the machinery for the contractor , and affords electric light for everybody . Its supply comes from a power canal 17 miles in length , in many places lined with cement . It is a sight never to be forgotten , to stand on this cliff at night and through the myriads of electric globes watch the busy toilers laying the huge blocks of One of the world 's greatest dams is building . A beautiful curve of masonry is slowly rising in the river bed , a masonry monolith against which a turbulent river will beat itself into stillness , its foam and spume lost in a deep lake 25 miles long and 2 miles wide . In that lake the town of Roosevelt will be submerged 200 feet deep . A quarter of a century ago this particular region was the haunt of Geronimo  | and his band of murderous Apaches . The big chief has been exiled , but his people still live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer turned missionary and held a pow-wow with the Indians . Such was his eloquence that several hundred Indians went on the government pay-roll . They proved to be good workers and were in no small degree responsible for the prompt construction of the Roosevelt road . Later on they were tried on canal work and on concrete mixing , and were not found wanting . While the head of the family toiled for the government , the squaw in her wickiup wove wonderful baskets , which found ready sale in the camps and in Roosevelt . Poor Lo as a worker is no longer a joke . He has discarded the gay-colored robe , the paint and feathers , and in sweat-shop juniper and blue jeans is earning his living by the sweat of his brow . What justice could be more poetic than that his arrows and hatchets should be turned into picks and shovels and his labor utilized to bring the precious water to the land which he had so often enriched with the blood of the white man . In 1908 Roosevelt darn will be completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be Boo feet long . It will create the largest artificial lake in the world and will furnish 200,000 acres of land with water . The cost of the entire project will be approximately $6,500,000 . On several of the projects the work has reached the point where the human interests involved overshadow in importance the engineering features . The most intensely interesting period in the work of reclamation is at hand ? the landless man has been brought to the manless land . It has been well said that he who helps to establish the security of the  | irrigable home will also help to establish that greater , that composite home , the United States of America . Our nation is indeed affected by this problem which the Reclamation Service is on the eve of solving , for on the success of the irrigable home rests today the prosperity and stability of more than one western state . A REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION In March , 1903 , a party of surveyors ran their lines over a vast , unbroken , uninhabited plain in southern Idaho , comprising 150,000 acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . After the surveyors , came the engineers . In turn they were followed by the contractors . The desert 's awful stillness was broken by the shrill whistle of engines , by the creaking of giant cranes , and the voices of hundreds of laborers . Attracted by these evidences that Uncle Sam was about to do battle . with the desert , scores of home-seekers flocked to the scene and began to erect : their homes in the desert . The transformation which has followed the advent : of that little band of surveyors is so remarkable that one is led to believe that Uncle Sam , in the role of Aladdin , rubbed the magic lamp and the desert vanished . In 1904 the Minidoka project had not a single inhabitant ; today it contains more than 4,000 people ; it has three thriving towns , a railway , schools , newspapers . Every eighty acres of that vast desert has a dwelling upon it with a family living in it . Lands only a short time ago counted as worthless are now valued at from $40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract was let for the con- struction of the principal engineering work , a rock-fill dam . This structure was located about 8 miles southwest of Minidoka , at a point where the channel of the river has been crossed by recurring lava flows . A ridge of lava probably extended entirely across the river channel at this point and the river cut a narrow way through it . The purposes of the darn are mainly control , diversion , and power development . In constructing the dam the diversion channel was first built . Two separate masses of fill , the upper one of earth and the lower one of rock , about 15o feet apart , were extended across the river from shore to shore . As the natural channel was thus gradually closed , the water was backed up and compelled to flow through the diversion channel . The line of rock-fill was deposited from a cable-way , the earth-fill being put in place by means of clump-cars and trestle-work . Between the two masses of fill a concrete core wall , built up from bed-rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates each 5 feet wide by 7 feet high , and the controlling works contain five gates each 8 by 12 feet . The dam is So feet high and 625 feet long ; on top it is 25 feet wide . Its volume is about 190,000 cubic yards. , It was completed in September , 1906 . The natural conditions are favorable for the development of power , and from 11,000 to 30,000 horse-power will be available for the people who dwell under the project , an asset the value of which can scarcely be overestimated . The canal system , to be in operation this year , is more than loo miles in length and will cover 6o,000 acres . THE WONDERFUL YAMMA VALLEY Redlands and Riverside of southern California have their rivals in the Northwest in the wonderful Yakima Valley , in Washington . Those who find the perpetual summer of the Southwest too enervating will be attracted to this remarkable region , which has so recently come into prominence by reason of its surprising fertility and the diversity and superior quality of its products . Naturally this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under way which when fully concluded will bring approximately 400,000 acres under ditch . The crop yields in this valley are almost incredible , and , as a result , agricultural lands have as high average value here as anywhere in this country , California orange lands not excepted . Two thousand dollars per acre for orchard land is not an uncommon price . We need not wonder at such sales when these apple orchards frequently yield 1,470 boxes per acre , which sell for $1.25 per box , or $1,737 per acre . The hay crop is an important one . The valley potatoes bring an annual income of $1,000,000 to the farmers . Hops yield from $300 to $600 per acre . Yakima apples and hops sell well in the New York markets , and are exported in large quantities . The Yakima project is in several units which ultimately will be combined in one great system , embracing 400,000 acres , every acre of which , with an assured water supply , will be worth not less than $1co . The government 's plans involve an expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams to hold hack the flood waters of the Yakima drainage in several mountain lakes . Our desert region is the only section of our imperial country wherein there is an equality of opportunity . In no other part of the nation are the rewards for individual effort more certain and constant . When these facts are more fully realized , the wisdom of President Roosevelt 's policy of safeguarding and conserving this vast estate for the people will be appreciated . America has furnished a safety valve against the overcrowding of the great centers of population in the Old World for 5o years . Is it not about time to look to our problem and prepare against the day when there shall be a glut of population in our own cities ? Thoughtful men are predicting a popula- tion of 200,000,000 in 1950 and 300,000 , - 000 at the close of the century . How shall we take care of this vast increase ? There is a land hunger even now that is hard to satisfy . Many thousands of our best people are flocking to Canada every year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every acre of our remaining public domain should be reserved for the bona fide homeseeker . WORK IN NEW MEXICO In the range of resources , in the charm and healthfulness of her climate , and in the fertility of her soil , New Mexico typifies the arid region . It has been found possible for the Reclamation Service to undertake the construction of three projects within her borders . The greatest of these , the Rio Grande project , is especially interesting , as it involves international and interstate features in unusual combination . The project is today the subject of a treaty with Mexico , and our Congress has just done tardy justice to a friendly neighbor by appropriating $1,000,000 in recognition of a debt long overdue . The Rio Grande Valley is rich in historical incident . Long before the Puritan fathers landed upon the bleak and inhospitable shores of New England , thrifty husbandmen irrigated the fertile bottoms along the lower valley in New Mexico , Texas , and Old Mexico . Primitive as were their methods of agriculture , they sufficed to sustain a dense population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal system of farming , with homes in the pueblos and small cultivated areas near by , is essentially being adopted by our later civilization as best adapted to desert conditions . It removes the isolation of the lonely ranch , makes possible social and  | educational advantages , and tends to the economical and most profitable methods of farming . Small farms , carefully and scientifically tilled , make compact communities , which enjoy graded schools and the luxuries and comforts of towns with the freedom and pure air of the country . The principal feature of this project is the Engle dam , about Too miles north of El Paso , Texas . It is to be a huge structure of masonry 255 feet high , 400 feet long on the bottom , and 1,150 feet long on the top . This dam will impound 2,000,000 acre-feet of water , or nearly double the amount stored by the Roosevelt dam . It will check the greatest flood ever known on the Rio Grande and will supply 180,000 acres in New Mexico , Texas , and Old Mexico . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars of this amount has already been appropriated by Congress to meet the proportionate cost of the works required to irrigate the lands in Mexico . These lands were formerly irrigated by canals taken from the river in Old Mexico , but the extensive diversions in Colorado and New Mexico finally rendered these canals useless , and the land went back to desert . The Hondo project , near Roswell , New Mexico , now almost completed , provides for the storage of the flood flow of the Rio Hondo in a natural depression and supplies 10,000 acres of land . The Carlsbad project was undertaken by the Service to save from destruction the property of settlers near Carlsbad . A great flood destroyed the irrigation works in the valley , and the valuable orchards and cultivated fields would have returned to desert but for the coming of the government . About 20,000 acres are embraced in this project , which involves an expenditure of $650,000 , and will be completed in 1908 . It will irrigate a considerable acreage next spring . IN MONTANA AND WYOMING There will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana next summer , when the Huntley project is formally opened . About 35,000 acres are involved in this project and the lands are exceedingly desirable . As this project is in the ceded portion of the Crow Indian reservation , no settlers have been permitted to locate thereon and the formal opening next summer promises to be somewhat spectacular . Across the line , in Wyoming , is the great Shoshone project , involving several difficult engineering feats . In the narrowest part of the Shoshone Canyon a wonderful dam is beginning to rise above the river bed . In height it tops every other structure of the kind in the world . It will be a narrow wedge , 85 feet across the bottom , 200 feet long on top , and 310 feet high , and will block the canyon . To reach the dam site it was necessary to construct a road through an inaccessible gorge . On this road are several tunnels through rock cliffs , and for several miles the road is in rock cuts . It opens a new and very attractive scenic route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody , Wyoming , a diversion dam is being constructed in the river , and the stream is to be diverted into a great tunnel three miles long , passing under an elevated plateau . From the lower end of the tunnel canals extending all over the valley will carry the water to 18o,000 acres . TUNNELING A MOUNTAIN-A WORLD 'S RECORD The Uncompahgre project , in Colorado , in many respects has presented more difficult problems than any other work undertaken by the Service . The engineers from the very first step have encountered trouble . The topography of the country is probably the roughest in the United States . Here was a canyon through which no man had ever passed . It was necessary to explore it in order to locate a site for a tunnel . An engineer and an assistant made the attempt , and after incredible hardships succeeded . The topographers who followed to complete  | the surveys experienced unheard-of trials , but they too accomplished their task . Then a road into this frightful gorge was constructed ? a remarkable road , with grades out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery was brought in and a power plant was installed . River Portal became a village with a store , a school , a public reading-room , machine shops , cottages , and a hospital . Three crews of men , each working 8 hours a day , were set to work in the canyon , driving a tunnel under a mountain 2,000 feet high . This tunnel is to furnish an underground waterway , with cross-section of by 11/ feet and nearly 6 miles long , to carry the waters of the Gunnison River into the Uncompahgre Valley . Simultaneously other crews began the same work on the other side of the mountain , and night and day the drills were kept boring into the rock and shale , each crew vying with the other to achieve a record . For a time work was carried on from four headings . The tunnel has been driven 18,000 feet , or 31/2 miles , to date . A world 's record has been made , 823 feet having been driven in one month . The records on the Simplon Tunnel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang of laborers drove over 7,500 feet in one year . Gas , cave-ins , and subterranean springs have all interposed difficulties requiring the utmost care in the prosecution of the work . While the excavation was going on , many miles of canal have been dug , some of which are in exceedingly unfavorable country . The Uncompahgre Valley has a general elevation of 5,000 feet , but owing to the lofty ranges of mountains which surround it , the climate is mild and equable . The soil of the valley is of unusual fertility , and this section is noted for its fine fruits . AN INTERNATIONAL , COMPLICATION Up in northern Montana , close to the International Boundary , the engineers of the Reclamation Service are wrestling with what is known as the Milk River project . One of the problems on this project is to divert the waters of the stream which rises in this country , but empties into Hudson Bay , and utilize the same on lands in one of our own valleys . There are some rather delicate international features connected with this scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust . Briefly , the plans provide for the taking of the waters of Saint Mary River across the low divide into the North Fork of Milk River . Milk River rises in Montana , flows northward across the boundary into Canada , continuing in that country for zoo miles , and then turns southward into Montana again , emptying finally into the Missouri River . Our Canadian neighbors are already using the waters of both of these streams for irrigation and an endeavor is being made to settle the questions of water rights . The first work on this project will be the construction of a dam in Saint Mary River near Lower Saint Mary Lake and a canal 37 miles long to carry the water into Milk River . Considerable work has been done on the canal , and on this work a number of Blackfeet Indians have been employed . This region is one of unusual scenic beauty . The mountains are rugged , of great elevation , and contain a number of the largest glaciers in the United States . There are several beautiful lakes and waterfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation project is located partly in southwestern Oregon and partly in northern California . This is called the Klamath project , and involves problems of irrigation and drainage in unusual combinations . It is proposed to drain partly two lakes and to irrigate their exposed beds from water drawn from Upper Klamath Lake . About 18o,000 acres of land will be reclaimed by this project , some zo , 000 acres of which will be watered next spring . The Yuma project . which embraces  | lands in California and Arizona , has been the subject of a presidential message to this Congress . This is the region often called the " Egypt of America , " and in climate , soil , and crops it bears a singular resemblance to the fertile valley of the Nile . The government is engaged upon the construction of a great darn across the Colorado River about 12 miles north of Yuma . This structure is of the India weir type and is the first of the kind ever attempted in this country . It will have a length of 4,780 feet across stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream will have a length of 247 feet . It will be a great mass of masonry resting on the sandy bottom of the river , as no bed-rock was found in the channel at this point . The weight of this structure will be 600,000 tons . Water will be diverted by means of canals connecting with both ends of the darn and the area irrigated will be approximately 90,000 acres . When irrigated this will probably be the most productive region on this continent . Harvests are practically continuous throughout the year , and the yields from well-irrigated lands are enormous . 1267 MILES OF CANALS ALREADY CONSTRUCTED A summation of the work of the Reclamation Service to January I , 1907 , shows that it has dug 1,267 miles of canals , or nearly the distance from Washington to Omaha . Some of these canals carry whole rivers , like the Truckee River , in Nevada , and the North Platte , in Wyoming . The tunnels excavated are 47 in number , and have an aggregate length of 9 1/2 miles . The Service has erected 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minidoka dam in Idaho , 8o feet high and 65o feet long . It has completed 67o headworks , flumes , etc . It has built 376 miles of wagon road in mountainous country and into heretofore inaccessible regions . It has erected and in operation 727 miles of telephones . Its own cement mill has manufactured 70,000 barrels of cement , and the purchased amount is 312,000 barrels . Its own sawmills have cut 3,036 , - 000 feet , board measure , of lumber , and 6,54o,000 feet have been purchased . The surveying parties of the Service have  | completed topographic surveys covering 10,970 square miles , an area greater than the combined areas of Massachusetts and Rhode Island . The transit lines had a length of 18,900 linear miles , while the level lines run amount to 24,218 miles , or nearly sufficient to go around the earth . The diamond drillings for dam sites and canals amount to 47,515 feet , or more than 9 miles . Today the Service owns and has at work 1,154 horses and mules . It operates 9 locomotives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationary engines , and 27 steam engines . It has constructed and is operating 5 electric light plants . This work has been carried on with the following force : Classified service , 380 , including Washington office ; laborers employed directly by the government , 3,50o ; laborers employed by contractors , 6,100 , or a total of all forces of 10,000 . The expenditures now total about $1,000,000 per month . The excavations of earth and rock amount to 33,000,000 cubic yards , or about onefourth the estimated yardage of the Panama Canal . As a result of the operations of the Reclamation Service , eight new towns have been established , Too miles of branch railroads have been constructed , and 10,000 people have taken up their residence in the desert . POTENTIALITIES OE THE DESERT You can not fix the possibilities of this land of silence and sunshine . Here the harvests are always assured . Here the farmer can estimate by a mathematical calculation the rewards for his labors.  | The influence of its extended horizon and its true perspective may be potential in character molding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prevails where people are over . crowded and underfed , the desert offers the uplift of unmeasured distances , the perpetual sunshine and the individual home of contentment and prosperity . May not these develop new systems of  | ethics and morals , leading us back from the material to the spiritual into ways of gentleness and simple living ? In this empire now asleep , awaiting the coming of the builder , perhaps the dreams of Plato and Socrates , who imbibed their splendid imagery , their stately rhetoric , and their sublime metaphor from the desert , may be revived .  |
