 | The " Breaking " of Baby 's Will By A Mother A " human document , " this , if ever there was one . This , one of the prize-winning papers in our Corporal Punishment contest , was blurred with the tears of its author . IN the hope that my experience may , perhaps , become the stepping-stone to better things for some poor , miserable , ignorant young mother who thinks , as I did , that she knows it all , I am going to open the door of a dark closet in my heart : a still and sacred room where lie shattered hopes and sweetest memories , tinged though they are with the bitterness of what might have been if one had only known . I was a school teacher . A successful one , too . One who was noted for " good discipline . " This , I say gratefully , was a gift . I " had a way with the children , " and succeeded in getting good government without having to use extreme measures . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporal punishment , and though it happened fifteen years ago , I can not remember it to this day , without a flush of hot shame covering my body . The child seemed to be stubborn , and with all my tact in managing , I could not discover that it was a natural stupidity , hightened by confusion and diffidence , which made her refuse to read , or rather made it impossible for her to do so . I considered her stubborn and thought it my duty to rid her of the fault . I did not understand her nature and it did not enter my comprehension that I should make it my business to study it . Instead , I whipped her . Not severely , but with a little switch , and just enough ; as I understand now , to confuse and antagonize . It is sufficient to say that I never had any success with that child , and I doubt if she has forgiven me to this day , because of the injustice . What she needed was a little individual treatment , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how slight , kindness and love . What she got was punishment for she knew not what , a bewildered sense of injustice in teachers and schools , confusion of ideas , fear of ridicule , and nobody knows what lasting hurt to her mental nature . I can never feel grateful enough that this was my only experience in unjust punishment as a teacher . As a parent I can not say as much . Like many another school teacher , I had many fine theories about childraising , none of them based on careful and sympathetic study of childnature , but mostly a variation of the moods and tenses of the verb " to mind . " To exact and compel obedience seemed to my untutored mind the acme of the aim of motherhood . Well , I finally took all my ignorant , untried theories , considerable ill-health , and little else , for a wedding dowry , and went to be the mother of a good man 's children . The first-born was a beautiful child , with the big , sad , wistful eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why it was , but I think I know at last . When the baby was about a year old he began to develop a wonderful tenacity of purpose and determination . We called it " stubbornness " and " willfulness " and considered it our duty to break him of it . The child 's father was a good man and anxious to do the best of which he was capable for this young creature , of which he was , if possible , a shade more ignorant than I. One day the baby , when he was not quite two years old , tipped over a basket of clothespins with which he had been playing . Now . one of our finest theories was that a child should be taught , from the time that he was old enough to have playthings , to put them away , or at least pick them up when through playing . This theory I still uphold and have found practical , but there are different methods of securing its adoption . The one we first employed was not the happiest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIe , for some reason of his own and to which , possibly , he had as good a right as I had to mine , refused . He simply sat still and did n't . I whipped his hands and repeated the  | command . He refused . Then his father came in and tried his authority . We really thought the time had come when we must take severe action or be forever ruled by a despot in our own home . I still think the child should have picked up the pins , but I am also positive that had I assumed that he was ready and willing to do so ; since he had thrown them down , and with a little cheerful encouragement , he would have at once acted upon the suggestion , and thus have established a sense of the justice of restoration . As it was , his father whipped and I commanded until the poor baby was so confused , bewildered and feverish that he was quite beside himself . Finally , with little , trembling hands and sobbing breath , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , kissed and rocked and caressed him , and congratulated ourselves that we had " broken his will . " Just think of that ! To be glad that we had broken his will , his spirit . That fine , beautiful , courageous , glorious thing given by God , and broken by his parents ! They who should guard and cherish and train this same spirit , as it were , to be the mark of their handiwork in the day when it should " return to God who gave it . " When I look back upon that scene now , remember the little tear-stained swollen face . the perplexed , grieved baby eyes , the red , smarting flesh , I think the parents should have been tied to a bedpost and flogged with a cat-o ' - nine-tails . However , this all happened years ago , and yet , as I write , the beads of remorseful perspiration stand out on my forehead , and bitter , bitter tears scald my eyes , as they have many and many a time since . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant parents to the retributive " mills of the gods . " Oh , the poor first children . Suffering . not only for the pre-natal influences of ignorant parents , but serving as butt for all the experiences and experiments by which the untaught parents must learn ! He was a beautiful child , that first one of ours , and we loved him almost to idolatry , but we never lost sight of the fact that if we did not exact immediate and perfect obedience we were going to ruin him soul and body . I am not yet finding fault with the theory , but only with the manner of enforcing it . He had inherited certain undesirable family traits and tendencies that were intensely distasteful to us , and these , it seemed to us , had to be forced out . As for training beautiful tendencies in , to crowd the others out , we never thought of it . So when he did naughty little things , things often that other children taught him and of the real significance of which he was ignorant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was on the straight down-grade track to perdition , and we whipped him . We did n't know then that children often tell a lie when the truth is really the easiest . When he took a penny out of the drawer and spent it and then said another boy gave it to him , we whipped him severely . We really believed that he would be ruined if we did n't whip these faults out of him . I still believe that every indication of evil needs the most untiring and unceasing effort toward eradication , but I seriously doubt the efficacy of corporal punishment as the best method . ' Oh , poor little lamb , poor little lamb ! And poor , ignorant misguided young parents who were laying up such a harvest of woes for themselves ! Well , God was good to the little boy , and took him home where parents have learned kindlier lessons . Sometimes I wondered , and often with a fierce bitterness in my heart , at the number of the first-borns who are " taken home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadder days , I do not wonder . I appreciate the mercy of a loving Father whose love so transcends that of the earthly parent . These first-born come into the world hampered and fettered with the influences of ignorant ancestors . They stay a little while and teach us the lessons for which their tender hearts and flesh have to pay the penalty ? and then God takes them home to be happy . We hope and pray that they may not forget us . Are there not some things that we would mercifully have effaced from their memory before we are again permitted to behold their faces ? It is several years now since the little boy went home . but yet if I shut my eyes I can see him clasping his little hands and crying : " Oh , do n't ! do n't ! Please do n't ! I will be a good boy , now ! I will , I will ! " " Oh , Absalom , my son , my son ! Would God I had died for thee ! " Nay ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had  | known thee ! For every blow laid upon that tender flesh the angel of retribution has lashed me a hundredfold , and I yet feel my own punishment insufficient . To the end of my earthly life , however , it will continue , and always must go with me the everlasting pang of bitterness that I did not know and do differently . For every punishment of that sort laid upon him I can now devise a dozen others that would have served the purpose better , and helped him in the development of character . Now , out of these bitter and soulsaddening experiences have been forced upon me a few hard-earned truths , and the greatest of these is , that the grave danger of corporal punishment is ? injustice . It is pretty safe to say that seven out of every ten whippings are given in anger , and no person in a temper is fit to act . Ten to one if the whipping is postponed until the anger has passed , some other punishment will be devised . It is n't easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cold deliberation . His eyes are apt to embarrass you . You 're likely to feel your own overgrown size and his helplessness at that moment more keenly than usual . And it is n't pleasant to feel one 's self a bully . Yet this is the only way in which corporal punishment can be administered with any . degree of justice . There are times , to be sure , when it seems as if no other punishment would quite so well answer the purpose . But if we put self quite aside , the desire to express our irate feelings on the child 's person , is n't there something else that can be done to impress upon him the enormity of his transgression , or the lesson we desire to teach , rather than the blows we are tempted to inflict ? It takes less time and thought , to be sure , and quite often bears fruit accordingly . Have you ever given a child the privilege of choosing his own punishment ? either a whipping , or the deprivation of some beloved treat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had him prefer the whipping " to have it over with " ? Does n't this prove it to be the lesser punishment ? Something to be borne with stoically , as a necessary evil , perhaps , but forgotten the next moment in some pleasure or recreation . If , however , upon mature deliberation , it seems expedient to apply the rod , let it , by all the regard you have for your child 's self-respect , be done in the privacy of his own room , and not even hinted at before other children . There seems to he a strain of cruelty in the make-up of some children that delights in another 's punishment . If a child must be punished in this way , if every other expedient has been tried and found wanting and it seems that he will learn the desired lesson in no other way ( for let it be understood that punishment is given for no other reason than reform ) , then shut him up in one room and yourself in another , until your anger has had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm face , a prayerful and sorry heart , and a dignifie demeanor , go to him and do the jo thoroughly and well . Keep him closeted until the fierceness of his emotion has worn away . Then take him out , bathe and clothe him afresh , and keep him with you . Talk to him not about his offense ? you have punished him for that ? let it drop . Cheerfully expect it not to happen again . Be kind and loving to him and prove by your actions that he has grieved you . Children have n't much faith in the trite plea of a parent that a whipping hurts him more than it does the child . They are apt to think that you are putting yourself to a lot of unnecessary suffering . The same methods of punishment can not be employed for the younger children that might prove effectual for the older . With the littler ones too much stress should not be laid upon the offense itself . They are not conscious of the wrong and to dwell upon it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted that they are anxious to make restitution and they will accept the idea and act upon it . There is just as much danger from too lax a dealing with the child as a too severe . For a child to come to the understanding that he can do anything under the sun as his fancy dictates and go scot free , is to make him a lawless , irresponsible person , trampling recklessly on the rights and privileges of everyone with whom he comes in contact and appropriating all things to himself with an uncontrolled selfishness of spirit that will send him through the world friendless and unloved . Pius will tear baby 's stockings unless these are pinned between instead of on folds of goods .
