AN election is like a flash of lightning at midnight . You get an instantaneous photograph of what every man is doing . You see his real relation toward his government . But an election happens only once a year . Government goes on day and night . It is hard breaking down the popular fallacy that there is such a thing as " politics " governed by peculiar conditions , which must be understood and respected ; that the whole thing is a mystic avocation , run as a trade by high priests and low priests , and is remote from our daily life . Our system of party government has been developed with this end in view : to keep the control in the hands of professionals by multiplying technicalities and increasing the complexity of the rules of the game . There exists , con-linesdeleted have I known one where any other point was involved . You are a citizens ' committee . The parties offer to give you half a loaf . ' Well and good . But this is not their main object . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want to dissipate your agitation by getting you to tell the public that you are satisfied . What they hate is the standard . The war between you and them is a spiritual game of chess . They must get you to say they are right . It is their only means of retaining their power . Thus the apple of discord falls into the reform camp . Half its members take the bait . In New York city our politics have been so picturesque , the pleas of the politician so shallow , the lies demanded from the reformers s ? c obvious , that the eternal principles of the situation have been revealed in their elemental simplicity . It is just because the impulse toward better things carries no material content , ? we do not want any particular thing , but we want an improvement in everything , ? it is just because the whole movement is purely moral , that the same questions always arise . We ought not to grieve over the discussion , over the heartburn and heated argument that start from a knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against one another . The initiative of all this wholesome life is the quarrel in the executive committee of some reform body . They are no more responsible for it , they can no more avoid it , the community can no more advance to higher standards before they have had it , than a child can skate before it can walk . - The executive committee is discussing the schools . In consequence of a recent agitation the politicians have put up a candidate who will give new plumbing , even if he does steal the books , and the question is whether the School Association shall indorse this candidate . If it does , he wins . If it does not , both plumbing and books are likely to remain the prey of the other party , and the Lord knows how bad that is . The fight rages in the committee and some sincere old gentleman is prophesying typhoid . The practical question is , " Do you want good plumbing , or do you want the truth ? " You can not have both this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it knows , it will get itself laughed at , insult the candidate , and elect his opponent . If it tells the truth , it might as well run a candidate of its own as a protest and an advertisement of that truth . It can buy good plumbing with a lie , and the old gentleman thinks it ought to do so . The reformers are going to indorse the candidate , and upon their heads will be visited his theft of the books . They have sold out the little public confidence they held . Had they stood out for another year , under the practical regime which they had already endured for twenty , and had they devoted themselves to augmenting the public interest in the school question , both parties would have offered them plumbing and hooks to allay the excitement . Perhaps the parties would have relaxed their grip on the whole school system rather than meet the issue . But the Association does not understand this . It close not as yet clearly know its own mind . All this procedure , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pass through these experiences before it discovers that the shortest road to good schools is truth . A few men learn by each turn of the wheel , and these men tend to consolidate . They become a sort of school of political thought . They see that they do not care a whit more about the schools than they do about the parks ; that the school agitation is a handy way to make the citizens take notice of maladministration in all departments ; that the parties may be left to reform themselves , and to choose the most telling bid for popu- lar favor ; that the parties must do this , and will do this , in so far as the public demands it , and will not do it under any other circumstances . It is the very greatest folly in the world for an agitator to be content with a partial success . It destroys his cause . He fades instantly : You can not see him . He is become part of the corrupt and contented public . His business is to make others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always sow . Let him leave the reaping to others . There will be many of them , and their material accomplishments will be the same whether he indorses them or not . If by chance some party , some administration gives him one hundred per cent of what he demands , let him acknowledge it handsomely ; but he need not thank them . They did it because they had to , or because their conscience compelled them . In neither case was it done for him . In other words , reform is an idea that must be taken up as a whole . You do not want any specific thing . You use every issue as a symbol . Let us give up the hope of finding any simpler way out of it . Let us take up the burden at its heaviest end , and acknowledge that nothing but an increase of personal force in every American can change our politics . It is curious that this course , which is the shortest cut to the millennium , should be met with the reproach that it puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the imagination of people who are dealing with an unfamiliar subject . We have to learn its principles . We know that what we really want is all of virtue ; but it seems so unreasonable to claim this that we try to buy it piecemeal , ? item a schoolhouse , item four parks ; and with each gain comes a sacrifice of principle , disintegration , discouragement . Fools , if you had asked for all , you would have had this and more . We are defeated by compromise , because no matter how much we may de- ceive ourselves into thinking that good government is an aggregate of laws and parks , this is n ? t true . Good government is the outcome of private virtue , and virtue is one thing , a unit , a force , a mode of motion . It can not pass through a nonconductor of selfishness at any point . Compromise is loss : first , because it stops the movement , and kills energy ; second , because it encourages the illusion that the wooden schoolhouse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some hundreds of school children do get housed six months before they would have been housed otherwise . But this is like cashing a draft for a thousand pounds with a dish of oatmeal . We have perhaps followed in the wake of some little reform movement , and it has left us with an insight into the relation between private opinion and public occurrences . We have really found out two things : first , that , in order to have better government , the talk and private intelligence upon which it rests must be going forward all the time ; and second , that the indivickial conscience , intelligence , or private will is always set free by the same process , to wit , by the telling of truth . The identity between public and private life reveals itself the instant a man adopts the plan of indiscriminate truth-telling . He unmasks batteries and discloses wires at every dinner party ; he sees practical politics in every law office , and social influence in every convention , and wherever lie is , he suddenly finds himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forces . Let him blurt out his opinion . Instantly there follows a little flash of reality . The shams drop , and the lines of human influence , the vital currents of energy , are disclosed . The only difference between a reform movement , so called , and the private act of any man who desires to better conditions is that the private man sets one drawing-room in a ferment by speaking his mind or by cutting his friend , and the agitator sets 30 Between Elections . ten thousand in a ferment by attacking the age . As a practical matter the conduct of politics depends upon the dinner-table talk of men who are not in politics at all . For instance , there is a public excitement about Civil Service Reform . A law is passed and is being evaded . If the governor is to set it up again he must be sustained by the public . They must follow and understand the situation or the official is helpless . Government is carried on from moment to moment by the people . The executive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? We do not . We are half-hearted . To lend power to his hand we shall have to be strong men . If we now stood ready to denounce him for himself falling short by the breadth of a hair of his whole duty , our support when we gave it would be worth having . But we are starchless and deserve a starchless service . What did you find out at the last meeting of the Library Committee ? You found out that Commissioner Hopkins 's nephew was in the piano business . Hence the commissioner 's views on the music question . Repeat it to the first man you meet in the street , and bring it up at the next meeting of the committee . You did not think you had much influence hi town politics and hardly knew how to begin . Yet the town seems to have no time for any other subject than your attack on the commissioner . From this point on you begin to understand conditions . Every man in town reveals his real character and Iris real relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats you . You are beginning to get near to something real and something interesting . There is no one in the United States , no matter how , mall a town he lives in , or how inconspicuous he or she is , who does not have three invitations a week to enter practical politics by such a door as this . It makes no difference whether he regards himself as a scientific man studying phenomena , or a saint purifying society ; he will become both . There is no way to study sociology but this . The books give no hint of what the science is like . They are written by men who do not know the world , but who go about gleaning information instead of trying experiments . The first discovery we make is that the worst enemy of good government is not our ignorant foreign voter , but our educated domestic railroad president , prominent business man , our leadour pi ing lawyer . If there is any truth in the optimistic belief that our standards are now going up , we shall soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not note our increase of virtue so much ' by seeing more crooks in Sing Sing as by seeing fewer of them in the drawing-rooms . You can acquire more knowledge of American politics by attacking in open talk a political lawyer of social standing than you can in a year of study . These backstair men are in every Bar Association and every Reform Club . They are the agents who supervise the details of corruption . They run between the capitalist , the boss , and the public official . They know as fact what every one else knows as inference . They are the priestly class of commerce , and correspond to the intriguing ecclesiastics in periods of church ascendency . Some want money , some office , some mere power , others want social prominence ; and their art is to play off inter-. est against interest and advance themselves . As the president of a social club , I have a power which I can use against my party boss , or for him . If he can count upon me to serve him at need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish myself as a reformer . The most dependable of these confidence men ( for they betray nobody and are universally used and trusted ) can amass money and stand in the forefront of social life ; and now and then one of them is made an // archbishop or a foreign minister . They are indeed the figureheads of the age , the essence of all the wickedness and degradation of our times . So long as such men enjoy public confidence we shall remain as we are . They must be deposed in the public mind . These gentlemen and their attorneys are the weakest point in the serried ranks of iniquity . They are weak because they have social ambition , and the place to reach them is in their clubs . They are the best possible object lessons , because everybody knows them . Social punishment is the one cruel reality , the one terrible weapon , the one judgment against which lawyers can not protect a man . It is as silent as theft , and it raises the cry of " Stop thief ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age covers itself with the illusion of charity , and asks in the name of Christ that no one 's feelings be hurt . But there is not in the New Testament any hint ' that hypocrites are to be treated with charity . This class is so intrenched on all sides that the enthusiasts can not touch them . Their elbows are interlocked ; they sit cheek by jowl with virtue . They are rich ; they possess the earth . How shall we strike them ? Very easily . They are so soft with feeding on politic lies that they drop dead if you give them a dose of ridicule in a drawing-room . Denunciation is well enough , but laughter is the true ratsbane for hypocrites . If you set off a few jests the air is changed . The men themselves can not laugh or be laughed at , for nature 's revenge has given them masks for faces . You may see a whole roomful of them crack with pain because they can not laugh . They are angry , and do not speak . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure for this both in politics and social life is the same , ? hardihood . Give them raw truth . They think they will die . Their friends call you a murderer . Four thousand ladies and eighty bank directors brought vinegar and brown paper to Low when he was attacked , and Roosevelt posed as a martyr because it was said up and down that he acted the part of a selfish politician . What humbug ! How is it that all these things grow on the same root , ? fraud , cowardice , formality , sentimentalism , and a lack of humor ? Why do people become so solemn when they are making a deal , and so angry when they are defending it ? The righteous indignation expended in protecting Roosevelt would have foanded a church . The whole problem of better government is a question of how to get people to stop simpering and saying " After you " to cant . A is an aristocrat . B is a boss . C is a candidate . D is a distiller . E is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inure respectable than this chipper concern that all shall go well . Is not this politics ? Yes , and the very essence of it . Ts not the exposure of it practical reform ? How easily the arrow goes in ! A does not think you should confound him with B , nor E with C. Each is a reformer when he looks to the right , and a scamp as seen from the left . What is their fault ? Collusion . " But A means so well ! " They all mean well . Let us not confound the gradations of their virtue , but can we call any one an honest man who knowingly consorts with thieves ? This they all do . Let us declare it . Their resentment at finding themselves classed together drives the wedge into the clique . Remember , too , that there is no such thing as abstract truth . You must talk facts , you must name names , you must impute motives . You must say what is in your mind . It is the only means you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Innuendo will not do . Nobody minds innuendo . We live and breathe nothing else . If you are not strong enough to face the issue in private life , do not dream that you can do anything for public affairs . This , of course , means fight , not to-morrow , but now . It is only in the course of conflict that any one can come to understand the system , the habit of thought , the mental condition , out of which all Jur evils arise . The first difficulty is to see the evils clearly ; and when we do see them , it is like fighting an atmosphere to contend against them . They are so universal and omnipresent that you have no terms to name them by . We must burn a disinfectant . We have observed thus far that no question is ever involved in practical agitation except truth-telling . So long as a man is trying to tell the truth his remarks will contain a margin which other people will regard as mystifying and irritating exaggeration . It is this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate he is , the less he exaggerates , the more he will excite people . It is only by the true part of what is said that the interest is roused . No explosion follows a lie . The awakening of the better feelings of the individual man is not only the immediate but the ultimate end of all politics . Nor need we be alarmed at any collateral results . No one has ever succeeded in drawing any valid distinction between positive and negative educational work , except this : that in so far as a man is positive himself he does positive work . It is necessary to destroy reputations when they are lies . Peace be to their ashes . But war and fire until they be ashes . This is positive and constructive work . You can not state your case without using popular illustrations ; and in clearing the ground for justice and mercy some little great man gets shown up as a make-believe . This is constructive work . It is impossible to do harm to reform unless you are taking some course which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great outcry is made upon occasions when men are refusing to take such a course . This is due to the hypnotism of self-interest . " Do n't wake us up ! " they cry ; " we can not stand the agony of it , " and the rising energy with which they speak wakes other sleepers . In the early stages of any new idea the only advertising it gets is denunciation . This is so much better than silence that one may hail it as the dawn . You must speak till you draw blood . The agitators have always understood this . Such men as Wendell Phillips were not extravagant . They were practical men . Their business was to get heard . They used vitriol , but they were dealing with the hide of the rhinoceros . If you look at the work of the antislavery people by the light of what they were trying to do , you will find that they had a very clear understanding of their task . The reason of some of them canted a little from the strain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their contemporaries that we may claim them as respectable human beings . They were the rock on which the old politics split . They were a new force . As soon as they had gathered head enough to affect political issues they broke every public man at the North by forcing him to take sides . There is not a man of the era whom they did not shatter . Finally their own leaders got into public life , and it was not till then that the new era began . The same thing is happening to-day . It is the function of the reformer to crack up any public man who dodges time issue of corruption , or who tries to ride two horses by remaining a straight party man and shouting reform . This is no one 's fault . It is a natural process . It is fate . Some fall on one side of the line , and some on the other . One gets the office and the next loses it , but oblivion yawns for all of them . There is no cassia that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing that it lies in the power of the human mind to remember . Why is it that Calhoun 's // intellect is fresh and strong , but he must live . How conies it that the country is full of maimed human beings , of cynics and feeble good men , and outside of this no form of life except the diabolical intelligence of pure business ? How to make yourself needed : this is the sycophant 's problem , and why should we expect a young American to act differently from a young Spaniard at the court of Philip II . ? He must get on . He goes into a law office , and if he is offended at its dishonest practices he can not speak . He soon accepts them . Thereafter he can not see them . He goes into a newspaper office . The same . A banker 's , a merchant 's , a dry - goods shop . What has happened to these fellows at the end of three years , that their minds seem to be drying up ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more uninteresting from year to year . Is there something in trade that desiccates and flattens out , that turns men into dried leaves at the age of forty ? Certainly there is . It is not due to trade , but to intensity of self-seeking combined with narrowness of occupation . If I had to make my way at the court of Queen Elizabeth , I should need more kinds of wits and more knowledge of human nature than in the New York button trade . No doubt I should be a preoccupied , cringing , and odious sort of person at a feudal festivity , but I should be a fascinating man of genius compared to John H. Painter , who at the age of thirty is making fifteen thousand dollars a year by keeping his mouth shut and attending to business . Put a pressure gauge into Painter , and measure the business tension at New York in 1900 . He is passing his youth in a trance over a game of skill , and thereby earning the respect and admiration of all men . Do not blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the port of New York has touched him , and he is rigid . There are hundreds of these fellows , and they make us think of the 34 Between Elections . well-meaning young man who has to support his family , and who must compete against them for the confidence of his business patrons . Our standard of commercial honesty is set by that current . It is entirely the result of the competition that comes from everybody 's wanting to do the same thing . " But , " you say , " we are here dealing with a natural force . If you like , it withers character , and preoccupies one part of a man for so long that the rest of him becomes numb . He is hard and queer . He can not write because he can not think ; he can not draw because he can not think ; he can not enter real polities because he can not think . He is all the wretch you depict him , but we must have him . Such are men . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep an intellectual injury in the mind that thinks it as self-seeking can inflict . Business has destroyed the very knowledge in us of all other natural forces except business . What shall we do to diminish this awful pressure that makes politics a hell and wrings out our manhood , . till ( you will find ) the Americans condone the death of their brothers and fathers who perished in home camps during the war , because it all happened in the cause of trade , it was business thrift , done by smart men in pursuance of self-interest ? You ask what you can do to diminish the tension of selfishness which is as cruel as superstition , and which is not in one place but everywhere in the United States . It runs a hot iron over young intellect , and crushes character in the bud . It is blindness , palsy , and hip disease . You can hardly find a man who has not got some form of it . There is no newspaper which sloes not show signs of it . You can hardly find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elixir of life , the vade mecum of civilization . What eau you do ? Why , you can oppose it with other natural forces . You yourself can not turn Niagara ; but there is nOt a town in Amer ica , where one single man can not make his force felt against the whole torrent . He takes a stand on a practical matter . He takes action against some abuse . What does this accomplish ? Everything . How many people are there in your town ? Well , every one of them gets a thrill that strikes deeper than any sermon he ever heard . He may howl , but he hears . The grocer 's boy , for the first time in his life , believes that the whole outfit of morality has a place in the practical world . Every class contributes its comment . Next year a new element comes forward in politics as if the franchise had been extended . Remember this : you can not , though you owned the world , do any good in it except by devising new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . It is the personal influence of example that is the power . Nothing else counts . You can do harm by other methods , but not good . This influence is a natural force , and works like steam power . Why all this commotion over your protest ? If you accuse the mayor of being a thief , why does he not reply in the words of modern philosophy , " Of course I ' m a thief ; I 'm made that way " ? Instead of that he resents it , and there ensues a discussion that takes people 's attention off of trade , and qualifies the atmosphere of the place . You have appreciably relieved the tension and checked the plague . This whole subject must be looked at as a crusade in the cause of humanity . You are making it easier for every young man in town to earn his livelihood without paying out his ? soul and conscience . There is no royal road to this change . You can not help any one man . You are forced into helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself he cuts a cord that is strangling somebody . The first time that independent candidates for local office were run in New York city strong men cried in the street for rage . The supremacy of commerce had been affronted . New York , in all // that makes life worth living , is a new city since the reform movements began to break up the torpor of serfdom . You asked how to fight force . It must be fought with force , and not with arguments . Indeed , it is easier to start a reform and carry it through than it is to explain either why or how it is done . You can only understand this after you have been three times ridiculed as a reformer , and then you will begin to see that throughout the community , running through every one , there are currents of power that accomplish changes , sometimes visible , sometimes hard to see ; that this power is in its nature quite as strong , quite as real and reliable , as that Wall Street current , ? terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contending together as they surge and swell through the people . It is the sight of that second power that you need . I can not give it to you . You must sink your own shaft for it . It is this current passing from man to man that makes the unity of all efforts for public betterment . You have a movement and an excitement over bad water , and it leaves you with kindergartens in your schools . It is this current that turns your remark at the . Club ( which every one repeated in order to injure you ) into a piece of encouragement to the banker 's clerk , who could not have made it himself except at the cost of his livelihood . It is this current , not only the fear of it but the presence of it in the heart of your merchants , that leaves them at your mercy . Cast anything into this current and it goes everywhere , like aniline dye put into a reservoir ; it tinges the whole local life in twenty-four hours . It is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms , all resolutions , all lies are dedicated to it , all literature lives by it . The head of power is near and easy if you strike directly for it . There is an opinion abroad that good politics requires that every man should give his whole time to politics . This is another of the superstitions disseminated by the politicians who want us to go to their primaries , and accepted by people so ignorant of life that they believe that the temperature depends upon the thermometer . Why , you are running those primaries now . If you were different , they would become different . You need never go near them . Go into that camp where your instinct leads you . The improvement in politics will not be marked by any cyclonic overturn . There will always be two parties competing for your vote . It takes no more time to vote for a good man than for a bail man . There will be no more men in public life then than now . There will be no overt change in conditions . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that it requires a general increase of interest on the part of every one in order that these men shall be found . Your personal duty is to support them in private and public . That is all . The extent to which you yourself become involved in public affairs depends upon forces with which you need not concern yourself . Only try to understand what is happening under your eyes . Every time you see a group of men advancing some cause that seems sensible , and being denounced on all hands as " self-appointed , " see if it was not something in yourself , after all , that appointed those men . As we grow old , what have we to rely on as a touchstone for the times ? You once had your own causes and enthusiasms , but you can not understand these new ones . You had your certificate from the Almighty , but these fellows are " self - appointed . " What you wanted was clear , but these men want something unattainable , something that society as you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps they bring it . Has the great Philosophy of Evolution done nothing for the mind of man , 36 Between Elections . that new developments as they arrive are received with the same stony solemnity , are greeted with the same phrases as ever ? How can you have the ingenuousness to argue soberly against me , supplying Ins by every word you say with new illustrations , new hope , new fuel ? Until I heard you repeat word by word the prayer book of crumbling conservatism I was not sure I was right . You have placed the great seal of the world upon new truth . Thus should it be received . - The radi'cals are really always saying the same thing . They do not change ; every one else changes . They are accused of the most incompatible crimes , of egoism and a mania for power , indifference to the fate of their own cause , fanaticism , triviality , want of humor , buffoonery , and irreverence . But they sound a certain note . Hence the great practical power of consistent radicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one believes them . They hold a tolling fork and sound A , and everybody knows it really is A , though the time-honored pitch is G flat . The community can not get that A out of its head . Nothing can prevent an upward tendency in the popular tone so long as the real A is kept sounding . Every now and then the whole town strikes it for a week , and all the bells ring ; and then all sinks to suppressed discord and denial . The only reason why we have not , of late years , had strong consistent centres of influence , focuses of steady political power , has been that the community had not developed men who could hold the note . It was only when the note made a temporary concord with some heavy political scheme that the reform leaders could hear it themselves . For the rest of the time it threw the whole civilization out of tune . The terrible clash of interests drowned it . The reformers themselves lost it , and wandered up and down guessing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole community can suddenly sing in tune after it has been caterwauling and murdering the scale for twenty years . The truth is , we ought to thank God when any man or body of men makes the discovery that there is such a thing as absolute pitch , or absolute honesty , or absolute personal and intellectual integrity . A few years of this spirit will identify certain men with the fundamental idea that truth is stronger than consequences , and these men will become the most serious force and the only truly political force in their community . Their ambition is illimitable , for you can not set bounds to personal influence . But it is an ambition that can not be abused . A departure from their own course will ruin any one of them in a night , and undo twenty years of service . It would be natural that such sets of men should arse all over the country , men who " wanted " nothing , and should reveal the inverse position of the boss system ; it set of moral bosses with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of all the forces of human nature now suppressed , and the suppression of those now operative . It is obvious that one such man will suffice for a town . In the competition of character , one man will be naturally fixed upon whom his competitors will be the first to honor ; and upon Mm will be condensed the public feeling , the confidence of the community . If the extreme ease do not arise , nevertheless it is certain that the tendencies toward a destruction of the present system will reveal themselves as a tendency making for the weight of personal character in practical politics . Reform politics is after all a simple thing . It demands no great attainments . You can play the game in the dark . A child can understand it . There are no subtleties nor obscurities , no higher analysis or mystery of any sort . If you want a compass at any moment in the midst of some difficult situation , you have only to say to yourself , " Life is larger than this little imbroglio . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your compass swings true . You may be surprised to find what course it points to . But what it tells you to do will be practical agitation .
