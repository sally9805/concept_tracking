 |p1179  I HAVE heretofore told THE INDEPENDENT readers of the profitsharing plan which the N. O. Nelson Mfg . Company of St. Louis , Mo. , adopted in 1886 and has continued ever since . I am now to tell about taking the customers and the public also into partnership . For nineteen years the employees have received dividends of from 4 to Io per cent . on their wages and salaries . ? All but the latest corners are stockholders in the company , their dividends having most of the time been paid in stock . All sick and disabled and widows have received suitable maintenance . I have also told you of the town of Leclaire , in Illinois , 18 miles from St. Louis , planted in a wheat field in 189o , with its work , its education , its recreation , its beauty , its homes and its freedom . Leclaire was born and built on no other theory than that of improving the going methods of the world 's work and life . Neither I nor my neighbors and associates who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply an industrious , well behaved , jolly lot of ordinary people . We have no rules , nor police , nor boss ? in the fifteen years we have had no need of any . Visitors admire Leclaire , praise what we take as a matter of course . I have told you about the Industrial School ? not reformatory , please ? where boys of sixteen and over study half the day and work as apprentices the other half . The schooling is free , the work is paid for and the students pay the cost of co-operative board . We do not aim to manufacture professional intellectuals for positions on top of the coach , but intelligent and competent men for the world 's common duties . About half of the students are children of our own Leclaire people ; the other half are from various States and countries . A few months ago we celebrated with a banquet the thirty-third anniversary of the business and there announced a new  |p1180  departure for the future . It is about this that the editor has asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal owner of the company , have quit taking any profit or interest . I get a living wage for my work ; that is all , and it is enough . The profits are divided between the employees , the customers , philanthropy and the stock held by others than myself . Summing up the division without reciting the technical details , the employees get about onethird of the profits , the customers onethird and the employee stockholders and philanthropy the other third . The employees get dividends in proportion to their wages , the customers in proportion to the profitableness of their purchases . The stockholders other than myself get interest and a sliding scale of bonus . Philanthropy gets about one-fourth of the whole . I use the word " philanthropy " because it is an honest word and a good one . It means " the love of men " and in this case it is applied to such necessary and helpful things as we think most useful to the unfortunate . To this fund will be added such a portion of my capital as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid in my stock , thus giving me the money , and the employees and customers the ownership of the business . It will take no great length of time to make them the complete owners and the company a completely co-operative concern . This has been my objective point for many years past , awaiting only the proper conditions . The logic of taking the employees and the customers into partnership is that these two classes together make the profit . The former do the work , the latter take the product and convey it to the public . A share in the profits is a very different thing for employees from getting an advance in wages . If , in good times , the wages were advanced so as to pay out their share in the earnings the scale of living would , in most cases , be increased , and when times were poor and ordinary wages only could be paid a hardship would be felt . In paying the usual rate of wages and paying the dividends in stock they become the joint possessors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper interest in their work , they are accumulating a reserve fund for the exigencies of the future , and in due time their stock or their future cash dividends can be diverted to the making of homes , which very few employees now enjoy . It is not well for any one to be rich , neither is it well to be empty handed . A man should own the means by which he works , either severally or jointly , and he should own a home to live in . His manner of employment is the foundation of his home life and family ; it is an essential in the social structure and political stability . The predominant proletariat is more than a menace ; it is inevitable destruction . The customer is taken into partnership because he contributes to the profit , because he is an interested party , because his good will is essential to the business . He is an active and necessary participant in the operations that yield the profit . Profit arises partly from underpaying the employees , partly from overcharging the buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for additional working capital , for homes and for social utilities , including education and aid for the unfortunate . It is better to use it this way than divert it into the congested channels of extravagant and injurious living for a few or for superfluous capitalistic investment in speculation . Should profits he largely expended on home building , the unfit tenements will be vacated and replaced . None will be built . When used to fully care for the dependents there will be little use for the poorhouse and outdoor relief . If also freely used for special education , the great endowments would lose their terror for college presidents and millionaires . While I have thus resigned as capitalist I retain my post of captain and I shall most likely continue in that position as long as I am wanted . The business can safely be trusted to other hands . A well organized business , like a well organized army , has lieutenants fit for promotion and command . No organization is in safe condition that is dependent on a single head , neither is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good management . The majority of large corporations are conducted by  |p1181  page deleted  |p1182  bors in the day of disaster , against which no one is assured . We struggle intensely for foreign markets . Our navy is built mainly to keep open the door through which our surplus goods may pass . Better that we use this surplus at home and save ourselves the cost and the blood of war . We produce nothing more than we need at home , provided only we put it in the proper channels . All the labor employed in making goods for foreign markets could well be used for building fit homes for those of our own people who now occupy inadequate and unsanitary tenements . Better houses , better living , more schooling , better goods and clothing are needed . Our production is misdirected . We make things we do not want , and do without the prime requisites of f civilized living . By distributing the profits , the " surplus value , " among all the people we give them purchasing power and make a home market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making too much steel and build more and better houses for the common people . If we make too much cotton cloth , let us rather make more schools . More fruit and vegetables and meat might well take the place of the corn and wheat we export . If only the circle of demand was set in motion by increasing the income of consumers through a distribution of producers ' profits we should make a healthy demand for all the labor we have . A prominent manufacturer said recently that he devoted himself first to God , second to his family , third to his business . This order is good , somewhat equivalent to Theodore Parker 's " I love my family better than myself , my country better than my family , the world better than my country . " In either case the essential matter is whether the love to God or love to the world is a metaphysical concept or a reality , whether the love is shown in praying or practicing . God needs no incense or praise , but His children need much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cunning and plus by sale . Look up the land , look down the land , The poor , the poor , the poor , they stand Wedged by the pressing of Trade 's hand Against an inward opening door That pressure tightens evermore . They sigh a monstrous foul-air sigh For the outside leagues of liberty , Where art , sweet lark , translates the sky Into a heavenly melody . "
