txt When asked to-day whether his arctic ship , the Roosevelt . would take part in the Hudson-Fulton Parade , Commander Peary said he did not know . If Mr. Bridgman had said the . steamer would not take part in the celebration . if the schooner John R. Bradley . Cook 's vessel , was admitted , that would probably be the official opinion of the Peary Arctic Club . and would express Peary- 's own view . If the Roosevelt did take part in the parade , Commander Peary said ale would probably command her . but he was in doubt as to who would be his guests . The Roosevelt will proceed to New York just as she is now , Crew , dogs , and all complete : She will leave here on Thursday or Friday for Sydney , with Commander Peary aboard , going direct to that port without stop . There the steamer will fill her bunkers with coal for a straight run to New York . Has Dogs That Were nt Pole . On board the Roosevelt are eleven dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander Peary . One of these , called Apudingwah , was also with him in his farthest dash three years ago . Passage to Sydney on The Associated Press tug Douglas H. Thomas was offered to Commander Peary , but he declined with the explanation that the Roosevelt was absolutely seaworthy and would not require any assistance , nor would he leave her , he added , until he had personally docked her at Sydney . Asked if he would accept an Invitation to the banquet in his honor at Sydney , he replied that he probably would . From Sydney Commander Peary will go to the United States by rail . He would not say what would become of the Roosevelt . At New York . however , the crew would be paid off . The ship belongs to the Peary Arctic Club . The explorer suggested that it would be a good idea for the United States to take over the Roosevelt as a cutter in the Bering Sea or to keep some channel open , as ' she would be a splendid ice breaker . Italy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Duke of the Abruzzi 's ship , and the Norwegian Government holds the Frani . With regard to his steamer Commander Peary said : " The Roosevelt is in first-class condition and ' is practically uninjured . The hull , engines , and mathinery are as good as When she left New York in July , 1008 . " The main boat , however , had been accidently broken . Peary Answers Questions . Commander Peary answered a number of questions this afternoon . " Was Dr. Cook at the pole ? " was the first query , to which the Commander replied : " Cook was not at the pole on April et , 1808 , or at any other time . I make this statement advisedly , and at the proper time will back it up with proof . " " Were , you surprisea , Commander r Peary , on returning to Labrador , to learn that Dr. Cook had reported reaching the pole , or had anything happened before you returned to cause you to anticipate this event ? " was next asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the pole back , - replied the Commander . " Is it true that you opened letters or documents having reference to this point ? " No , " he responded emphatically . " Did Harry Whitney make any important statements to you about another polar expedition ? " " He made no statement , " said Commander Peary . " He is on the relief schooner Jeanie now , and is probably shooting bear on the western coast . " " What life is there to be found at the north pole ; are ' there birds , fishes , or any animals there ? " " When I was there it was not the season for birds . I do not know if there are fish in tile polar seas at that spot . There are no animals at the pole . " Commander Peary declined to discuss the charges that he took supplies at Etah belonging to Dr. Cook , but he declared that . Capt . Moses Bartlett could not throw any light on this point , because he had not been in Greenland since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken out of Greenland , as he was ill . Speaking about the unexplored area in the polar regions . Commander Peary said that there were 1,000,000 square miles of unknown territory between the pole and - Bering Straits previous to his expedition . He had not yet figured out by how much that quantity was reduced . Asked with regard to the purple snow fields at the pole and the hummocks and crevasses near the Pole , Commander Peary said : " That is a range of information that I do not care to impart now . " Many Soundings Taken . Speaking of the depth of water he said that he had run out 1,500 fathoms of line without reaching bottom within five miles of the pole . " We took soundings from Cape Columbia to the pole , " he continued , " which gives a cross-section of that part of the floes of the arctic ocean . The soundings were from ten to twenty miles apart . " What was the thickness of the ice and the temperature of the atmosphere ? " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , which was heavy . I do not care to tell the temperature . " Bearing on the Cook controversy , Commander Peary was asked : " Are the Eskimos wha were with Dr. Cook in his dash to the pole on your ship ? " " No , but I talked with them . " " Have you heard that any Eskimos were ever at the pole before yours ? " . " No , never . No inducement that could be offered them would-tempt them out on that sea of Ice until I went there . They knew by experience the liability of the ice breaking up and carrying people away to ' death . " " Why did you not have a white witness at the pole ? " - " Because after a lifetime of effort I ' dearly wanted the honor for myself . " A number of dispatches addressed to Commander Peary at Chateau Bay , Red Bay , and Blanc Sablon , dated Sept. 7 and 9. were received , here only to-day for delivery . Spent No Government Money . Commander Peary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work to Washington , and therefore had not yet decided whether he would go immediately to the National capital on returning to the United States . The survey work of past expeditions was embodied in the Government maps , and the same course probably would Le followed in this case . Not a dollar of Government money had ' been invested in his polar exploration . Up to the present time- his total expenditure in this work , - he said , aggre- gates , roughly speaking , $500,000 ; The first and smaller portion of this was his ' own and his wife 's fortunes and the contributions of personal friends . The proceeds of his lectures and books also went in ; said Commander Peary . Of the total outlay about $350,000 had been supplied by members of the Peary Arctic Club and other connections : - Ha ' had- always lived on his salary- , and until 1000 was in debt for money advanced for his arctic investigations . - COMmander Peary . has received an invitation to address the National Geographic-Society at Washington and to attend the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me. , - wishes to ? offer a welcome to the explorer between trains , and Portland is also anxious to entertain him , . To these invitations Commander Peary has replied that it . will be impossible for him to make any engagements now , that the Peary Arctic Club and New York City are to have first claim on his attention . Prepared to Controvert Cook . Mr. Peary declared that he would not further discuss Dr. Cook's. claim to the discovery of the north pole until the main point , whether Dr. Cook had actually reached the pole or not , had been decided by others . He then dictated the following statement for publication : " I am the only white man who has ever reached the north pole , and I am prepared to prove it at the proper time . I have already stated publicly that Cook has not been to the pole . This I reaffirm , and I will standby* it , ' out I decline to discuss the details of the matter . These will come out later . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pole should not be taken seriously , and that I ' have him nailed ' by concrete proofs . to support I my statement . In six months you probably will get the whole story . " It would not be policy for me to enter upon a full debate with the subject as it now stands . To do so I would be giving out much information of which other uses could be made . I intend to wait until Dr. Cook has issued his full ' , , authorized statements . Up to the present time there have been only newspaper accounts of Dr. Cook 's alleged polar trip , and these may or may not be accurate . Will Await Cook 's Report . " When Dr. Cook has time to issue a complete authorized version of his journey will be the proper opportunity for me to make public the information which I have . After that the jury ? in other words the people and the scientific bodies of the world  --  will pass judgment on the matter , and there will then be nothing left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has reached the north pole . In the meanwhile it is my determination not TO deal with debates for the reasons already stated . " Commander Peary was asked if new land could have been discovered in latitude 84 longitude 8G . He shrugged his shoulders and said it was quite possible that an unknown continent existed further West . He referred to the land discovered by himself on previous trips that had not yet been explored . Asked what would be the international effect of planting the Stars and Strips at the north pole , Commander Peary said lie had notified the Secretary of State that he had taken possession of the pole in the name of the United States , and that it remained for the Secretary to decide what that meant . He said he had left records on the ice at the pole . Peary Through with Exploring , commander Peary is done with active exploring . He will continue to take an Interest in arctic and antarctic exploration , but from his home , and he declared that he would withdraw from field work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy passage up the ' west coast of Newfoundland and through the Strait of Belle Isle from Sydney . Cape , Breton , arrived at this lonely whaling and mission settlement at neon yesterday . A squall of rain was blowing over the harbor as the Thomas steamed in , but with glasses it was possible to make out the mast and hull of the arctic steamer T-toosevelt moored in the inner bay . The Thomas broke out the " North Pole " flag , the same emblem that was flying 1-rern the mizzenmast of the Roosevelt . and signaled " The Associated Press con-1 gratulates you . " The Roosevelt signaled the ti arks of Commander Peary for this message . whereupon the Thomas gave three loud blasts on her whistle . In response there carne from the Roosevelt a chorus of harking and yelping from the Eskimo ( logs on board . that echoed back from loe surrounding hills . The Thomas drew near to the RooseVeit . The arctic steamer looked little the I , worse for her second trip to the polar , re- ; gions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . crew , among them the redoubtble Capt . Robert Bartlett . who WAS at once recognized . Capt . Bartlett invited the Thomas to lay alongside and the correspondent 46 come on board without delay . The correspondent clambered over the weatherbeaten bulwarks and proceeded direct to the cabin to meet Commander Peary. - The Commander 's greeting was most cordial . " This is a new record in newspaper enterprise . " , he said , - " and I appreciate the compliment . " Commander Peary spoke feelingly of I the death of Prof. Marvin . A cross bearing his name , his college , and the date of his death was erected- at Cape Sheridan , just above the Roosevelt 's Winter position , and is visible for miles . This is seventy-three miles from the point north of Cape Columbia where he was drowned . Health of the Party Good . The health of the party in general was good , according to the statement of la , r . ! John Goodsell , the surgeon of the expedition . Two Eskimo children were born and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due chiefly to the experience of the Commander in the selection of food and supplies necessary for the health and care of the party . In addition there was an abundance of fresh meat , which the expedition was able to secure through Commander Peary 's knowledge of the . country . Bartlett , Marvin . , and Borup suffered from frost-bitten feet more severely than the others . Frost bites in the arctic are treated with borated musk ox fat and are well protected from the cold . Two of the Eskimos were disabled at Cape Columbia , one suffering from frozen feet and the other from a severe inflammation , partly due to the same cause . Dr. Goodsell gave them surgical attention and I left them in their igloos until the detachment returned from the northern trip . He supplied them with ample provisions . They received the return party with manifestations of great delight . One of the disabled Eskimos was hauled on the sledges to the ship at Cape Sheridan , a distance of ninety miles . On this trip Dr. Goodsell slipped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival at the Roosevelt found an Eskimo child with a fractured shoulder . He had no trouble in keeping busy . There were some cases of snow blindness also . Commander Peary was ill f .. ir one day about six weeks prior to Fel , . 15 , which was the day that Capt . Bartlett left the Roosevelt with his division for Cape Columbia . the advance guard of the dash to : lie pole . The- surgeon was a little concerned about Commander Peary 's illness on account of the approaching tramp , bid proved to be nothing serious , and all the men were in the pink of condition f when the start was made . Prof. was confined to his hed for a month on the trip through Smith Sound , immediately after leaving Etah . He suffered from a moderate fever of rheumatic type , which is doubtless peculiar to local conditions . Dr. Goodsell also suffered for some time from the same complaint .                    @
