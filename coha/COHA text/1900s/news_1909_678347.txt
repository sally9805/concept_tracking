txt The Union League Club Exhibition . An exhibition of extraordinary dignity opened yesterday with a private view at the Union League Club . Eleven pictures from the collection of the late Collis P. Huntington are hung with admirable discretion in a way to show the merits of each picture to the fullest advantage . And I these merits are many and great in each case . The two fine Rembrandts from the Kann collection dominate the exhibition both by their size and their quality . " The Savant , " with its richly painted head , the splendid folds of its draperies , the elaborate chain , and the/magisterial authority of the handling is the most important of the two , but there is more humanity and more Rembrandt in the powerful portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels , thinly painted , with an amazing look of flesh and blood , a vitality comparable only with that of the self-portrait in the possession of Mr. Frick , which was shown a year or so ago lin the Metropolitan Museum . Two other , examples deriving from the Kann collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Portrait of " ' bung Koetjmanszoon van Ablasserdsm , " both by Frans Hale and both specimens of his colder period and tighter modeling , but the quick side glance of the young Dutchman and the gloved hand of the lady are pure Hals  --  the piaster who is envied by painters of all countries and all times . On the same wall with Hendrickie Stoffels and separated from her by Mr. Lathrop 's portrait of Mr. Huntington , is a beatitiful Ver Meer of Delft , the " Lady with a Guitar . " The warm gray wall , the pale yellow of the sleeve and the deeper golden tones of the hair , and the guitar ' and the white of the fur contrasted with the dark dull blues of the curtain and tablecloth make enchanting passages of color sharpened by the high notes of the pearls and the gold ornament in the hair . On the opposite wall is the pretty " Nature " group , the children of Mr. Calmedy , by Sir Thomas Lawrence , with a Itomney 's lovely " Portrait of Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left . The latter is entitled " Hauling In the Net , Twilight , " and expresses both Corot 's architectonic sense in the arrangement of the structural lines of the compoartion and the poetry of his vision . This tall tree , the perpendicular of which makes a bold angle with the horizontal of the boat and the suave curve of the woman 's figure bent over the boat 's side , make as rlasslq a bit of picture building as the master often accomplished . On one of the large side wall spaces hangs a capital Troyon in which the shaggy coats of the cattle are not more brilliantly painted than the meadows and sky . The strong colors and fine values of the picture are interesting in view of the blackening that has come to many of the Barbizon pictures with these few years of time . Opposite the Troyon Is Sir Joshua Reynolds 's " Portrait of Lady de Smythe and Her Children , " the faces of the children having the dainty archness of the famous " mouse " picture , and the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracious pose . Take it all in all , the collection , with its fine setting unincumbered by trivial surroundings , makes a deep ! repression . ' C. Everett Shinn 's Works on View . At the Club is an exhibition of some fifty or sixty paintings , studies . and drawings by Everett Shinn . Great variety and technical strength are the characteristics of the group , and those who would know this always interesting painter on his different sides should see the exhibition . It Is a long step from such a painting as " The Empty Fiacre , Paris , " with its rigid constructions , its bleak suggestions in the dejected starving horse and empty street , to the flowing line and Watteau spirit of some of the red chalk drawings , but in one as in the other there Is an original vision , a spontaneity of execution , and a lively vitality that set them far above the commonplace of art . The " Rag-Picker , " with its dark row of buildings , its snowy street , its strongly characterized figure and- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust actuality ; the monotypes , rich in color and in the opulent contours of the figures , are little masterpieces , and the decorative compositions in the style of eighteenth century France are vigorous and well composed . A gallery exhibition of Mr. Shinn 's work would be welcomed by lovers of fastidious and competent draughtsmanship . IN ERROR ABOUT MR . KENNEDY He Did Not Testify That He Did Not Remember His N. P. Holdings . THE TIMES 'S story of the principal stock holdings in the great railroads of the country last Wednesday contained the sentence : " Among the holders of Northern Pacific John S. Kennedy 's $10,000,000 gathers interest from the recollection that during the Northern Securities case hearing Mr. Kennedy testified that he could not recollect whether he held $5,000,000 or $14,000,000 worth . " Mr. Kennedy 's testimony does not contain this statement . He writes to THE TIMES : " 1 never made such a statement at any time , in any place , or to- any person . I would take no notice of this were it not that it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testimony under oath I made a deliVerately false statement . "
