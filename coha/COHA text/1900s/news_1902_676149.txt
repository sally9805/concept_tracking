" That MADDEN who came near killing the President at Pittsfield , and succeeded in killing one of his companions , belongs to ' a too common and very loathsome American type , commoner , perhaps , in New England than in other sections of the country . That is the kind of American who thinks to prove equality by showing insolence . We read that the President came near forgetting himself to the extent of personally chastising the man , and while we approve his self-restraint , we are still conscious of a carnal desire that he might have lost It to that extent . It seems quite clear that MADDEN was engaged in racing with the President 's party , being probably instigated thereto by the promise of a tip from his passengers , and that he was consequently going at a reckless and criminal rate of Speed . He did not expect to kill anybody . But also he did not mean to relinquish what he called his " right of way " even to the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . He was just an American hog . It was , we believe , the Great Hampshire hog that was the celebrated animal that was killed in consequence of having too much cheek . But it might as well have been the great Berkshire hog . Berkshire has numerous specimens of the same ignoble breed . And when MADDEN gets his sentence for some degree of homicide , it should be evident that hoggishness , against which there is no statute , is his real offense . Certainly some condign punishment of him is needed to vindicate the American idea of equality , and to prove that the mere millionaire , speeding his automobile along the public highways , and incidentally killing and maiming his felIow-citizens as he goes , is equal before the law to the proudest Berkshire hog , employed as a motorman on a trolley car , and glorying in the opportunity his job gives him to defy and insult the President of the United States and all others . in civil authority , and thereby to express his contempt for the people of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the American equivalent of the European " lese majeste . " At the expense of MADDEN , the fact should be borne in upon the minds of all other actual or potential Maddens.
