txt No man who either heard or has read ELIEE ROOT 's speech at the Union League Club will call in question his entire loyalty to President ROOSEVELT , from whose Cabinet he has just retired . Nor will any one deny that the ex-Secretary has the full courage Of his loyalty , It can not be said , of course , that in his home city of New York Mr. ROOSEVELT would find himself , as Mr. BRYAN said he found himself , " in the enemy 's country . " But it is understood , to put it mildly , that there is in this city , especially among Republicans , a considerable distrust of the President 's steadiness and sobriety of judgment . That sentiment Mr. Boor openly challenged and reproved . He counted it one of the greatest privileges of his life , " when our lamented President MCKINLEY was carried away , to have been able to stand by and hold up the hands of his true and loyal successor , THEODORE ROOSEVELT . " He continued : Men say he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to prosecute selfish schemes for the public 's detriment . He is not safe for the men who wish the Govern went conducted with greater reference to campaign contributions than to the public good . He is not safe for the men who wish to drag the President of the United States into a corner and make whispered arrangements which they dare not have shown by their constituents . In the opinion of the en-Secretary of War Mr. ROOSEVELT is an eminently safe President . " I say to you that he has been during these years since President 's death the greatest conservative force for the protection of property and our institutions in the City of Washington . " Evidently mindful of the fact that it is precisely in respect to this quality of conservatism that the great business interests of New York have their doubts , Mr. ROOT explained a lit-tle : There is a better way to protect property , to protect capital , and to protect great enterprises than by the buying of legislators . There is a better way to deal with labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistless mobs than by starving it or by buying or corrupting its leaders . There are some things to be thought of besides the speculations of the hour . There is the great onward march of American institutions , the development of our social system , the underlying faith and trust of our people in the laws under which they live . And the man in the chair of the Chief ** of this great people , President not merely of you and me , but of all the eighty millions in the land , is charged under his high responsibilities so to administer the law that it shall have the confidence and respect of the people who have made it . It would be an ungracious task to submit Mr : ROOT 'S eulogy to the test of analysis phrase by phrase , yet we suppose the language he used about Mr. ROOSEVELT might have been safely and with propriety used about any of the Presidents . An en-member of the Cabinet of any of Mr. RoosnvELT 's predecessors , possessed of Mr. ROOT 's capacity for straightforward , forcible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this way . It is the familiar language of eulogy , and while it gives convincing proof of the ex-Secretary 's loyal attachment , its effect in removing distrust of the President will depend largely upon the individual attitude of the hearer or reader . Mr. RooT wishes to convince New York that the President is a faithful yet conservative upholder of the law . That is the heart and meaning of his discourse . It is also the point in dispute . The men of the railroads and great combinations are told , not specifically by Mr. ROOT , but by the President 's friends all and several , that the law compelled him to bring the action against the Northern Securities Company . His respect for the law was the motive of his action . The question is instantly suggested , if Mr. ROOSEVELT is so punctilious about the anti-trust law , why did he so roughly override the public law , the supreme law of the land , our treaty with Colombia ? " We shall have the canal , " said Mr. ROOT , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction . How could he in an address describing Mr. ROOSEVELT as a conservative President ? The - constructive recess " raises a further question . Is there any law for that ? Does that sublimated idea of an infinitesimal point of time find any support in human reason ? Where was the law for the anthracite strike commission ? And was not the law a little mishandled in the promotion of Gen. Wool ) ? Sober-minded men have reached the conclusion that the interference in the coal strike was the reverse of a conservative act . But for the President the end of the struggle it is believed would soon have been reached , and it Would have ended in a less aid and comfort way to give far to labor agitators , in a way that would not have served to encourage the spirit of unrest and the turbulence that has brought such loss upon the country 's industries during the past year and a half . The law is perhaps not the President 's strong point , and conservatism is not his foible , we fear , Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own city and State , But if Mr. ROOT correctly interprets his wish he is unwilling to deserve its confidence by any display of tenderness toward " the speculations of the hour . " There again the President 's relation to law is brought into view . A chorus of protest went up the other day when it was hinted that Senator FoaAwat 's amendment to the Anti-Trust act was to be construed as an overture from the President to Wall Street , and an instant disclaimer was heard coupled with the explanation that it would be very bad politics indeed for the President in the midst of his campaign for the nomination to assent to any mitigation of statutory savagery toward the trusts . The anti-trust law is a clumsy and unreasonable statute . Senator FonaJcta 's amendment merely aimed to make it a reasonable law , leaving unimpaired the safeguards it provides against the Injurious use of corporate power . Do we not want reasonable laws ? When we discover that one of our laws is unreasonable ought we not promptly to amend it ? But this amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because to press it now would hurt the President 's chances of getting the nomination . In other words , politics takes precedence over regard for good laws . Reasons of this nature make men disinclined to join with Mr. Boor in his trustful view of the President .
