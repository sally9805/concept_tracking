 |p491  To announce too much of what one means to do is the best way not to do it at all , " says Talleyrand . We all know how dangerous it is to promise pleasure to others from what has pleased us . Our dearest friend may seem but a dull dog to the stranger to whom we introduce him . The book , the play , the picture , the tour in a new country , the hotel in which we have been comfortable , all these we may praise to another , and he only finds them commonplace or positively disagreeable . There are , however , two things that I dare announce to the traveller as superlatively beautiful . If he be disappointed the fault is his , and not my praise of them . The pictures of Velasquez in the Prado at Madrid , and an English country landscape in May , surpass any possible preliminary praise of them . You may announce what you will , but the reality still surpasses the promise . Twenty miles out of London , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green fields , hedges of hawthorn , trees blossoming on every side . England looks to be the huge well-cared-for farm of a Croesus . The absence of much sunlight , so distressing to the American in London , is an advantage now . True , the country is an old country , and had been ploughed and planted and harrowed for close on to a thousand years before America was even discovered . This gives the country-side a mellowness and wellgroomed look , and the vaporous sunlight softens all the outlines , hides the harsh features , and gives the landscape the dreamy , far-away , misty loveliness of a mirage . Just now the fields that are not brown , having been turned up for sowing , are of a delicate green , and hundreds of sheep and lambs scurry about as the train flies by . If I were an Englishman , it @# seems to me that I should grow positively thirsty for this scene if I were long away from it . There seem to be no angles ; field melts into field , and hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road which seems to join rather than to separate them . The houses , big and little , are all of brick or stone and have the advantage of lending their interstices to ivy and climbing roses , and the older they are the softer the color and outline . Houses of wood look to be dishevelled and shabby as they grow old , while brick and stone are the more dignified the older they grow . I believe it is true that the midlands of England are as fertile and easily cultivated as any similar number of acres in the world , and to the eye of the traveller they seem so . But where are all the people ? Did we leave them all in London , and Oxford , and Worcester , and Birmingham ? All through the afternoon and into the early evening we travel , and I could have counted more houses , certainly more sheep , than men and women from the carriage window . It may be a holiday , it may be the day 's work is finished , it may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and browns , are not so distinctly seen in this soft light . In any case , it seems as though one might step out and take possession of as much of this lovely country as one cared to , and this adds still another quality to the charm . There is solitude without loneliness . It is so well cared for , so gentle and cultivated in appearance , that one feels the centuries of human toil , the intimate companionship of men , but without their interruption . England is London says one , England is Parliament says another , England is the Empire says still another ; but if I be not much mistaken , this stretch of green fields , these hills and valleys , these hedges and fruit trees , this soft landscape , is the England men love . In India and Canada and Australia , in their ships at sea , in their  |p492  knots of soldiery all over the world , Englishmen must close their eyes at times , and when they do they see these fields green and brown , these hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung with roses and ivy , and when the eyes open they are moist with these memories . The pioneer , the sailor , the soldier , the colonist , may fight , and struggle , and suffer , and proclaim his pride in his new home , in his new possessions , but these are the love of a wife , of children , of friends ; that other is the love , with its touch of adoration , that is not less , nor more , but still different , that mysterious mingling of care for , and awe of , the one who brought you into the world . This is the England , I take it , that makes one feel his duty to be his religion , and the England that every American comes to as to a shrine . When this is sunk in the sea , or trampled over by a host of invading Germans , or mauled into bankruptcy by pandering politicians and sour socialists , one of the most delightful spots in the whole world will have been lost ; and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , for nowhere else is there just this texture of canvas , just this quality of pigment , just these fifteen centuries of atmosphere . One can not describe every country town in England , so I have chosen the one I love best . If it is more beautiful than other country towns , if I am partial , even prejudiced , in regard to it , so much the better . Criticism seldom errs too much on the kindly side . This particular town had a castle , built by no less a person than a daughter of the great King Alfred , who led his Saxon neighbors in driving off the Danes . This town had a charter granted to it by the King three hundred years before Columbus sailed into the west . It is an old town even for England ; its hoary antiquity drifts out beyond the harbor of American imagination into an unknown sea . To an American it is almost too old to be true . One might as well say in an Oklahoma village that Adam lived here ! At such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth numbering . The town hall stood in the main street ( and still stands there ) when the Mayflower set sail , and one of the local inns was an old established hostelry before we made our first noise in the world , taking pot-shots at the redcoats near Lexington . The members of one family represented the town in Parliament for several centuries , and the old corn-mill dates back almost to the days of Charlemagne . In a wholesome old age the features , the speech , the manners , the opinions soften ; thus a gentle old lady has a charm that no youthful maiden , be she ever so beautiful , can rival . As for men , I wonder that any woman is willing to marry a man under forty . So it is with a town . Not Time itself can ever console us for the lack of this long vista back through the centuries . Neither dollars nor energy can manufacture mellowness . There is no lack of manuals , documents and erudite treatises on the economic , political , religious and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catalogue of any large library to find data for the support of his theories , or theories with which to confirm his data . But when all is known that has been written on the laws and traditions and customs that influence the life of a nation , there still remains the peculiar atmosphere , the social climate , that thermometers and barometers can only register ; they can no more describe them than a box of colors can paint a picture . This must be acknowledged in describing an English country town . Given the differences between a republic and a monarchy ; between a new country and an old country ; a country where there are still millions of acres of unoccupied land , and a country where the land is in the hands of a comparatively few landlords ; a country that has had free education ever since it was settled , and a country where education was for centuries considered undesirable , or at any rate , unnecessary , for the masses ; a nation where distinctions of class are recognized in the constitution itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , are generally accepted ; and even then there are still differences which can not be tagged with names , but which are plants centuries old , and having qualities not to be analyzed , qualities like those of old pictures or old wines , born of age . The moment the stranger puts questions to his neighbor in this English town ? a town , I may say in passing , of about six thousand inhabitants ? the first differences @#  |p493  discover themselves . The Englishman of Northbridge in England does not know as much , nor does he take as much interest in the affairs of his town , as does the American of Bear 's Cove , Massachusetts . The whole machinery of local government , until very lately , was based upon traditions , the origins of which are only known to the antiquary or the student . In England laws are almost always the outgrowth of custom and tradition ; in America the laws were made brand-new for a particular purpose , easily recognizable by the least profound observer . In England the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same customs and habits which made the laws also made the man who obeys them , and he wears them like a well-worn suit of clothes . In America the man made the laws , and feels rather superior to them , as one might feel toward clothes not altogether comfortable in their fit . This is part of the secret of the lawabidingness of the Englishman and the American tendency to law-defyingness . It is not strange then that the American knows more about the affairs of his town than does the Englishman . One would naturally be better informed about one 's own children than about one 's ancestors . In England , too , the people have not had the franchise long , and consequently the masses are not yet accustomed to feel , or to take upon themselves , much political responsibility . The middle and lower classes are only just beginning to question the political and social status quo . For centuries it has not occurred to them that things could be other than they are . " It has always been so " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America , on the contrary , was born of revolt against the political , social and religious status quo , and England was left for two hundred years more of it has always been so , " when her rebellious ones sailed away to Virginia and Massachusetts . In America , politics ranks as one of the domestic virtues ; in England politics has been , and is largely even now , the obligatory occupation of the few who can afford it , though this state of things is rapidly changing in both town and country since the widening of the franchise and the passing of the Corporation Act . In America it may almost be set down as an incontro- vertible proposition that no man of Lord Rosebery 's wealth and social position , for example , could be elected President of the United States . In England until the last few years no man could have hoped to succeed in politics without a private income ; in America nothing is such an awkward handicap as great wealth , while if part of this wealth were spent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absolutely prohibited . The English people as a whole still look to wealth and position to govern them , while in America the people are still jealous , not to say unreasonably suspicious , of wealth and power . These are the larger , the enveloping reasons why the American in his country town takes more interest in its political affairs than does the Englishman in his . The Englishman 's town was made for him , and the centuries have swathed it in customs that are almost sacred . The American 's town he made himself , and he looks upon it not as a graven image , but as a model of clay that maybe often and easily altered without sacrilege and probably with advantage . The country town in England serves as well to exploit all these national differences as though it were England under a microscope . The classes are as distinctly marked as though they wore uniforms . At the base of the social pyramid are the agricultural laborers earning from $2.50 to $3.25 a week ; fifty per cent . of the laborers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact worth remembering when we revise our tariff ! Then the farm servants and house servants of the small gentry , earning , the men from $90 to $250 a year , the women from $6o to $125 a year ; then the shopkeepers and their assistants and employees ; then the richer merchants , and mill or factory owners , and ranking with them the local professional men , lawyers , doctors , Dissenting ministers , land agents , and the like ; next come the gentlemen farmers and landed proprietors , and the clergy of the Church of England ; and finally the county gentlemen and the neighboring nobility , with the lord lieutenant of the county , often a great noble , as the official and political apex . The manufacturer , mill-owner and the like receives of course both social and official recognition according to his success  |p494  and his wealth . As we have noted elsewhere , the successful brewer or manufacturer often crowns his career by being made a peer , when he leaves his own class and enters another . The same is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . I may be mistaken , but I believe the physician is the only representative of success in the professions who thus far has failed to reach the dignity of the peerage . In the New England town I have in mind ? and very proud I am to keep it in my memory ? of about the same size and relative importance as the English town I am describing , the governor of the State , who happens to live there , and the cashier of the local bank , and the shopkeeper , if he chance to be an interesting companion on account of his antiquarian knowledge , and the editor of the small local newspaper , if he be of intelligent proportions , would meet at one another 's houses , if their common tastes made it agreeable . But it would be considered the height of social glory in this English town should a shopkeeper , no matter how big the shop , or a bank cashier , no matter what his erudition , or even a physician or small solicitor , or small factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the county nobility , much more at the table of the lord lieutenant of the county , except on some occasion of a formal function . Though the lord lieutenant of the county is usually a man of rank , he may be in no sense superior in social weight to other nobles in the county ; for the time being he outranks them by right of his office . If you can not be a duke with a large rent-roll in England , by all means be an agreeable American , for to one and the other all doors are open . You dine with all classes , and all are willing to dine with you . No one is jealous of you , no one envious ; no one suspects you of pride or vainglory , because , being a sovereign yourself , you are equally at home with sovereigns or with the people abroad . No one else can have the inestimable privilege of warm friendships with all classes , and consequently an intimate knowledge of the ways of life , of men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , so the salaries and incomes are smaller among these people than with us . The largest house in the town , built of brick , with garden , greenhouse and small stable , and containing rooms ample for the accommodation of a family of six , keeping a governess and seven servants , keeping two horses and doing a fair amount of entertaining , such an establishment as this can be kept going , without painstaking economy , on an income of $6,000 or $7,000 a year . In no place in America would the upkeep of a similar establishment for such a sum be humanly possible . In the first place , the governess and seven servants would require in wages $2,500 a year , while a similar staff in England would cost somewhere in the vicinity of $900 a year . This particular house was in the town itself , and was far more comfortable than the majority of the houses in the town . People with an average income of from one thousand to three thousand dollars a year live in far more convenient houses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , lighting , suitable kitchens and laundries , is insisted upon with us , and is lacking to an appalling extent in English country or even town houses , and also in the more pretentious country houses themselves . The houses of the poorer classes , laborers , clerks , servants and the like , are mere boxes , with none of the conveniences to which Americans even of the poorer classes are accustomed . Hundreds of thousands of Americans live in houses admirably equipped as to bathrooms , lighting and heating conveniences and the like , where hundreds are thus housed in England . Indeed , America is in a class quite by herself , so far as mechanical contrivances for personal comfort are concerned , as compared with England , or any other country in the world . The average level of comfort is far higher than anywhere else , whatever may be said as to the satisfaction of the rarer and more luxurious and more refined demands of the more cultivated . At any rate , America is easily chief among dwelling-places where mediocrity has nearest approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines , beer , spirits , tobacco , all are cheaper in the English than in the American town , and prices of meats , vegetables , bread , butter , poultry , eggs , much the same . In this particular town in Shropshire , however , the beef and mutton , though costing about the  |p495  same amount , or a little less , per pound , are very much better than in a similar town in Massachusetts ? are of as fine a quality , indeed , as the very best beef and mutton served in the best hotels and restaurants in New York . As you walk through the covered outer entrance to the door of the local inn , you may taste the preliminary joys of the carnivorous gastronome , for there are hanging the joints of beef and mutton , the beef getting that black-purple look which promises tenderness , and at dinner the visual promise is kept to the full . There is no such mutton in the world as a Welsh sheep fattened on the luscious grass of these hills and valleys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fatter So we thought it would be meeter To carry off the latter . " But in the sheep from Wales fattened here one has both the sweet and the fat . Alas ! the preparation of food in this town , as in all others I know , and in London itself , except where foreign cooks and foreign methods are used , is by no means equal in quality to the materials provided . The only thing that can be said in praise of English cookery is , that one is never tempted to eat too much ! It satisfies legitimate hunger amply , but is never a temptation to gormandizing . With all these fertile fields , it is a ceaseless source of wonder to the traveller that England should have nothing but potatoes and cabbage and sea-kale and vegetable marrow , day after day and year in and year out , and import millions of pounds ' worth of eggs ? some of them from as far away as Russia ? butter , cheese , poultry , salads and small vegetables . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house in a neighboring county , his beef and his mutton , and his famous band of sturdy children , make one pause to remember that by their fruits ye shall know them . To those who have enough of bread , and beer , and beef , and bacon , and plain vegetables , and to boot plenty of outdoor exercise and a somewhat varied social life , this diet is evidently well suited . These English , Scotch and Irish men and women of the well-fed and wellcared-for classes are the sturdiest of the human race . No doubt my own experience is that of others , that you can bear more physical fatigue on this diet , and in this climate , than in America . The hard work of shooting over dogs in Scotland , of four and sometimes five days a week hunting in Ireland , can be kept up for weeks on end , with only a pleasurable sense of fatigue ; while in our electrical climate , I am personally , at least , able to do only , say , two-thirds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion . At the hundred yards , the two hundred and twenty , and quarter-mile , at the high jump and other contests where rapidity and tremendous momentary exertion are required , we beat the English ; while at the mile , three miles , and other tests of endurance rather than speed , they beat us . Probably the most noticeable difference between two such towns , the one in America , the other in England , is the entire absence of foreigners in the latter . In the house I know best at home , out of a staff of some ten or more people , only one is an American , and he is the gardener , and in all the fundamentals he is a gentleman if there ever was one . The others are from Ireland , England , Sweden and France ; France , of course , supplying the lady governess . But here in the English town they are all English . In America the rough work of the laborer is all done by the foreigners , the servants are all foreigners , the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all foreigners . I have lived in America in the South , and West , and East for many years , and I puzzle my brains and prod my memory but I can not recall that I have ever come in contact with an American pauper , though I know of course that there must be such . This must account for the fact that pauperism seems to be taken so much more for granted in England than in America . On Saturday , April II , 1908 , there were nearly one hundred and twenty-five thousand persons receiving indoor and outdoor relief in London alone , and they were practically all English . One feels differently perhaps about being a pauper if other paupers are of one 's own breed ; so , too , one feels differently about helping them . They are a recognized class in England , but no American , despite the distress , vagabondage and poverty in our great cities , has taught himself to accept pauperism as a necessary condition of masses of his own race , and as a necessary tax upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over America where a confirmed and recognized pauper would be as great a curiosity as the man skeleton or the fat woman of a travelling circus . I question if this be true of any single town in England . On the other hand , this fact of the homogeneity of the race makes for mutual understanding and solidarity . In spite of the social gradations we have noted , the common grounds of intercourse are nowhere so many as here : witness the cricket , the hunting field ; the dog and horse and agricultural and flower shows ; the friendly and even confidential relations between the landowner and his farmers , bailiffs , woodsmen , trainers , jockeys , huntsmen , and so on . There are no false distinctions , only real distinctions , so the English claim , and no one but a fool or an ape cares to break them down . On ground where men can meet without self-consciousness , they do meet ; but why should men who meet because they play cricket , or ride to hounds , or breed dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at the dinner-table , where they have not the same experience , the same opportunities , or common tastes ? Nowhere do men of sympathetic interests meet more often and more easily , without thought of social distinctions , than here , and no doubt this is due to the fact that differences of social rank are fixed , and universally recognized and accepted . The general understanding of this rather paradoxical social situation , and the smoothness with which social life moves , is due again to this fact that they are all English . This is a key to the understanding of one another , which , while it defies analysis , must be recognized as important . Peoples who speak a different language never fully understand one another , and even when they speak the same language , as in the case of the Americans and the English , they constantly fail to see eye to eye to one another . We give the same words a different shade of meaning , just as we give them a different intonation . These people all of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have an advantage of mutual understanding , and a kind of taciturn sympathy with one another , that are priceless in solving many of their problems . The very machinery of government in the town itself runs more easily for this fact . Going from small to great , the Parish is the smallest unit in England , having a Parish Council , or , if very small , a Parish Meeting . Groups of Parishes form the Union , the Union being the unit for the administration of the Poor-Law . Unions again , where a Borough is concerned , are divided into " Borough " and " District , " i e . Town and Country . Their respective Councils deal with roads , sanitary matters , etc. , etc . Groups of Unions form the County , which deals with main roads , education , lunatics , and so on . In some cases a Union is partly in one County and partly in another , then it is divided for County purposes . The English town of Northbridge is governed as to water , lighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mayor , and Town Council , over which he presides . The Town Councillors are elected by the voters of the Borough , who consist of all property-owners , practically all occupiers of any taxable property , and lodgers who pay a certain specified sum for their lodgings . Even the sons in a family , twenty-one years of age or over , and living at home , must become lodgers in their own homes , they must have rooms of their own in the house , which they may lock up against their parents , and they must , as has been said , pay a certain sum therefor , viz. , ten pounds unfurnished , to entitle them to vote . Women , too , may vote for the Councillors , but not for Parliamentary candidates . Married women may not vote , and other women , spinsters and widows , must be property-owners , or lodgers paying a certain sum , and coming under the same rules as to their right to vote as men . This privilege is exercised in certain places , and in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places and at other times scarcely at all . It is not a matter that can be settled by giving figures , since the numbers differ widely . In New Zealand , where the women may vote , but where they have not been obliged to fight for the privilege , they care very little for it , and seldom exercise their right . To what extent the novelty of the franchise may influence the women voters in England it is as yet too early to decide . For the moment it is evident that the majority make comparatively little use of their right to the ballot . At this present  |p497  writing there are 1,141 women on Boards of Guardians , 2 on Urban District Councils , 146 on Rural District Councils and 615 on Education Committees . The Councillors elect so many Aldermen , and from their own number the Aldermen and Councillors elect the Mayor . In the case of Northbridge , the town is divided into wards for the purposes of elections , but this is not so in all towns . When a Town Councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ward , and there follows another election . These elections take place every three years . The Aldermen are elected tor six years , and half of them retire every three years . This system , however , only dates from 1882 , the year of the passing of the Corporation Act by Parliament . The Schools are controlled : ( 1 ) by Parliament , ( 2 ) by the County Council , ( 3 ) by local managers . Parliament is represented by the Board of Education , whose inspectors visit and report on all schools , and the government grant of money is paid only to such schools as satisfy the government requirements as to efficiency . The County Council , through its Education Committee , pays the teachers , fixes their salaries and provides all equipment , such as books , blackboards , furniture , coal and so on . The government grant is paid at the rate of so much per child to the County Council , who make up the deficiency by levying a tax over the whole county . The tax in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pence halfpenny in the pound , and for secondary education one-half penny in the pound , or , for both taxes , twelve and a half cents on every five dollars . The local managers are six for each school , divided as follows : four Foundation Managers , appointed under the trust deeds of the several schools ; one appointed by the Town Council , and one by the County Council . In Northbridge there are four schools , though one , the Blue Coat School , a foundation school , is very small and rather an exceptional case . The three schools which practically serve the town are : the school in the Parish of the High Town , the school in the Parish of the Low Town ( these are merely geographical distinctions ) , which are both Church of England schools , and the school of the Roman Catholic Parish . In very many towns there are Council schools directly under popular control , but in Northbridge , which is a stanch Tory town , in a stanch Tory county , there are none . Practically all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Town Council , and are not elective , the auditor being one of the few office-holders who is elective . In the matter of licenses for public houses , a much vexed question just now , the licenses are granted annually by the local justices to old license-holders , but in the case of applications for new licenses , or of a refusal to renew an old one , the local justices refer the matter to the County Justices , or the Court of Quarter Sessions , who deal with such questions through the County Licensing Committee . The local justices also grant licenses for buildings where stage-plays may be acted , and the like . Justice , in a borough or town like Northbridge , is administered by Borough Justices , who are mostly local tradesmen and professional men ; they deal with small offences at Petty Sessions . More serious offences are dealt with at the Borough Quarter Sessions , presided over by a Recorder , who is a barrister and a paid official , with a jury . Still more serious offences are sent up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrewsbury , and tried before a Judge of Assize . In the County District , the Magistrates as a rule are local gentry . They sit in the town itself for Petty Sessions , and in the County Town for Quarter Sessions , when , in place of a Recorder , they select one of their own number as chairman , who is also unpaid . He is , however , usually a barrister , and I know of one instance where a gentleman studied law merely to fit himself to occupy this position in his own neighborhood creditably . Here again the most serious offenders , as with Borough offenders , are tried at Assizes . The offender himself in some cases may demand to be tried by the higher court . These unpaid magistrates are suggested by the Lord Lieutenant , and appointed by the Lord Chancellor . The Lord Chancellor is an officer of the government which may at the moment be in power , the Lord Lieutenant of the County is not necessarily so . When these gentlemen happen to belong to different  |p498  political parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without consulting the Lord Lieutenant . This is not often done , and the arrangement on the whole works without friction . To be a County Magistrate is the ambition of many men , and the gift of this distinction is rarely if ever mischievously bestowed . It is not supposed to be a question of party politics , but of personal worth , and there is no complaint that the party in power misuses this privilege . These amateur magistrates make mistakes , and Mr. Labouchere and Truth devote many paragraphs to their shortcomings , but the system works so well that there are seldom complaints from the class who are judged by them , and over whom they exercise control . It is generally held by those who come before them that more leniency may be expected from these unpaid magistrates than would be shown by paid magistrates . The clergy of the Church of England are State officials , for marriage and funeral purposes , and , together with the church wardens , control church property . They are also ex-officio chairmen of their respective vestries , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are often , also , under certain trust deeds , trustees of the schools and Parish charities and not infrequently exofficio chairmen of the Trustees , or School Managers . The clergy of the time of Swift , Sterne and Addison were not precisely of the gentleman class . They were placed below the salt , and often mated with the upper servants . There seems to be a falling off again now in the quality of the inferior clergy . I know of a neighbor 's nursemaid who is engaged to a curate . They no longer occupy the position of influence of half a century ago . This may not be wholly local , for no one can doubt the decreased influence of the clergy of New England in the last fifty years . Up to and during the time of the struggle between North and South in America , the Unitarian of New England , and the Presbyterian and Dutch Reform ministers elsewhere , were not only the moral but the civil leaders of the people . One can count such clergymen now on the fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harvard , ex-President Cleveland , Mr. Joseph Choate , have carried far more weight in their own local affairs and in the country at large , than any clergyman I can mention , unless it be perhaps Bishop Potter , and Rev. Dr. Edward Everett Hale when in the full vigor of his powers . It is by no means intended to be inferred from this statement that the bulk of the clergy are not hard-working or without influence . In the country districts they are valuable public servants , and , according to their willingness , lend a hand here , there and everywhere . But , with many exceptions of course , they receive nowadays more of social rank from their position as clergymen than they bring to that position . One often hears the lament that it is not easy to get a curate who is a gentleman ? using that word , of course , in its limited technical sense understood in England . The temptation to men of a certain social grade and of moderate abilities to go into the church is of course great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become members of a profession which gives them a standing that neither their birth nor their intellectual powers would have won for them in any other way . This is true also in America , where there are hundreds of ministers of all denominations who owe their position to their profession and who would at once sink out of sight were they not buoyed up by their profession . Though it is both in England and America the noblest calling of the noble , it is also largely used as a refuge by the incompetent and the contemptible . No man has a right there who is not man enough to hold his own anywhere . There are still examples in England of parsons who are only clergymen in name ; men who wear the uniform but who not only hunt , but are masters of packs of foxhounds themselves ; men who shoot , and farm , and are what Sydney Smith described as half county squire and half parson , under the name of " Squarsons . " One of these died only the other day who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say perfunctorily Benedictus benedicat before meals , but beyond that their clerical duties are purely formal . This stamp of cleric is dying out , though it may be doubted whether the clerical snob , without public school or university behind him , is an improvement or even an equiva/ lent . There are men in this English town whose fathers well remember a certain rector who went home from the tap-room of The Swan every Saturday night with his legs in a wabbly state of drunkenness , whatever may have been the condition of his head . That type of man has , of course , disappeared never to return . The fact that the clergyman is in an independent position as regards his parishioners , since he is not looking to them either for his salary or for retention in his place , gives him a freedom that is valuable . However much of a heretic a man may be , he may admit that the Church of England and the Roman Catholics have much to be said in praise of their adherence to the logically sound arrangement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to those whom he teaches , for his means of subsistence . There are numbers of men whom we all know , both in England and in America , who are entirely unhampered by this awkward relation . On the other hand , what is more contemptible than the position of many ministers who know , and whose flocks know , that they are hanging on to their positions for their daily bread , and who are as fearful of the frown or disapproval of the local knot of richer men in their congregations who bear the bulk of the parish expenses as though they were lean hounds in a kennel ? But whatever their faults , the English clergy do a large amount of detail work that no one else is called upon to do in these country towns and villages . Indeed , the three marked differences between life in an English and an American country town are : the absence of foreigners , the amount of work done by unpaid officials , and the remarkable dulness , awkwardness and inarticulateness of the lower classes . The mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us say , a County Magistrate , and the ordinary laborer , is greater , far greater , than between any two Americans in similar positions in an American town . There has been little or no chance for education . In 1870 the age for compulsory school attendance was fixed at ten ; it was raised in 1893 to eleven , and in 1899 to twelve . As late as 1901 , out of every ten thousand children attending school , the number who remained after the age of twelve was only 4,900 , and in 1906 it was only 5,900 . As a test of what boys acquired and remembered after leaving school , the head of a large labor bureau submitted all boys between sixteen and eighteen to a simple examination . They were asked to do some perfectly simple sums , and to copy in their own handwriting a few lines of print . The result showed that one-fourth could write moderately , one-fourth fairly and one-half " wrote in quite a disgraceful manner . " As to arithmetic , 10 per cent . answered the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 per cent . neither of them . Such people must necessarily leave their governing and their guidance in all affairs of importance to others . One would go far and search long to find a town in Massachusetts without its free public library , and a good one at that . Similar opportunities for reading are almost unknown in the English towns of the type I am describing , and there is little demand for them . Newspapers and magazines are in every house in the American town , but only in a comparatively few families in the English town is there any continued reading of even such ephemeral literature as that . There has been no opportunity to take any part in political affairs either local or national . The local tap-room is the laborer 's only forum , and the fields he cultivates , or the beasts he tends , limit his experience ; and as a result the lowest class of laborers in English country neighborhoods , English though they be , are in a condition of intellectual apathy that positively startles the American when he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a population slightly over six thousand , there are some nine hundred voters , but there is a surprisingly large number of men of the proper age to vote who are disfranchised by the provisions already mentioned as to financial qualifications . It may surprise American readers to learn that there is a very large male population in England who are still , despite recent reforms , wholly deprived of . any participation in government by lack of the necessary financial qualification . In that sense England is very far from being a free country . As we have noted elsewhere , the total population of England and Wales at the last census ( 1901 ) was 32,527,843 . Of @#  |p500  these 15,728,613 were males , and of these again 6,697,075 were males of twenty-one years of age or over . At the elections in 1907 the number of registered electors was : Counties , 3,428,721 ; Boroughs , 2,553,144 ; Universities , 19,068 , or a total of 6,000,933 . There were , therefore , 696,142 males twenty-one years of age and over who were not registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this because the census is of 1901 , while the electors are of 1907 . No doubt some are not registered through neglect , though very few escape from the fine net drawn through every election district by the professional election agents . It is probably , therefore , not far wrong to say that out of a male population twenty-one years of age and over numbering 7,000,000 , 700,000 were not registered as voters , most of them probably because they were not qualified to vote . In the county town of Shrewsbury , for example , with a population of 28,395 at the last census , the number of Parliamentary voters was 4,819 , divided as follows : ratepayers , 4,423 ; lodgers , 164 ; service , 128 ; freemen , 1o4 ; with 1,301 women entitled to vote for municipal officers . In the last Parliamentary election there actually voted out of the 4,819 , 4,350 . This does not weigh heavily upon those who are thus deprived of the ballot . They are quite without ambition ? this does not refer to factory towns ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guttural , indistinct kind that one usually associates with people partially dumb . Their vocabulary is of the smallest , and their mental pace tortoisian . This appeals to the stranger , the American stranger at least , because he knows no such type among those of his own race at home . Where he meets with stupidity and political disability , it is among the lower class of foreigners , but here are families who have lived side by side perhaps for centuries , the one in the squire 's house , the other in the laborer 's cottage , yet the difference between them mentally and politically is as was the difference between the Southern planter and the hands in his cotton-fields . There is little fear of exaggerating the opiumonic dulness and apathy among this class , although I appreciate that the Englishman who is accustomed to it may wonder that the stranger finds it so noticeable . It is one of those national traits that the fresh eye and ear must be trusted to describe more accurately than may the eye and ear of the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type is uneducated , inarticulate , inaudible , and grotesquely awkward both mentally and physically . But he has his small political value , for he is always and unalterably for no change ! He grumbles , but his grumbling means little , and effects nothing , and plays no more part in the affairs of the world than does an accidental tap on the big drum in the music of an orchestra . There is a fierce controversy at the date of this writing ( 1908 ) over a new Licensing Bill . One sees on every side placards announcing that " Your beer will cost more ! " At the same time the bill is called " confiscatory , " and that it will ruin the holders of brewery shares is announced . In addition to this it is claimed that it does not promote temperance . I am no political oracle , but he must be dull indeed who can swallow these three statements together , viz. , that beer will cost more , that just as much beer will be drunk , and that the breweries will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to analyze . " All still and silent ? far and near ! Only the ass with motion dull , Upon the pivot of his skull Turns round his long left ear . " There is absolutely nothing like him in America , and he must be seen , and heard , and watched in his native lair to be understood or appreciated . He is useful in doing the heavy work of farm and field , but politically and intellectually he is more like one of his string of stout draught-horses than like a modern man of our race . What is steadiness in the upper classes droops into sheer stupidity in the lower classes . It is their apathy that accounts to some extent for the entire lack of feverish excitement over temporary troubles which characterizes us Americans . One would suppose that there were no storms , murders , poisoned food , in this country , while in America we revel in these and other tragedies . Who in America , for example , knows of the Derby pork-pie epidemic in 1902 , when two hundred and twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester arsenical beer episode of 1900 , in which over six thousand persons were slowly poisoned ?  |p501  In the last annual report of the Local Government Board , which relates to the year 1906-7 , it is stated that the number of ' samples analyzed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in 1966 was 90,504 , of which 8,466 , or 9.3 per cent. , were certified to be adulterated . Who in America knows that ? But who in all the world was not made to hear about Chicago 's canned beef ! Our rustic Englishman even heard those mischievously exaggerated reports from Chicago , and probably thanked God he was not as other men are , as he said grace over his poisoned pie and his arsenical beer . We Americans are accustomed to the exaggerated retailing of our faults and misdeeds even from public men in high places . Our common-school sophisticated people rather enjoy the excitement . They are not educated up to the point of appreciating its immaturity and lack of perspective , but they are wide awake enough to be interested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would not be stirred in the least ; while the governing class , trained and disciplined , would ignore such exuberance as bad form . It is quite our own fault , and not a matter for surprise , therefore , if , when we are thus advertised , the country people with whom I am now dealing look upon us in America as being an excitable , rather untrustworthy people , holding nothing sacred , and with little personal pride or elevated patriotism . If there is a difference in the alertness of the people , there is also , it must be admitted , a difference in their leaders , who would , and who do , consider it disgraceful to advertise themselves at the expense of the blunders , or even the sins , of their countrymen . Though one may look askance at the political and educational condition of this class of the English populace , one can have little but admiration for the thousands of Englishmen who work away year in and year out at the details of local government in England . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the machinery of their government , are entirely managed by the voluntary labors of those with the wealth , leisure and ability to do so . They sit as Magistrates , they govern the towns as Councillors and Aldermen , they look after the roads , sanitation , water sup- ply , lighting , schools , poorhouses , and are expected by the powers that be in Parliament to put into and keep in working order educational and licensing enactments ; and recently , the whole reorganization of the territorial forces , or new Army Bill , and the putting into effect of the Small Holdings Act , are to be largely entrusted to them for their successful operation . That they undertake all these duties , that they do them so well , and with so little ? almost no ? friction , and with so little dissatisfaction to those whom they thus govern , is , I am inclined to think , the most impressive feature of English life . They are called " the Great Unpaid , " and the name is truthful rather than humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or District Commissioners of Taxes , and collect the income tax , while quite independent of party and holding their appointments directly from Parliament . All Justices of the Peace are ex-officio commissioners . The land tax is also collected by unpaid commissioners . Of the County Councils having under their control lunatic asylums , bridges , main roads , which are responsible for the county rate , I have written . Chairmen of Quarter Sessions also try all cases not necessarily going before Judges of Assize , and hear appeals from Justices of the Peace at Sessions . More than a hundred hospitals in London and the country are administered by governors and committees , as are the British Museum , the National and Portrait Galleries and many others . Royal commissions and departmental committees do an immense amount of work . Lord Beaconsfield said : " The government of this country is considerably carried on by the aid of Royal Commissions . So great is the increase of public business that it would be probably impossible for a Minister to carry on affairs without this assistance . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commands the most varied talents for the successful administration of the affairs of London . All of these men are unpaid in money and scarcely even receive very wide recognition , let alone applause . The School Board alone in London spend nearly $18,000,000 a year , and have under their management some 750,000 children  |p502  and 10,000 masters and mistresses . The managers of these schools give their services , and in addition look after the schools of cookery , laundry work , manual training , gymnastics , swimming-schools , home nursing , asylums for the mentally defective , blind-schools , truant-schools , pupil-teachers ' schools and so on . No country in the world receives so much and such valuable service from its leisure classes ? or rather its upper classes , since many of these men are already professionally engaged , or busy with large private affairs . The large landholdings , the concentration of wealth , the position and privilege accorded to birth and breeding , are thus in some sort compensated for . The most superficial student realizes that these people would not countenance an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies the secret of the permanence of the English classes in these days of rule by the masses . On the whole , they pay , and pay with strenuous and honest service , for what they receive . The paper* on " Who are the English ? " outlined the historical forces , or genealogy , of this system of unpaid self-government . If the ownership of the land in a few hands , and the aggregation of wealth in a few hands , are evils , this wonderful system of efficient unpaid local government goes some way to palliate them . The saving of expense to the taxpayer must be enormous , and it may well be set down as unquestionably true that the work is far better done than it could be by a paid staff of political servants . Administration , whether at home or abroad , is apparently the birthright of the well-trained Englishman . When one sees at close quarters how admirably he keeps his own house in order , one is the less surprised at his hitherto unparalleled success as a colonizer and administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in friction and chicanery unending ; while common-sense without law becomes mere paternalism tempered by tyranny . The happy medium is the application of the law by common-sense , and nowhere may this be seen to better advantage than here . Imagine the British Empire administered for a year by Frenchmen ! If it were not for the horror of what would follow to innocent people , nothing @# could be more grotesquely ludicrous . The results to the humorist would be even more illuminating than should the English undertake to do the dressmaking and millinery work of the French . I venture to say that nothing in the whole realm of estheticism could be more awful than that . Even so complicated a measure as the new Small Holdings Act , which , roughly described , is a bill to enable persons without land in England and Wales to become possessed of a certain number of acres by proper payments , the land of course to be leased or purchased outright from the larger landowners , has been turned over to the County Councillors to work out . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a taking and giving of property might entail , one must needs envy in a measure a nation where there is a competent body of unpaid workers willing to undertake so distasteful and so technically difficult a task . This very day there appears in the Morning Post the following advertisement : EMPIRE MOVEMENT Ladies and Gentlemen of independent means are invited to offer their services gratis for the promotion of the " Empire Movement " at home and throughout the Empire . No expenses paid . Formation of local permanent Committees , distribution of literature , etc. ? Address : Earl of Meath , 83 , Lancaster Gate , London , W. The italics are the letter-writer 's . To what extent this appeal in a morning paper will be answered I have of course no means of knowing , but it is a pertinent and timely proof of what has been said in regard to the faith of the Britisher in the existence and willingness of the unpaid and unprofessional worker to take additional burdens upon his shoulders . At any rate , it will probably result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to undertake gratuitously . They do not confine their interest and their activities to official matters of administration . In such semi-public matters as hospitals , agricultural and flower shows , cricket and rowing and football , and provident clubs , golf , and here and there polo clubs , they not only support and encourage , but they participate . Their interests of this kind are even greater and more varied than in the public work which is done under the law . It is  |p503  this genuine and wholesome good-fellowship between all classes which tempers the strict social demarcations . There are classes to be sure , but the classes all belong , and take pride in making it evident that they do belong , to one all-powerful class , which is England . The more prominent one is by birth , wealth or position , the more it is looked upon as incumbent upon such a one to take an active part in local and national affairs . The masses have grown to feel that they can depend upon the classes to lead , and to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic in certain ways , it is still very evident that the Englishman likes a gentleman to lead him . I am told that in the army this is made unmistakably evident . It is not mere snobbery , though there may be a touch of it ; but it is the centuries-old instinct of the English to have faith in noblesse oblige as a real factor in life . There died only lately a shy , awkward Englishman , of great name and great estates , to whom it was a kind of torture to speak in public , to whom it meant hours of drudgery to master problems of State . He became the most trusted of English statesmen . When people spoke of " The Duke , " it meant the Duke of Devonshire . He was never in the least shifty , or ingratiating , or amenable to even the lofty bribes of office or ambition . He held a brief for England , and made no fuss about it . He was typical of the class which , numbering its thousands far less conspicuous than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duty . When England arrives at her Pass at Thermopyle , this large class will have to be reckoned with , and I venture to prophesy that there will not be even one left to tell the news , if things go against them . This sense of duty to England , when exercised by the English abroad , takes on an air of aggressiveness and superciliousness which has often been noted by foreigners . As a matter of fact they are unimaginative administrators , rather than supercilious . They look upon themselves as sentinels of a kind of Anglican Almighty whether at home or abroad , and the stiffness of their deportment should be forgiven them , rather than held up against them . A man who has India at arm 's length and Ireland squealing at his feet , must needs be robust and matter-of-fact , rather than nervous and an idealist , if he is to sleep nights . As an example of devotion to duty I cite the case of an English gentleman of comfortable income who , finding when the South African war broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as a farrier or blacksmith . He had learned horseshoeing as an amusement as a youth , and was , and is , an amateur in gold and silver and iron work . He shod horses until his value for other duties was recognized , and he came home a major , having been twice wounded . What can Ireland , or Germany , or other enemies do against a nation whose gentlemen are made of such stuff as that ! Of the smaller domestic social life in the town itself , the variations are so many that it would be quite impossible to make an inclusive category without weariness to both writer and reader . There are musical and debating and mutual improvement societies , and these are becoming more and more common , and they flourish or not according to the talent available . One marked difference between the English and the American town is the part played by the local churches in the American towns . They are often the centre of the amusements of the town . Around them grow the literary and musical and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnics , and suppers , are often part of the regular programme of church work . According as the local pastor is energetic and of varied talents , social and literary , these activities flourish . In England this is not the custom . The people in the town itself lunch and dine together , and on a much smaller scale keep the social ball rolling along much the same lines as their wealthier neighbors of greater social position . I well remember my astonishment , at the first dinner given to some ten or a dozen neighbors who had been civil to us , to find in the hall where hats , coats and wraps had been left , various rolls of music of different sizes and descriptions . I hastily informed the hostess of this discovery . Our duty-loving English guests had come prepared to do their share toward the general entertainment after dinner . This was before the days of bridge playing , and what happens now I know not . But at that Ii  |p504  time each one came prepared to sing or play for the edification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as elsewhere , my experience teaches , is not an aid to digestion ; and to the ultra-sensitive it may even be a test of patience ; but the English are duty-doing rather than artistic , and an amiable host forgets of course certain painful laryngeal exercises in his appreciation of the unselfish desire of a guest to do his , or her , share toward the general entertainment . The English dinner-party , in the provincial towns and cities at any rate , is a heavy , prolonged and rather lugubrious affair . One feels sometimes as though it would be neither surprising nor inappropriate should one suddenly hear a voice saying : " Brethren , let us pray ! " In England , as elsewhere , little people give bad big dinners , and big people give nice little dinners . It was considered proper in Northbridge to give rather pretentious dinners of many courses , with servants added to the staff for the evening . I have seen on more than one occasion the groom , in livery of belt , breeches and boots , assisting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that the dinners were given apparently as a social duty , and as a return for similar courtesies received during the year , rather than as an attempt at display . It adds something of both ludicrousness and lugubriousness to a dinner to hear the assistant of the local undertaker , who is serving as a waiter for the evening , whisper to your host who has ordered your glass refilled with champagne : " There ai n't no more , sir ! " Even if one be still thirsty , the incident is forgotten , however , in the knowledge that your host is doing his best in your honor . There is little exuberance or elasticity in provincial hospitality , though it is as kindly and generous as anywhere in the world . They labor under the disadvantage of certain racial characteristics , which , while they make administrators of the finest quality , do not produce entertainers . I can imagine that the Duke of Devonshire himself was probably not a scintillating host , and no doubt England thanks God that he was not , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind as a contrast , there was no attempt , even , by people of similar means and position to live up to any such social standard as that of dinner-giving on any scale whatever . Strange as it seems , having in mind the smallness geographically of England and the ease with which one may go from place to place , the English town is more an entity and less dependent upon neighboring large towns and cities than is the case in America . The people in Northbridge keep within their own borders more , and depend more upon themselves for such amusements , recreations and social enjoyments as they have , than would hold true of an American town . Here , as elsewhere , they cultivate the faculty of being sufficient unto themselves , and display that resourcefulness in small matters which distinguishes them in large affairs . Here again , too , their climate influences their way of living . I doubt if there was one man in a hundred in Northbridge , under seventy-five and not a pauper , who was not an active participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket , tennis , golf , rowing ? and many in addition interesting themselves in the local militia , volunteers or yeomanry . Some part of every day in the year they can be , and are , out of doors . While in Bear 's Cove more time is given to , and more interest taken in , novel or reading clubs , in Northbridge outdoor sport claims more time and keener interest . While from the economic point of view it may be regretted that the land is so unequally distributed , from the point of view of the inhabitants of a country town it is a most agreeable and convenient arrangement . The land is all cultivated , and the fields and woods and country lanes are in and of themselves a vast park , open to all so long as there is no disturbance of the game and the cattle . And what a park it is ! This soft , dreamy , drowsy , English country-side , in the summer months at least , is the fairest setting in the world for a holiday , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and for many of the differences between an American and an English country town . Perhaps the main , the fundamental difference between the two is after all that the English , being less imaginative , and with fewer opportunities , and hence with less incentive to change their social or financial status , seem to the American to be more Easter 505  |p505  contented , more peaceable and calm ? the unsympathetic American might phrase it as duller , less enterprising . These country town people are seemingly striving to live as did their fathers and grandfathers ; in America the restlessness is the result of the strife on the part of most people to have a portion of the wealth , the good fortune , the opportunities , of their grandchildren . The Englishman looks back for his standard , and makes tradition and precedent serve as guide ; the American looks forward , scans eagerly the far horizon of the future , rebels against old customs , against the ways of the grandfathers , scoffs at caution , and lives as much as , - he can in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard it is to increase his capital ; the American all too often lives upon his capital and looks upon the opportunity to participate in the enormous increase of natural wealth of his country as a more or less assured income . The Englishman prosaically tries to live upon what he has ; the American lives upon what he thinks he deserves , upon what he expects . One can readily see how this fashions differently the setting of life . The one results in calm , in contentment , or , at any rate , a forced contentment which imitates the reality ; the other results in an attitude of expectancy , of constant striving and restless watchfulness . The American even in a country town is surrounded on all sides by the evidences of what twenty-five years of Future have done ; the Englishman is surrounded , on the contrary , on all sides by what hundreds of years of Past have done . The American naturally enough leans forward ; the Englishman leans back . We a1 know which is the more alert position of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is trying to keep what he has , the other is trying to wring what he can from the future . The one plays with what he has ; the other gambles for what he wants . The one tries to make himself comfortable in last year 's nest ; the other is looking for the best place to build himself another nest , better and bigger than the old one . The country town in England and in America differ accordingly . In the one they are making the best of what they have inherited ; in the other they are mainly solicitous about what is to come . The house of the Englishman is being mellowed and smoothed down . More vines and roses grow on it every year . The house of the American is in a constant state of repair , of being added to , of being improved . Both to the eye and to all the other senses the one spells repose , quiet ; the other advertises activity and restlessness . Each prefers his own . Fortunately it is no business of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near accuracy in noting the differences , I have satisfied my own purposes . p
