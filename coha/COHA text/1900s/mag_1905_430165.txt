 | THE WAR BY CAPTAIN A. Z ILLUSTRATIONS BY STANLEY M. Al XI* THE CAMPAIGN OF 1814 ON THE NORTHERN FRONTIER AND SEABOARD HE particular feature which differentiated the campaign of 1814 from those of the two preceding years was that through the downfall of Napoleon the British Government was enabled to send a large body of veteran troops to America . Formal peace with France under the restored Bourbons was signed May 3oth . On June 2d a division intended for operations in the Chesapeake sailed from Bordeaux , reaching Bermuda July 25th . In the same month reenforcements began to arrive in Canada ; the effective strength under Sir George Prevost rising , by the official returns , from 16,117 in June to 29,437 in August . There was at the opening of the season still a period of opportunity for the American arms , had the Government been efficient . Instead of gaining , however , it appeared rather to have lost , through discouragement , such small portions of military vigor and sagacity as had at any time belonged to it . Circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not materially increased up to July 1 , 1814 , but its own also had received no sensible augmentation ; and the British position on the Niagara frontier was decisively better than it had been , through the possession of the forts on both sides of the river 's mouth . By this they not only had safer anchorage for the fleet , but , still more important , the power of passing reenforcements at will , and secretly , from one shore to the other . An American general operating on the Niagara peninsula was thus in continual danger of having his landwise communica-@# OF I 8 I 2 ' . MAHAN , U.S.N.

On Lake Champlain conditions were no better . It will suffice to quote the words of General Izard , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on this ( New York ) side of Lake Champlain , produce an aggregate force of more than two thousand effectives , and these raw , ill-clad , and worse disciplined . The brigade in Vermont is not proportionally stronger . " On the seacoast also , conditions from the defensive point of view remained essentially as they had been . The news of approaching British reenforcements , and the reports of operations projected against the principal seaports , stirred up the people to take local precautions for defence ; the General Government having neither the means nor the energy to accomplish the work of protection assigned to it by the Constitution . In an hour of emergency , private enterprise and individual contributions of money and labor were evoked to effect , under the guidance of committees of defence , that which the responsible government of the nation through a dozen years had neglected to do . One good result was produced by the universal uneasiness and apprehension . The sense of national danger , of the projects of territorial acquisition entertained by the British Government , aroused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through discontent with the measures of the government , and lack of respect for its capacity , as shown in the conduct of the war and of the preceding negotiations . The campaign of 1813 in the North had closed with Wilkinson 's army going into cantonments in November , at French IOI  | Mills , on the New York frontier . It there remained till February , 1814 , when the larger part removed to Plattsburg and to Burlington , Vermont ; but General Brown with some two thousand was sent to Sackett 's Harbor . The Champlain division remained inactive ; but in March Brown received orders from the Secretary of ' War , Armstrong , to make an attempt upon Kingston , if at all feasible , while the ice still held on the St. Lawrence . To mask this purpose , he was sent a different set of instructions , which he was to let transpire . These dwelt upon the humiliation of seeing Fort Niagara in the hands of the enemy , and mentioned that General Winfield Scott had been sent to western New York to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be insufficient , Brown was to reenforce him with the two thousand men brought from French Mills . Upon receipt of these papers Brown consulted with Chauncey , and they decided that to attempt Kingston would be inexpedient with less than four thousand troops . These were not to be had at Sackett 's . Brown then fell into the not unnatural mistake of construing Armstrong 's separate instructions as alternatives ; and , as Kingston was out of the question , he determined to go to Niagara . On the way he was visited by doubts as to the correctness of his course ; but in the end he persisted , and carried his division to Batavia , where it arrived before April 1st . The entire force in western New York was then concentrated for organization and drill under Scott , who made of it the most efficient body that fought during the war under the United States flag . General Gaines was put in charge of the Sackett 's Harbor district , Brown himself retaining general command of the whole Lake Ontario line . This march to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It disconcerted , finally , Armstrong 's projects against Kingston , which he had all along recognized to be the position of paramount importance on the lakes . The movement was , moreover , open to the objection of being ex-centric ; the distance between the armies of Champlain and Ontario being increased to an extent which prevented concentration upon the really vital section of the enemy 's line , ? the St. Lawrence River from Kingston to Montreal , or , indeed , co-operation of any kind . The Secretary took the disappointment good-humoredly , and proceeded to reconstruct his plans . Not least among the objections to the diversion of this number of men from Sackett 's was the consequent danger to that important station . Early in April Chauncey received correct information that General Drummond had gathered three thousand troops , with a number of small transports , to attack the place if the American fleet left it . The Commodore feared the attempt might be made even in the presence of the fleet ; for " there are not a thousand effective men here besides the sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Brown and Chauncey , were agreed that four thousand men were necessary , and as that number could not be collected , they decided to direct their effort against Oswego . Yeo , on April 14th , had launched two new ships , of fifty and fortyeight guns respectively , and these gave him for the time so far the superiority that Chauncey would not venture out . This momentary command of the lake was especially menacing to the Americans , because the preceding winter had been so mild , and the roads consequently so bad , as seriously to impede land communication with Sackett 's . All supplies were retarded , but heavy guns could not go forward at all . They therefore had to be sent by the water route of the Mohawk , Lake Oneida , and the Oswego River . Quantities of stores had thus accumulated at Oswego , where they were very inadequately protected ; but the guns were held back at the falls , ten miles above , and could be reached by the enemy only if in large force . On May 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the American interests at the east end of the lake were exposed , had returned to Sackett 's ; and , suspecting the enemy 's purpose , had sent to defend Oswego a small detachment of 290 men . These , with the seamen present , offered a spirited resistance ; but they were heavily outnumbered , and the necessity of preserving the guns in the rear compelled them to retreat to positions where that object could be more certainly assured . The British occupied the town , and on retiring next day carried with them over two thousand barrels of provisions , besides a quantity of cordage and two  | small schooners . Nine heavy cannon were also captured ; but the bulk of the armament for the new ships approaching corn pletion remained untouched at the falls . The enemy 's control of the lake made the forwarding of these difficult . Yeo immediately placed his squadron across the entrance to Black Bay , within which lies Sackett 's Harbor . " This is the first time , " wrote Chauncey , " that I have experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There remained the resource of bringing the guns by water to an inlet south of Sackett 's , and exterior to the British blockade , called Stoney Creek , the head of which was within three miles of the Harbor . This hazardous operation , carefully planned and contrived , was brilliantly executed ; and in its course entailed upon the British a defeat particularly mortifying and inconvenient . Nineteen batteaux were assembled at Oswego Falls , and there loaded with thirty-four heavy guns and several cables . When preparation was complete , on May 28th , a lookout boat from the town reconnoitred the lake , well to the eastward , and the batteaux were run over the falls , reaching Oswego at sunset . Here 150 riflemen were taken on board . The coast being reported clear , the expedition started at dark , hugging the shore closely , and at daylight entered Salmon River , having made twenty miles . One batteau , however , was missing . A party of 120 Oneida Indians now joined , and moved along shore in company during the next stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoy entered at noon of the 29th , and anchored two miles from the outlet to await instructions ; nearness to the enemy necessitating greater circumspection . The strayed batteau had been captured ; and Yeo , learning thus of the movement , sent in pursuit a division of armed boats . When these arrived off the Big Sandy , on the morning of May 3oth , the masts of the batteaux were seen not far away ; and the officer in command , Captain Popham , conscious of the importance of their lading , decided to attack at once . He pulled up the stream with every reasonable precaution , clearing the banks with grape from his guns ; but a half mile below the anchorage the riflemen and Indians successfully ambushed his flotilla , and compelled its surrender after a sturdy resistance . Of 183 officers and men , 14 were killed and 28 wounded . That the Americans lost but two wounded shows that the responsible officers had provided a force adequate to the gravity of the enterprise , and had handled it with care and skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not stop supplies , and on June 6th retired to Kingston . After consultation with Drummond he decided that , in view of the approaching superiority of the American squadron , the guns of which had arrived , and also of the fact that in the autumn his new roe-gun ship would be ready , it was not expedient now to contest directly the control of the lake . He wrote : " The enemy are not in sufficient force to undertake any expedition in the face of our present squadron , but any disaster on our side might give them a serious ascendency . " The British main fleet therefore remained quiet behind the guns of Kingston during the summer ; materially helped in so doing by Chauncey 's inactivity , which provided them with no motive for action . On June 7th the Cabinet of the United States framed a general plan of campaign , based upon the conditions so far stated . It assumed that Chauncey could co-operate actively by June 15th , and on June 8th he himself said that he would be ready by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reenforcements arrived before the loth , and on the 24th he wrote that he would sail the first week in July . The Secretary of War estimated that by then 5000 regulars and 3000 volunteers could be assembled at Niagara , under Brown . The Cabinet , as is usual , undertook too much . The principal effort was to be by the north shore of Lake Erie . Brown , escorted by the fleet in those waters , was to land at some place between the Niagara River and Long Point , eighty miles west , and thence march across the peninsula against Burlington Heights , at the head of Ontario , where the British in 1813 had twice successfully made head against the American advance . This position carried , the army would move along the north shore of Ontario against York , its flank covered by Chauncey 's squadron , which also , by controlling the lake , would maintain the supplies and reenforcements commonly embraced under the word  | " communications . " Subsidiary to this principal undertaking , a force of heavy armed boats was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British supplies arriving from Montreal ; and a minor expedition , naval and military , was to be sent against Mackinac . To the latter the Secretary of War strenuously objected . Mackinac , he said , can not stand , if we occupy the Niagara peninsula and Lake Ontario . He was right ; the troops sent on this fruitless mission should have been used to strengthen the army at Niagara . When the moment of action came , Brown 's muster-rolls showed 4780 men , of whom 830 were militia . To such proportions had fallen the 8000 of the Secretary 's estimate . On July 1st there were present for duty only 3500 , besides 600 Indians . For some reason , possibly the smallness of the force , the line of action chosen by the Cabinet was not followed . On the night of July 2d the Americans crossed the Niagara a little below its outlet from Lake Erie . Fort Erie , feebly garrisoned , surrendered next day . On July 4th , Brown moved north toward Fort George , which he proposed to besiege , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the advance , the enemy retiring without serious opposition . On the 5th , Scott was encamped on the south side of Street 's Creek . Unknown to him , the British were concentrating for attack , two miles north , covered from observation by the Chippewa , a river 15o yards wide , parallel to Street 's Creek ; both entering the Niagara at right angles to its general course . Neither of the opponents was in force between the two streams . The intervening ground was cleared along the Niagara ; but to the American left it was covered with woods , from which sharp-shooters caused some annoyance . Later in the day , a party of militia and Indians were ordered to dislodge these , which was done with apparently little trouble . The weather had been intensely hot , and while this movement in the woods was in progress , Scott decided to improve the cool of the evening with some field exercise . For this purpose he marched his brigade across the creek , but had scarcely done so when he found himself confronted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much inferior to the American aggregate force , all which he believed to be upon the field ; but the past had taught him , in common with his superiors , to make little account of American soldiery . Drummond had written him that liberties might be taken , which would seem hazardous " to a military man unacquainted with the character of the enemy and the events of the last two campaigns . " The militia and Indians , after passing the woods , met his approaching column , and retreated with a rapidity which ended in rout . Scott , equally surprised , deployed under fire with a steadiness which astonished Riall into recognizing that he had before him an organization different from those before encountered . The British came on as men accustomed to conquer ; but the American officer , extending his flanks at the price of leaving between them a wide interval , threw forward his left and brought upon the enemy a cross fire , in which his troops showed the superiority of their marksmanship . Then , taking the offensive , they charged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outflanked , were driven together in confusion , and the whole forced to retreat . Scott 's description was that " the wings of the enemy , being outflanked , and in some measure doubled upon , were mouldered away like a rope of sand . " This battle of Chippewa was intrinsically a small affair . The force engaged on either side was substantially equal . Each numbered about 1500 , the Americans being very slightly the fewer . The losses in killed and wounded were , British , 369 ; Americans , 295 . The figures speak for the severity of the fighting , which characterized also the whole of this campaign ; to which only , in the War of 1812 , Americans could point as proving conclusively the fighting possibilities inherent in their race , suitably organized and drilled . The degree of satisfaction given at the time may be inferred from the fact that two ships-of-the line , laid down by Chauncey at Sackett 's the following winter , bore the names respectively of New Orleans and Chippewa . After this affair , Brown advanced rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he threw a garrison , and thence to Twenty Mile Creek , that distance west of the fort , on the lake shore . Brown followed , and on July loth wrote urgently to Chauncey to come and co-operate with  | him ; but the caution , which formed so disproportionate an element in the military character of the naval commander , combined at this moment with severe illness to deter him entirely from moving . Notwithstanding his assurance of taking the lake in the first week of July , he remained at Sackett 's throughout the month . The reasons alleged were inadequate . The letters of the Secretary of the Navy show an entire understanding of the various opportunities open to the squadron , in order to support Brown ; but he refrained from giving specific instructions to the officer on the spot , in whom his confidence had not been shaken by the impotent results of the previous year , nor by their contrast with Perry 's instant and decisive action . Left to his own discretion , Chauncey idled July in port ; while to Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied that it was impossible to co-operate , because the fleet could not get nearer than two miles to Fort George , and the army had not reached the lake shore . He underestimated extravagantly the assistance he could have given by stopping reenforcements and supplies to the British on the peninsula . He was so far superior to Yeo that he could have placed before Kingston a force equal to that within , and yet have spared to the head of the lake vessels sufficient to embarrass immensely the operations of the enemy . The proof of this is that he actually did so in August , and that the British commanders in July were tormented with fears that he might intervene . " Without the valuable aid of the Navy in transporting troops and stores , " wrote Drummond , " I certainly should not have been able to attempt offensive operations so soon after my arrival . " The offensive operations alluded to were those which issued in the battle of Lundy 's Lane . Brown had advanced to the neighborhood of Fort George , and there made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly alarmed , and on July 22 ( 1 sent pressing messages to Drummond ; but on the afternoon of the same day was able to report that the Americans had fallen back to Queenston . There , the next morning , Brown received word from Gaines at Sackett 's Harbor , that there was no chance of the navy assuring him the siege guns needed to operate against Fort George , and that no one knew when the squadron would sail . He then determined to retire still farther , to the Chippewa , abreast of Fort Schlosser , where his depots were . His intention was to make a dash direct at Burlington after replenishing . At this moment Drummond , hitherto detained at Kingston , reached York . Receiving Riall 's letters , he determined at once to utilize the free use of the water , abandoned to him by Chauncey , to send reenforcements to Fort Niagara , and thence strike at Brown 's communications on the United States side . Riall was instructed to support the movement by a demonstration on the Canada side . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person on the 24th . When he arrived , on the morning of the 25th , he found conditions which induced him so far to change the plan , that Riall 's became the main attack , and the advance against the depots a diversion only . Brown 's retrograde movement had begun when he received news of the enemy 's advance on the New York side . He conceived that the surest way to stop it was to return himself against the British positions at Queenston , and Scott 's brigade was ordered in that direction . As it turned the bend at the Falls , signs of the enemy were seen . Half a mile beyond enters the cross road known as Lundy 's Lane . It was lined with troops superior in number to those encountered equally suddenly at Chippewa . Scott hesitated an instant ; but , fearing the effect upon the other brigades if he retired , he decided to attack , sending Brown word . Throwing the weight of his force upon the British left , next the river , he drove it back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the result , the pushing back of the enemy on this flank gradually brought them across the lane instead of along it ; and when the remaining American brigades arrived they formed in order parallel to the enemy , their backs to the Niagara , Scott on the right . Like Chippewa , Lundy 's Lane is noticeable chiefly for the stern resolution shown on both sides . " In so determined a manner were the attacks directed against our guns , " reported Drummond , " that our artillery men were bayoneted in the act of loading , and the muzzles of the enemy 's guns were advanced within a few yards of  | ours . " He repeats the statement in other words in his report ; but stronger testimony to the impression produced is his estimate of 5000 , as the force opposed to him . The Americans had present 2644 , of whom 400 were militia . Drummond says that first and last he had not more than 2800 . With these respective totals , the Americans lost , in killed and wounded , 743 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Bladensburg and Lundy 's Lane , occurring a month apart , with men of the same blood , illustrate exactly the difference in military value between crude material and finished product . From the reduction in his numbers Brown could no longer keep the field . He retired to Fort Erie , where he remained shut up by the British . On August 15th , Drummond assaulted the works in force ; but , being repulsed with heavy losses , he settled down to a formal siege , grievously harrassed by Chauncey 's control of the lake . British official correspondence bears abundant testimony to a vigor of American naval action in August and September , which in July might have produced appreciable results . The retirement within the lines of Fort Erie , July 26th , may be taken as marking the definitive abandonment of the offensive on the Canada frontier by the United States . The opportunities of two years had been wasted by inefficiency of force and misdirection of effort . While Brown was campaigning , the reenforcements were rapidly arriving which were to enable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compel the rectification of frontier , by cession of territory , which the British Government desired . Lord Castlereagh , Minister of Foreign Affairs , and the leading representative of the aims of the Cabinet , wrote in his instructions to the Peace Commissioners , August 14 , 1814 : " The views of the Government are strictly defensive . Territory as such is by no means their object ; but , as the weaker Power in North America , Great Britain considers itself entitled to claim the use of the lakes as a military barrier . " The declaration of war by the United States was regarded by most Englishmen as a wanton endeavor to overthrow their immemorial right to the services of their seamen , wherever found ; consequently , the invasion of Canada was an iniquitous attempt to acquire territory under cover of an indefensible pretext . To guard against the renewal of such , the lakes must be considered British waters , to which the American flag should have only commercial access . Territory south of the lakes would not be exacted , " provided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortifications upon , or within a limited distance of , their shores . " " On the side of Lower Canada there should be such a line of demarcation as may establish a direct communication between Quebec and Halifax . " As defined , this would slice off such part of Maine as lay north of the Aroostook River Luckily , although Napoleon had fallen , conditions in Europe were still too unsettled and volcanic to permit Great Britain seriously to weaken her material force there . Two weeks later Castlereagh wrote to the Prime Minister : " Are we prepared to continue war for territorial arrangements ? " " Is it desirable to take the chances of the campaign , and then be governed by circumstances ? " The last sentence defines the policy actually followed ; and the chances went definitely against them when Macdonough destroyed the British fleet on Lake Champlain . Except at New Orleans and Baltimore ? mere defensive successes ? nothing but calamity befell the American arms . To the battle of Lake Champlain it was owing that the British occupancy of United States soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use Wellington 's phrase ? to claim possession was as absurd as for an officer to assert sovereignty over the ground on which he had posted his pickets . The earnestness of the Government , however , in seeking the changes specified , is indicated by the proposition seriously made to the Duke to command in America . Yet another object dictated the character of operations initiated with the increase of force . Resentment for what was considered the unreasonable action of the United States , and impatience of the continuance of war , determined both nation and rulers to give the offending people a lesson which would compel peace on the terms assigned . Gallatin wrote from London in June : " To use their own language , they mean to inflict upon America a chastisement which will teach her that war is not to be declared against Great Britain with impunity.  | This is a very general sentiment with the nation ; and that such are the opinions of the ministry was strongly impressed on the mind of by a late conversation he had with Lord Castlereagh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intimate at St : Petersburg , that he was sorry to say the instructions given to his successor on the American station were very different from those under which he acted , and that he feared very serious injury would be done to America . " To this intent to punish , a specific tinge of bitterness was given by the official purpose to retaliate some unwarrantable ? and unauthorized ? destruction of private or unmilitary property by United States troops in Canada . The weight of this retaliation ? excessive in measure ? fell upon the Chesapeake , the most exposed region , and upon the capital of the offending nation . The capture of Washington was a simple raid , executed in four days , and to the moment of undertaking tentative even in design . It was prosecuted under cover of destroying the American flotilla , under the gallant Commodore Barney , who had been forced to take refuge in the Patuxent River , which enters the Chesapeake twenty miles above the Potomac . The draught of Barney 's boats would permit their retreat to a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen from Washington . Thither they could not be followed by any naval force capable of destroying them without suffering severely ; but a co-operating land detachment would make resistance impossible . There was thus apparent motive for the fleet being accompanied by Ross 's division , which had left Bordeaux in June . Admiral Cochrane wrote : " The Potomac flotilla afforded a pretext , . . . while the ultimate destination was Washington , should it be found that the attempt might be made with any prospect of success . " The combined expedition entered the Patuxent August 18th , the troops numbering over four thousand . On the 21st , Barney , seeing himself cornered , carried off 400 of his men to aid the militia hastily assembling to oppose the invasion . A few hands were left to burn the boats at the last moment . This was done on the 22d ; and at noon of the 24th the British , after an advance presenting only technical points of interest , encountered the armed mob as- sembled at Bladensburg , five miles from Washington . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . The Capitol , White House , and several public buildings , were burned by them ; the navy-yard and vessels by the Americans . Ross , accustomed to European warfare , did not feel Drummond 's easiness in his position , which technically was most insecure . He retreated rapidly on the evening of the 25th , and on the 26th regained touch with the fleet on the Patuxent , after a separation of only four days . Advance and retreat had been made by a force of little over 4000 , through a country which the American Secretary of War described as " covered with wood , and offering at every step strong positions for defence . " Cockburn remarked that there was no molestation of the retreat , " not a single musket having been fired . " It was the culmination of the Administration 's disgrace , unrelieved by any feature of credit except the gallant stand of Barney 's four hundred . Their leader , wounded and incapable of flight , compelled his subordinates to leave him . He remained a captive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delicate attention ; " like a brother , " to use his own words . Only by contrast with the contemporary fight at Lundy 's Lane is Bladensburg rightly appreciated . In its defenders was realized Jefferson 's ideal of a citizen soldiery , unskilled , but strong in their patriotism , flying to arms to oppose an invader . Posted before the centre and heart of national life , they occupied a position strong , though unfortified , upon a hill ; while the enemy had to cross a river , in part fordable , but nevertheless an obstacle to rapid action . There was but one bridge , and that covered by the American artillery , superior to the enemy 's . The bridge was rushed , and then the whole line in rapid succession broke , except Barney 's little battery , which for a few moments compelled respect , though abandoned by its supports . The figures again tell the tale . The victors lost 64 killed , 158 wounded . The defeated , by the estimate of their superintending surgeon , had io or 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual where defendants are behind cover ; but in an open field it shows that the party attacked did not wait to contest the ground . " The @#  | rapid flight of the enemy , " reported Ross , " and his knowledge of the country , precluded the possibility of many prisoners being taken . " Coincident with the capture of Washington , a little British squadron ? two frigates and five smaller vessels ? ascended the Potomac . Fort Washington , a dozen miles below the capital , was abandoned August 27th by the officer in charge , removing the only obstacle due to the foresight of the Government . On the 29th , Captain Gordon , the senior officer , anchored his force before Alexandria , of which he kept possession for three days . Upon withdrawing , he carried away all the seaworthy merchant-men , having loaded them with merchandise awaiting exportation . Energetic efforts were made by Captains Rodgers , Perry , and Porter , of the Navy , to molest the retreat by such means as could be extemporized ; but both ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 killed and 45 wounded . After burning Washington , the British main fleet and army moved up the Chesapeake against Baltimore , which would undoubtedly have undergone the lot of Alexandria , in a contribution laid upon shipping and merchandise . The attack , however , was successfully met . The respite afforded by the expedition against Washington had been improved by the citizens to interpose earthworks on the hills before the city . This local precaution saved the place . The enemy 's march was contested in the field by the militia , who behaved better than at Bladensburg , but showed , nevertheless , the unsteadiness of raw men . To harass the enemy 's advance a body of riflemen had been posted well forward , and a shot from these mortally wounded General Ross ; but , " imagine my chagrin , when I perceived the whole corps falling back upon my main position , having too credulously listened to groundless information that the enemy was landing on Back River to cut them off . " The British approached along the narrow strip of land between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had judiciously selected for his line of defence a neck , where inlets from both streams narrowed the ground to half a mile . His flanks were thus protected , but the water on the left giving better indication of being fordable , the British directed there the weight of the assault . To meet this , Stricker drew up a regiment to the rear of his main line , and at right angles , ? L fashion , ? the volleys from which would sweep the inlet . When the enemy 's attack developed , this regiment " delivered one random fire , " and then broke and fled ; " totally forgetful of the honor of the brigade , and of its own reputation , " to use Stricker 's words . Their flight carried along part of the left flank proper . The remainder of the line held for a time , and then retired without awaiting the hostile bayonet . The American report gives the impression of an orderly retreat ; a British participant , who admits that the ground was well chosen , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that he never witnessed a more complete rout . The invaders then approached the city ; but upon viewing the defences , and learning that the fleet could not co-operate , owing to vessels sunk across the channel , the commanding officer decided that a successful assault would not repay the probable loss . Fleet and army then withdrew . The attacks on Washington and Baltimore , the seizure of Alexandria , and the general conduct of operations in the Chesapeake , belong strictly to the punitive purpose which dictated British measures upon the seaboard . Similar action extended through Long Island Sound , and to the eastward , where alarm in all quarters was maintained by the general enterprise of the enemy , and by specific injury in various places . " The Government has declared war against the mist powerful maritime nation , " wrote the Governor of Massachusetts to the legislature , " and we are disappointed in our expectations of national defence . But though we may be convinced that the war was unnecessary and unjust , and has been prosecuted without any useful or practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been left almost defenceless , yet I presume there will be no doubt of our right to defend our possessions against any hostile attack by which their destruction is menaced . " " The eastern coast , " reports a journal of the time , " is much vexed by the enemy . Having destroyed a great portion of the coasting craft , they seem determined to enter the little outports and villages , and burn everything that @#  | floats . " On April 7th , six British barges ascended the Connecticut River eight miles , to Pettipaug , where they burned twentyodd sea-going vessels . On June 13th , at Wareham , Massachusetts , a similar expedition entered and destroyed sixteen . These were somewhat large instances of an action everywhere going on , inflicting indirectly incalculably more injury than even the direct loss suffered ; the whole being with a view to bring the war close home to the consciousness of the American people . They were to be made to realize the power of the enemy and their own helplessness . In the North , rectification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than punishment was to be practised . Moose Island , on which stands Eastport , in Passamaquoddy Bay , was seized July 11th , " being considered within the boundary line of New Brunswick ; " but protection to individuals and property was promised . In August , General Sherbrooke , Governor of Nova Scotia , received orders " to occupy so much of the District of Maine ' * as shall insure an uninterrupted communication between Halifax and Quebec . " His orders being discretionary as to method , he decided that with the force available he should best comply by taking possession of Machias and the Penobscot River . On September 1st , navy and army appeared before Castine , which was quickly abandoned . A few days before , the United States frigate Adams , Captain Morris , returning from a cruise , had run ashore in a fog upon Isle au Haut , and in consequence of the injuries received had been compelled to enter the river as far as Hampden , thirty miles up . A detachment of seamen and soldiers were sent against her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her defence , and militia had gathered for the support necessary to ? artillery so situated ; but they proved unreliable , and upon their retreat the ship had to be fired . The crew escaped . The enemy penetrated as far as Bangor , seized a number of merchant vessels , and subsequently occupied Machias , where twentyfive pieces of artillery were captured in the fort . Sherbrooke then issued a voluminous proclamation to the effect that he had taken possession of all the country between the Penobscot and New Brunswick ; after which he returned to Halifax , leaving at Castine two regiments , with transports to remove them in case of overwhelming attack . It was this burlesque of occupation , " one foot on shore , and one on sea , " that drew forth Wellington 's derisive comment . Much more threatening was the concentrated movement along Lake Champlain . This constituted " the chances of the campaign , " upon which the British ministry based its expectations . The tenure of this lake , feebly contested on either side , had remained with the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Saratoga , of 26 guns , being ready , transferred control to Commodore Macdonough , the American commander . The British , however , were then building a vessel , subsequently named the Confiance , of 37 guns , which should give them supremacy . She was not launched until August 25th . It was understood generally , and by none expressed more emphatically than by the Duke of Wellington , that upon naval command of the lake depended such issue of the operations as should justify the pretensions of his Government . On July 12th , Sir George Prevost wrote to the Secretary for War that as soon as all the reenforcements arrived the secret instructions should be obeyed ; but he must confine himself to defence until naval control was obtained , which could not be before September . As the troops from Bordeaux arrived , three brigades , estimated , with attendant artillery , at from 11,000 to 14,000 men , were assembled near the border . Singularly enough , this moment of threatening invasion was chosen by the United States Government to divert from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the commander-inchief , was directed to go to the relief of Brown , then shut up in Fort Erie . He started August 29th with 4000 effectives , representing the result of a summer spent in organizing and drilling the disordered rabble found in April . Moving by Utica to Sackett 's Harbor , and thence by lake , he did not reach Brown until after that general , by a brilliant sortie on September 17th , had compelled Drummond to raise the siege , and fall back to a defensive line behind the Chippewa . Prevost 's advance corps crossed the frontier August 31st , two days after Izard 's de- departure . Macomb , left in command at Plattsburg , had but I500 regulars , of which only four companies were organized . The remainder were broken groups or individuals , recruits and convalescents . On September 4th , 700 militia joined . By that time the whole British army had reached Little Chazy , twenty-five miles away , on Lake Champlain , where their depots were established . Hitherto no opposition had been met ; but next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges broken by Macomb 's orders . On the 6th there was skirmishing , but the American militia " could not be prevailed upon to stand , " reported Macomb , " notwithstanding the exertions of their officers , although the fields were divided by strong stone walls , and they were told that the enemy could not possibly cut them off . " The British Peninsulars pushed on contemptuously , and almost silently . " They never deployed in their whole march , always pressing on in column . " The evening of the 6th they entered Plattsburg . Macomb retreated across the Saranac , which divided the town , removing from the bridges their planking , to be used for breastworks in disputing a passage . The decisive moment had now arrived , and decisive action meant nothing short of the destruction of the United States squadron anchored in the bay . If Prevost continued southward , his communications by land would be endangered by the little force under Macomb , which successive arrivals of militia raised to 4700 by September rrth , the day of final battle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water route . If Macdonough could be brought to action on equal terms as to position ? that is , under sail on the open lake ? he would be inferior to the British , for the same reason that Yeo through most of 1813 was inferior to Chauncey on Ontario . As the General Pike was there superior to the whole British squadron , under way , so in like circumstance was the Con fiance superior to Macdonough 's entire command . The necessary policy of the British , therefore , was to bring their fleet up the lake , between Macdonough and his retreat southward ; and having done that , to drive him from his anchorage by land guns . But to do this most quickly it was necessary to storm Macomb 's position , and then turn the captured guns ' upon the squadron . In this sense the American works and fleet afforded mutual support , but not otherwise . The Americans could not turn the guns upon an attacking enemy without imminent risk of hitting their own vessels . For defence against the hostile squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its wise disposition by him . On shore , a defensive position is determined by the circumstances of the ground selected , improved by fortification ; all which gives strength additional to the number of men . A sailing squadron anchored for defence similarly gained force by adapting its formation to the circumstances of the anchorage , and to known wind conditions , with careful preparations to turn the guns in any direction deliberate precautions not possible to the same extent to the assailant anchoring under fire . To this is to be added the release of the crew from working sails to manning the guns . Cumberland Bay , on which Plattsburg stands , and in which the United States squadron was anchored , is two miles wide , and lies north and south , open to the southward . Its western boundary , two miles long , is Cumberland Head . The British vessels , starting from below , in a channel too narrow to beat , must come up with a north wind . To insure that this should be ahead , or bring them close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition unfavorable for attack , ? Macdonough fixed the head of his line as far north as was safe from possible enemy 's guns brought to the shore north of the Saranac . His order thence extended southward , abreast of the American works , and somewhat nearer the Cumberland than the Plattsburg shore . The wind conditions further made it expedient to put the strongest vessels to the northward ? to windward , ? whence they would best be able to manouvre as circumstances might require . The order from north to south therefore was : the brig Eagle , 20 guns ; the ship Saratoga , 26 ; the Ticonderoga schooner , 7 ; and the sloop treble , 7 . The Con fiance , having 3 7 guns in all , carried fourteen 24-pounders on one broadside , a very heavy battery for the day . The next in force , the brig Linnet , had sixteen long  | 12-pounders , inferior to the Eagle at carronade range . The two other vessels , the cutters Chub and Finch , had been captured from the Americans a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macdonough 's dispositions being perfectly under observation , the British commander , Captain Downie , framed his plan accordingly . The Confiance should engage the Saratoga ; but before doing so , would pass along the Eagle , from north to south , give her a broadside , and then anchor across the bows of the Saratoga . The Linnet , supported by the Chub , would then become the opponent of the Eagle , reduced more nearly to equality by the punishment already received . Three British vessels would thus grapple the two strongest enemies . The Finch was to attack the American rear , supported by all the British gunboats ? eleven in number . There were American gunboats , or galleys , as well , which Macdonough distributed in groups , inshore of his order ; but , as was almost invariably the case , these light vessels exerted no influence on the result . This being the plan , when the wind came northeast on the morning of September 11th , the British stood up the lake in column , as follows : Finch , Confiance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head , and changed course towards the American line , they would be properly disposed to reach the several places assigned . It was understood with Prevost that as the vessels came round the Head the army would assault the batteries ; but to Downie 's dismay no such co-operation was apparent . He was fairly committed to his movement , however , and could only persist . As the initial act was the attack upon the Eagle by the Conjiance , she led in ahead of her consorts , which caused a concentration of the American guns upon her ; the result being that she was unable to carry out her part . The wind also failed , and she @#  | eventually anchored five hundred yards from the American line . Her first broadside is said to have struck down forty men , or one-fifth of the Saratoga 's crew . Fifteen minutes later Captain Downie was killed , leaving in command Lieutenant Robertson . The Linnet reached her berth and engaged the Eagle closely ; but the Chub , which was to support her , received much damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge was nervously prostrated by a not very severe wound . Instead of anchoring , she was permitted to drift helplessly , and so passed through the American order , where she surrendered . Though thus disappointed of the assistance intended for her , the Linnet continued to fight manfully and successfully , her opponent finally quitting the line . The Finch , on the contrary , by an error of judgment on the part of her commander , did not keep near enough to the wind . She therefore failed to reach her position , near the Ticonderoga ; and the breeze afterwards falling , she could not retrieve her error . Ultimately , she went ashore on Crab Island , a mile to the southward . This remoteness enabled her to keep her flag flying till her consorts had surrendered ; but the real credit of being last to strike belongs to the Linnet , Captain Pring . By the failure of the Finch , the Ticonderoga underwent no attack except by the British gunboats . Whatever might possibly have come of this was frustrated by the misbehavior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistence , eliciting much admiration from their opponents ; but the remainder kept at distance , the commander of the whole actually running away , and absconding afterwards to avoid trial . The Ticonderoga maintained her position to the end , but the weak Preble was forced from her anchors , and ran ashore under the Plattsburg batteries . The fight thus resolved itself into a contest between the Saratoga and Eagle , on one side , the Confiance and Linnet on the other . The wind being north-northeast , the ships at their anchors headed so that the forward third of the Confiance 's battery bore upon the Eagle , and only the remaining two-thirds upon the Saratoga . This much equalized conditions all round . It was 9 o'clock when she anchored . At 10.30 the Eagle , having many of her guns on the engaged side disabled , cut her cable , ran down the line , and placed herself south of the Saratoga , anchoring by the stern . This had the effect of turning towards the enemy her other side , the guns of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Lieutenant Robertson , " she kept up a destructive fire on the Con fiance , without being exposed to a shot from that ship or the Linnet . " On the other hand , Macdonough found the Saratoga suffer from the Linnet , now relieved of her immediate opponent . By this time the fire of both the Saratoga and Confiance had materially slackened , owing to the havoc among guns and men . Nearly all the guns on the starboard side of the United States ship were dismounted , or otherwise unserviceable . The only resource was to bring the uninjured side towards the enemy , as the Eagle had just done ; but to use the same method , getting under way , would be to abandon the fight , for there was not astern another position of usefulness for the Saratoga . There was nothing for it but to " wind " * the ship ? turn her round where she was . Then appeared the advantage attendant upon the defensive , if deliberately utilized . The Confiance standing in had had shot away , one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a manoeuvre . The Saratoga 's resources were unimpaired . A stern anchor was let go , the bow cable cut , and the ship winded , either by force of the wind , or by the use of " springs " before prepared , presenting to the Confiance her uninjured battery ? for fighting purposes a new vessel . The British ship , having now but four guns that could be used on the side engaged , must do the like , or be hopelessly overmatched . The stern anchor prepared having been shot away , the effort was made to swing her by a new spring on the bow cable ; but while this slow process was carrying on , a raking shot entered , killing and wounding several of the crew . Then , reported Lieutenant Robertson , the surviving officer in command , " the ship 's company declared they would stand no longer to their quarters , nor could the officers with their utmost exertions rally them . " The Confiance struck her colors about 11 A.M. , the Linnet fifteen @# @#  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lasted two hours and twenty minutes without intermission . Few combats have been more resolutely contested . The Saratoga had 55 round shot in her hull ; the Conjiance , 105 . Of the American crew of 210 men , 28 were killed and 29 wounded . The British loss is not known exactly . Robertson reported that there were 38 bodies sent ashore for interment , besides those thrown overboard in action . This points to a loss of about 50 killed , and James states the wounded at about 6o ; the total was certainly more than roo in a ship 's company of 270 . There was reason for obstinacy , additional to the natural resolution of the parties engaged . The Battle of Lake Champlain , more nearly than any other incident of the War of 1812 , merits the word " decisive . " The moment the issue was known , Prevost retreated into Canada ; entirely properly , as indicated by the Duke of Wellington 's words , before and after . His previous conduct was open to censure , for he had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage prematurely ; " goaded " into action , soYeo wrote . Before the usual naval court martial , the officers sworn testified that Downie had been led to expect cooperation , which in their judgment would have reversed the issue ; but that no proper assault was made . Charges were preferred , but Prevost died before trial . There remains therefore no sworn testimony on his side , nor was there any adequate crossexamination of the naval witnesses . In the judgment of the writer , it was incumbent upon Prevost to assault the works when Downie was known to be approaching , in the hope of driving the American squadron from its anchors to the open lake , where the real superiority of the British could assert itself . Castlereagh 's " chances of the campaign " had gone so decidedly against the British that no ground was left to claim territorial adjustments . To effect these the war must be continued ; and for this Great Britain was not prepared , nor could she afford the necessary detachment of force . In the completeness of Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe still required all the Great Powers to keep their arms at hand . On October 18 , T 14 , when news of the battle could , carceiyha v reached England , Bathucst instructed the British Peace Commission that Great Britain would yield Castillo and Machias , in exchange for Fort Erie and Amherstberg ; retaining Forts Niagara and Mackinac , for which the Americans were assumed to have no equivalent capture to trade . The cession of Maine north of the Aroostook would also be expected ; apparently a quid pro quo for " all the country east of the Penobscot , which the British now occupy . " The peace , signed December 24th , ceded no American soil whatever . The war was practically finished when Prevost retreated . It remains only to gather together a few stray incidents , purely episodical in essential character , but necessary to round off the narrative ; like the summing up the future for the characters of a novel before the book is closed . Izard , finding himself unable to make an impression upon the British lines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and withdrew to the American shore ; abandoning thus the last of Brown 's conquests , and leaving the American situation on the Niagara frontier the same as when the campaign opened . By this time Sir James Yeo 's new roe-gun ship , the St. Lawrence , was afloat , lording Lake Ontario without a rival to fear , As winter drew on , the scene of British activity was transferred to the South . The expedition against New Orleans , though conceived and initiated while the state of war still continued , scarcely matured to active collision until after peace had been concluded . In support of this larger undertaking , operations were begun upon the coast of Georgia in January , 1815 . These were intended as a diversion , to draw away from easy access to Louisiana the American troops then employed in Alabama against the Creek Indians . Whatever deeper motives may have underlain these two enterprises , ? Wellington in one of his letters expresses a hope that New Orleans may yield a conquest , exchangeable for the desired cession of territory in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the war , indeed , but scarcely part of it , and with no bearing upon its course or issue . As before said , the end was in Macdonough 's  | defeat of the British Champlain squadron , compelling Prevost 's retreat . Formally , the termination dates with the signature of peace ; on the very day , December 24th , that the British army assembled on the banks of the Mississippi for its final brief and disastrous campaign -- that against New Orleans . @# @#
