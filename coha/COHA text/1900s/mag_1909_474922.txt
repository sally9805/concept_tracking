THE play of King Henry V. is Shakespeare 's portrayal of a hero-king of England , and has as its protagonist a matchless heroical figure . Henry V. is a " one-man " play . The King alone fills the stage ; the other characters move around him and make the action , but do not interfere with our contemplation of the central personage . All the dramatic energy proceeds from the King or illustrates him ; and if the renown of the house of Lancaster is the theme of the trilogy which is concluded with this play , that renown is summed up in the person of Harry of Monmouth . We will not theorize as to Shakespeare 's design in writing his plays , nor do him wrong , as a German might , by hinting that he dealt with " qualities " or " types , " and intended to set forth in his Henry V. the characteristics of a typical hero-king . To construct a man from his qualities inward , or to refer him to a type , is to make waxwork puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a theory ; like the rest of Shakespeare 's characters , a person , not an impersonation . Personality was all-important to Shakespeare . You may take the story of one of his plays and let the personages play it out , as in Much . Ado or Twelfth Night or The Merchant of Venice : or you may take the central figure , Othello , Lear , Hamlet , and see how it works in with the story . Whatever else may be on the page , the glory of England , the power of fate , ambition , jealousy , love , madness ? all is subordinate to personality . The play is built on the characters , not the characters drawn out of the play . It matters not whether the story is good or had ; Shakespeare can make a good acting play of any material . The slightest narrative would give him situation ; he could never lack rhetoric ; he eared little for the working out of a plot ; he could no more help putting his persons into dramatic relation with eachother than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We go to Shakespeare for character first ; situation is secondary ? for construction , perspective , proportion , though he held them in the hollow of his hand , leviter curare videt ? fr . The conscious artifices by which a dramatist like Schiller makes everything subordinate to the dramatic moment are as alien to Shakespeare as are the typical personages and situations of the rhetorical stage , tragic or comic , Terenflan , Spanish , or Italian . We shall , then , not be wrong if we look for the unity of Henry 's character in the two plays which lead up to this ; for though Henry V. is a self - contained drama and a good acting play , whether considered from the point of view of incident , situation , oratory , character , or even spectacle , and though Shakespeare would , we may he sure , have laughed at the idea of its standing in pre-established relation and psychological order to other of his plays ? since a play must stand alone , as a play , whatever its place may he in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be learned by comparing it with other plays in which the same personages appear . The Henry of the third play is no royal figure picked up at random out of the Chronicle . Shakespeare knew all along the boy and youth who was one day to be the hero of Agincourt , as he knew his father , Bolingbroke ; and the earlier plays outline the portrait completed in that of which he is the principal actor . Shakespeare did not stumble upon Henry V. by accident . Historical plays were in the fashion . England , rich in glory from the Armada and the wars in the Low Countries and on the Rhine , was then imperial-minded , and liked to view her past and present greatness in the glass of the stage . The playwrights wrote for the stage , and not for a theory , SHAKESPEARE 'S " KING HENRY V. " nor according to chronological order . Henry VI . came before Henry IV. , Richard III . before Richard II . But the two Henry IV . plays and Henry V. form a consistent T.ancastrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain road marked out by Holinshed 's Chronicle , found ready to his hand material for a story of epic grandeur . If it were lawful to wish anything in Shakespeare otherwise than as it is , we could wish that he had given us a King Edward III . There we should have seen Shakespeare 's conception of the heyday of chivalry , and his Black Prince would have been a splendid counterpart to his Prince Henry . Cressy and Poitiers made Agincourt possible ; the French against whom Edward TH. fought were a stronger race than their grandsons ; the scene was vaster , and the two Edwards larger figures than the two Henrys . But Shakespeare did not write a King Edward III. , though it is probable that he may have added some touches to the play which under that title held the stage at this period ; and a prince , whose fame five centuries and a half have not dimmed , caret rate sacro . Shakespeare had touched upon his hero-king already in Richard II . as the young , wanton , and effeminate boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some sparkles of a better hope ; had understood his father Bolingbroke 's distrust of him , which comes out in the two succeeding plays , again and again chased away by the winning frankness of the Prince , but returning to roost in the suspicious mind of the gloomy " politician . " The " smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers " do their work , and find the King still willing to listen to them . The Prince takes his rating patiently , not submissively . For one moment he melts , when the father 's " foolish tenderness " checks his speech ? " I shall hereafter , my thrice-gracious lord , be more myself . " But he is stung that - " your unthought-of Harry " should be lowered to a comparison with Harry Percy this same child of honour and renown . This gallant Hotspur , this all - praised knight , VOL. cxvill , ? No. 708. - 116and disdains to clear himself when called " degenerate " - Do not think so : you shall not find it so ; - And God forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good thoughts away from me ! So rooted in the King 's mind is this suspicion that Harry 's exploits at Shrewsbury do not chase away his father 's mistrust ; and when the Prince saves his life in the battle , he only says : Thou past redeem 'd thy lost opinion ; And show 'd , thou mak'st some tender of my life . In this fair rescue thou bast brought to me . Prince . 0 heaven ! they did me too much injury , That ever said I hearken 'd for your death . Harry returns to his jolly companions . War blazes up again ? when or how matters little to Shakespeare ? but the Prince is not there ; his brother John of Lancaster leads the King 's forces . By heaven , Poins , I feel me much to blame , So idly to profane the precious time : When tempest of commotion , like the south , Borne with black vapour , cloth begin to melt , And drop upon our bare unarmed heads . Give me my sword , and cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did naturally inherit of his father " is warmed by the alarm of war . But it is Prince John who is in favor , not the Prince of Wales , who is only mentioned in a tone of regret by his father , speaking as one who has lost a prized jewel by ill guardianship . . . . Omit him not ; blunt not his love : Nor lose the good advantage of his grace , By seeming cold , or careless of his will . Fur he is gracious , if he be observ 'd ; He bath a tear for pity , and . a hand Open as day for melting charity : Yet notwithstanding , being incens 'd , he 's flint ; As humorous as winter , and as sudden As flaws ' congealed in the spring of day . His temper , therefore , must be well observ 'd . The famous scene with the crown follows : stagy , perhaps , but truly dramatic , because situation illustrates character . The politic old King , unwilling to stand aside for his heir or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sharing for him , who has never trusted any friend but himself ; the son , free at once from the wish to go on living his merry life , and from any foolish dazzlement of royal splendor , yet resolved to be full sovereign and grasp his heritage entire . This is true human nature . Here is no masquerade of a transformation scene , " exit madcap Hal , enter the hero-king " ; they were all along the same . There was no " conversion , " no miraculous change from madcap to hero . If Hotspur had killed the Prince , he would have killed King Harry in him . There is no weakness in Prince Hal 's merriment . The severity is foreshadowed in the license : the stern soldier can unbend . If Shakespeare had not drawn him , our critics would have made out ? nay , they do so in spite of Shakespeare ? that the " madcap " stories belonged to some one else , or are pure invention , and that Henry V. was always staid and majestic ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , " we reply that Henry is not many-sided , but harmonizes ? contrasts in comprehensive greatness . Shakespeare conceived him one and complete . Henry V. is a simple character . His simplicity enables him to deal plainly and directly with all problems . He has no compunctious visitings , no pangs of conscience like his father . He grasps the crown in all good faith . He makes no question of his right to France , when the Archbishop has once affirmed it . He assumes all the royal authority at once , and as easily as if he had had the serious and conscientious training of Prince John . He sends Scroup to the scaffold , reinstates the Chief Justine , turns Falstaff away , all without a moment 's hesitation . He is " terrible in constant resolution . " Compare him with Richard II. , compact of opposites . The outburst of wrath which commanded the killing of the prisoners is of a piece with the severity of the summons to Harffeur : . . . as I am a soldier ( A name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I begin the battery once again , will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur , Till in her ashes she lie buried . The gates of mercy shall be all shut up ; And the flesh 'd soldier , rough and hard of heart , In liberty of bloody hand , shall range With conscience wide as hell . This is the feeling of the soldier who knows that war can not be played at . War is no " civil game " : and when great issues are at stake " he 's flint . " His good-humored jesting with Williams and Fluellen is the counterpart of his soldierly fire . The " terrible warrior changed into the merry bridegroom " * is no change at all : for Henry 's wooing goes hand in hand with the Treaty of Troyes , and has as much to do with war as with love . As in his careless youth he excelled his unworthy associates , so now he excels the noble Englishmen whom he commands . The contrasts are great , but intended , and are commended by truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Prince and his father is consistent throughout , so also is the relation between the Prince and his companions . His " reformation " is always in view ; he spends himself , but dues not give himself away . Early in the first play , after he has consented " once in his days , to be a madcap " and when the Gadshill sport is toward , comes the soliloquy , neither hypocritical nor vainglorious , nor yet of deliberate purpose , but simple and natural : I know you all , and will awhile uphold The unyok 'd humour of your idleness ; Yet herein will I imitate the sun ; Who doth permit the base contagious clouds To smother up his beauty from the world , . That , when he please again to he himself , Being wanted , lie may he more wonder 'd at . . . So , when this loose behaviour I throw off , And pay the debt I never promised , By how much better than my word T am , By so much shall I falsify men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make offence a skill ; Redeeming time , when men think least I will . The soliloquy is of course a stage artifice , and meant for the audience . It has dramatic value , giving the key to character : and it is placed at the beginning of the first play , to interpret at the outset what is to follow . Observe how he holds himself aloof and above his companions . Falstaff himself fears him , and though he takes liberties , is always under check . He *Cervinus. promises Bardolph a halter , and keeps Poins ( who is something of a gentleman ) , Pete , and the rest at distance . When it comes to real work , Falstaff is nothing to him . One of the fine touches is the dialogue between the Prince and Falstaff after the challenge to Hotspur : Falstaff . Hal , if thou see me down in the battle , and bestride me , so ; ' t is a point of friendship . Prince . Nothing but a colossus ran do thee that friendship . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were bed-time , Hal , and all well . Prince . Why , thou owest God a death . The speech is rather kindly than merry . He is still kindled by the greatness of the moment , and Falstaff is neither here nor there . Once or twice again they meet ? " What , stand'st thou idle here ? " . . . " What , is't a time to jest and dally now ? " and again when Falstaff is down , " What , old acquaintance ! " ( he does not say " old friend " ) , could not all this flesh Keep in a little life ? Poor Jack , farewell ! I could have better spar 'd a better man . 0 , I should have a heavy miss of thee , If I were nitieh in love with vanity . He never was in love with vanity ; his character was always serious and weighty . You may say this is heartless . It is no more heartless than the Duke of Wellington 's remark upon Lord Uxbridge 's leg at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither here nor there . In the same way Henry may be defended from the charge of ingratitude when he finally sends Falstaff about his business . There was no place for Falstaff in a reign the key-note of which was reformation . Let him amend himself , and lie and his should have advancement . If not , let him go down : and if Bardolph earns the gallows , to the gallows he shall go . The greatness of Falstaff is a measure of Henry 's greatness . No one else could have so dealt with Falstaff . Falstaff turns all the world round his finger , even the Chief Justice , who , half in anger , half in amusement , retires from him baffled . But not the Prince ; and the Prince 's favor withdrawn , he can but die . " The King hath killed his heart . " It ishis unfitness for the change of times which makes us feel that Falstaff would have been out of place in the play of Henry V. His part is played out . He had staked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win ? His unwonted activity and self-assertion when the change was imminent make it doubtful . Dramatically , Falstaff counts for much more than Henry V. He is the greatest comic figure in literature . His action in the second part of Henry IV . displays his whole character ; genius , ascendency , readiness , wit , audacity , depravity . How wonderful is the art which without any preaching or moralizing sets its character upon Gargantuan vileness , merely by shedding upon it the daylight of a heroic nature : For no falsehood can endure Touch of celestial temper , but returns Of force to its own likeness . Henry , though he amused himself with Falstaff 's company , was never his friend . The sympathy between them was little more than an intellectual pleasure in the contest of wits . His friendship went out to men like his brother John of Lancaster , of whom he has no jealousy , though there was cause enough for it in his father 's preference . By heaven , thou hast deceiv 'd me , Lancaster , I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this her lends nettle to us all . Happy Lord John . to be so praised by such a brother ! The same generosity makes him give the " grace of a lie " to Falstaff for slaying Hotspur ; and to his brother the " high courtesy " of disposing of the Douglas . It is like Fairfax at Naseby , waiving the exploit of taking the King 's standard : " Let be , Charles ; I have honour enough . " With the play of Henry V. a new scene opens , and new dramatis persona : walk the stage . The horizon is wider . The theme is epic , and the construction epic . Epic and drama are combined , partly by the use of rhetorical passages of an epic color , such as the Harfleur and Agincourt orations , full of Homeric stateliness , partly by the common expedient of a Chorus , to supplement drama by epic machinery and combine narrative with KING HENRy . I fray thee , bear my former answer hack : Bid them achieve me , and then sell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give historical movement to drama . And not movement only ; the Chorus in Shakespeare 's hands represents dignity as well as movement , and invests the march of time with majesty Movement in time is essential to an historical play , which does not depend upon situation so much as a tragedy or a comedy . There , character added to incident makes the situation : the situation does not exist without the character . Here , the plot is written by the chronicler , and dealt out by the Chorus . There is little comedy , far less than in Henry IV. ; no tragedy , as in Richard II , Richard and King John . The incidents are of the simplest kind ; the humors of Fluellen and Pistol and the other soldiers are the only things not taken from the book . Henry V. is , as we said above , a one-man play . The action of the drama is England against France , and Henry stands for England . The frivolous chivalry of the Dauphin who " longs to eat the English " is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timidity of the French King with Henry 's speed in action . The minor characters all set him forth . Fluellen and the English captains in their humble service ; the common soldiers in their simple talk , laying all " upon the king , " bring out his grandeur and seriousness , his high conscience and humility , his courtesy and brotherly-in iii dednessFor he to-day that sheds his blood with me , Shall be my brother ; and his human kindliness : ? I think the king is but a man , as T am ; the violet smells to him as it cloth to me. . . all his senses have but human conditions . There is hardly a character in the play which does not exhibit some spark of Henry 's spirit , or some unlikeness to provoke a contrast . The low personages , Bardolph , Nym , and the rest , bring his nobility into relief , " like bright metal on a sullen ground . " His princely valor outshines but does not eclipse the kindred gallantry of Fluellen , whom we love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the play ; we feel him in every line ; he is the atmosphere which we breathe . There is but one point of chivalry lacking in Henry V. He has personal valor , magnanimity , piety , solemnity , sternness , royal greatness of every kind . But he is not a lover . Throughout the roistering scenes of the earlier history there is no love - making . His wooing of the French King 's daughter is of the good-humored superior sort : the soldier 's wooing , by capture , not by tenderness , much less by worship . It is the wooing of a conqueror , not a suitor ; heroical , this . too . So Hotspur , we may be sure , courted Lady Percy , though with more ardency ; so Desdemono listened to Othello ; and Rosalind , like Imogen , " chose an eagle , " the conquering Orlando . Not so did Antony woo Cleopal ra C. If it he love indeed , tell me how much . A. There 's beggary in the love that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose ; she was little more than one of the articles of the peace ; and Henry V. 's wife , whoever she might have been , would have been a Katharine or a Lady Percy . He would not have loved Rosalind or Beatrice : he was made for men , not women . With this exception , Henry V. is the mirror of chivalry in its graver aspect . There are many types of manly courage in Shakespeare . Mcrcutio is a good example of a form of courage much in vogue in Shakespeare 's time , of the fashion of Italy and France ? that of the duellist alai street brawler , " sudden and quick in quarrel , " from the high-born professor of the ( ludic ) like Lord Herbert of Cherbury or the heroes of Brannime , to the hired " spadassin " or " tueur . " Pistol is the counterfeit of this . Hotspur and FauIconbridge are " sudden and quick in quarrel , " but are barbarians compared with Henry . Richard III . in his last transports of rage comes nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bosom . Elsewhere we have the wild-beast fury of the desperate Macbeth , the magnificence , governed by no steadfastness , of Antony , the arrogant championship of Ajax and Achilles . Henry 's warlike virtue is more than courage . Courage may be mere high spirit and masterfulness ; discipline and deliberate courage make the soldier ; courage and counsel the general ; courage , counsel , and policy , and something loftier still , the king , as Shakespeare conceives him . The king may risk himself on a worthy occasion ; but he must not present his life , like the Admirable Crichton , to any bravo who comes by . There is no nobler portrait of royal valor than is painted here . Henry is a king , and a king of England too ; be is , above all , the English hero , and stands for the English nation . Hence foreign critics complain of his being insular and Chauvinist ; but to us English , who can not help feeling a pride in " these Gallia wars , " he must always rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behold then the hero-king , fully furnished . He must be valorous as Achilles , magnanimous as Scipio , politic as CEesar , rigid as Brutus , religious as St. Louis ; no knight-errant to adventure himself in single combat , as at Shrewsbury . " TTpon the Ring " weights all his thoughts and actions : ? Upon the king ! let us our lives , our souls , Our debts , our careful wives , uur children , and Our sins , lay on the king ; ? he must bear all . O hard conditions twin-born with greatness I His merriment , his clemency , his justice and severity , must all be kingly ; there is no room for sudden changes of personal motives ; " being so majestical , " he must move slowly ; and it is only at moments when the royal state gives fuel to the soldier 's fire that , as in the Agineourt speech , the cresset which was Henry 's emblem blazes in the front of war . Whilst in this mood of greatness the thought of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles ! steel my soldiers ' hearts ! Possess them not with fear . . . Not to-day , 0 Lord , O not to-day ? think not upon the fault lkly father made in compassing the crown . Of all the miracles of Shakespeare 's art none is greater than his power of transmuting a plain story into romance , and raising it from the flats of actuality to the highest region of imagination by the " heavenly alchemy " of a single character . He thus exalts the simple stories of Lear and Othello to the loftiest pitch of tragedy , and with no material but the homespun Chronicle weaves a golden vesture for the prince of warriors , and enriches our English memories with the ideal presentment of the hero-king , the victorious Harry , the rose of Lancaster .
