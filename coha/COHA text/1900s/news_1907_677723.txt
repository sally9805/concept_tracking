txt CHICAGO , Aug. ** a master stroke Federal Judge K. M. Landis to-day placed the responsibility for immunity squarely upon the shoulders of Attorney General Charles J. Bonaparte . That official has been given until Sept. 3 by the jurist to examine the record of the Standard Oil trial and decide whether the Alton deserves immunity . This action by the court is admitted by other Federal officials to be fair and just . It is a method of dealing with the unique situation which had occurred to no one until it was announced from the bench , yet which is declared by all those interested to he the proper solution of the Problem . Since the good faith of the Government is at stake Judge Landis has decided that it is necessary for some responsible official to examine the record and make a decision , and the Judge will be governed by the decision . There is grave doubt whether , as a matter of right , the Alton , under its secret agreement with the Government , is entitled to immunity . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Standard Oil trial gave evasive answers and otherwise proved themselves hostile . The crucial point in the case , that of intent on the part of the Standard Oil Company to violate the law , was juggled by F. S. Holiands , rate clerk for the Alton , to the disappointment of the Government attorneys . In his address to the jury , District Attorney Sims refered to the hostility of other Alton witnesses , yet , despite this , there is nothing to connect the Alton as a corporation with the action of these witnesses , and it is expected the promised immunity will be granted . While members of the District Attorney 's office refused to discuss what action had been taken by them following Judge Landis 's announcement , it is known the gist of the announcement was telegraphed to Washington . It is probable that either District A ttorney Sims or his assistant , Mr. Wilkerson , will take a copy of the record in the Standard Oil trial to Washington , and remain there to confer with the Attorney General .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
