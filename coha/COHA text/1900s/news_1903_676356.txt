txt The " grab bills " now before the Legis lature at Albany and their sponsors were roundly denounced by several speakers last night at Cooper Union , where the first in a series of meetings to voice the protest of the public against the measures was held . The meeting was under the auspices of the Citizens ' Union , the Civic Club , the Board of Trade and Transportation , the West Side Committee of One Hundred , and various other bodies , numbering thirty-five in all . Representatives of these organizations declare that the bills in question are the most notorious a set of lobbyists ever tried to jam through the Legislature , and measures which , if passed , will rob this city out of millions of dollars in public franchises . The sentiment of the meeting was expressed in resolutions denouncing the bills , and calling upon their sponsors to withdraw them . A resolution was passed denouncing the State Railroad Commission as incompetent to solve the traffic problems of this city , and demanding the passage of a law creating a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor and be directly responsible to the people of this city . President Fornes of the Board of Aldermen , who occupied a seat on the platform , offered the following resolution , which was unanimously adopted : Resolved , That it is the sense of this meeting that a committee of ten be appointed by the delegates of various civic bodies represented here to devise means for the permanent defense of the right of self-government of our municipality . This action was suggested in a letter from Mayor Low to R. Fulton Cutting , who was to have presided at the meeting . The letter which was read at the meeting was as follows : City of New York , Mayor 's Office . April 9. 1903 . My Dear Sir : I venture to remind you that all of the so-called " grab " bills at Albany are amendments to the General Railroad law , so that none of them will be submitted to me for consideration . If by chance , therefore , these bills or any of them shoul3 pass the Legislature , it would be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very glad if the meeting over which you are to preside would authorize you to appoint a committee for this purpose . Yours very truly . SETH LOW . The following delegates from the various organizations were appointed on the corn-fnittee : John De Witt Warner , ' S. E. Donnelly . Chairman ; iMrs . Ralph Trautman . R. Fulton Cutting , F. Norton , Goddard . Charles V. Forties , E. W. Bloomingdale . Frank Moss , Charles Chadwick . William S. Stonebridge , . The measures against which the protests of the meeting were directed were introduced by Senators Foley , Goodsell , Grady , L ' H ommeclieti , and Wilcox . and Assemblymen Bedell , Catlin , and Mullaney . ASSERTIONS OF MR . BEDELL . A letter from Louis Bedell , Chairman of the Assembly Railroads Committee , addressed to the Manufacturers ' Association of New York , was read . It was as follows : In relation to Bill 1.741. ( the Cadin bill. ) the committee will not act favorably upon it . In regard to Assembly Bill 632 ( introduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago abandoned by me . In respect to Mr. Grady 's bills , they have not received the attention of the Railroads Committee nor has the bill of Mr. Foley . Mr. I. ' . Hommeclleu 's bill will not be reported by the committee . Mr. Goodsell 's bill has never been before us for consideration . LOUIS BEDELL . Chairman of the Assembly Railroads Committee . Nearly every seat in the large hall was occupied when Charles Sprague Smith called the meeting to order , shortly after ' 8 o'clock . There were many women both in the audience and on the platform , where the delegates of the various organizations and the Vice Presidents of the meeting were seated . Mr. Smith introduced John De Witt War ! ner as Chairman of the evening . In his introductory remarks Mr. Warner said : We are threatened with grab legislation at Albany , pushed by rural legislators . to steal our public franchises . We are here to voice our protest against any such interference . What we want is home rule . " As with the great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private corporations to monopolize our local franchises . Our Governor is well known to us . No one doubts but that with his little finger he could long since have killed every one of these grabs . No one better understands such matters than he And we all know that , should any of them pass , a stroke of his pen will bury them . Then why are we afraid ? His repute is the same as when a majority of us voted foi . him . " As I stand here I am reminded how history repeats itself . Four years ago the gentleman who 7c as then , and is now , the President of the Rapid Transit Commission was at Albany lobbying for a bill to permit the perpetual franchise of the subways of this city to be handed over to the Whitney interest . With him , on the same errand , was his associate on the Rapid Transit Commission , now our Corporation Counsel . On that evening . Mr. Chairman , on this very platform , you presided , as you are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , at a mass meeting called to , protest against any such betrayal of our city 's - in- . terests . We succeeded . That grab bill was killed . And in another year the Rapid Transit Commission had found a contractor , whose rights are now held by the Belmont syndicate , to accept the terms they had solemnly assured us nobody would accept . " MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP PANACEA . Alfred J. Boulton . the next speaker . ' said : " Altgeld used to say that he never took a stand on any important public question without first considering how his action would probably be viewed by the future generations . Tried by this test there can be but one attitude toward the franchise piracies now so boldly attempted at Albany . Few men would dare stand as open advocates of any one of these bills . They must be killed , and their sponsors , so ' far as they can be discovered , must be held up to public contempt . " The people are awaking to the facit-thaf nothing but aggressive steps toward municipal ownership will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Assessors valued the naked franchise rights in ' New York City at about $140,000 , - 000 , yet as a return or rental for the use of all this city property the city actually gets - $50,000 a year less- than it gets from the ferry companies . which themselves pay little enough . When we seek to tax these , values the companies get the law amended and then have the whole law declared unconstitutional because it has been so amended . When we start a huge uprising against abuses in the local transportation management , weeks of agitation result only in a report from the State Railroad . Commission , which has about the style which would be used 1 ; , 3r a committee in Russia if ' they were called upon to discuss the conduct-.of the Czar . Even our famous Rapid Tranr sit Commission is so binding itself up - to one syndicate that the passage of the Elsberg bill Is now an ' sane of importance equal to the Wiling of these grab measures . But let the city start a municipal tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cora tics tunnel , and it will not only save miIliuns On these trarticular - ventures , but will /sans tbst private cssovazdes intntan , attitude of respect for the public which can be inspired in them by fear , and by fear alone . " John S. Crosby said in part : " important as it is that the bills under consideration should not be passed until more fully explained by their authors , it is - still more important that the public should determine to take the control of public affairs into its own hands-1n short , to Mind its own business . Let the Government be given control of public utilities and let the people assume control of the Government , through direct legislation and home rule . " John Brooks Leavitt said : " We are met to-night to uphold the principle that public property shall not be taken for private use without compensation . That Is a diplomatic phrase for those ugly words ' Thou shalt not steal . ' Private property is protected against individual theft by our criminal laws . It is protected against public theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ' be taken for public use without compensation . " It was in such tactful language that our forefathers enacted that the State should not steal from its citizens . If it had occurred to them that its citizens might steal from the State with the Connivance of its public servants , then no doubt there would have been a constitutional provision forbidding the giving away of public franchises without compensation . They evidently supposed that so honorable a body as they thought a Legislature should be Would stand guard over the People 's interests . " Frank Moss observed : " Shortly stated , the situation is that we have caught a great street railroad combination in the act of committing theft unsler the forms of law . We must quickly take steps to prevent their getting away with the plunder . Perhaps that is not diplomatic speech . Well , then , phrase it this Way : We want to instruct our servants at Albany in such a way as they can understand it , that we shall be highly pleased if they will condescend to protect our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for private use without compensation . We also want to consider how such things can be stopped in the future . " The bills which we are here to oppose are of the usual slippery character . When the Bridge Commissioner some years ago began to locate the Blackwell 's Island Bridge . he found a franchise occupying the necessary site , owned by a gentleman named Ranney and his associates . They maintained their charter for over twenty years , while doing nothing to build their bridge . We find exactly these features in some of the railroad bills  --  old , worn-out franchises are to be revived in the most innocent-looking way possible . " The Mayor well says , ' These bills were drawn by a master hand , and undoubtedly one master mind inspired them all . ' I like the prosposition of the Mayor that we shall not only defeat these bills , but that we shall take back to the city rights which were grabbed ' a few years ago by the same sort of legislative procedure .
