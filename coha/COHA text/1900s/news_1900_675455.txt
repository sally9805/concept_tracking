txt We are much confused in our minds as a result of noticing that , Just before departing from the Viceregal Lodge in Phoenix Park , Dublin , Queen VICTORIA wrote and caused to be widely printed a letter beginning : " The Queen is very anxious before leaving Ireland , where she has spent a most agreeable time , to express ? " and so on and so on for fifteen or twenty lines of gratitude and affection . The document as a whole is a character= istic and entirely pleasing one , but that " most agreeable time , " as we have already confessed , sets us all adrift . It must be assumed , of course , that the Queen , even when in- Ireland , writes and speaks the English language as it is written and , spoken in England , and yet it was one of our most firmly established beliefs that the use ce the word " time " as she employed it in the sentence quoted is an " Americanism " of the most pronounced and typical sort .

" To be sure , the Queen is not as " Colloq. , U. S. " as she might be , for she says she has spent , instead of had , an agreeable time , but this is a minor detail and in nowise restores our evanimity in regard to what is and what is not an " Americanism . " And while we are about this dangerous business of criticising the language of royalty , how about the Queen 's use of the word " leaving " ? Some people who are only moderately fussy in such matters have a vague distaste for " leaving " a thing which by no possibility could be taken along . That , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lexicographers all assert that one can leave even so large a thing as Ireland and still preserve one 's dignity unimpaired . Still but there 's no use arguing against both good usage and high authority .
