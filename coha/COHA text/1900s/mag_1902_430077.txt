 | As often as I think of the conditions of modem life , one fact appears to me with startling clearness . The past twenty years have created in America a new type of civilization , or , more exactly , have added a new element to the composite life already existing . The characteristic of this newly created civilization is the development of industrial and commercial enterprise , and , incident to that development , the increased dignity and importance of that phase of living and thinking . It is clear that , now as never before , brain energy and capacity are being applied to industry and the conduct of business . And the world has rightly conceded to commercial enterprise a dignity and an importance commensurate with the training and mental capacity of the men engaged in it . Illustration of this fact will be clear if we but answer the question , " Who were the leaders of thought and action in the civilization of one hundred , fifty , or even twenty years ago ? " Evidently the trend of life was shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literary men of that day . They were almost the only exponents of mental and social culture . Our colleges then trained men primarily for such lines of activity ; all the youth of intellectual promise sought , in these fields solely , the opportunity for applying their unusual mental gifts . Business was looked upon as a good field for physical endurance and a certain uncouth native shrewdness , but for brains never ; at least in that day an unusual mentality would not have viewed commercial activity as a means of acquiring the highest attainment . Such a man might aim to write a poem , but never to build a bridge ; his ambition might be to lead his church or the bar of his country , but never to be the master mind in the business world . To-day , as you know and I know , all this is no longer true . The field for trained intelligence is as wide as the life of man . There is almost no form of activity to which brain power is not attracted by the certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Applied science , transportation , manufacturing , finance have been advanced and ennobled ; to them much of our best intelligence has been attracted ; they are all on a par with literature , the ministry , or law with respect to their dignity and the estimation accorded by broad-minded people . And , in this modern American society , the business man is no longer slighted and ignored . He is as much a representative citizen as any class . He is as brainy and broad-souled and sympathetic and often as cultured intellectually and socially . He is asked to hold important offices ; he serves on great committees ; he can speak and write ; he is asked to welcome foreign potentates . Surely the business man is a leader in society . The world yields him not wealth alone ; it exalts him and calls him great and honored and noble . We shall accept these conditions and , if you agree with me , we shall call them good . For in this way civilization has been more nearly completed ; its limitations have been widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential of effective and successful living . And surely there is no good reason for a jealous guarding of the sacred portal of the abode of culture . I do not know what culture is , I can not define it ; but I have a well settled conviction that the man who builds a bridge is as much a man of culture as he who writes a poem ; that the preacher or lawyer may not claim this fair name and deny it to him who conducts a great business enterprise . I shall refer you to a single danger incident to this change in our life , and that is the possibility of the over-development of one element of life to the detriment of others . This tendency has often been noticeable in the history of man . Circumstances may aid the growth of one phase of living and thinking , while society seems to run mad with favor and enthusiasm for a part of its duty . To that part is turned the intelligence , the energy , and endurance of the race . There is a swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exultation to what they have done . But , in the moment of pride , the very structure to which they point is becoming top-heavy : it will fall upon and crush its builders . For illustration let me refer you to the history of Greece and Rome . During the first two centuries of the Christian era , there was a splendid life in western Europe . It combined the glory  | page deleted  | to approve greed and sordidness , the ideal which makes the acquisition of property the only object in life . But I do approve the desire of a good income which shall win comfort and happiness for self and for those dependent . I do approve the desire to read good books , enjoy fair opportunities of travel and wear excellent clothes . It is right for every man to wish to eat good food from a good table in a good house over a good carpet , put down by good tacks . And in a modern world the living of that sort of life costs money . Therein lies our danger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing , business , transportation , and finance . These are the attractive fields for the intelligence of our country . We may talk , if we please , about the beauty of self-denial and the joy of the service of mankind , but , as long as the present conditions prevail , the brains of the country will forget all this beauty and joy and will take the good income which will win them comfort . This is not necessarily selfishness . It is often merely self defense . No man need follow that course which will clothe him poorly , make him eat bad food and subject his wife and children to discomfort . Evidently these conditions are a most serious menace to the field of pure scholarship which it is my purpose particularly to defend . The danger to which it is exposed will be better understood from a discussion of the character of the scholar 's life and the scholar 's work . Pure scholarship is that form of mental activity which has no application in the practice of the arts and sciences , which then is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature or in the work of man , literary , artistic , historical , economic or social . The emoluments of this scholarship are small . For wealth is a product of the application of knowledge in art . It is not necessarily a product of the knowledge itself . In the average instance the scholar has neither the time nor the inclination to search for the application of his discovered principle ; he is not usually able to finance and exploit it in such a way as to secure money from the public . And the lack of emolument is especially burdensome by reason of the fact that great discoveries of truth are never made suddenly but are the results of years of preparation and hard work . The reward , if any , usually comes in the last years of life . It does not guarantee happiness and comfort during the many years of study and effort .  | Again the scholar must prepare himself for his work by years of hard training , comparable with which the strictest military discipline is but child 's play . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of the scholar . And then there can be no certainty of definite , tangible results . The man who learns how to build a bridge , knows that there will be bridges to build , and he is reasonably sure to find work . But the scholar must be ready to work ten , twenty , and if need be , forty years with no assurance that he will solve the problem in hand . He must be willing to die without accomplishing his purpose , and , if he have the true spirit , he will not be envious in the thought that another will take up the work where he left it , use his results and finally reach the solution for which he labored so long . Finally the scholar can not expect with certainty any large measure of fame and dignity . A few discoveries have made scholars famous in their lifetime but they are usually based upon the work of earlier scholars who are unknown . Marconi 's name is famous and his life is insured fora million dollars but no one thinks longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not bring ten cents in any market . Yet who is the greater ? One man discovered a great principle of physics and is unknown save to a few . The other is a clever manipulator of known principles and is famous and wealthy . And that is a good illustration of the world 's treatment of scholars . There is loud acclaim and honor and wealth for him who applies principles and makes things which the world can see and hear and smell and use with pleasure . But for the man who discovers great principles there is often nothing but silence and oblivion save in a select circle of holy souls who are specialists . This is the meaning of pure scholarship . You and I who know the spirit and the purpose can see the scholar 's life shining fair and golden bright to our eyes : but all the world can not . It is , for the average man , obscured by a mist , through which he can not see . And when once man passes through that cloud , he knows that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; that he can not reach the things which other men know as comforts . Shall we wonder that the best and most intellectual of men will not pass along this cloudy way into seclusion and oblivion ?  | If there exists a menace to the future of pure scholarship , does it not follow that there is danger also for our civilization ? It is , I hope , almost unnecessary to say that there can be no perfect civilization without a healthy and generous scholarship . No modern society can be symmetrical , sound , and permanent without an adequate development of that phase of living and thinking . Necessary , indeed , is a large and enthusiastic band of searchers after truth ; as necessary , surely , as the men who make bread better or oil cheaper or transportation more comfortable and safe . If our society is to become a perfect society , we must have a generous growth , a healthy rounding out of that side which is the field of the scholar 's effort . Let me illustrate this principle more definitely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of Greek . The literature and institutions of that race are said by some to have little value for the average man . But if we consider the question fairly we shall find that Greek lies close to the very life of our modern day . It is the language in which are written the types of most of the literary forms which we recognize today . It is the medium of expression of the man who made philosophy and asked the most searching questions of the soul . In its care are the beginnings of modern science and mathematics , and finally it is the language in which the words and acts of Christ and the teachings of the apostles are preserved . In Greek then are the sources of literature , art , architecture , philosophy , science , and finally the Christian religion . This means , to speak plainly , that no man can go to the bottom of these subjects without a knowledge of the Greek language . It is an essential for the ultimate result in any of these lines of thought . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Homer and the dramatists . The philosopher must read Plato ; the perfected scientist will need to know the work and the terminology of the Greeks ; the theologian must read his New Testament in Greek . We may argue of the futility of Greek , of its impractical nature , if we will ; but we shall every time come face to face with the stubborn fact that Greek is a necessity . That principle I shall state clearly and definitely ? that a complete society is impossible without a knowledge of the Greek language . I do not mean that every man should know Greek , but I do mean that many should know it . I do mean that some must make of it a life work . If that is not done , our society must be imperfect .  | page deleted  | the great and useful inventions of the world are the result of pure mathematics and pure science . Look at a great modern bridge . It stands in the beauty of graceful proportions , in perfect stability and safety , not because men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because some humble mathematician chose to pass his time fooling with x 's and s . Again , the commercial world sought for years a means of applying the principle of the telephone to the submarine cable . But the problem lay in uncertainty until a great mind solved it . A young man , in the power of the scholar 's equipment , sat at his desk with no tools but pencil and paper , worked out the problem by pure mathematics and told the world how to accomplish its end . But that problem would still be unsolved , if all the men in all the world had been taught nothing but practical electricity and had seen and handled from infancy nothing but a submarine cable . Let me refer you also to the medical profession . Within a decade the life of the average man has been lengthened five years . That splendid work has not been done by physicians in the making of pills and giving of medicines . It is the work of the man of pure science , laboring in the silence of a laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that in practical life , as in literature , scholarship is a necessity for progress . Let us support practical education with enthusiasm , but if we are wise we shall avoid the extreme which would teach that progress in commerce and manufactures is a result solely of manual training . The great advances are not the work of men who have made things . Discoveries are not the products of hands ; are not the results of manual manipulations in an effort to find a practical adjustment . They are the products of great minds taught to do great work . Activity in commerce will , of course , stimulate scientific work but is dependent upon it for progress . If the training of pure scholars be neglected , industry will begin to revolve about its own centre , will stagnate and be throttled ultimately by a lack of progress . Commercial activity and wealth are a prime necessity of our life . They will stimulate and support our literature and pure science but they are powerless to create a sound literature and a sound science . Practical skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cure for can- cer will not be discovered by the practicing physician but by a pathologist who may never have seen a case of measles . The great advances in electricity and steel will follow the work of the physicist and chemist . Practical life will declare to science what it needs , but it must always follow theoretical research . I shall not be misunderstood as arguing against the value of practical and technical training in business , arts , industries , and the applied sciences . I argue only for the symmetrical civilization and , for the realization of that end , one form of education is as important as another . Practical training is good , vastly good and imperatively necessary if we are to have a stable and progressive society . But scholarship is also a necessity and my voice is raised against the policy which would belittle its influence . As we have seen , the field of scholarship offers , at best , but few inducements of a material sort to the highest order of mind . Let us not lessen its chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us rather seek to support and strengthen that side of our civilization by voice and action and by every form of influence . For if the unattractive field is also the subject of ridicule and neglect , where lies the hope of its future . The editor , to whom I have made reference , who overlooks ignores or openly scorns the need of pure scholarship , is a false prophet of his people . He is a social and educational ingrate ; for he is slighting the very scholarship which has made progress sure . In our commonwealth , then , scholarship must have its due honor and its proper place . For other elements in our civilization we need have no fear . We shall have the mind and hand and eye trained to industrial service ; we shall have the brain power necessary for the profitable direction of business enterprise ; we shall have wealth and a spirit which shall prompt us to levy taxes , to cut the corners square , and to keep the brass works shining . And literature and art will follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by wealth and industry . But , if we be not careful , we shall not have scholarship and if we lack that , we shall be unsound and unprogressive in literature , in art , and in industry . If then we are to build here a great and a progressive State , let us not restrict our patronage to the things which need the less encouragement ; for they are near the hands and eyes of men .  |  Let us , by our enactments and appropriations , support the men , who , in the study and the laboratory , prepare the seeds which shall bear fruit in the visible world , the men who deal with that abstract which is the essential forerunner of the concrete . In our zeal let us not forget that sure progress is impossible unless we heartily support him who in seclusion pores over his Greek and his Shakespeare , who dabbles with bottles and with acids , who studies in silence the forces of nature and life ; who , it may be , spends his time solely with x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his work is necessary for a complete civilization . Wealth will buy the great book when it is written . For wealth can see its pages and enjoy the reading . Wealth will also buy the picture when it is painted ; for it can be seen upon the walls and it is an element of beauty . And wealth will be the patron of industrial education ; for it can see in the mind and hand , thus trained , the possibility of ever larger gain . Similarly it will patronize liberally the excellent preacher and teacher ; for they are a necessary element in its life . In these forms of patronage wealth is right , for all these things are good . But pure scholarship will not be thus favored unless wealth has the larger view . It is easy to see why the book and picture should he bought , technical education endowed , and the good teacher well paid . But only the large mind will see the need of the scholar in society . The average man does not know that the great book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German and English literatures ; he does not know that the sayings of Christ are exactly known only to the student of Greek ; he forgets that advances in industry can not be made without the scholar in pure science . Our State should seek to find the exceptional man in literary criticism , in historical research and in pure science and mathematics . To find him we must have the equipment with which to fit and train its men , but when he is found , we must say to him , " Young man , you need not go into business or industry for your comfort ; we shall give you the large income to search for truth in your chosen field . " We shall do that or we shall fail in our duty .
