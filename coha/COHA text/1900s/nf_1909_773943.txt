txt qo THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY IN FLORENCE . those compartments of the ceiling and the divisions of the cornice , by which the squares and niches forming the decoration of the compartments are separated , had been made with a more careful relation to the lines of the columns ; and this might have been very easily effected . But according to what I have heard from old friends of Andrea , he defended himself by reference to the Rotunda at Rome , which had served as his model . Here , as he observed , the ribs that descend from the circular opening in the centre , which gives light to the building , form the compartments , which are divided transversely into those deepened recesses that secure the rosettes , and which diminish by regular degrees from the base to the summit , as do the ribs also , wherefore the latter do not fall precisely on the centres of the columns . He added , that if he who had erected that Temple of the Rotundo , which is the most admirable and most carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact proportions , paid no regard to that circumstance in a vaulting of so much greater size and so superior in import ance , still less was he required to consider it , in the compart ments of a space so much smaller . Be this as it may , many artists , among whom is Michelangelo , are of opinion that the Rotundo was erected by three different architects , the first Ilf whom raised the building to the completion of the cornice which is above the columns ; the second they consider to have carried it from the cornice upwards , that part , namely , wherein are windows of a more delicate manner ; and this portion is certainly very different from that beneath , the vault ing having been then continued without any regard whatever to // the relation required between its compartments and the divisions of the lower part . The third master is believed to have executed that portico which is held to be so exquisite a work . He , there-fore , who should now permit himself to fall into the error of Andrea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sculptor-architect , whose proper designation was Andrea di Domenico Contucci , is not to be confused with Jacopo Sansovino , who was a disciple of Andrea , and took his place-name , but whose chief works are of a later period and mostly at Venice . Andrea 's work leads up to the culminating period and was rather in advance of his time ( 1+6o-1529 ) . Chrono-logically he stands between Giuliano da San Gallo and Baldassare Peruzzi , and there was no artist of his own generation who was his superior in architecture . There are not many buildings of the Italian revival which can be said to possess a naive simplicity , unaffected grace , and beauty unadorned . More commonly , as their enemies delight to affirm , they smack of the pride of learning and conscious striving after effect . But if this be a rule , the monastery church of Santo Salvator ( or San Francesco ) del Monte is one exception ; and some idea of this kind was doubtless in Michelangelo 's mind when he styled it his " fair country-maiden . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more famous // Latin Romanesque San Miniato , as the peasant with the king 's daughter , sharing the delightful prospect of Florence and the Arno . Its face can hardly be said to be its fortune , nor is it , like San Miniato , " all glorious within . " The arrangement of the plan ( page 41 ) is one not uncommon in the Italian churches , and goes to produce a stately and impressive interior . There is much that is pleasing in the proportions of the whole and in the broad surfaces of its cemented walls ; while the details are in perfect keeping with the rusticity of the whole , piquant , and not remarkable for refinement ( Plate 17 ) . Passing from individual works and reviewing the early Florentine manner as a whole , we can not fail to see that first it is affected by the preceding Romanesque and Gothic work . Despising , as the Florentine architects doubtless did , the style of their immediate forerunners , they could not , at a bound , effect the transformation they desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milieu , was too powerful for them . Mediaval church arrangements , for example , were generally preserved , and the plan of Santo Spirito , while semiByzantine and semi-basilican in construction , resembles more the Gothic church of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries than either the pagan temple or the Roman basilica . The Greek cross to which at an early period many of the architects directed their attention , and which controlled the development of transepts and chancel , even in Latin cross types of plan , is a Byzantine ideal rather than a Roman one . Even the horizontalism which characterises exteriors was not due to the ancients more than to the medieval structures of the period immediately preceding ; the heavy projecting cornice which crowned the palazzi was as much the legacy of the Italian Gothic as a revival of the antique . In the facades of the palaces there survives that particular compound forrn of arch peculiar to the Italian Gothic ( a round arch with the extrados of the voussoirs taking a pointed form ) , and also the late Romanesque and Gothic innovation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite method of lintel over arch . For this distinctively Roman fashion does not appear in the Florentine work of the Early Period which is under consideration . The composite arcade of these Florentine architects , where it does exist , is made up of a main pilaster and subsidiary columns to carry the arches , instead of a maw column merely to carry a decorative // entablature , backed by an arcade formed in a wall which does the constructive work , as at the Colosseum , and Roman work generally ( Plates 38 and 58 ) . Thus a Romanesque or basilican system is followed rather than a Roman one , and although the entablature frequently surmounts a row of arches , it does not protrude , or if so , not more than the projection of a flat pilaster , and much less than would be required properly to load a half or threequarter column ( Plate 1o , Ospedale degli Innocenti ) , seen also in the Ducal Palace , Urbino . It is , therefore , not in the least obtrusive , and a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except at the points where the pilaster is employed , and this can not well be done at each divi sion . Further , in the Palazzi Antinori , Pitti , Riccardi , and Strozzi , an attempt is made to work out an arcuated style with-out dependence upon the classic orders , which merits every praise . In this , as in other respects , the palatial style of Florence may be said to be more truly an Etruscan than a Roman revival . Large stones , the use of the arch and great simplicity and solidity of construction were the characteristics of Etruscan // buildings , and they are no less typical of the Florentine town-houses . In constructive principle , the early Renaissance is eclectic , employing the wagon vault , pendentive dome , cross vault , open wood roof , and beamed ceiling indifferently . Not-withstanding the cultivation of the Grecian language and literature , and the introduction of a Greek element into the population of Florence , purely Hellenic architecture had not begun to influence Florentine work up to the end of the fifteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the somewhat fantastic character which the style it had originated assumed in the hands of the Lombards and Venetians . Perhaps enough has been said to indicate that the merits of this earliest phase of the Renais sance are of the highest order , that its originality is beyond cavil , and that there are few periods which deserve more careful study . One failing for which it is difficult to account is the rejection of variety of hue in the material employed . Except for the glazes of the della Robbian ware , inharmonious always ? though a poetic imagination likens them to " fragments of the milky sky itself , fallen into the cool streets and breaking into the darkened churches " ? the buildings mainly rely upon their masses of brown stone for any colour effect ; and it is this want in a land of colour , and among the Byzantine and Gothic buildings and their often splendid polychromatic decoration , which causes them to be overlooked by the ordinary tourist or half-educated architect . Possibly the most plausible explanation of this restraint on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms and proportions to give much heed to their enhancement by colour . The sgraffito decoration applied in some cases ? as , for example , the Palazzo Guadagni ? is just the kind of exception that proves the rule . For in this only two neutral tints are employed ? the black plaster , or first coat , and the white grey second coat , which is cut away to show the design , or to form it on the black background . A blue stone , macigno or pictra serene , is frequently used in interiors , where it contrasts finely with the tan-coloured inorta or pietra forte , both being quarried in the immediate neighbourhood of Florence , at Fiesole and Settignano . Rome , as far as this first period is concerned , may be joined // with Florence , for although afterwards the seat of the culmi nating period at the time of Raffaello and Peruzzi , there is little that one who has studied Florentine work need know about the early Renaissance in Rome . Florence at the time was the real capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Papal schism and various misfortunes , and such artists as were attracted to Rome by Nicholas V. , the firotege of Cosmo de ' Medici , were of the Florentine school . There are a few un-important houses of the time , mostly by Baccio Pontelli and Bernardo Rosselino of Florence , who were employed by the Popes Nicholas V. and Pius II. ; while the greatest work is probably the Palazzo di Venezia , built in 1455 by Francesco del Borgo di Santo Sepolcro for the Venetian Cardinal who became Pope Paul II . The view of the doorway from this building bears out better than any words what has been said as to the modification of archi tectural forms by jewellery design and goldsmith work . The architrave is studded with the semblance of jewels , relieved with delicate carving , while the light and graceful scrolls connecting the little window with the door cornice suggest bands of beaten metal . The arabesque type of ornament , though seldom employed in Florence , flourished to a greater degree in Rome and Siena . The doorway of the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontelli , which has a facade in form very like Santa Maria Novella , Florence , has some good examples in the long narrow pilasters under the trusses which carry the pediment , and on Plate IS some are given from monuments in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo , Rome . Floral and leaf forms were chiefly used at first , and the // grotesque character afterwards developed has not yet appeared . The tomb of Bishop Tommaso Piccolomini ( 1483 ) in Siena Cathedral ( Plate 19 ) shows other renderings of arabesques . The effigy is a most beautiful example of careful study and refined rendering of the human figure , and the whole monument , equally with many another from Florence and Lucca , shows the Tuscan sense of propriety , the qualities of grace and scholarship , enhanced by skilful and tender manipulation . In Siena the fruits of Florentine influence are also seen in the splendid Palazzo Piccolomini ( now the Palazzo del Governo ) attributed to Bernardo Rosselino , who is supposed to have designed it shortly after 146o , having already built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope Pius II . The facade ( Plate 20 ) resembles that of the Palazzo Riccardi ( Plate ri ) in its general conception , but instead of the extreme boldness and gradation of the rustications , a more uniform wall treatment is employed , in front of which , in bold relief , are carved the Sienese shields with the arms of Popes Pius II . and Pius III. , both members of the Piccolomini family . While departing here entirely from the system of design initiated by Alberti in the Rucellai ( page 34 ) , but followed in his palazzo at Pienza , Rosselino in many respects forestalled the Pal . Strozzi , which though better known and built several years later , can scarcely be said to have carried the Florentine school beyond the high-water mark reached by Rosselino . Beyond the palace part of the Loggia del Papa , designed by Federeghi and built about 146o , is seen on the plate . CHAPTER III . Footnote CHAPTER III . THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . IN any treatment of the subject of Italian Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole time into three divisions ? the Early , the Culminating , and the Declining Periods . But in order to deal with these , or any one of them , in strictly chronological sequence , it would be necessary to pass from one district to another in a manner somewhat distressing to a moderate sense of locality ; while such a treatment would be unscientific , in that the continuity of local progress would be interrupted , and the local colour broken . For these reasons it may be better , in dealing with each period , that its course in any district where it appeared should be considered separately . This procedure will cause us again to touch upon Florence , and to take up Rome at the point where we left off in the last chapter ; and if , having fixed the source of what has been called " the foul torrent of the Renaissance , " * we were anxious merely to follow the current of the main stream , we should simply con-tinue the subject from that point . But having decided to stop there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has its own character and interest , and which after various modifications may be said to have ultimately found its way into the main stream at Venice . The centres of Early Renaissance architecture are not the usual elementary district divisions of Florence , Rome , and Venice , but rather those of ( I ) Florence , ( 2 ) Milan , and ( 3 ) Venice . Rome , as already mentioned , is almost wholly dependent upon Florentine artists of indifferent skill , for any work of this period done within its walls , most of it unimportant , and not such as to entitle it to separate classi-fication . Rome 's time of prosperity followed later , and in the culminating period it was the chief centre ; Verona for the first time , and Venice for the second time , becoming the centres of other schools . The varying prosperity of towns , together with , in one or two cases , the advent of some outstanding artist , gave 5o THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . some of the cities a different importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we come to it , we shall find it necessary to deal with the new centres of Vicenza and Genoa , along with Rome again , and Venice for the third time . Venice is thus the only centre which presents important examples of all three periods . Every town in Italy bears the impress of the work of these times , but nearly all can be referred to the influence of the centres named at the particular periods . Adopting this treatment , a difficulty presents itself in regard to the dates . For example , the early Renaissance in Florence ends about 1500 , while in Venice it extends till 1525 , overlapping the beginnings of a new development in Florence and Rome . Disorder of some sort is inevitable in any division of so complicated a matter as the Italian Renaissance , though its treatment need not be immethodical , and such a division as is here marked out will conduce to the clearest and best idea of the subject . It is necessary to have some comprehension of the partition of the country at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy retained the same configuration as that into which they had crystallized by the end of the eleventh century : ? those most important to remember being the Dukedom of Milan ; the Republic of Venice ; the Duchy of Ferrara ; the district of Romagna round Bologna , with the Duchies of Parma and Modena , forming part of the Papal territory , and the Republic of Florence . Besides these , there were the smaller Republics of Genoa and Siena , and the Kingdom of Naples , that part of Italy south of the Papal states . Without a clear conception of these elements of political geography the study of the history of the times is impossible , and the variations of its architecture inexplicable . At the middle of the fifteenth century we find Francesco Sforza , Duke of Milan , administering the affairs of his seigniory with conspicuous ability , and in I466 see him succeeded by his son , Galeazzo Maria , a ruler who has been described as another Nero ; like him , at least in this , that with his open vices he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close and friendly relation subsisted between the Sforza family and the Medici of Florence , and the States of Milan and Florence were more than once allied in warfare . The ambition of Venice , in the eyes of the governments of Italy , was at this time the chief danger to the balance // of power and the peace of the Peninsula . Receiving its first rebuff in the East by the irruption of the Turks in 1453 , its spread of empire on Italian soil was repeatedly checked by the leagued armies of the country , and the interposition of other European powers . The governments , both of Venice and Florence , were nominally Republican , but present some striking contrasts . Above the riotous disposition of the Florentines and the undue influence of merchant princes there rested the fixed ideals of personal freedom and popular government , in great measure attained : the Republic of Venice , on the other hand , is proverbial as an expression for a tyrant oligarchy ; and the lesser degree of individual liberty is written unmistakably in the Venetian art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the Chair of St. Peter had an occupant who evinced some desire for the revival of arts and letters , but the rest of the Popes of the fifteenth century showed more interest in the aggrandizement and extension of their temporal power . Alphonso of Arragon was sovereign of Naples , or the Sicilies , at the middle of the fifteenth century . At his death , in 1458 , the island kingdom and Naples were separated , and Ferdinand I. succeeded . This ruler brought about some amelioration of the backward and abject condition of the once Magna Grcia of a higher Hellenic civilization , fifteen hundred years buried . In North Italy , among the lesser powers , the Marquis of Ferrara appears to have encouraged in his territory the love of the arts , and the d'Este family , to which he belonged , were in this respect not unworthy rivals of the other reigning families in Italy . Pisa was a subject city of Florence , and Siena and Lucca , though free communities , and capable of producing a school of artists of great talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather by motives of jealousy among the con tiguous powers than by their own resources , much as Turkey is able to hold its own to-day , or as Belgium and Holland have remained inviolate amid the struggles of great empires . Such , in broken outline , were the relations of the peninsular repub lics , duchies and kingdoms of the period at which this chapter opens . In many respects which will readily suggest themselves , Italy , then the foremost province of civilization , presents an epitome of the history of the Europe of a later date . On the little stage of Italian soil , with its changing background of the arts , the larger drama of European evolution is rehearsed . 52 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . Beyond the limits of the territorial influence of Florence , Milan was the first to transplant the new growth which had blossomed in " the flower of cities . " For about the middle of the fifteenth century Florentine artists were employed in various buildings in Milan ; Antonio Filarete first , in 1457 , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-Gothic in style , and Michelozzo at the Capella Portinari . ( 1462 ) at San Eustorgio . But the first outstanding architect with whom we meet , and strangely enough , almost the only great artistic personality connected , at the period , with the places we are to consider , was Donato Lazzari , more generally known as Bramante da Urbino ; and since in the first part of this chapter , not to speak of the next on Rome , we shall always be coming into contact with his work , the very few facts known of his earlier life may be worth retailing . Urbino , the capital of the duchy of that name , and the birthplace of the still more famous Raffaello , is a small town , lying some fifty miles south of Ravenna , and eighteen miles landward from the Adriatic . It was in a house just outside Fermignano , a village near Urbino , that Bramante was born ( 1444 ) . The name he bears signifies , in the Italian , ? " longing , " and his career proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little is known but that he had instruction in painting from Andrea Mantegna at Mantua , where he may also have come under the influence of Alberti , whose church of Sant ' Andrea was building in 1472 . We have it too , from the writings of almost an immediate successor ( Serlio ) , that he was " first a painter and had great skill in perspective art before he applied himself to architecture . " Architectural power seems from his days to have passed into the hands of the painters , who soon out-numbered the sculptor-architects of the Florentine school . This was not without its effect upon the art , and arose in part from the fictitious importance given at the time to the science of perspective , in which the painters were naturally more proficient . Not that it signified much in itself whether the way to the practice of architecture lay past the painter 's easel or through the sculptor 's bottega , so long as the man qualified himself as an architect . It would be a mistake to suppose , that because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way through the painters ' and sculptors ' studios , that therefore such a training must , at any // period , best fit one for the work . These particular cases only show that special capacity under favouring circumstances will assert itself and find its true outlet . Many painters and sculptors of the era made poor architects , and hundreds of them never indicated any architectural skill whatever . The best of the architects were those who laid everything aside for their art , and became no longer painters and sculptors , but architects . It was so with Brunelleschi , and Bramante , too , seems to have laid aside his palette to give all his energies to the building art . From Milan , where he appears to have been employed from 1476 to the end of the century , Bramante went to Rome , where his first important works were the choir and cloister of the convent church of Santa Maria della Pace . These were executed under the direction of the Cardinal Oliviero Caraffa , and appear to have recommended him to the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 , gave him the commission to paint the pontifical arms over the Porta Santa of the church of St. John Lateran , a door which is opened only in the year of jubilee . This Pope afterwards appointed Bramante as an assistant architect , but it was only with the accession of Julian della Rovere ( Julius II. ) that his opportunity arrived . Of that potentate 's ambitious schemes for a new Vatican and a new St. Peter 's , Bramante bad full control till the death of the Pope in 1513 . It would not be fair implicitly to accept the view of Michelangelo 's latest biographer that Bramante was " a maneuvering and managing individual , entirely unscrupulous in his choice of means , condescending to flattery and lies , " because the interests of Michelangelo and Bramante were constantly in opposition , partly on account of Raffaello da Urbino , who is believed to have been Bramante 's nephew . Whatever may have been the weak points in his character , Bramante was an accomplished architect , and filled a very large space in the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his connection with St. Peter 's may be left to the following chapter . Taking leave of Bramante meantime , in order to consider some of the chief buildings in progress at the time of his early manhood in this district of Milan , we may first view the facade of the Certosa di Pavia ( Plate 21 ) . This part of " the most magnificent monastery in the world " was begun in 1491 , 54 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . and the names of Ambrogio Borgognone , Giovanni Antonio Amadeo , and Agostino Busti have all been connected with the design of the lower portion of the front . As an example of painter 's architecture ( for Borgognone , at least , was a painter more than an architect ) nothing could be finer , and it is im-possible to praise too greatly the delicate perfection of the details of the lower part . A change occurs at the level of the triforium , or frieze of windows , and above that level the design is simpler and more architectonic , while the detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cristoforo Solari . Broadly , . the features worthy of notice are the deep buttresses , and Gothic basement mouldings , and the niches ; and passing to the more classical ele-ments , the rectangular window openings , with broad architraves divided by an inner order of baluster , or more correctly , candelabrum shafts of magnificent workmanship , in their form suggested probably by the work of Libero Fontana , a silversmith who had caught the inspiration of the Renaissance sooner . The candelabra ( Plate 22 ) are connected with insignificant arches , and the whole window covered with a bold cornice surmounted by a cresting , bearing some resemblance to that surmounting the Greek tomb . In one respect , at least , the facade resembles much modern work in that there is not " the indecency of a single bare square foot of wall , " every available spot being filled up with figures , medallions with busts , or squares with circles of coloured marble . The body of the church was begun nearly a century before the facade , and is thus in the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . For although the prevalence of the round arch in the work of the nave and cloisters might lead us to assume an earlier or Romanesque period for the date of the nave , the conjecture would be erroneous , as the work was commenced in 1396 . The exterior treatment of the lantern is a classical version of that of Chiaravalle hard by , and is characteristic of the district . Although the construction of the interior is Gothic , it is profusely decorated with work almost entirely in the early Renaissance style . Of such is the doorway illustrated , by Amadeo , a Lom bard sculptor-archi-tect of the period . Like the Certosa itself , the door is only beau tiful up to a certain level , and falls away after that is reached . The splayed ingoing with its continuous cap , most charmingly sculptured , is a pleas ing variation of the Florentine treatment . The workmanship on the lower part of this doorway , like that of the facade , is magni ficent , and the deli cacy of the carving unrivalled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if it be considered along with the crowning ornament of the windows of the facade and their candelabra shafts , some idea will be formed of the closeness with which these Lombard craftsmen were following the motifs of metal . A building of a similar type and of this period , scarcely further removed from Milan on the other side , is the Cathedral of Como . In this beautiful building , constructed of white marble , 56 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . the transitional style is really seen to better advantage than in the grandiose Certosa . Here again are the deep buttresses , the corbelled-out figures , the fanciful pinnacles , but the restraint of the true architect makes itself felt for the better . It is not likely to have been from lack of resources , else the pinnacles would scarcely have blossomed out in the way they do : and one of the strong points of the design is the massive solidity and simplicity of the lower part of the building as opposed to the delicate richness of the sky-line ( see Frontispiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as work of a similar type is concerned , Spain was at least twenty-five years later , and there is no doubt that this originated in Italy . The south doorway ( Plate 23 ) is attributed to Bramante ( 1491 ) , and it // may be that to him also we owe the elevation of the south aisle wall . There is no doubt he worked in Lombardy , and we shall have occasion to study some work of his immediately in Milan ; besides , the composition of the door is of a type in which Bramante delighted , consisting of two concentric arches on pilasters joined by a series of seven four-sided panels , the reveal being left severely square . The lunette is occupied by a sculpture-picture of a favourite subject , the " Flight into Egypt . " The church is cruciform in plan , resembling the Cathedral of Florence , on a much smaller scale , and the tri. - apsidal arrangement is common to both . The greater part of this building , including the transepts and choir , was the joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter part of the fifteenth century . Part of the better known abbey church of Santa Maria delle Grazie at Milan ( Plate 24 ) , has been ascribed to Bramante ( 1492 ) , and with some reason , at least of the sort that may be distinguished as internal evidence . Over a basement of rich mouldings and a band of great medallions , there rises a series of rectangular recesses in close juxtaposition , some of which are made use of as windows , the others having been evidently destined for some kind of decoration . On the mullions dividing these openings are placed pilasters on pedestals , with an intermediate baluster shaft over the centre of the space below , an arrangement which seems to have been a favourite one with Bramante . In place of the semidomes of Como , the apsidal chapels are covered by a simple , boldly projecting tile roof . That the upper parts of the church were erected by Bramante is not so probable ; they are , however , thoroughly typical of the district , and in harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great dome problem is much less heroic than that of Brunelleschi at Florence ( completed in its essential part half a century previous ) , but it has many merits , and is scarcely less beautiful . Its family likeness to that at the Certosa di Pavia ( page 54 ) scarcely needs to be remarked . Whether or not the design as it is now realised is the work of Bramante , the Early Renaissance does not furnish a composition more happily inspired . The Church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro ( which henceforward we shall call San Satiro for brevity ) , in the same city , has also been attributed to Bramante , and with regard to the 58 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . sacristy , there can be little possible doubt that he was the author of its existence . The remarkable point about the church ( begun about 1474 ) is that , owing to some re-arrangement of adjoining streets , the architect having built his nave was left without room for a sanctuary . The manner in which this little difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as be guessed at , by those who have had no information on the point . It was , in fact , to construct in low relief a sanctuary with its ornament and decoration in perspective . The effect of this , seen from the middle of the nave , may be tolerable , but when viewed from other parts , its effect may well be imagined . Bramante had doubtless seen or heard of the earlier octagonal sacristy at Santo Spirito in Florence , and in the case of the Sacristy of San Satiro ( 1498 ) he adopted the octagonal form with semicircular niches on a small scale ( Plate 25 ) . The pro poitions differ , the Milanese example being higher in relation to its diameter , consequently the side of the octagon is much attenuated . Probably for this reason Bramante employed a single pilaster bent to the angle , instead of pilasters coupled near the corners , leaving the angles free as in the Florentine example ( page 40 ) ; and by this he secured a much greater appearance of rigidity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement startles , but on closer acquaintance its reason ableness is forced in upon one , and it is impossible not to admire the resource by which the difficulty is overcome , even if the expedient itself be not approved . The breaking back of the entablature over the pilaster , in this case , is a masterly touch . At first sight it would seem as if the awkwardness would half disappear if the entablature had been carried round without a break , supported on the angle pilasters ; but consideration will show that it was necessary to carry up these lines , so bringing the pilaster in harmony with the entablature , connecting it with the upper tier , and giving force and strength to the angles . From the clever way in which this difficulty is surmounted alone , one would be inclined to accept the view that the architect of the sacristy and the constructor of the perspective sanctuary were one and the same . The shell ornament does not seem to have occurred to the Florentine architects as a very suitable ceiling for a semicircular niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is upon a recessed order , and // surrounded by a relieved archivolt . A departure from the sacristy of Cronaca is the rich triforium treatment of the first-floor storey ; and a striking peculiarity are the large leaf consoles taking the place of the pillar or candelabrum pillar , which in early work of Bramante we might naturally expect to see . The light in this case is derived wholly from elliptical openings in the sides of the cupola . Ambrogio Foppa ( nick-named Cara d ' Osso ? bear 's face ) , a native of Milan , * modelled the splendid frieze of child figures and great heads in terra-cotta , overlaid with bronze . Recollecting what has been said about the characteristics of Florentine work , it will be seen that the decoration of the main pilaster with arabesque orna ments indicates a change . The Florentines seem to have felt the arabesque out of place in a pilaster , where strength , or the appearance of it , was required , as , for example , in the Floren tine example referred to ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fluted . But Bramante seems to have over-come such scruples , if he ever had them himself , and from this time for half a century , the ornamental pilaster , perhaps un fortunately , became an indispensable feature of North Italian work . Leaving the immediate surroundings of Milan we might travel through Lombardy by way of Bergamo , Brescia , and Verona , and by gradual change of feature and treatment , scarcely be conscious , on arrival at Venice , of any distinctive character separating the Milanese and Venetian schools . Their individuality will appear more clearly if we transport ourselves at once to Venice . A few sentences are , however , necessary to explain the peculiar position of this capital . The Republic of Venice reached the pinnacle of her greatness about the end of the fifteenth century , having extended her dominion seawards to Dalmatia and Crete , and landwards to Padua , Vicenza , Verona , Brescia , and as far as Bergamo , almost at the gates of Milan . These Italian cities were all acquired during the fifteenth century , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Lion of Saint Mark in token of their subjugation . We naturally , therefore , look for , and find in these towns signs of Venetian influence during that period , and for some time afterwards . But there is another side to the , 6o THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . shield . Conquerors have always been willing to learn art from those they have been able to subjugate , and the successful feuds with the Milanese were the indirect means of introducing much Lombardic influence into Venetian territory . The architect of the Porta della Carta , for example , was a native of Bergamo , and the Lombardi family , who so enriched Venice with their works , belonged probably , as the name suggests , to some part of Lombardy . In this , as in other tendencies , Venice very much resembled Rome , which gathered to itself , in the time of its greatness , the styles of the known world . For Venice was another meeting place of East and West , in its early years assimilating Byzantine and Arabic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its own heterogeneous styles , the rising renaissant art of the Milanese : not that of Florence , be it observed . Among the first things that strike one in studying this matter , is the fact that the first appearance of a truly Renaissance building in Venice is so late as about 1470 . When it is remembered that Brunelleschi had opened his career by building the Pazzi Chapel at Florence in 1420 , that the Palazzo Riccardi dated from 1430 , and that eager hands all over Italy were carrying on the style Brunelleschi had initiated , it is remarkable that fifty years should elapse before its adoption at Venice , and that it should reflect so little Florentine character . Various circumstances unite to account for this , and a very brief outline of its history will serve to make it comprehensible . The original stock , from whom Venice takes its name , were the Veneti , who peopled the district round Padua , on the mainland , in very early times . In the second century before Christ they concluded an alliance with Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly . On the irruption of the Northern hordes , Padua , the capital , and after Rome the wealthiest town in Italy , was destroyed , a remnant of the inhabitants taking refuge in the islands of the Lagune , where they came under the protection of the Eastern Emperor , who was represented by an Exarch at Ravenna . Rudely separated from their native soil , they began life anew on the desolate mudbanks of Torcello and Rivoalto , and out of hardness and toil and obscurity proceeded the greatest of the medieval republics . By the time of the fifteenth century Venice was the emporium RELATIONS OF VENICE AND FLORENCE . 6i of the commerce of Europe , and had great power and influence both by land and sea . Its history was therefore of a unique character , and in relation to such ancient cities as Florence and Rome , it stood much as America stands to the older powers of Europe . The enthusiasm begotten of a newly discovered antiquity of renown was lost upon the Venetians . They had no part in a great Etrurian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent ; nor could they ardently join in the contemplation of the past glories of a world-wide empire . Instead of the shadow they had the substance , and if in the fifteenth century they had not surpassed the conquests and greatness of ancient Rome , they may have fondly imagined that they had . Thus the element of sympathy was wanting , and it was possible that they had a touch of contempt for the Florentines , in so far as they lived in the past among the ancient manuscripts , rather than in the present . But a more potent cause of contempt presents itself in the events of the period . In 1438 the Florentines most generously came to the assist ance of the Venetians in endeavouring to preserve Bergamo and Brescia , threatened by the Duke of Milan , and for several years they fought side by side against the Milanese . Various circumstances led the Florentines to take another view of things , and promptly to go over to the enemy . In retaliation the Venetians , about 1440 , published a decree expelling every Florentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . The war between Venice and Florence , in 1467 , was a farther result of this bitter ness , though directly instigated by the exiles from Florence . No territorial changes resulted from this " war , " which , " in accordance with the custom of the times , " * did not occasion a single death , and consisted of " some slight skirmishes , " and the wounding of a few horses , each side behaving with quite remarkable cowardice ; but it had its effect in still farther alienating the two powerful neighbours . Altogether it is not surprising that Venice should have drawn her architects and the forms of her architecture , not from Florence directly , but at her from the districts of Lombardy which she had conquered and naturalized , although , as we shall find , she put her own stamp upon them . 62 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . It has been shown that there was no transition in Florence . Although Brunelleschi frequently retained Gothic ideas and systems , his personal study of the antique forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their restoration in purity ; and some of his pupils and successors in Florence went even farther , and attempted not only the revival of the technic , but of the Roman architecture . But one can readily understand that in the more remote parts of the country the new or resuscitated forms would graft themselves upon those in use , not , perhaps , so much because their architects loved them , as that they could not resist the tendency towards their reproduction . The first indication of this in Venice is to be found in the western or Piazzetta facade of the Doges ' Palace , though at first sight or in general form there appears n o t h i n g classical about it . Part of this was built between the years 1424 and 1442 in continuation of the Gothic palace , thus beginning a little later but almost coincident with the building of Brunelleschi 's dome , and classical churches . And even at this date there is nothing in the elevation to justify its being classified as transitional work , although in the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , there is an absence of the symbolism which characterises the series on the sea front , and the introduction of classical subjects. * But in the Porta della Carta ( so called from the cards or placards announcing the edicts of the Republic ) omens more unmistakable of the new art influence present themselves . The composition is wholly Gothic , // but signs of classical influence are observable in the treatment of the mouldings and in the shell , though this form might at any time be looked for in a city whose boundaries were the salt sea waves . And a stronger indication of classical feeling is the admixture of cupids among the leaves , for in the words of a recent writer , " it was already the time of the Renaissance , and all the uncleanly gods of the heathen , with all their fables , were coming back , for the diversion and delight of the licentious and learned . " ( ! ) ? This was the work ( 1439 ? 43 ) of Bartolomeo Buon , the Bergamo architect already mentioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , simply " Opus Bartolomei . In the interior of the court there are clearer signs of Renaissance influence , but this is some fifty or sixty years later in date , and after buildings on purely classical lines had been erected in Venice . Even then , however , the pointed arch has been constructed , so firm were the roots of the Venetian Gothic . The little facade beyond the Giants ' Stair is worthy of notice , being the work ( in 1520 ) of another Bergamo archi-tect , known as Guglielmo Bergamasco , and the detail of the 64 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . window gives a good idea of the character of his work . The staircase itself belongs to the end of the fifteenth century , and was executed by Antonio Bregni ( Rizzi ) ; but Sansovino 's statues of Mars and Neptune , from which it derives its name , belong to the middle of the sixteenth century . Almost fresh from the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie at Milan , and Bramante 's Sacristy of San Satiro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest and best examples , Santa Maria dei Miracoli , begun six or seven years after those Milanese buildings . The first thing that will strike one is the shape of the cupola , which suggests the domes of St. Mark . Like the domes of St. Mark , too , it is over a square plan , although even from the exterior we can see that it is not carried upon arches ; in fact the position is unusual , being above the sanctuary . The composition from this point of view is extremely pleasing . The simple and artless way in which the coloured marbles are in-laid is delightful . In examples only a few years later we find them framed and suspended with ribbons in a somewhat ridiculous fashion . But what can be said of the composition of the // principal elevation ( page 66 ) ? The smugness and woodenness so painfully apparent are in part due to modern restoration , but under no circumstances could it have ranked as a successful composition . The fact is , that the church exterior was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his time he never succeeded in solving it . There is scarcely so much as an attempt in Florence ? the Church of the SS . Annunziata is smothered in a long and deep portico mainly of the seventeenth century , and the San Salvator del Monte is severely plain and almost barnlike , despite some merit . To the exterior of these this one bears no resemblance , and scarcely more to the Certosa or Santa Maria delle Grazie . Whence then had Lombardo his prototype or suggestion for this exterior ? A reasonable theory is that these scattered pilasters are really the classicising of the Romanesque pilaster strips , which the architect might see any day at San Zeno , Verona , the Romanesque buildings at Venice , or at the earlier buildings of Ravenna , where they are simple brick projections , joined by round arches at the top . As for the round roof and pediment , we do not meet with them in other districts in early Renaissance work , and it is quite apparent that the form is suggested by the Byzantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form is openly confessed , and is not hidden behind an ogee frilling of crockets , as on the Cathedral . The facts seem to be either that Pietro Lombardo had a somewhat hazy idea of what classical architecture was , although he had acquired ( most probably in Lombardy ) a Roman technic , or that he was even less desirous than Brunelleschi of constructing a Grxco-Roman edifice . It appears that he sought , with what knowledge he possessed , to purify the current architecture of Venice , and tried to get to the roots of things . In so doing he traced the 66 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . strips to the pilaster , and in the ogee sky-line of St. Mark 's he found a corruption of the true late Roman form of roof , which he restored in comparative purity . For it need hardly be explained that the roofs of St. Mark 's , like genuine Byzantine roofs , and , to go further back , like the roofs of the Basilica of Constantine and the Roman baths , were round wagon-vaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wanting that the type of the early Venetian Renais sance was n o t something outside Venice , not Greek nor Roman build ings , surely t h e Scuola di S a n Marco ( 1485 ) ( Plate 26 ) would be sufficient to carry conviction . The likeness to t h e facade of the Cathedral of St. Mark is strikingly close , and there can be no doubt that to a certain extent it formed the model on which this curious structure J was designed . V e can not say that it shows an advance upon its prototype , but its designer ( Martino Lombardo ) was honest in his aim of refining the propor tions , and purifying Byzantine detail , having traced it back to its classic source . There certainly never was a build ing quite like it in Rome , or Roman Italy , and it is on the whole the most fantastic work of the early Renaissance . One remarkable feature about the front is the attempt to picture a colonnade in perspective relief . Even in this the recessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // is about ten or eleven years later than San Satiro at Milan , and it is possible that the monstrous idea originated there , though in this case without the excuse it had in Milan , that it was forced upon the architect , and was merely an expedient to overcome a serious difficulty . But such caprices were not uncommon among the architects of the time , and in many similar ways did they exhibit their delight at the discovery of their ability to represent on a limited plane surface the effects of distance and foreshortening . " How charming a thing is this perspective ; oh , if I could only get you to understand the delights of it ! " the painter , Paolo Uccelli , who was the first to apply it to advantage , was wont to say to his wife when s h e nightly called him from his arduous labours to repose . So entirely did he give himself up to t h e fascinating p u r s u i t that he failed to rise above mediocrity in his art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that these architects , in their huge delight in the new science , had by its abuse imperilled their own reputation and that of their works for anything else but oddity . There is often more than one way of classifying an object or a series , and one need not then be surprised to learn that Ruskin classifies this and the other buildings of our subject along with the " Gothic School , " and as " consisting of its first corruptions . " No architect will hold this view for a moment , for he knows that between the Doges ' Palace facade and such a one as this there is nothing less than F 2 68 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . an architectural revolution ; but the terms may be transferred to a bit of building adjoining the facade , which is strictly transitional , and may be so classified ? the doorway , namely , of the Church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo , on the right hand of Plate 26 , with its pointed arch springing from an entablature of classic form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miracoli , the architect shows much more skill than in his treatment of its exterior . The work is of a very high order indeed , and one of the finest examples of its kind . The whole walls are lined with marble slabs , separated by stiles of slight projection , and of a stronger colour , in most severely simple rectangles . All the carving on the white marble pilasters and doorways is of the most refined and delicate description . The roof is barrel vaulted , being also round outside , and at the springing inter nally rises from an arcade formed of small transverse coves ( Plate 27 ) . The arrangement of the sanctuary and the two ambones with the doors right under is unique , but the high and steep stairway recalls the rude flight of steps which intersects " the stern ledges that sweep round the altar of Torcello . " Changed , however , is the disposition of . the arrangements from the mother church in the ninth century , where the bishop sat // in the east end of the apse facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the priest perforce turns his back to the people , and all the change from the Communion to the Mass is manifested ; in such ways does architecture chronicle history . At the other end square marble pillars support a gallery , which is screened off from the rest of the church , forming a separate room . The illustration ( page 67 ) is of the exquisite frieze and capital from the arch between nave and sanctuary , among the most beautiful of the period anywhere . The style is usually called by ornamentists the cinque cento , but the finest examples belong to the last quarter of the quattro cento , or the fourteen hundreds ( or , as we call it , fifteenth century ) ; and there is possibly more of the arabesque ornament in Italy belonging to the quattro cento than the cinque cento . This delightful example is distinguished by a simple naturalism , as in the treatment of the leaves and birds , and in the amphibious element appropriate to the Venetians . The distinctive Roman enriched mouldings of the architrave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst the frieze is undercut like most Venetian work , but in a most reserved and delicate manner . Another example of the beautiful detail characteristic of the Venetian work of this date is given ( page 68 ) from the Scuola di San Marco , but a richer and even finer piece of Venetian carving is the frieze from a doorway in the Doges ' Palace . I lure , instead of the low relief of the last examples , or the still lower relief of Florentine work , there is very bold undercutting , the forms of the foliage and the whole feeling suggesting sea-weed as much as anything , and quite likely it may have been inspired by that form of vegetation , the most familiar to the Venetians , as the acanthus to the Greeks , or as the oak leaf to 70 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . the English . The bracket is a very daintily executed piece of work , with considerable natural freedom , and the panelled architrave , which in Florence would probably be the part most enriched , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetian ornament , are the details from the beautiful marble chim ney-piece in an audience-chamber of the Doges ' Palace . The Grand Canal , t h e finest curved street in the world , is lined , almost from end to end , with the palazzi of the great Vene tian families . These are of all periods , from the By-zantine to the eighteenth century , b u t there are few indeed , which in simple g r a c e a n d beauty can vie with the Palazzo Cornaro-Spinelli ( page 71 ) , presumably a work of the Lombardi . The designer , whoever he may have been , had in this case some notion of the work at Florence initiated fifty years before ; at least , one would be inclined so to infer from the rusticated basement , of which this is // the first example in Venice . The free distribution of the windows in the basement is interesting , and shows the advantage of being sometimes relieved of the orders . These are employed only in the form of pilasters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the windows gives relief , and sufficient contrast is afforded to the two similar upper storeys by the varying shapes and projections of the balconies , together with the simple entablature of small projection which crowns the facade . The trefoil balcony is a beautiful feature , but what should be specially noticed is the Gothic roundness of the sections of the window tracery bars , and the de lightfully natural leaf form of the eye , which in other examples becomes a circle . In pro-portion the facade makes a perfect square of just sixty-one feet . The Palazzo Vendramini ( Plate 28 ) , by Pietro Lom bardo ( 1481 ) , is another of more advanced charac ter , but still within our limits . The tracery has assumed a more classical character , in so far as the tracery bars are flatter in the face , partaking more of the nature of archivolts , and the eye is depraved to a circular form . The orders are applied throughout , and the monotony of an equal division of height to some extent avoided by the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular and massive treatment of the basement , while in horizontal spacing it is counteracted by the grouping of the central windows in the manner characteristic of all Venetian building of every age . This irregularity , which has given to // already referred to in connection with the Miracoli church , but in this case framed with mouldings and tied up with ribbons . Striking features in the principal storey are the trophies suspended from the tops of trees , off which the branches have been lopped , with just a stray leaf delicately carved , here and there , almost upon the wall surface . Ruskin has suggested that it is as if the workman had intended to leave us an image of the expiring naturalism of his so-styled " Gothic School . " In the towns lying between Venice and Milan , as has been already indicated , the character of the work suggests influence from both sides . Verona , almost the first town we come to travelling westward , has in the little Capella Gesu , in the Church of Sant ' Anastasia , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the elaborately carved marble work is probably carried too far ; it is advanced work , and almost out of our limits . The lectern , choir stalls and o yher 74 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . intarsia and carved woodwork of date 1499 , in Santa Maria in Organo , are interesting , and the illustration will serve to show the delicate curvature of its brackets , and the rich open cresting of the desk , recalling the crowning ornaments of the Certosa near Milan . In Verona ( Plate 30 ) there is also the Palazzo del Consiglio , or Town-hall ( 1476 ) , a work of Fra Giocondo , one of the many versatile geniuses which the time pro duced , and a native of the town . The arcade will suggest that of Bru nelleschi at Florence in its treatment ( Plate 1o ) ; but Brunelleschi would have avoided the division which places the pilaster in the middle of the front . It also differs from the Florentine loggie in the free use of the arabesque pilaster . The facade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of which we recog nise our old friend Vitruvius Pollio , of classic memory . A t Padua , the Loggia del Consiglio ( Plate 30 ) , deputed to Biagio Rossetti , is another elegant building of the same type with an open loggia approached by a broad and lofty flight of steps . Travelling farther in the direction of Milan , two buildings at Brescia might well detain us . The Palazzo Municipio or La Loggia ( page 75 ) is one of the largest and most splendid works in the North Italian cities . Begun about 1489 by Formentone of Vicenza , some of its later decoration was con tributed by Jacopo Sansovino and Palladio . It inclines in its design more nearly to Roman models than any of so // early a period in the north . More characteristic if less dignified is the Church of La Madonna dui Miracoli ( Plate 31 ) with a facade perhaps the most ornamental of its class . Lying in the dominion of Venice at the time , and yet near enough to Milan to be influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would naturally expect . Sharing some of the faults of the early Renaissance exteriors , it marks an advance in composition on the church at Venice dedicated to the same name . Its ornamental details are equal in delicacy and refinement to those in the interior of that building , but their appropriateness to an exterior treatment is at least open to question . The candelabra ( which do not appear in Venice ) in the panels , are fanciful to the extreme in design , and of superb workmanship , entering into details of inconceivable minuteness . On the frieze on the left side of the porch may be observed a miniature sculpture-picture 76 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OFT OF FLORENCE . of the Nativity , while the corresponding space on the other side is occupied by the Baptism of our Saviour . The most remarkable feature of the church is the porch , constructed for the most part of white marble , with its richly treated order , suffering much from the larger scale of the main pilasters . The little Renaissance chapel at the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of almost Florentine grace and simplicity , and seems at first sight to upset geographical theories . Here are the corbels , which . Brunelleschi uses under the architrave in the Sacristy and Church of San Lorenzo , and the simple panelled pilaster . But t h e Gothic basement is a more northern touch , as is also the double architrave , a very literal translation of the Gothic recessed orders , and we can not conceive of a Floren tine architect making use of either . Apart from the capitals of Florence , Venice , and Milan , no city seems to have prospered at this period more than Bologna , which is crowded with early palazzi of a somewhat distinct character . Their workmanship , unfortunately , is crude , and never rises to a very high level , except in the Palazzo Bevilacqua-Vincenzi ; and it is only in the court of this building that great excellence is attained ( Plate 32 ) Notwithstanding a slight tameness of design , especially in the repetition of the architrave and cornice over the upper and lower tiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its charming detail , and there is scarcely a finer cortile in all Italy . Another well-known example in the same town is that of // exterior differs from most of those in Bologna in that it is with-out the continu ous arched loggia , which , forming the footpath of the street , runs below the prig-cipal floor of the houses ; but in poverty of ex-terior design and detail they are all much alike . Of the smaller dwellings , the Casa Tacconi ( page 79 ) is the most interesting . Here as at Milan brick and terra cotta are the materials most ready to hand , and affect the character of the buildings . but there was no school of archi-tecture in Bologna , and such quality as is expressed by the work may be said to be eclectic , borrowing from all sides , but losing entirely the simplicity and breadth which distinguish that of Florence , and by coarseness of execution failing to catch the refined grace and sumptuous elegance characteristic both of Venetian and Lombardic design . the Fava , but this , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moulded brick facade , is of much less merit than the Bevi lacqua cortile . The Bevilacqua 7s THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . Taking the Early North Italian work as a whole , we note in its favour that it is marked by great delicacy and refinement of ornamental details , far excelling in this respect anything of the kind executed during the Roman Empire , and only to be matched by the work of the best periods of Greek art . Much of it , however , is frittered and frivolous , and even in the best examples it frequently errs on the side of minuteness and excess . In the nature of the North Italian ornament there survives some of the old Lombard fire and energy , as well as its love of the grotesque , the same spirit which decorated the front of San Michele at Lucca and the doorway of San Zeno ; but the legendary character of Lombard ornament , and also the symbolism of Byzantine art , gradually dies out under the new principle of simple devotion to the beautiful for its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details seems to have hindered proper attention to design in mass , so that , but for one or two exceptions , it was exceedingly defective , confused , or fantastic in composition . During all its course it remained experimental , for if exception be nude in // favour of one or two of the dwelling-houses , there is no building which is complete within and without , and is quite satisfactory . Its importance , therefore , does not rest entirely on what was achieved at the time , but in the power of composition and command over detail , which its gradual unfolding placed in the hands of the masters of the culminating period which succeeded . The argument that the Renais sance , being purely imitative , is unworthy of study , or of being placed in the same category as the preceding styles , against which contention it was possible to make a case even in Florence , becomes more unfair and even ridiculous in the face of such buildings and such ornament as the North Italian districts present . But instead of taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first corruptions of the Gothic school , we might , with more truth , take the very opposite view , that it consisted in a purification of the corrupt Italian Gothic and Romanesque . The architects of the time , their eyes opened to the beauty of the antique forms , and a working knowledge of ancient principles attained to , looked on the illogical Italian Gothic forms and treat ments from a new standpoint , and saw in them merely cor ruptions of the old Roman methods . Such buildings as the Cornaro-Spinelli and the Vendramini can not with any show of reason be described as corrupt Gothic buildings . They 8o THE EARLY RENAISSANCE OUT OF FLORENCE . are certainly developments of the Gothic palaces , whose chief features they present ; but treated with the Roman technic , which all along had been most applicable to the classical forms the Italians chose to retain during the medieval period , and to which in the degradation and exhaustion of their Gothic style they very naturally and properly turned . The construction and general effect of the church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivable from the Cathedral of San Marco , and by that building , too , is the plan of Santo Salvatore inspired . Thus the Early Renaissance , particularly in North Italy , if not deemed worthy of the status of a distinct style , might be better described as a complex combination of styles rather than a revival of any one in particular . Much of what was good and useful in the Byzantine and medæval tradition and local characteristics was preserved in every new work , while to these were added , or restored , the classical forms and treatment of orders , ornament , and moulding , which seemed to the designers the purest and best . With one or two exceptions , such as the beautiful Arch of Alphonso of Arragon , at Naples ( Plate 33 ) , built of white marble between the massive round towers of the Castello Nuovo , and the Basilica or Loggia of Brescia ( page 75 ) , whose very purpose in each case is essentially a Roman survival , no one building bears the slightest resemblance to any the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that imitation was intended ; while there is abundant evidence that the archi tects , of Venice at least , were inspired by a natural and patriotic admiration of the great monuments of early Venetian history . CENTRAL PERIOD , 15o6-1550 . CHAPTER IV . Footnote CHAPTER IV . THE CULMINATION IN ROME . To attempt to weigh the various agencies which gave being and form to the period of artistic activity known as the culmination of the Renaissance , giving to each cause its proper effect , would be an utterly impossible task . But some of them may be clearly apprehended : on the one hand , the growth of the wealth and power of the Church , not as a church merely ; the forcible , ambitious and statesmanlike character of Pope Julius II . ; the gravitation of aristocratic families to Rome ; the social rivalry ? these gave the opportunity and rough-hewed the schemes . Prepared at every point to shape them were the striking artistic personalities of the day , the cumulative results of a long line and unbroken tradition of fifteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalry . When to " Mars " in the shape of Julius II . succeeded " Pallas " " in Leo X. , a Medici of the Florentine house , in full sympathy with the beautiful arts , the happy moment was prolonged , and thus even a clerical despotism became for a brief season the home of art and culture . Minor influences on the part of the artists were the diversity of their training in different parts of Italy , and the sensible modification wrought in each case by actual contact with the monuments of ancient Rome , which seems to have blended dissimilitude of individual tastes and training in a perfect harmony . The whole period is comprised between the years 1506-50 , and the briefest possible summary of contemporary events will be an advantage . We have seen that 1492 , the memorable year which hailed the discovery of a new world , and the expulsion of the Moors from Spain , and with these events the G 2 // rise of that country , witnessed in the death of Lorenzo it Magnifico , the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later the entry of Charles VIII . of France , at the call of Ludovico Sforza of Milan , in a campaign against Naples , inaugurated a most distressful period for the whole of Italy , during which it was ravaged by Germans , French and Spaniards ; and this but the beginning of three and a half centuries of humiliation and oppression , ending only in our own day and generation . In 1508 came about the concert of the powers of France and Spain , the Pope and the German Emperor , against Venice , known as the League of Cambrai . Matters soon took another complexion , and from this period till about 1529 a condition of things approaching anarchy prevailed over the greater part of the peninsula , due to the wars between France and Spain . Rome and Venice seem to have been least affected ; Rome by its alliance with the enemies of Italy , and Venice by its own strength and independence . As a result of Pope Clement 's duplicity , however , Rome itself , in 1527 , suffered siege and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Emperor Charles V. of Spain . From this blow it seems quickly to have recovered , and although on first thought it might appear surprising that the peaceful arts should have preserved a course almost uninterrupted , it must be remembered that the wars of the period were comparatively harmless affairs , and seldom did much damage to property , although gunpowder had long been in use , and battles had assumed a much more serious aspect during the sixteenth century . These wars certainly retarded the progress of art in North Italy , while tending to its centralization in // Rome ; and not till peace was declared in 1529 did Venice and Verona find leisure and security enough to build their greatest palaces . Much of the available talent of the country was for a time devoted to fortification building , but this was not wholly an unmixed evil , for remote as may seem its connection with art , it was in this kind of work that Sanmicheli developed that vigorous simplicity of style which distinguished him as an artist , and made his engineering work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . There is a vigour of handling , a facility of composition , a richness of modelling , and an artistic reserve which easily distinguish any genuine example of what may be called the Central Period from one of the early or later Renaissance . Naturally , however , there is transition on both sides , and there are some famous buildings which stand on debatable ground as regards classification , as , for example , certain works of the last decade of Bramante 's career , and others of Andrea da Monte Sansovino . To Bramante is generally ascribed the origin of the new tendency , which has been in negative fashion described as a refusal of all elements of design foreign to classical taste . Writers of the period immediately succeeding Bramante , not to speak of those of modern days , give to that artist the undivided glory of " raising up good architecture again , which from ancient time till then had been hidden and kept secret . " With very much more truth this saying might be applied to Brunelleschi , or even to Alberti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality in the variations of his treatment of the classical forms , and much ingenuity in their adaptation to modern requirements , but he was in a position to benefit greatly by the far more remarkable originality of those who had preceded him . As an assimilator Bramante excelled , and his work is characterised by a quite remarkable variety and flexibility of treatment of the elements placed at his disposal . To Bramante nothing was common nor unclean , and the same power of assimilation which enabled him to sum up the traditions of Lombardy in such work as Santa Maria delle Grazie , enables him now to produce in Rome a work so com pletely in harmony with its surroundings as the Cancelleria Palace ( 1495-1505 ) . The revolt from the Lombardy style which its general design evinces is in itself a mark of // Bramante 's capacity , and an indication of the nature of it . Yet there is little in this quiet and monotonous facade ( Plate 34 ) , with its dry and ineffective decoration , or in the light and overweighted arcades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated a new era in architecture. * The window with its balcony from the south-east corner of this palace ( Plate 35 ) conveys an idea of the early character of the detail and ornament , showing that these at least have no claim to be regarded as of the culminating period or even of leading up to it . The treatment is simply that which Bramante brought with him from the terra-cotta district of Lombardy ; unsuited to Roman travertine or tufa , it has demanded the employment of marble as an inset , for of this the window and balcony are constructed . In general arrangement the pilasters , arch , and spandrils , with their enclosing moulding , are a revival of the very late and debased Roman window of about the fourth century , examples of which were to be seen in many of the northern provinces . But the broad facade in its general character must have revealed to the Roman architects of the day the interest that could be obtained in the simple distribution of features , and the effect that good proportion and reticent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also illustrates a system of setting-out which constantly recurs in Bramante 's work , the greater and lesser interspace , and this play of rhythmical division of pilasters is really what it contri butes to the progress of architecture . On the other hand it indicates the inroad of a tendency to copyism , the top storey being a close imitation of that of the Colosseum , especially in the interior . Comparing the Palazzo Rucellai at Florence , on page 34 , with the Cancelleria , one can appreciate the advantage of the use of the broader and narrower interval alter .. aiely , which runs through so much of the work of the architects of this period . The illustrations ( pages 86 ? 89 ) enable one to realise more fully the variety which such a treatment affords , and give an idea of certain dispositions which at this period were being introduced , or for the first time really grasped . In the sketch of the Cloister of Santa Maria della Pace at Rome , a very favourite motif of Bramante 's early work is shown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central pillar of the upper tier resting upon the crown of the arch below . The Sacristy of San Satiro ( Plate 25 ) is designed on the same principle . In // the Palazzo Giraud or Torlonia , the superimposed orders are seen , but the spacing is less happy than at the Cancelleria . The diagram ( A ) , represents the same arrangement carried out at the great Belvedere gallery in the Vatican , but with the wider space arched and the narrower spaces decorated with niches . This system of coupled columns with central arches is evidently suggested by the Roman triumphal arches , and it is only in its application to a facade that any novelty consists . ( B ) represents the front of an earlier church by Bramante , at Abbiate-grasso , near Milan , and in this case the pillars are closely coupled and superimposed , the arch being turned from the top of the upper tier . This is a most exceptional treatment , and it resembles nothing so much as the door-ways of the Church of St. Mark at Venice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the French ' as the " motif Palladio , " loosely so named , as it was used by the ancients ; reintroduced before Palladio 's time ; and not specially characteristic of his work , although used in his arcade round the Gothic Basilica at Vicenza ( Plate 6o ) . In this case , the arch in the central space springs from the modified entablature , which serves to span the lesser // side spaces . The system of concentric archivolts in ( D ) is another favourite device of Bramante , less used by his followers . The germ of this arrangement appears in the interior of the Pazzi Chapel , by Brunelleschi ( Plate 6 ) . In the transept of Santa Maria delle Grazie , Milan ( D ) , the archivolts are connected by medallions , and on the doorway from Como Cathedral they are , in more sedate fashion , united by four-sided panels ( Plate 23 ) . It will be observed that nearly all of these varia-tions result from the attempted combination of the lintel and the arch , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This impossible fusion is at once the logical weakness and the actual vitality of the style . Neither in Latin nor Italian times having been fully worked out , and being possibly incapable of solution , it affords scope for originality and great variety of treatment . In one view of it , the architecture of ancient Rome was a transition from Greek trabeated to Romanesque vaulted construction . The tendency of the Renaissance was , in this matter , just in the opposite direction ; it did not serve to unite more closelythese uncongenial elements , and some of its best examples are those in which the arch is almost if not entirely eliminated . In those instances it is probable that their designers were consciously adopting Greek methods and principles ; that they had come to distinguish between Roman and Greek ; and , in many cases , they aimed at attaining the spirit of the latter , the superiority of which they appreciated , however imperfectly they were acquainted with the letter . The words of one of the Italian chroniclers of the sixteenth century , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of their mental attitude to Greek work : The Romanes , although they learned the upright manner of building of the Grecians , neverthelesse , afterward , when they became rulers over the Grecians , it may be that some of them thereby became licencious : but certaynely if a man might see the wonderfull works which the Grecians then did make ( which are now almost all spoyled and cast downe in time of warre ) , hee would assuredly judge the Grecians worke to surpasse that of the Latines farre . " It has been part of the purpose of this book to point out how many of the Byzantine , Romanesque , and Gothic elements were intermingled with the early Renaissance of Florence , Milan , and Venice ; how little tendency to direct imitation of classic models was manifested ; and how slight a bondage even to classical principles . But from the first years of the sixteenth century these lingering elements of the Romanesque very quickly disappear ; and the following of the classic styles is much closer , although there is still no direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic and early Renaissance periods ( the church plan and the dome , for example ) , undergo continuous progress and improvement . Between the motives of the art of the Renaissance and our fleeting revivals of styles in modern days , there is a great gulf fixed . Had the Italian church-builders of the sixteenth century pursued the architectural methods of the English Gothic revivalists of the last generation , they would have attempted to reproduce the temples , or at least the law court or Basilica , or the form of the Roman houses where the earliest Christian churches assembled . This was not their method , and where their arrangements were not virtually original , designed to meet the wants of the time , they were developments of mediaval or Gothic practice , that is , of the period immediately preceding . There is perhaps one exception to this , Bramante 's Tempietto in the Cloisters of San Pietro in Montorio ( 1502 ) ? the exception that proves the rule , because it vas erected as a shrine reminiscent of a classic period , rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peter the apostle is believed to have stood . And although the form of the building and the columnar arrangement indicate that it had been inspired by the Roman circular temples , there are features which could scarcely have been supposed by their // author to be antique in style . Among these are the balustrade , and the bold type of dome , which is certainly far removed from that of antiquity . Judged on its own merits the whole design is a beautiful example of simplicity and artistic restraint . But when all is said it must be freely admitted that the Renaissance from Bramante 's day partakes more essentially of the nature of a classical revival than in its earlier stages , and that the arguments hitherto used as to its original , unique , and ( in the best sense ) timeserving character lose much of their force . We may base our estimate of its value on another ground , that , namely , of its success . For there can be little question that much of what was produced in this first half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been done before . Never were the arts more perfectly united in a common purpose , nor had they ever abler exponents . In the painting of Botticelli , Raffaello , Sodoma , and Titian , the sculpture of Michelangelo , and the architecture of Peruzzi and Sanmicheli , all art , subsequent to that of Greece , culminated ; and the short interval embraced between the years 1506 and 1550 , may also be regarded as the most brilliant and productive half-century in the arts of form which the world has // yet seen . And yet there was no Parthenon of the Renaissance , no magnum opus in which was enshrined all that was greatest and most perfect in the art of that epoch . Those works which in a measure attain the perfection of the Parthenon , are of small scale and importance , the larger projects being rarely , if ever , completed by their architects during lifetime , and they were subjected , at a later and decadent date , to the most lamentable alterations and deviations from the original intention . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is remembered , a mere flicker compared even with the evanescent flame of Greek art , wonder will not be expressed at the want of complete and representative works , but rather at the profusion and brilliancy of the results . Why it should have been found impossible to maintain it for a longer period is another question , into which we may enter later : meantime , let us enjoy what the genius of the time produced , however short its duration . In so far as it was a revival of antique art , the Renaissance was appropriately consummated in the Eternal City , the heart of the ancient world : and naturally so ; for Rome at the end of the fifteenth century had recovered some shadow of its former prosperity , and under the Pope Julius II . had become once more the art centre of the peninsula . It had drawn Bramante from the service of Ludovico Sforza , Michelangelo from the Medici , and Raffaello from Perugia . Once again it was in a limited sense the capital of Italy , although Italy might only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not wield its empire over Europe as in ancient times , it was at least the centre of an influence , which to this day has swayed the following course of the art and architecture of the civilized world more than any other . It has been said that in Brunelleschi 's hands the architecture of the Renaissance had a Tuscan or provincial character , while in the hands of Alberti it became more Roman ; * and it may fairly be claimed that if Bramante went farther and rendered it national or peninsular , Peruzzi , Sanmicheli , and ultimately Palladio made it European . The works rather than the lives of individual architects concern us , and except for two names that naturally stand out , Brunel leschi and Bramante , there is little necessity for narrating the personal histories of those of the earlier periods . The names // now mentioned , however , Antonio Sangallo , Raffaello , Peruzzi , Michelangelo , are so important and recur so frequently that one can not so easily pass them over without at least a brief word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) does not appear to have been ( as so many of his contemporaries were ) some-thing more than an architect ; nor did he enter that profession of art through the painter 's or sculptor 's workshop . He seems to have become an architect much in the same way as men do nowadays , by assisting others , notably his uncle Giuliano da San Gallo , of Florence , and Antonio the brother of Giuliano , whose beautiful church at Montepulciano ( page 105 ) , is one of the most complete examples of the adaptation of the style to church uses . Along with Peruzzi , Antonio the younger was assistant and draughtsman to Bramante , while the last named was architect at St. Peter 's . Many years before his death , Bramante suffered from an affection of the limbs which pre-vented him from drawing and otherwise incapacitated him , * and there can be little doubt that the assistance of these two architects went farther than is usual . In fact , it would not be unreasonable to attribute what is sometimes called Bramante 's ultinaa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assistants than himself . This view makes Bramante comprehensible , as an artistic personality , not to say a social one , while it is in accordance with what we know of the character of the work of his pupils . The Palazzo Farnese was largely built by Antonio , as also the smaller houses Sacchetti ( his own dwelling ) and Palma , in Rome , all of which are admired for their solidity and sobriety . Baldassare Peruzzi ( 1481 ? 1536 ) has been described as from his birth the child of misfortune , but his lack of worldly success need not close our eyes to his very remarkable gifts and attain ments . His life is so interesting and such works as he accom plished are so valuable , that it will become necessary to deal with him in more detail ; meantime , to give some idea of his position we may say that , by common consent ( to quote a French writer ) , he was raised to equal eminence with such men as Ariosto , Tasso , Michelangelo , Raffaello and Bramante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them he contributed to the glory of the century ; but the modesty of his character , lacking in // ambition , has robbed him of the honour , and his merit , while appreciated by artists , remains almost unnoted . " It is to Peruzzi that the Grecian tendency of the time is due , in fact it is his work chiefly which gives character to the culminating period . Most of it was accomplished at Rome , where the Villa Farnesina ( Plate 48 ) , Palazzi Pietro Massimi ( Plates 39. to 41 ) and Angelo Massimi , Lante , Costa , Ossoli , Via Giulia ( pages 103 and 104 ) , and Linotta serve to attest his skill in simple domestic work . Raffaello da Urbino ( 1483 ? 1520 ) , " whom " ( says Serlio in simple eloquence ) " I will always name Divine , for that he never had his fellow ; I say no more " ? was a contemporary artist , but died at thirty-seven years of age , having executed in that brief lifetime an incredible amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a very deep interest in the archeology of Rome , and prepared for Pope Leo Y. an elaborate report on the condition of the monuments in the city and its surroundings . There is , besides , no doubt that he made studies for buildings , and many important works of this . kind are associated with his name . It is tolerably certain , , however , that his connection with the work did not go farther than the study or sketch , and that he was not an architect in the sense that Peruzzi and Antonio were . The Palazzo , Pandolfini of Florence , probably from a sketch design of his , but not begun till after his death , is a gem of the purest water , and one of the most typical examples of the period we are now considering . It resembles the Albergati ( page 124 ) in its first floor windows , and the cornice with its astragal inscription frieze probably affected the treatment of that at the Roman Farnese Palace . The Palazzo Stoppani , Caffarelli , or Vidoni , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michelangelo Buonarroti ( 1475-1564 ) , who has attained a fame surpassing all his famous contemporaries , was not their equal as an architect , although one of the greatest personalities , who ever adorned the world of art . His largest architectural task , that of the completion of St. Peter 's , was forced upon him late in life , in spite of his protest that it was not the work for which he was trained and adapted . Yet when he had once laid his hand to it , he could not be induced to leave it even to return to Florence . That Michelangelo combined in his work the arts of painting , sculpture and architecture , was of itself nothing // remarkable in those days . Raffacllo and Peruzzi , not to speak of Giotto and Brunelleschi , united with their architecture another art of which they were masters , but probably no man was great in all three forms of expression of the arts of form , and none certainly so great . Lanzi , in his Stone Pittovica , says , justly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortalised three different artists , had his pictures , his statues , and his architectural works , been the production of as many different authors . " But through all his works we can not fail to distinguish the same idiocrasy , and trace in each of them his love for largeness of scale , for anatomical display , for effects which will tell powerfully , whether in the Sistine chapel decorations , the David , or the cornice of the Farnese Palace . Michelangelo is the central figure of the Italian Renaissance , and touches both its earlier and its later phases . He was a brilliant sculptor before Bramante came to Rome and while the Lombardi worked at Venice . In the maturity of his powers he glorified by his painting and sculpture the zenith of the revival in architecture , and he lived long enough to witness g6 THE CULMINATION IN ROME . the degradation into which it fell . His own hand initiated the decline . Of Sanmicheli and Jacopo Sansovino , worthy rivals of these more famous names , whose principal work lay outside Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy " will afford some information . The large number of great palaces built during this period , both before and after the sack of Rome , and the still larger number of magnificent dwellings , which yet could scarcely be designated as palaces , afford a vivid illustration of the social prosperity of the time and the ruling motives of the clerical and aristocratic circles which dominated Rome . The Cardinals particularly appear to have been ambitious to build : among them , to begin as far back as 1495 , Raffaello Riario , who in that year caused the immense structure now known as the Cancelleria Palace to be begun ; Adriano da Corneto , who erected the Palazzo Giraud or Torlonia ( 15o3 ? 6 ) ; Niccolo Fieschi , who built for a habitation the Palazzo Sora in 1505 ; Alessandro Farnese , who in 1517 commenced the palace called by his name ; Ricci da Montepulciano , who in 154o began the Villa Medici ; Capo di Ferro , who about the end of the limits fixed , built the Palazzo Spada alla Regola . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , erected , no doubt , largely out of rivalry and for the glory of their house , upon whose influence and power the chances of election as Pope , not to speak of other desirable offices and emoluments , most largely depended . And besides these , numerous patrician families like the Massimi , or wealthy traders like the Chigi , erected sumptuous and imposing residences . In all there are magnificent suites of apartments , halls and galleries , suited to purposes of entertainment , on the piano-mobile ( the first floor ) ( Plates 36 and 41 ) , which Italian custom makes the principal floor , even in country dwellings . Out of this eventually proceeded the evolution of the open staircase , which in the earlier and many middle period examples is confined between walls in primitive and unworthy fashion . The interiors of the chief apartments have vaulted , coved , or coffered ceilings , the walls being often lavishly adorned with painted decoration , and in the later dwellings with rich plaster work . In the plan of such an example as the Palazzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement is revived ; while in the greater palaces the medieval courtyard is preserved . In most cases // the cortile answers to the peristyle of the ancients , rather than the atrium , and combines the advantages of both . One of the examples which best illustrates the peculiarities of the Central Period of the Roman Renaissance is the great palace built for the Cardinal who became Pope Paul III . , ( Plate 37 ) . The facade presents a precipice of wall nearly zoo feet high , in proportion about two squares , its splendid monotony broken only by the insignificant central doorway and the adornment by shields of the space over the first floor window . Sangallo the younger was the first architect of this edifice , while Michelangelo completed it by the addition of the top storey and the magnificent cornice . The window columns standing on brackets , and the arch let up into the frieze below the pediments , are features distinctly Michelangelesque , and appear to have been first introduced by that master . The small view on this page is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marred to a great degree by the loggia forming the central feature , which was added in 158o by an imitator of Michelangelo , Giacomo della Porta . By reason of its date it falls outside the limits of our present subject , although not A. H g8 THE CULMINATION IN ROME . departing greatly from the principles of the Central Pefiod . But it will be observed that in the original parts of the building the orders are only used as a window decoration , and a partial return made to the earliest Florentine practice . It may be that this can be accounted for by the fact of the origin of the architects , who , as Florentines , were more likely to have sympathy with the domestic work in that city than with the manner which Bramante had been developing in Rome . Reference to the Palazzo Riccardi ( Plate it ) will serve to remind one of the models they had in Florence , and at the same time direct attention to the details of the windows which Michelangelo had inserted in the work of Michelozzo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , and it was probably his recollection of it which made him disapprove of Antonio 's proposal for an order on the top storey of the Farnese , * and which led him to design for it a cornice not less virile than that of the Riccardi . The architectural traditions of Florence would appear to have had much influence upon Michelangelo , who , both in this matter and in the greater problem of the dome of St. Peter , found stimulus in the study of the school of Brunelleschi . Going round the long flank of the building , and entering by the commonplace doorway , we pass through a particularly fine vestibule ( Plate 36 ) , probably inspired by the promenade galleries of the Theatre of Marcell us ; // and that it was literally built out of the material of that notable building , or of the Colosseum , is a circumstance not only appropriate but characteristic of the time . The loggia of Andrea Sansovino at Santo Spirito , Florence ( Plate 16 ) , is vaulted in a similar manner , though on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example ; and in purity of design and beauty of proportion quite holds its own . Passing into the loggia which runs round the cortile , we observe first the Roman cross vaulted ceiling , the panelled soffit of the archivolt ; and , stepping out into the grand cortile , find in its lower storeys a close reproduction of the rich ordinance of the under half of the Colosseum . The topmost floor was part of the addition of Michelangelo , and shows symptoms of the decline . The most perfect examples of an architectural style are frequently not those of greatest importance on account of size and extent , and there are many reasons why this should be so . Carried into execution at some fortunate moment , before fashion has had time to change , they are besides within the compass of a single architect 's capacity , and admit of the most solicitous study and the most perfect performance of every detail . Hence one of the finest examples of the culminating period in Rome is a house of modest dimensions , the Palazzo Pietro Massimi alle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture of the period , a perfect mine of wealth , while , under a simple and severe aspect , it buries its treasures from eyes that do not bring with them the power of seeing . The whole scheme , which embodies two separate houses for brothers on a fixed and very irregular site , is a beautiful example of acute judgment under unwonted conditions , and ingenious adaptation to determinate ends . An earlier habitation of the family of Massimi del Portico had occupied the site , but like many another was destroyed in the sack of Rome ( 1527 ) . The motto of the family is " Cunctando restituit , " but soon after this the services of haldassare Peruzzi were called into requisition , and a plan prepared which in the most economical way upheld , as far as possible , the older building . This plan , still preserved , " - while decidedly ingenious , failed in symmetry and elegance , and the design which superseded it , likewise from the hand of zoo THE CULMINATION IN ROME . Peruzzi , was in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general arrangement the completed structure bears a closer resemblance to the characteristic plan of the ancient dwelling , as we now know it at Pompeii , than any of the palazzi anterior to Peruzzi , and it is highly probable that it was an instruction of this assertively Roman patrician that the scheme should approximate to the Roman model . For the Massimi claimed descent from the illustrious Fabius Maximus , who led the armies of Rome against Hannibal . It would also appear to have been a condition of the programme that the full surname of the family ( del Portico , or , as it was afterwards called , delle Colonne ) should be expressed in the building by some su. , h feature . Owing to the very limited nature of the site , this had to be obtained by recessing the ground floor in the manner which the plans and exterior view indicate . As Letarouilly remarks , the coupling of the columns , which , in the fashion generally practised , he appears to regard as a vicious innovation , is in this case amply justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their close setting also serves to give the necessary architectonic sense of solidity and cohesion to the whole elevation . The curve of the facade , following the lines of the frontage of the narrow street , had a remarkably fine effect before it was widened and made part of the Via Nazionale . The beauty gained by this curvature is only now to be appreciated by the internal perspective of the loggia itself , viewing it for its full length . The extreme projection of the shallow abaci of the Doric columns has been considered a fault , but affords a piquancy which is far from unpleasing , and an effect of vigour which seems to be required . It has been already said that the architects of this time were beginning to distinguish between Greek and Roman . They had not sufficient accuracy of information in regard to Greek work to attempt its literal reproduction , and for that we may be thankful . But there are many proofs , especially in the work of Peruzzi , of a Greek manner being assumed apart from the prevalent Roman treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that the arch and the tunnel vault appear more than once in the design , but they are kept subordinate , and the columns and doorway of the portico , the elevations of the cortile , and the interior of the apartments suggest Greek n-odels rather than Raman . Judged by these THE UNION OF GREEK AND ROMAN METHODS . ioi standards , this portico or entrance loggia presents some curious anachronisms . There are the Roman Doric columns with the Attic base and a Grecian profile and projection of echinus , and windows of the time of the Republic ; a flat-coffered ceiling to the whole , while the niches have delicately coffered stucco semidomes of the second century . In all this it seems as if Peruzzi were attempting to infuse into the Roman methods some of the Grecian refinement which was his partly by instinct , and as the fruit of his study of Hellenic art ; and the freedom of his use of motifs or features developed in widely separated periods is a lesson to the painful arch2eology of much of the architecture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek and Roman features is most happy ; the cortile , which is illus trated on Plate 40 , more consistently preserves the prevailing Grecian character . The openings above the first cornice , apparently formed for the purpose of lighting up the loggia at each end of the cortile , are introduced in a most infelicitous // manner , whether by Peruzzi , as Letarouilly believes , or by subsequent hands . The entablature is in this way bereft of its proper frieze , while guttw are left to lament the absence of their hitherto inseparable triglyph . The walls of the house enclose the cortile only on three sides for its full height , and on the east side the buildings are merely of one storey and an attic . The rich mouldings which frame the sculpture above the doorway of travertine stone on this wall ( seen in Plate 40 ) are of stucco , and , like the ceilings , and semi-domes of the niches in the portico , also of this perishable material , are in fair preservation . The firm and delicate moulding profiles serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even upon details of small consequence , while they indicate no want of originality on the part of the master . The loggia on the first floor , approached by the unpretending staircase , is in its union of painting and architecture one of the most perfect features of a singularly perfect building . The Ionic columns are purely Greek , of the most refined proportions and drawing . White marble is used not only in the columns and square pillars , but in the jambs and cornice of the doorway , and in the archway at the head of the staircase . The ceiling is // boldly coffered on hexagonal lines , and beautifully enriched and decorated . It will be observed that in this cortile Peruzzi , as in every other case but one ( the facade of the Pal . Costa ) , resists the temptation to place his main cornice at the level of the column entablature , and superimpose an attic , terminated by a lesser moulding . This treatment , a common one , is exemplified in the Palazzo Stoppani ( designed by Raffaello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as elsewhere is un fortunate , being a species of anti-climax . Such an arrangement is most effective in interior work , and the Hall of the Massimi ( Plate 41 ) furnishes an example of the application of this principle . Here it appears very successful , although Letarouilly , whose opinion is entitled to the greatest weight , is pleased to stigmatize the architecture of this room as " heavy , " while highly com mending the decoration . The large panels in the frieze , which is the happiest part of the decoration , represent scenes in the life of the founder of the family in republican Roman times , while the intermediate panels and the sculptures are mythoI04 THE CULMINATION IN ROME . logical . The baldachino is an indication of the high rank of the noble owner . The marble chimney-piece , surmounted by a bust of Raffaello , has consoles closely resembling the supports of the seats in the loggia . It will be observed that in this building , as in all contemporary work , the corbel or bracket shape ( page 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every feature of this nature , by the weaker and softer console form of the trusses flanking the first floor windows , and the door of the entrance loggia , as well as that on the piano-nobile . The house in the Via Giulia , Rome , is as distinctively Roman as the Massimi is Greek . The exterior ( page 103 ) depends chiefly upon its figure decorations , and mouldings have been wisely suppressed . In the accidental union of the central arch at the farther end of the cortile with the square window openings there is a foreshadowing of the " motif Palladio , " which from this time constantly recurs , especially in the works of the later Northern artists . For an indication , on a similar moderate scale , of what was // being achieved in ecclesiastic work at this time , no more characteristic examples could be chosen than the churches at Montepulciano and Todi ( Plate 42 ) . At Montepulciano , a town lying between Siena and Perugia , the church of the Madonna di Santo Biagio ( begun 1518 ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and marks him out no less than his younger namesake and connection as an able exponent of the new type of work . It is the fruit of the Florentine development represented by the Church of Santa Maria delle Carceri ( Plate 15 ) , which was erected by his elder brother . Like the Palazzo Massimi it presents a design which has been carried practically to completion , and is as perfect as the talents of its architect could make it , under certain stipulated conditions . The plan is a Greek cross , wagon vaulted and without aisles ; and the central dome , well raised above the roof , has almost attained its full development , while the finished campanile at the corner of the facade is one of the finest of its kind , an enriched and improved version of Baccio d'Agnolo 's campanile of Santo Spirito at Florence , and in some ways approaching the Venetian type . At Todi , south-east of Perugia , the Church of Santa Maria della Consolazione shows a still more perfect development of the simple plan dominated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ascribed to Cola da Caprarola , with possibly Peruzzi as his adviser , and was begun in 1508 , but not completed till long afterwards . Polygonal apses open from three sides of a square with a circular one on the fourth side , all covered with semi-domes , and the central dome with its high drum rises from a square base , slightly concave in plan . It would be tedious and unprofitable to recount the early history of the various proects for the less fortunate Church of St. Peter , the argest work of the Renaissance . Suffice it to say that after other schemes had been commenced and abandoned , Bramante , some time before 1506 , when the foundation stone was laid , was appointed architect , and that Giuliano da San Gallo , Raffaello the painter , and Fra Giocondo of Verona , were afterwards associated with him in the work . All four dying by 1520 , before the work had advanced very far , Peruzzi was soon after appointed to the control of the works , although Antonio Sangallo the younger had been previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect on his appointment seems to have set himself to restudy the whole matter and produce his own plan , hence it is easy to account for the delays which occurred at this time ; and with the succes-sive removals of three Popes , the difficulty of procuring funds , and the sack of Rome , it is difficult to understand how the work proceeded at all . Bramante prepared many designs , but his definitive scheme was a cross , of four arms of equal length , * the central feature of which was a low dome not far // removed in form from that of the Pantheon , but raised on a complete peristyle without and the semblance of one within . The illustration ( page ro6 ) is from Serlio 's drawing of this dome , and when architects and critics regret , as they so often do , that Iramante 's design was departed from , they should not forget that they have gained something greater than the dome with which he would have crowned the pile . It is possible , however , that this design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid masses at intervals in the colonnade , gave Sir Christopher Wren a suggestion for his most beautiful dome at St. Paul 's , in which case Bramante 's dome design had its uses . After his death his whole scheme seems to have been departed from , and Raffaello , possibly influenced by clerical conservatism , made an exceedingly beautiful and simple plan , in a more conventional form , a design which , says Serlio , " in my opinion , is one of the fairest draughts that are to be found , out of the which the ingenious workman may help himself in many things . " This plan , without any doubt , would have produced a finer building than that which now exists . It is often spoken of as Bramante 's plan , but this is an error , although it may have been based upon the previous studies of Bramante and his assistants . At Raffaello 's death , Peruzzi , appointed to the chief control , found that the piers of Bramante needed greatly strengthening , having almost collapsed under their own weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , and desiring to let the dome be seen from all points of view , he reverted to the Greek cross plan . The plan he adopted ( Plate 43 ) was really a skilful combination of the good points of Bramante 's and Raffaello 's plans : and it seems a plausible theory that Raffaello 's eastern termination and Peruzzi 's plan were based upon a study ( perhaps by Bramante ) of the ancient Church of San Lorenzo at Milan . Peruzzi 's annotator explains that the temple was to have four doors , the high altar to occupy the middle . At the corners were to be four sacristies , upon which clock towers might be reared . Had the author been suffered to carry out his model , there can be little doubt that it would have been not only the most magnificent temple the world had seen , but one of the purest in taste . Peruzzi , however , was cut off in 1536 , not without suspicion of having been poisoned by one who hoped to succeed him in his office at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took charge of affairs , restudied the whole matter . His design is io8 THE CULMINATION IN ROME . illustrated , both in plan and elevation , in Fergusson 's History of Modern Architecture. * The exterior has much merit , but the plan little or none , compared with those which had already been made . Though retaining the Greek cross principle of Peruzzi , he proposed to add a great and well-nigh useless hall or vestibule flanked by two great campanili , giving to the exterior the form of the Latin cross . It is probable , however , that he had little opportunity of making headway with the scheme , his time being occupied in building up the niches of the great piers of the dome , and possibly by the inner wall of the southern apse , which , after it had been thickened by Michel angelo , became the outer wall of his restricted plan . The merits of Sangallo 's design were freely criticised and generally condemned by his contemporaries , who rarely appear to have done Antonio justice . Michelangelo was especially critical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken up " with its innumerable projections , pinnacles , and divisions of members , it was more like ' a work of the Teutons than of the good antique manner , or of the cheerful and beautiful modern style . " Thus did the greatest critic of the age set magnitude against multi plicity , and encourage by precept as well as example the worship of mere bigness . Many architectural critics of to-day , having the benefit of such mistakes as St. Peter 's before them , would much prefer Antonio 's elevation , which involved three orders in height , to that of one order , which supplanted it . As for Antonio 's capacity to carry out such a work , Vasari says : " It is true that he effected much , in accomplishing what we possess ; but he would , nevertheless , as is believed , have seen his way more clearly through certain of the difficulties incidental to that work , had he performed his labours in company with Baldassare . " Antonio died in 1546 , at sixty-one years of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reduced the scheme greatly , and by suppressing many of the features of the designs both of Peruzzi and Antonio , gave the plan a simplicity which , on so great a scale , is now seen to be a blunder . He was , however , strong enough to overcome pre judice and restore the plan of the equal arms . The cliff-like walls of the apses and the towering pilasters , as we know them , are his work , as is also the dome , for which he left a complete model and drawings . These parts of the church , however , // properly belong to the succeeding or Late Period , which Michelangelo really initiated , and the extension of the nave , which ended the battle between the two forms of cross , belongs to the seventeenth century . The facade ( page 113 ) exhibits Carlo Maderna 's work , with a base caricature of the portico which Michelangelo had designed to stand free of the main building as an appendage to the Greek cross scheme , but which the seventeenth century architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the great Doric colonnades surrounding the piazza , which were begun in 1667 under Bernini ( see page 162 ) . It is the interior ( Plate 46 ) which chiefly concerns us in IIo THE CULMINATION IN ROME . considering the work of this period . The internal ordinance , with its gigantic pilasters and protruding impost mouldings , is probably due to Bramante , and his assistants Peruzzi and Antonio Sangallo ; for although the long arm of the cross , and its colossal wagon Vault , is partly the addition of Maderna , the original idea is fairly well preserved , but with late and debased details and ornaments . The form of the four supporting piers of the dome , which are among the earliest parts of the work , makes the projection of the pendentives comparatively slight , and necessitates some distortion of the pendentives carrying the circular drum . Had these been curved on plan , concentric with the dome , or had they been rectangular , there would be no irregularity ; but , indeed , none is apparent as the work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mosaic , filling up the spaces perfectly . St. Peter 's and the Vatican make up the one group of Renaissance buildings which in scale and monumental character more than holds its own with the old Roman work . In this there is significant testimony to the truthfulness of architecture as the stone hook of history , for in St. Peter 's are writ large the importance of the Church in the world of the sixteenth century , the character and surroundings of its rulers , as well as the spirit and aims of the constructors of the material fabric . If ancient Rome was built out of the spoils of the conquered world , renaissant Rome , too , spoiled Christendom . The Popes of the Renaissance are but the sixteenth century types of the ancient Emperors : they reoccupy the house that the Romans prepared . The palaces of the Vatican and of the Cardinals stand in the place of those of the Palatine Hill . Out of the tepidarium of the Baths of Diocletian , Michelangelo finds them a fitting temple ; the Pantheon of the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so it has been said that in St. Peter 's the Catholic world adopted for the type of its great church the central hall of a Roman bath ( Plate 45 ) . The architect , however , will dwell more on the distinctions than on the type character common to both . Particularly he will not fail to observe that it is the addition of Maderna , which in its design , its vaulting and lighting , as well as its dimensions , presents so close an analogy with the Roman vaulted chamber of the Baths of Caracalla or Diocletian . Round about the dome , the part which belongs to the culminating IMPRESSIONS OF ST . PETER'S. period , there is little which need recall the old Roman models . The Greek cross plan which successive architects schemed , is founded on the early churches , while Michelangelo 's dome design is at the end of a chain in which the links arc t he dome of S. Sophia and Santa Maria del Fiore . But for the principle illustrated by the Italian Byzantine domes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven , " and but for Brunelleschi 's intrepid construction at Florence , even the hand of Michelangelo must have faltered before the boldness of its drum design with the poor abutment of the sixteen twin column props . The triumph of " the hand that rounded Peter 's dome " consists largely in this , that on a scale which increases every difficulty out of all proportion , the union of both systems was successfully effected ; so successfully that with the Pantheon and S. Sophia the dome of St. Peter 's is one of the most nobly beautiful of architectural creations . The internal effect of St. Peter 's is a subject about which much has been said . All are agreed that the impression it makes on a first visit is not so overwhelming as might be expected from its prodigious dimensions . Byron , in notable verse , has expressed the idea and given a poetic cause for the absence of this effect , and Nathaniel Hawthorne , in his delightful picture of Modern Rome , treats of the subject at some length . The explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one enters , the ghostly image which almost unconsciously had been cherished is shattered by the shock of the reality presented . There had been built up in the mind 's eye a vague outline , " dint , and gray , and huge , stretching into an interminable perspective , and overarched by a dome like the cloudy firmament , " such an edifice in which one might keenly realise the insignificance of his own personality . Some of this effect is produced by the dome of St. Paul 's in London , and it might naturally be looked for in a building greater by far . But when , for the first time , you push aside the heavy mattress at the door , or later stand below the dome , there is little or none of this feeling , and the first impression is of cheerfulness and colour , should you chance to see it with the sunlight streaming through the clear windows on the mosaics and coloured marbles , fresh and bright through three centuries . Then , with the very limited view which can be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor substitute for the preconceived edifice with its boundless vistas , and the THE CULMINATION IN ROME . next impression is decidedly that it is not so vast a building as had been expected . The violation of what may be called the human scale , which is perpetrated no less in the enormous size of the order than in the colossal cupids , is another reason for this . Never before were classical orders used of this size , save in such monumental columns as those of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius , and it is not wonderful that the mind and eye , accustomed to their use on a much smaller scale , should for some time fail to grasp their actual dimensions . But every moment of time spent within the building and every fresh visit increases the sense of its immensity , until , to quote Hawthorne again , " after looking many times , with long intervals between , you discover that the Cathedral has gradually extended itself over the whole compass of your idea ; it covers all the site of your visionary temple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is the same difficulty in realising the immense scale of the exterior , but there never comes the same ultimate satisfaction . The order of the outer wall is still higher , about ninety-four feet , and nine feet broad , the capitals being ten feet deep . The height of the wall surrounding the structure is 165 feet , while the figures on the balustrade of the east front are nineteen feet high . ' While on this matter , it may be said that the total height at the dome is 435 feet , twice the height of the central towers of York or Durham Cathedrals ; and although less remarkable for length than for width and height , it is longer than Rochester and Glasgow Cathedrals placed end to end . The ultimate victory of the Latin cross has deprived all spectators within a quarter of a mile to the east of their view of bhe dome . To see it close at hand we must go round the flank of the building , whence the effect is splendid ( Plate 47 ) , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be surpassed in grace of exterior aspect by St. Paul 's , in London , with its unbroken entablature , relatively higher colonnade , and attic ; but without St. Peter there had been no St. Paul . The brackets designed by Michelangelo to unite the coupled columns and entablature with the attic were never carried out , and do not seem to be required . Viewing the culminating period in Rome as a whole , we observe that , like all art of the highest attainment , it is characterised by the attention given to proportion and design in the mass , the details being made strictly subordinate to the tout ensemble kept pre-eminently in view . A feeling for what may // I ) e called rhythm in spacing , and a sense of satisfaction in simple arrangements and grouping is evident . The power thus gained in composition enabled the architects of this period to I ispense with the elements which had lingered in the Renaissance f ? m Gothic or Romanesque influence . The traceried window , the carved arabesque ( at least in exterior work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made to disappear , and I lit. lived om and variety of capitals and other purely ornamental 11 i ng greatly curtailed . Even such elements as the round 1 , , , , I and pediment , directly inspired by the Byzantine work , . ( , given up , although actually the old Roman form of roof II4 THE CULMINATION IN ROME . and ceiling , as in Constantine 's Basilica and the Baths of Caracalla . Closely connected with the tendency to classic imitation may be considered the revival of Greek methods and the preference for rectangular compositions , continuity of lines , absence of breaks or projections , and monotonous repetition of forms . Great use is made of the columnar form , and where it is not preferred as a substitute for the panelled pilaster of the early period , the pilaster is made to assume the severe form of the Greek anta , fluted pilasters being relegated to interior decoration . The reintroduction and use of the engaged column , backed by a square pier carrying arches ( Plate 38 ) , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1455 ) , is perhaps the earliest instance , is very typical of this period , replacing the detached columns of the earlier practice ( Plate 34 ) , or the lesser half columns applied to the main pilaster , as on Plate to . The mouldings , though less highly enriched as a general rule , are of the most refined types and purest profiles , delicate , and yet vigorous ( page 102 , Plate 49 ) . Instead of being cut out of a bevelled surface like most of the early Renaissance cornices and mouldings , they approach the bolder sections of the Romans , but in refinement of line and shading they are more often Greek in feeling than Roman . Projection is much increased , and all the effect of timidity produced by such low relief as Alberti 's and Bramante 's early work disappears . A passion for the human figure is a decided characteristic of the Roman architects , and led them to impress its semblance upon almost every detail of the architecture and every trifling accessory they designed . Their plastic power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is not better or worse illustrated than by the doorway of Peruzzi at Ferrara ( Plate 52 ) , where busts flank the door , cupids bear up the balustrade , and heads , children , and animal figures line the top of the balustrade . Even on the simpler Greek doorway from Bologna , shown on the same plate , miniature figures , with foliated tails , are to be seen on the acroteria . This tendency they certainly carried further than the ancients , Greek or Roman , in not a few cases , as , for example , in the Palazzo Spada alla Regola ( page 1i6 ) , or the House in the Via Giulia ( page 103 ) . In interior decoration little else seems to have been dreamt of but figure painting . The most extreme example is of course the Sistine Chapel , the // work of various artists , including Botticelli and Perugino , but remarkable chiefly for the ceiling by Michelangelo , and the vast composition on the altar wall representing the Last Judgment , painted thirty years later by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sibyls from the vaulting , representing the one who dwelt at Erithraea , a name which the Italians have again revived in bestowing it , appropriately enough , upon their strip of Red Sea territory . The architectural accessories to the figure are , of course , in this case entirely produced by colour on the concave surface of the vault , with amazing technical skill . The Sistine Chapel is justified by its success and by the unrivalled excellence of the work , but the golden mean of a union of truthful architecture and appropriate decoration is attained with happier results in the interior of the Villa Farnesina and the r16 THE CULMINATION IN ROME . Palazzo Massimi alle Colonne . One thing appears beyond dispute , that Renaissance decoration has a high ideal , and demands , for its successful accomplishment , a full knowledge and perfect command of the principles of Nature 's design , whether in the vegetable or the animal world , as well as of the arts of Greece and Rome . CHAPTER V. THE ROMAN INFLUENCE IN THE NORTH OF ITALY ( 1529-1550 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NORTH OF ITALY . IN the last chapter an attempt was made to ascertain the general drift of the architecture of the time , and to determine the points in which it differed from the work of earlier periods , rather than to differentiate the works of individual architects . Having in this way attained some idea of the nature and distinctive qualities of the culminating period as a whole , it is fitting that the nicer question should be entered on of distinguishing the work of its leading exponents . Architects who may be selected for illustration and comparison in this connection are Peruzzi , Sanmicheli , and Jacopo Sansovino . Each of the trio was at one time connected with Rome , but the later and principal practice of Sanmicheli and Sansovino was wholly in the dominions of the Venetian Republic . Of the three , Peruzzi and Sanmicheli were the originating geniuses , and Sansovino the faithful follower . So much was he their imitator in architecture that he had on occasions his Peruzzi manner of expression , and at other times a manner which is unmistakably founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illustrations ; meantime it may be noticed as answer to those who affirm that great architects have always been painters , amateurs , or at least have not been trained in the regular way , that Raffaello , Michelangelo and Sansovino , unrivalled painters and sculptors , though designing great architectural works , never displayed either the originality or power of Brunelleschi or Bramante , who at an early period forsook the craft of the sculptor and the painter for architecture , or Sangallo and Saninicheli , who were architects from their boyhood , and nothing more . Bramante and Sanmicheli in particular are distinguished by a grip of the elements of composition and a command over possible combinations in architecture , to which their brethren of t he brush and chisel never attained . Peruzzi was an exception , in that he was an excellent decorative painter as well as an architect of the highest capacity . At the same time , were it
