txt Decided opposition was shown by Mani members of the Board of Aldermen at the public hearing yesterday to the proposed Pennsylvania tunnel franchise . Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce , the Merchants ' Association , and the Rapid Transit Commissioners lined up on one side in favor of the tunnel grant , and many of these speakers said that it would be a disaster to the city and a vital blow at the commercial supremacy of New York if the Board of Aldermen again rejected the franchise . The large assembly room was crowded . Every member of the Railroad Committee was present , and Chairman John Diemer presided . Among those who appeared were John P. Green , First Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad ; Samuel Rea , Fourth Vice President , and Counsel E. V. Massey . Gustav H. Schwab and J. Harsen Rhoades represented the Chamber of Commerce . Ex-President William F. King had a delegation from the Merchants ' Association on hand . The first speakers heard were in opposition to the tunnel grant . Alderman Timothy P. Sullivan read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the franchise . He claimed that the tunnel could be used for freight , and the city should be given a portion of the receipts of the railroad for freight carried . He argued for the insertion of the eighthour and the prevailing rate wages clauses in the franchise . He also claimed that the city should receive more than the $2,000,000 as the total receipts for a twenty-five year period on a franchise which was practically granted in perpetuity . Alderman Sullivan declared that with a more liberal sum paid to the city for the franchise and the labor and rate of wages clauses inserted he would favor the grant . Philip Kelly , who represented the Central Federated Union , argued that the Aldermen should refuse to grant the tunnel rights unless laboring men were protected . He said that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would import 30,000 men and pay them $1 a day or less if the clause for the prevailing rate of wages was not put in the contract . Assemblyman Prince of the American Federation of Labor said : " We do n't want 00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that no man should receive less than $2 a day . If the Pennsylvania Railroad wants to deal fairly with the wage workers of New York , why is the company afraid to put the clause in the contract for decent wages for the men who work on the tunnel ? " R. J. Andrews of the Stone Cutters ' Union , James Fitzgerald of the Building Trades Council , Patrick McCann of the Anti-Trust League , and James J. Garving of the Bricklayers ' Union made similar arguments . ALDERMAN DOULL 'S CHARGES . The Aldermanic opposition to the grant was voiced by Reginald Doull , whose district comprises the section of the borough in which the Pennsylvania terminal is to be located . Alderman Doull made a long speech . He said in part : " If it was terminal facilities which the Pennsylvania Company wanted in Manhattan , I would be willing to guarantee that , if they paid proper prices for rights acquired , I would get the franchise through without the expenditure of one penny . What this company wants is not terminal facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing freight through . I have looked into this matter thoroughly , and I charge that this company , has acted in bad faith . " Its agents went around to owners of property in the vicinity and told them that they were purchasing land for an institution , which , when built , would enhance the value of property in the vicinity . They got much lower prices for property by means of this deceit and trickery . If the company want this franchise for through passenger traffic , as they claim , why was it that the words ' and freight ' were inserted in the franchise when the matter was before the Conference Committee ? This board would not oppose the franchise if the city 's rights were protected . " " The Alderman has no authority to speak for the Board of Aldermen , " said President Fornes . I am not trying to speak for the board . I am speaking for myself personally . I am not pledging the President of this board to anything , because he reverses his own rulings so often that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said : " The administration of Mayor Low went into office on a plank which guaranteed the municipal ownership of all franchises . Now we seek to throw aside that plank . The result of the last election in this city shows what the people think of this franchise . We have heard of great public sentiment in favor of the grant , but I will say that a careful investigation shows that the people of my district are opposed to this franchise , and that is the reason I am fighting it . " Alderman Doull said that there was not sufficient return to the city for the franchise ; that there was not an adequate sum of money paid for the property of the city taken on Thirty-second Street ; that the city should be indemnified from all loss caused by the building of the tunnel to private property ; that the eight-hour clause should be inserted in the grant , and also the prevailing rate of wages clause . He caused consternation among the members of the board by saying : " Now , as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have heard statements that certain members of this board have not ' been seen ' about this matter . Every one here knows what that means . If it is a fair assumption to claim that certain members of this board are opposing this tunnel grant because we have not ' been seen , ' it is a. fair assumption that the members of this board who are out in the open in favor of this tunnel grant have been seen . Yes . and they must have ' been seen ' right handsomely for their support of this plan . " I have not been seen , and , thank God , we have a Board of Aldermen in New York now unlike many boards in the past , who will not barter away the rights of the people for the dirty , filthy money of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company . That company has left a trail of bribery and corruption over every mile of its tracks , and I am proud to say that I stand here in this board and oppose this franchise because I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Aldermen who have been favoring the Pennsylvania grant shifted uneasily at this attack . of Alderman DouII , but no return ? statethent - w'as made . - . MR . SCHWAB SPEAKS . ' ! : Gustav H. Schwab was the first speaker fhfavor of the tunnel . He said : " - The Chamber of Commerce on Oct passed resolutions favoring the grant of the . tunnel franchise to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company , and is unqualifiedly in favor of the grant I learned with surprise to-day that the venerable bogey of a Montauk Point terminal has been resurrected and-the building of a big depot at the other end- of Long Island by the Pennsylvania Company to work in company with a steamship line or lines . Now , I claim to know something about the steamship business , and I say that such a plan is absurd at this time , and any man who seriously proposed it would be declared to have taken leave of his senses . The transportation of freight by water is much cheaper than by railroad . " Mr Schwab said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representative of the Chamber of Commerce to advocate the granting of the franchise . J. Harsen Rhoades also spoke for the Chamber of Commerce . Ex-President King of the Merchants ' Association then directed Assistant Secretary Mead to read some resolutions Of the association in favor of the tunnel . - President Orr of the Rapid Transit CornTniSsIon spoke briefly in favor of the tunnel . He said that the Pennsylvania Company had . not only agreed to pay the full value of the property acquired from the city on Thirty-second Streit , but they had agreed to pay taxes on the property as well . He said that the price paid had been based on prices of abutting property , which the company had purchased in open market . Alderman Doull interrupted to ask a question , and after an exchange of words , in which President Orr resented the interruption , the Alderman Said : " This company has not paid a fair price for the property acquired in the neighborhood . " " The opinion of the property . owners does not coincide with . that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Rapid Transit Commission had presented many plans for transit facilities which were finally accepted by the Aldermen : " I think the members of this board may be laboring under some misapprehension at this time , but they will eventually reach the same conclusion as the Rapid Transit Commission that the franchise should be granted as it stands . " MR SHEPARD 'S ARGUMENT . - Edward M. Shepard , counsel for the Rapid Transit Commission . was the next speaker . Mr. Shepard said that he was most impressed by the statements of the representative of - the Central Federated Union to the effect that the tunnel was most needed and would bring a large amount of business to the city , and would be of great benefit to the laboring men . " The Board of Aldermen has for some ' time been granting franchises to private Persons and ' corporations for various purposes , and this is the first time that there has been any demand for the insertion of the - eight- hour and the prevailing rate of wages clauses . It did not occur to the Rapid Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the contract they would be inoperative and would amount to nothing . The first time the eight-hour clause was demanded in the franchise was when the matter was before the Board of Aldermen . " Mr. Slwpard replied to the arguments of Alderman ? Doull that the Pennsylvania Company wanted the franchise as a moneymaking scheme . The Directors of the Pennsylvania Company would have no right to make an investment except in the interest of the stockholders . This is certainly a moneymaking plan . and the company is ready to invest - $50.000.00. which it would have absolutely no. right to do . if it was not with the avowed object of making a profit on the investment ' The one question to he considerer is whether the benefits which will accrue to the city , if this franchise is passed end the tunnel is built . outweighs the objections which have been made to the grant If the gain to the city outweighs the objections , then this board should come to the same conclusion as the Rapid Transit Commission that the franchise should be approved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rapid Transit tunnel did not have a clause calling for an eight-hour work ? day and the . prevailing rate of wages : " That elsti.4 Was inserted before the Court cf Aiilieats passed on the question . " said Mr. Shepard . " It is in the contract , and I sincerely hope for the good of the workingmen of New York that it is beinglived up to . " Alderman Doull wanted to know why a tax was not put on the freight which the Pennsylvania Company might carry through the . tunnel . " I will reply at once . " said Mr. Shepard . " You can not tax freights any more than you can tax passengers . It is against the Constitution of the ' United States , and the Federal Courts would so decide . " Mr. Shepard then dealt in detail with the claims that the city was not receiving sufficient return for the franchise . He claimed that the City of New York was giving away no right to the surface of any street or any rights which the city could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experts to fix the value of a strip of land 90 feet under Manhattan Island . Mr. Shepard said that the Pennsylvania officials had contended that the city should not receive compensation for this part of the franchise . He said in no city in the - United States or in any European city was there any charge put on a railroad company for underground rights of the kind wanted by the Pennsylvania Company . Mr. Shepard said that notwithstanding this claim . the Rapid Transit Commission had arranged a schedule so that in twenty-five veers the city would receive near to 52,000.000 for the underground rights alone . in addition to a much larger sum for vault privileges . SECOND PARK AVENUE HEARING . Engineer Lewis of the Board of Estimate Presents Plan for Depressing Railroad Tracks . A second public bearing was held before the Board of Estimate yesterday on the plans of the New York Central Railroad for the reconstruction of the freight yards and the Park Avenue tunnel . Mayor Low at the opening of the hearing said that the opposition to the plan had no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the property owners . He said that the company had received every suggestion in a most friendly manner and recognized that what was for the best interests of the people and the city was best for the railroad . Counsel Ira E. Place said ? e appreciated Mayor Low 's liberal utterances . " It must he remembered , however . " said Mr. Place , " that of the five parties to this matter we represent three . The stockholders of the railroad , the traveling public , and our own employes . The Board of Estimate represents the municipality and the property owners . While there . is no desire on the part of the railroad to interfere with the rights of the opposition , the railroad is compelled to protect as far as it can the rights of those whom it represents .
