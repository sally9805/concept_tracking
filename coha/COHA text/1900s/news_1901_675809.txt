txt After an absence of more than three years , Major Gen. Arthur , ex-Governor of the Philippines , returned to the United States to-day on the transport Sheridan . He was the first passenger to walk down the gangplank . But for a slight loss of flesh , Gen. Mac -- Arthur looks the same as when ht left this city three years ago . He had no serious sickness during his stay in the Philippines , and boasts that he was able to perform his regular duties every day of the whole time . As soon as quarantine was raised on the Sheridan , the tug Slocum came alongside , and Mr. Green of Milwaukee boarded the transport . He came as a representative of Milwaukee 's citizens to invite Gen. to visit that city . which was formerly his homr , . The invitation comes direct from the Merchants and Manufacturers ' Association , and is in the form of a beautiful booklet . decorated with water colors and engraving and bound in leather . The little book is inclosed in a handsome wooden box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation . Itlany army officers and - citizens called at the hotel during the day to see the returned traveler . Gen. Young , in command of the Department of California , was among the first to greet his former comrade in arms . His personal representative , Capt . Smedberg , previously met Gen. at the dock and accompanied him to his hotel . After staying here several days awaiting orders Gen. expects to go to Washington to meet the President and secretary Root , with whom he will confer in regard to the situation in the Philippines . On that subject he talked freely to-day , saying : " A very satisfactory condition now exists in  --  the islands  --  not perfect , of course , but such that it is very gratifying to both military and civil officers . The insurrection is almost entirely extinguished . A few groups of armed insurgents are still at large and ' give us Some trouble , but they will undoubtedly surrender in a short time . The campaigning is practically confined to scouting and an occasional movement in force against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrender of the natives , with their rifles . Ea2h such event has the effect of bringing in other natives , who through fear ' have kept away . ' The nati ? ea. have now learned that to surrender fides not mean death , torttire , or other punishmdbt , but the securing of larger liberties and freedom . I am well satisfied with the conditions . The civil administration went into of-flee - une- July 4- with impressive cereinonie.s . An immense gathering of natives was present , and . they seemed to appreciate the change . I ? see no reason why the Government and the Civil Commission should not be entirely successful : The change was a welcome one to army officials , to whom the civil tasks were hard and tedious , although no one shirked - his duty . The two departments are well set apart . " Conditions in the provinces are much improved . There is-a great deal of freedom in movements throughout Northern Luzon , where  --  insurrection has been dead.for some time . We have had no trouble at that end for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say that it is entirely safe tor individuals as yet , for there is a large criminal class among the natives . Members of this.class wander about committing depredations on both Americans and natives . The latter suffer the most from the marauders . " These robbers are the result of several years of war , during which no Government existed and men were allowed to wreak their criminal passions without restraint . It could not have been otherwise . But these criminals are not insurgents and have no connection with them . The insurgent leaders repudiate the marauders ' actions . The situation in regard to the robber class arouses a question of importance , but it is being very satisfactorily worked out and solved by the natives themselves . They seek eagerly the establishment of ? civil governments , that they may take measures against the criminals , and native constables are doing the work of dispersing them . There is every reason to suppose that within a short time the whole archipelago will be safe to travel through . Many parts are safer to-day than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been torn and wrecked by war . Before we went there the last vestige of authority was lost , and the people had relapsed into a conditioa bordering on barbarism . Society had been disorganized and freedom had given way to tyranny . The best conditions now exist in the provinces of Northern Luzon , where the whole territory is pacified . but . net tranquilized . It is a good deal like the ocean after a storm . The worst is over , but the surface is still swelling and heaving . At present there is still some trouble in Samar. but Gen. Hughes , with a large sand effective force , has gone after the disturbers. and will soon bring them to their senses . That is the ' worst place , but it is not interfering with the coast business . in Cebu and Bohai , and occasionally in Southern Luzon , there is a slight outbreak , but it is the result of the criminal element . The Civil Commission was about to put in force some excellent ideas for the municipal grvernment of the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine condition . Its business is enormous and growing .
