What is the secret of the popularity of " The Natural History of Selborne , " that it should have passed through more than eighty editions in little over a century , and still remain the great classic in its kind ? It appeals not merely to English readers , whom we may suppose to be generally familiar with the plants and animals it discusses , but almost equally to Americans , who are to some extent without this advantage . The explanation lies probably in the fact that the author was a prince among observers , and that he set down simply and without self-consciousness the results of his observations . That he was a poet , too , as well as a naturalist , helps to explain the charm of his book , unless indeed it be true that no ardent lover of nature can fail to be also a poet . A certain stiffness of style characteristic of the period is , we must admit , manifest in his pages ; but still they hold the attention . Those who have the best things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telling them . Like many another masterpiece of literature , " The Natural History of Selborne " was begun more to amuse its author than with any thought of publication . Gilbert White 's turn for metrical composition early inspired some of his friends with high hopes for him as a poet ; but he disappointed them , and devoted himself to studies which , in the end , won him a far more enduring fame than any they could have predicted for him . His uneventful life was passed almost wholly at " The Wakes , " his modest place at Selborne . Except for the year ( 1752 ? 3 ) of his proctorship at Oxford , he seems to have stirred but little abroad after taking his degree . He was a victim of coachsickness , so that his quiet seclusion was partly forced upon him . He held an Oriel fellowship for fifty years , relinquishing it only at his death in 1793 . His admirers must regret that he incurred the odium of being a sinecure non-resident and pluralist . Nor does his pious descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole matter . Though he assures us repeatedy that his greatgrand-uncle was blameless , and that he never accepted any of the college livings offered him ,  | yet he distinctly tells us that Gilbert White did accept the small living of Moreton Pinkney , tendered him by Oriel College , and that he hired a curate to discharge its duties . For twenty-five years , too , he himself was curate of Faringdon , still residing at Selborne ; and all the while he continued a fellow of Oriel , and a non-resident one at that . What in the name of honesty does the author mean by asserting , in the footnote to page 100 , Volume I. , that his ancestor never accepted a college living , and then , only three pages farther on , calmly recording the fact of his " taking and holding with his Fellowship the small college living of Moreton Pinkney " ? The sum and substance of his labored apology seems to be that Gilbert White did only what fellows before him had done , and that he suffered no qualms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulso , the holder of several sinecures in the church , approved his conduct , and White was content . He certainly was not a rich man , as has been alleged ; but we wish he had avoided even the appearance of evil . The work before us is made up largely of extracts from the naturalist 's diaries , his letters , and his friends ' letters to him . Thus it serves as an admirable supplement to the " Natural History , " and helps us to know the man himself . In his Kalendar , under date of August 20 , 1765 , we have him as a keen-eyed observer of all that met his notice . " The water wagtail , " he says , " seems to be the smallest English bird that walks with one leg at a time : the rest of that size and under all hop two legs together . " Again , dipping at random into the letters , we find the poet . The following , from a letter to a nephew , has a savor of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well conducted , full of dignity ; but then perfection in that way is so rare , that we never had but two or three poems that were worth reading . A desire of raising the diction above prose pushes men into fustian and bombast . Even the great Milton , the father of blank verse , is not always free from this vice ; but ransacks the whole circle of sciences for a set of hard words and rumbling terms that make his readers stare . " Another letter , dated July 1 , 1776 , contains this item of historic interest : " As I was visiting last Tuesday at Bramshot I saw on the Portsmouth road Burgoyne 's light horse marching down to embark for N. America : the horses were fine , and the men fine young fellows ; but they all looked very grave , and did not seem much to admire their destination . The Atlantic is no small frith for cavalry to be transported over . The expense will be enormous ! " Mulso 's letters to White are good reading . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little touch of character is betrayed by the fact that while Mulso always addressed his friend as my dear Gil , " the latter would never descend from his high stilts , but , as we are told , invariably began his replies with " my dear Sir . " Even when writing to a nephew , he sometimes used this form . It is another trait of his character that he would never sit for his portrait , having been to some extent disfigured by the smallpox in his student days at Oxford . Consequently the many good illustrations contained in the Life include no likeness of Gilbert White himself . Though partial deafness overtook the naturalist in 1774 , and somewhat crippled him as an inquirer into nature 's secrets , he pushed his work on to its final publication fifteen years later . In January , 1788 , he writes that he has put his " last hand " to the book , but that the index still remains to be prepared , ? " an occupation full as entertaining as the darning of stockings . " Writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says of his book : The fate of my work is now determined ; and as the tree is fallen , it must lie . My brother and nephew have spared no expense about it , and particularly on the engravings , which have cost a considerable sum . This book will as you suppose not be published until autumn , when the town begins to fill . In the interim the author will be in no small a squeeze ; and will feel like a school boy who has done some mischief , and does not know whether he is to be flogged for it or not . " The work was well received from the first . Dr. Scrope Beardmore , Warden of Merton College , Oxford , in speaking to a nephew of the author , made the following prediction : " Your uncle has sent into the world a publication with nothing to call attention to it but an advertisement or two in the newspapers ; but , depend upon it , the time will come when very few who buy books will be without it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Natural History , " Mr. HoltWhite says , among other things : Its author did not , as a boy and young man , enjoy the benefit of any instruction in the facts of science ; instruction which would in our time be dignified with the name of a scientific education ; but his reasoning faculties were strengthened and improved by the study of the classical languages , which not only introduced him to the noblest literature , but also taught him to be logical and careful in thought , and accurate in statement . " This biography of the Selborne naturalist will prove rather heavy reading to those not  | already interested in Gilbert White and his writings . The author 's zeal and industry in tracing family history and pedigree will be admired and appreciated by all descendants of the Jutm or Viti of Jutland , but may not be so warmly applauded by less favored mortals . However , it was high time somebody wrote a life of Gilbert White , and probably no one was better equipped for the task than the present head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
