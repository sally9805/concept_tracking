txt Gen. Benjamin Harrison , ex-President of the United States , who has been in the city for several days , last night expressed his views on the political situation in a talk with reporters at ' the Fifth Avenue Hotel . " Is it true , General , " said a reporter that You have consented to make some speeches in the campaign ? " " No , " replied Gen. Harrison , " that statement has not been- authorized by me . I have said to every one - Who has spoken or written to me on the subject that I could not do-any more campaign work . I began to make Republican speeches the year I began to vote and have had a laborious , if unimportant , part in every- campaign , State and National , up to the year 1898 . In 1896 I submitted myself to very hard usage and then made up my mind-and so said to my friends-that I would do no - more campaigning . Following this conclusion I declined to take a speaking part in the campaign of 1898 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Few men have made more speeches for their party than I have done , and no exPresident , I am sure , has made so many . Since I left Washington my retirement from all participation in party management has been complete . All that I have left to others , and I think they have very generally and kindly accepted my sense of the proprieties of the case-at least between campaigns . In a word , I have vacated the choir loft and taken a seat in the pewswith a deep sense of gratitude to my forbearing fellow-countrymen . " " But , General , " a reporter suggested , " it is said that you are not altogether in accord with your party . " " Well , " remarked Gen. Harrison , with a smile , " I have heard that my silence was imputed by some to that cause . Now the only public utterance I have made in criticism of the policies of the party was contained in the interview consisting of one rather short sentence that I gave to . the newspapers while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in substance that I regarded the bill as a grave departure from right principles . deleted paragraph Governmental and business affairs into confusion . We should not aid the election - of a President who would , admittedly , if ' he could , destroy the gold standard and other things that we value even more , upon the deceptive suggestion that he has been bound-that the Republican Part will , after defeat , still have strength enough to save the temple . It will be much better not to allow the men with destructive tendencies so much as to lean'against its pillars . " The economic policies of the Republican Party have been vindicated by the remarkable and general prosperity that has developed during Mr. McKinley 's **25;59;TOOLONG a period of great depression . A change of Administration this Fall would almost certainly renew conditions from which we have so happily escaped . The full dinner bucket is not a sordid emblem . It has a spiritual significance for the spiritually minded . It means more comfort for the man and family , more schooling and less work for the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . " Gen. Harrison referred , in the course of his remarks as showing his present attitude , to his speech of 189G , condemning free silver and the populistic doctrine respecting the powers and duty of the Supreme Court . Gen. Harrison will leave for his home in Indianapolis to-morrow . . Diligent efforts are being made to induce him to speak in New York before his departure , but it is not believed that they will be successful .
