A elini011s and interesting process has been going on in Mindanao of the Philippines ; the West is being grafted upon the East ; American government and ways are passing to Oriental savages . The most troublesome and inaccessible tribe were the Lanao Moros , living about the fine lake of that name , high in the mountains and forests of the interior of Mindanao . From thence in the past they had sallied forth when they pleased , in piratical and slave-taking expeditions that made the name of Moro the terror of he Philippines . Returning thither , their ways had seemed to close behind them . It was for the Americans to open these ways : for here , as perhaps over all the earth , road-making was to be the first step , and to merge with government-making and civilization . For the Malanaos , as these Moros railed themselves , the two began together . Compare Major Bollard 's article on " Road-Building among the Moms , " in the Atlantic for December , Mil . VOL. 97 ? NO. 3 BULLARD United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores of Mindanao to the borders of Lake Lanao . The work fell to the soldier ; for , with the coming of civil government to the other Philippines , the Moros , because of their long tradition of piracy , lawlessness , and savagery , had been left to the care of the army . From this work , from his part and charge thereof , and from his subsequent experience as first governor of Lanao , the writer speaks . Having heard only fearful rumors of the military prowess and dire fanaticism of the Moros , we came to find a numerous people in a native state of political chaos , to the civilized mind incomprehensible , for reasonable beings incredible . Nothing , not even pandemonium , could be said to reign in such disorder . An infinity of chiefs called dattos , with pompous titles ? sultan and rajah ? suggesting power and authority , yet having none , divided a fine country into many minute sovereign and independent followings , of uncertain S86 Preparing our : 11 oros for Government jurisdiction as to persons , places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , differed only in name , ? not in condition or characteristics . These tribes bad their traditional , hereditary sultans , doubled and trebled perhaps , but always largely nominal , and , except for their immediate personal following , will but little real authority . Over their " sons " ? the general people and the countless lesser dattos and sultans of the tribe  --  they had influence , hardly control . The latter governed themselves , that is , lived as they pleased , as they could , or as they were allowed by their neighbors . More , probably , than any other man on earth the Moro did as he pleased ; his only restraint was his fear of others . With perhaps a dozen separate datto groups within a radius of a mile , wills no common superior to adjust differences , followers of different dattos wrangled , lay in wait for one another , made war , or watched one another in a state of armed peace that was worse than war . With no other means of squaring accounts than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy were the predominant tones . Fear on the datto 's part that , if he were severe with his followers , they would leave him and , by joining some neighbors , disturb the local balance of power , prevented the punishment of any but domestic offenses ; and so Moros everywhere were thieves , robbers , pirates , and slave-takers , in a state of continual violence and wrong-doing toward one another and all men , so far as they dared . They loved markets , trade , and intercourse , but for these there was no protection except individual prowess . If wives or children went out without guard but a little way from home , they were likely to be nabbed and run off into slavery by prowling man-hunters , shifted about , sold quickly from hand to hand , and lost beyond all power of tracing . They showed signs of industry , but for this virtue savagery offers no encouragement . Trained in the use of the dagger , kris , two-handed sword and spear , all Moros were soldiers , proud , quick-tempered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heir skill in arms , without which , waking or sleeping , they were never caught . Suds were the Moros . There was ao government . The only suggestion of it was found in the datto . Manifestly heir not only had the foundations of govern . ment and order yet to be laid , but the very places for them were to be made and prepared . From a few fights that had preceded our coming , it had been made plain to the American authorities that will our superior intelligence , arms , and organization we could , whenever desired , absolutely wipe the Moros off the earth . There was , however , in such proceeding neither purpose nor glory , and the policy was to grant opportunity to the INforos , if they would take it , for better things in pen , Thence , logically , my first steps were to try to demonstrate to them our good inten ? tions , to place on exhibition before thew the advantages , the benefits , of peace , order , and government , ? things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soldiers slowly and painfully for four months worked a road through jungle , forest , and mountain toward the heart of the Moro country . In this time , though often invited and always treated with great consideration , but a few straggling Morns came to visit me . With these , however , I spent time patiently , squatting or sitting about camp , sometimes talking , often in silence , all day to the very night , so long as they would stay , to allow them to look and d learn , to observe us for themselves , and satisfy their curiosity ; then , as they went away , I invited them to come again to-morrow . They came in little bunches , and the dattos talked . They rarely spoke directly upon the subject which nevertheless I could see was uppermost in their thoughts , ? our coming . They either disdained any show of interest in it that might imply concern or fear about our presence , ? for a Moro is nothing if not proud , - or // cis , preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset of trying to establish friendly relations , ill luck befell . Simultaneously with the Americans there appeared amongst the Moros the most fearful of all diseases , the Asiatic cholera , And straightway it was charged upon us . Tho white men were in league with the Cholera Man , and had brought his devils to destroy the Moros . My few friends dropped away out of sight , whence they had come . Prowling bands , even lone Moros , beset the trails and camp , lying in salt and attacking with fury and bitterness lone sentinels and small parties . A dugle old datto , Alandug , stayed . From his seacoast village he had looked wider upon the world , and was wiser than his follows . I did not need to tell him , for he cusily saw for himself , our mortal terror of the cholera , whose cause we called germs , he , devils . He did not , however , understand why we were not dying like the Moron . I showed him the soldiers boiling their water , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the water in which it lived . To my surprise he never flinched at the statement , he swallowed it whole ; this froth , so hard of acceptance among wiser men , found ready belief with this savage . Long afterward I knew why . It agreed with the Moro religious theory that all diseases are but devils that have slipped from the outside into the body . Our theory and theirs , so different , yet the same , proved a first bond , something common between white man and brown . Alandug told the other Moros what a just theory the Americans had of the cholera , and how the awful disease had killed but few Americans . In a short time my friends began to come back with him , bringing all the ills of human flesh for cure by advice of the white man , in whose medical theories they had quickly acquired confidence . Thenceforward medicine , and especially quinine , became my ally , esteemed above right , reason , principle , arid , upon occasions , even above force . The labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slow . We were still , af ter months , far from the Moro country , not among the people we had come to reach . A weekly market at a coast settlement , and the season of salt-boiling , were , however , bringing parties of Moros from the far interior past us to the coast . Curiosity induced them to squat , talk , and smoke with me , while they " sized up " the Americans and admired their beautiful arms . Thus daily I spent hours with them . The first thing ever in their eyes and thoughts was arms , ? firearms , ? but on this subject I would not talk . They were greatly impressed with the quantity and variety of the things we haul . Here I was ready for them . The Moros were very poor , they said ; they relied upon arms and the religion of the Prophet ; their sultans and dattos were mighty , and were not subject to or ruled over by one another , or by any man , because they were brave , feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them of the might , but assured them of the friendly intentions , of the Americans ; that we had not come to fight , but to open roads , so that the Moros could come to buy , sell , trade , work with the Americans and grow rich ; that we had come to bring the Moros all the valuable and useful things which they saw we had . I ended with an offer to hire and pay them for working on the road . Thereat they professed much pleasure . In this , my thoughts were on work for peace , theirs on arms for war , firearms , which in the Moro eye shut out sight and consideration of all things else . Moved by the hope of getting these , some smaller dattos near , after much talk , declared themselves ready to accept the offer of work . Old Alandug came first , with a handful of ugly-looking followers , whom we treated like kings , and handled like infernal machines ready to go off at any time . When at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the coin , the money in hand , in a sort of charmed , pleased surprise . The 388 Preparing our Maros for Government next day saw their numbers grow ; succeeding days new groups were added , with growing confidence , but armed , always armed , stuck all over with daggers and krises . A few days ' work , however , and my old friend , Alandug , fell from me for a while on the arms question . A stray Moro , a low-bred , common fellow , taking advantage of the datto 's absence at work with me , had eloped at one fell swoop with two of the datto 's young wives . The datto must have revenge , and , to obtain it , rifles from me , his brother , who had come to do the Moros good . Disappointed at my refusal , he went away sulking ; but , as I had expected , his people in a day or two sneaked back to work without him , to get from the Americans the sure pay and regular food which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an augury of good which , as time passed , I was to see more and more realized . The market goers and salt-makers carried the news of the money-getting to the interior , and other strangers appeared , strengthening the number of our laborers and friends , and weakening the ranks of the hesitating or hostile . Pay for work was sure , and the burning desire for arms began to be forgotten in an awakened love of gain . A new force was at work among Moron , and what , in civilized men , we rail at as low and vile , became in these savages a saving virtue , making for peace and progress . The followers of the datto Alag and the men of Pugaan , who , on account of a damsel bought and paid for but never delivered , had for years been attacking one another on sight , and dared not now , as they loved their lives , meet on market or trail , wiped the score from memory to come and earn money together on the American road . The sultan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in away to rack the nerve and wreck the best men ever built , had long been either at war or in a state of continual guard night and day against each other 's raids , forgot the old cannon that had been the cause of the trouble , and came to work on the road without friction . Men to whom it had been discredit . if not dishonor , to be found without arms , gradually came to lay them aside at the white man 's insistence , for a short time at least , while they labored . Harder still f Jr a Moro , ? whose law is an eye for an cyc , conduct for conduct to all generations . ? a datto , a favorite of mine , under the same influence , came after six months to look , if not with forgiveness , at least out excitement and feverish desire to kill , upon a Moro road laborer of mine , some of whose people in long-gone times had fought and wounded the datto 's grandfather . A boyhood spent among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them and over others like them , the Filipinos , had strongly impressed upon me the distrust which such people always feel toward middlemen of all kinds , especially interpreters . Direct speech alone satisfies them . ' With the Moros the constant effort and practice of our all-day seances had in a few months obviated alike the need of interpreter and the possibility of distrust : I had learned their own tongue . They could talk with me directly , and they soon were coining oftener and farther to do it . From the beginning , among these visitors had appeared many pandita8 , scribes and priests , men of solemn dignity and preoccupied mien . They made a great show of silence ; but , notwithstanding this , I could see that in reality , by look . gesture , and occasional word , they generally directed the speech of the rialto whom they accompanied . They touched so often upon religious matters and customs that I had quickly felt the need of being informed on the subject of Mohammedan teaching , especially concerning conduct and foreign relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was soon astonishing the panditas , who were themselves really ignorant of their religion , with my learned talk crammed for the occasion from Sales 's translation al the Koran . With the Moros in Spanish times , religion had been the greatest // , tum bling-block . In their view the Koran A a , the whole law , established long ago ie the days of the Prophet , so that change and innovation in anything that it governed ( and it governed all things ) were not only unnecessary. , but wrong . Now or . the Americans , had not , like the Spaniards , come talking a new religion . We had the correct Moro theory of disease . Moreover , we had , as it were , slipped up on their weak human side by appealing to their love of gain , and by keeping them employed had even kept their thoughts from the usual fanatical channels into which they were wont to turn on meeting new things . In short , before the Moros knew it , they had been surprised , juggled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion , where we had expected the greatest difficulty , we were , on account of a little study and pains ( I almost said trick ) , not only to have none , but were to meet with real assistance in getting control of the bulk of the Moros . Religion is the one thing , if there is any , that faintly holds together the incoherent groups of the race . After many visits irons less important priests , came the chief and most reverend one in all Lana ? , an old and very shrewd man . I received and treated him with great dignity and show of respect , and talked the Koran with him as long as he pleased . Delighted with his first reception , he came again and often . In a few months he was my stanch friend , and was sending letters and messages to his people , many of whom were now either preparing for war or had already been committing acts of war against the Americans . He told them that he spoke the will of Allah-'taAllah ( God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the Americans . He assured them that the Americans also , like the Moros , knew the will of Allah-'ta. - Allah and the words of the Prophet . With this old man I advised on many subjects , and one of his last acts with me was to rise , to my great surprise , in a grand assembly of his people a year after our first meeting , and solemnly announce it as the will of God , made known to him , that the Americans rule over the Moro people and tax them to the fifth of all their goods ! He could hare given no greater proof of loyalty , for the rock on which his people split was taxes . For nearly a year the pre'sence of the Americans , contact with them , observation , the example they offered of order , obedience , and government , the practice which in working with the Americans the Moros themselves received in obedience , order , industry , and responsibility , were lessons to the Moros preparatory to government , which was to follow . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on others , not . The latter committed against the Americans every aggresion that treachery and stealth could devise . Sentinels were stabbed in the dark , lone soldiers ambushed , cut up , and killed , small parties attacked , tents , tools , and arms stolen and carried away . Our patience long left these things unpunished , hoping that with time and a better comprehension of us the Moros would of themselves see the folly of continuing such acts . On the contrary , as the road went deeper and deeper into the Moro country , these aggressions became worse and more frequent . Our enemies , and even our friends , began to think we were afraid . Unpunished , enjoying to the full at our expense the gratification of their Moro love of lawlessness , our enemies taunted our friends with a foolish self-denial in abstaining from the sport . The friends felt and protested that we were making no difference between good and bad , between friend and foe . They demanded , and indeed it was right , that a distinction should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning all learned that we had surprised in his mountains , captured the arms , destroyed the rendezvous and scattered the band of Datto Matuan , whose followers , as all Moros knew , had beset and robbed the American camps . This was emphasized when , a few days later , 390 Preparing our Moms. for Government after wandering all night through the forest and mountains and wading lake and marshes , we had captured the fort and had utterly wiped out the band of the sultan of Birimbingan . His people under pretense of selling fruit had treacherously approached , cut up , and disabled for life an American soldier . Jeeringly referring to the American slowness to act against their enemies , he had answered my demand for redress by saying that he would take my message under consideration for some months , and then let me know whether he would talk about the matter at all . But respect grew when the news spread of a score dead in the town of Bacayauan , whose people had killed a soldier for the purpose of robbery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored , and then , fortifying the town , had defied the Americans . Nothing that happened between Americans and Moros was hidden . For the sake of instruction and effect Moros were made to know or hear all , and in these expeditions the effect was increased in Moro eyes by the fact that the Americans had distinguished well , and no friendly Moro had suffered at their hands . There was in consequence a wider call for American flags as a symbol of friendship . It was enough . Punitive measures were thereupon stopped . They were stopped out of policy also , with a view to the future pacification of even the bad Moros , on the knowledge that with them it is revenge , an eye for an eye , to the end of time , without regard to how justly be who first lost an eye deserved to lose it . For this reason a " kill and burn " policy can never succeed with Moros , can do nothing more than destroy them . These object-lessons had gradually , wills the passage of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American commander as their common superior . As this process went on it brought to light the miserable conditions under which these savages had always lived , ? willing , yet of themselves helpless , to throw them off . I was overwhelmed with a flood of complaints , requests to adjudicate claims , settle disputes and differences between different dattos and villages , punish countless rob beries , burnings , murders , and woundings , for which there had never in Morn history been any other tribunal than war and counter-aggression . The story led back as far as tradition goes , and opened a broad field of work , too broad for one man . It was plain that here , at least , near the road , the preparations for government had outrun the provision of machinery fur its operation . However , something had be done . I therefore quietly assumed the functions of lawmaker , ruler , and judge , ruled and settled disputes and differences on my own judgment and knowledge of conditions . The law was scarcely of record , ? neither was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhat informal ; but , like all simple folk , Moros seemed to prefer person . ality to form in government . Fortunately , too , with my clients exact justice according to civilized ideas was not necessary , nor in demand . Moro ideas of justice were , from their history , tradition , and lives , naturally hazy and faint , not to say nil . It was more important here that there be some law than that it be perfect , some decision and end of contro- versy than that they be just . My dictum was therefore accepted in general by the Moros near . Soon , however , the rumor of these things spreading , acts in intentional contempt and defiance of them as representing the growing American authority began to be committed by remoter dattos . Military men stationed among them need never seek occasions of quarrels with Moros . Moro ignorance , folly , and perversity can be relied upon to furnish plenty of occasions , and such occasions as can not be ignored or pardoned . Two such were now forced upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful Moros , under threat of war to the bitter end , was required to make full apology , and to cot // off his son from the succession to the sul- te , for public and boastful abuse of the American flag . It was a fit and effecnve though severe punishment . The see-pm I was even worse . One morning I surprised and captured , and soon had tried a el sentenced to seventeen years ' imprisonment , two dattos who , to show their disregard and contempt of what the Americans had enjoined , had made , against Filipinos , a successful slave-taking expedition by sea , under the American flag , which they had somehow managed to get hold of ! With the Moms restraint of personal liberty is the most grievous of all things ; it is inflicted for no crime , however great , and is allowed for but one cause , ? insanity . The punishment of the two dattos , therefore , spoke straight to the Moro heart , and all were made to hear it . Death were far preferable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dattos . That was the latest , no doubt it will be the last , nine that the American flag will cover a slave-taking expedition . The road had now been finished . In its concluding stages the competition among the Moros for the work , for the opportunity to earn money , had become so sharp as to be troublesome . Dattos were quarreling with one another about it , and , once started at work at a given point , they were so self-willed and determined that they could hardly be stopped to be directed elsewhere . The road work ended , the danger of idleness arose , for it had now become evident to me that Moros could be managed in two ways only , ? by putting them at work and keeping them atwork , or by putting them in fear and keeping them in fear . There is no possibility of living in quiet with unoccupied or uncowed Moros . I preferred the method of work . On my offer to hire them now to fetch supplies from the seacoast , there were repeated all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they first began work upon the road , complicated this time by fear that the Americans might try to make them carry bacon or something that contained some product of the hog , to the Mohammedan the lowest and vilest of things , accursed of God and the Prophet . After repeated reassurances on this point , they began . At first , to make sure , they would carry only flour , but the work proved profitable and became most popular . Then they took boxed stuff , then canned stuff , then ceased to question what , ? every man wisely curbing his curiosity , holding his tongue , carrying all things that came , and bacon at last among the rest ! Assuredly the leaven of new ideas was working . Gradually , in the past few months , the Moros had accepted much : and this demonstrated their readiness to accept more , of what was American . The time seemed opportune to give more foam to this beginning of control . Accordingly the writer was duly appointed governor of the Lanao Moms , with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining over the rest of the Philippines . Its defects were manifest at the very first effort to put it in operation . It failed to turn to account , to place itself at the head of , the weak but only organization in all Moro-land , the datto group , and to lay hold of the only power known to ? Ioros , the authority of the datto . On a small scale and imperfectly I had already had a government in operation in the only way that government can for years be operated among the Moros , ? one-man power without formality , backed by force and a knowledge of the conditions , and exercised upon the people through their dattos . As the law for the new government did not contain these essential provisions , it would not work ; but the little machinery of government which had previously been set up went on working quietly , until the new law by amendment adapted itself to the requirements of conditions , and the governor became de jure what he had already long been de facto , ? father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the dattos as his subalterns and assistants . 392 Preparing our Moron for Government Formal acceptance of government was naturally regarded by the Moron as a serious step , even where they had already in effect been living under that same government for some months . Reasons were demanded . I therefore held meetings to explain and satisfy all . Argument was made as varied and as different as the dattos themselves . Here came in profitably the knowledge which I had gradually been acquiring of each and every one 's circumstances and history . For one , it was sufficient to point out that Americans had not bothered his religion or his women ; for another , that he had suffered no injustice from us as he had from other Moros , Filipinos , or Spaniards ; for this one , that tribal wars in which his people had almost been wiped out had been stopped by the Americans ; for that one , that we had suppressed the thieves who had been robbing him of his women and goods . It was enough to remind the sultan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans , and the datto of Punud that he was wearing rich clothes since we came . It satisfied some that we had not come and tried to place over them the Filipinos , upon whom the Moron look with contempt as the immemorial source of their slave supply , and with hatred as their traditional enemies ; and others , that we had already adjusted and would go on adjusting ? it was the purpose of the government to adjust ? differences , and punishing wrongs between the different groups of the Moros , and so wipe out the sudden deadly attacks by one another from which all had suffered , and of which all stood in constant dread before the Americans came among them . " Why do you want this , and what do you come here for , anyhow ? " questioned , at one of these meetings , the old sultan of Bayabao , after I had just finished dealing out quinine to him and his begging retinue one raw , rainy day . " We are satisfied as we are , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin shirt , and flimsy trousers before me , well , warmly , and dryly clad . Have you such shoes and clothes as I to warm your body and protect your feet Or have you such medicines as I have just given you to cure your sickness ? " answered . " Do you know how to snake them ? " He was silent and the great crowd listened . " We do , and have come to show you . That is why . " To this day he and his people have not fought the Americans , nor resisted their government . It pleased and convinced many wchen I pointed out and emphasized , what Iher already knew , that now , with a security hitherto unknown to them , they were is ble to travel through all Lanao . Such were the reasons given , and they were pointed out and patiently repeated as the direct good which had already come , and of which more was to he expected , from the power and authority of the Americans . They won over gradually , without war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking on more form ; but the most numerous , warlike , and inaccessible tribe , under the most influential hereditary sultan of all , remained stubbornly hostile and aggressive . In twos and threes , his people prowled about , and by cunning , stealth , and lying in wait , lost no opportunity to rob , assault , stab , kill . They would accept nothing the Americans said , for while with most men it is credulity , with Moros it seems to be incredulity , that goes with ignorance of the world . To them , accustomed to see men governed only by desires and passions , it was inconceivable that the Americans bore these aggressions from any other cause than fear or weakness . Tradition and experience were all against such an idea . To them , whose largest example of power had been a datto who could muster a few hundred men , it was wholly incredible , and they ridiculed the idea , that the United States could bring against them any more men or arms than they land already brought . To them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without more ado destroy his enemy . That the Americans // had Imt done this meant therefore that the Americans could not do it . To talk to them of power without exercising it , or of punishment without executing it , was taken as mere vaporing . To my persuasion , demands , and threats alike , therefore , their dattos sent jeering replies or answered me with worse aggressions . The last straw was the murder of four soldiers by stealth , to secure their arms . Then followed a deadly punitive exptidition . It carried surprise and astonishment , a fearful lesson to foolish , boastful savages whose ideas of war were one thousand , and of power three thousand l years behind their age . This was the last argument , and to my next invitation not only those who had been punished , but the few others who had stood aloof , declared their readiness , and in a short time came under the new government . In organizing them , wherever they could be won over and had Made full submission , those dattos who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people under the United States ; for history shows that such men , under the conqueror , and whether the conqueror wills it or no , remain the strong spirits and real rulers of their country . Violent changes were thus avoided . All had now come under American authority , and the work of inducing them to accept government was practically finished . There was , however , one thing that still stuck in the throats of all , choking and gagging even those who willingly and peacefully had long been living under the new order . This was the question of taxation , a delicate subject , a last test with Moros , because it is a matter of religion . There had been much talk and murmur of this through all the tribes and groups . Therefore I again held a meeting , at which were assembled all the sultans , dattos , and men of consequence , for question and discussion . I laid before them all the reasons . It appealed to the dattos who had been appointed to offices over their people , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were very few . Again , for the common good , I said , ? to punish criminals and catch thieves ; but the common good had little meaning for men who had known no government , no rev publica , nothing common ; let every man care for himself , was their idea . In all their experience taxes stood for what had been wrung for selfish purposes by the strong from the weak , by conqueror from conquered , by master from his bondman ; and money paid for any other cause than direct barter and sale meant tribute , a horrible thing of subjection , dishonor , and slavery . That good should be alleged of taxa tion was incomprehensible ; that it was intended for the good of those who paid it was past belief . All their experience and tradition were contrary to such a thing . Public spirit could not be appealed to , for long habit of life in minute communities had effectually throttled the budding of such a feeling , and left only selfishness . Yet I felt no uncertainty as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had learned that in all things whatsoever , to the last , the white man outclasses , and can always find some intellectual way to go around , a Moro . In this matter it came thus : ? The Moros , like all other natives of the Philippines , are possessed of a consuming desire to carry a " pass , " ? some sort of an official certificate as to character , home , business , and the like , of the bearer , ? and they are willing to pay any amount therefor , and never think of it as taxation . On this weak point the Moros showed the first signs of yielding . Then the plan of indirect taxation caught , pleased , and overcame them , as it catches wiser men than they . Imported cotton cloth paying duty at the custom house had long been reaching the Moros through a few coast traders , and was now in large use among all Moros . Touching the jacket of the nearest datto , " You are a lot of foolish and ignorant children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes when you have already been doing it for years , and have actually been giving the Ameri- cans money to pay me , to pay the interpreter and all my soldiers . " This at once caught their attention . The explanation followed . They understood it remarkably quickly . They saw the humor and the truth of the thing , and , wondering at the finesse that had been able to make them contribute to their own subjugation , yielded in a sort of nonplussed way , feeling , no doubt , that it was useless to hope to escape a people who could devise such a smart system of getting money from other people without the latter 's eve , knowing it . To my help also at this juncture came my old friend , the priest Noskalim , the Metropolitan , as it were , of Lanao , with , if not a revelation , something better ? wisdom ? to his people " It is the will of Allah-'ta-Allah , The Merciful , who has many names . " In these ways government and cis-Hirt , @ @ @ @ @ @
