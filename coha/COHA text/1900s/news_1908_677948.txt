txt The longest and most exciting run since the contestants in the New York to Paris race left Times Square on Wednesday last has been made to-day- by the Thomas , ( American , ) De Dion . ( French , ) and Zust ( Italian ) cars . The two first named left Erie early this morning , the Thomas leading , and the Thomas reached this city at 8:85 o'clock to-night in a driving snowstorm . They had traveled 210 miles , to-day . The De Dion stopped at Premont. ' twenty-nine miles east of this city . The Zust car , which was held up at Ripley , twenty-seven miles east of Erie , last night through trouble with her radius rod , left there at 0:30 this morning , and passed through Erie at 11:40 , arriving at Cleveland at 7 o'clock to-night , with a run of 124 miles to her credit after a late start .

Misunderstandings All Around . The speed contest started to-day because of the mlitmderstandings which arose at Buffalo . yesterday . ; Up to that time the drivers of the Thomas , De Dionand . Zust cars ; . hhad Aeld.tfidAUSA izlider4i4ding , reached at Fonda on Friday . that , so far as possible , they should keep near each other and take turns in leading .

When the De Dion men heard that the Zust had gone on they started out in pursuit , leaving Buffalo at noon yesterday . Then Roberts set out with the Thomas , three and one-half hours behind the De Dion , and the dinner was abandoned . Feared Strategy of Italians . Both the French and American drivers last night were afraid that Sirtori ' in the Zust would steal another march upon them , and the two crews were nil upon the qui vire " last night at Erie to see Wet he did not go past . The suspense continued through the night , and the men took their rest after leaving the garages at midnight in fitful snatches , compared to which a sailor 's dog watch is a peaceful dream . When the Americans and Frenchmen were seated at breakfast at 0 o'clock this morning in Reid 's Hotel , the " honkhonk " of an automobile would cause them to jump from the table to see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching . Schuster , the engineer of the Thomas car , was especially indignant at being roused out from his bed at 3 A. M. after two hours ' sleep , with a false alarm that the Italian car had started from Ripley for Erie at terrific speed . After waking up telephone girls at various exchanges the report was found to be false and the tired men , including Roberts and TUE NEW YORK TIMES correspondent . who had also been called , lay down again to doze fitfully till e:30 o'clock . Thomas Car Oft in the Lead . The Thomas car was the first to leave the garage in Erie at 7 A. M. and start much as pOssible.the bitter wind that was blowing in his face and malting his eyes water very freely , One , commanding-looking woman stood In the porch of her . house , near . Unionville , with her four children , and fired a salute of sixteen shots with a rifle as the American car went by . Roberts smiled and waved his hand to her . The engineer of a Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand to Roberts as the automobile forged ahead of the train , and the conductor shouted : " Tell them in Cleveland that you saw us , and we sha n't be long . " The drivers of the electrice cars between Ashtabula and Cleveland sounded three signals on their horns as a salute : Seen from the top of the gasoline tank in the rear of the Thcmas car , the sun shining brightly on the crisp sparkling snow , the rapidly changing panorama of trees , farmhouses , - and ' country people in their sleighs made a. very picturesque effect . One of the features of the race that always , to interest . the public collected in the different towns- to see the Thomas car depart was the desperate attempts made by TIED TIMES reporter , clad in heavy coats , to clamber gracefully over the shovels , baggage , tires , and , other impedimenta to his perch on the gasoline tank . When he had accomplished the feat and was trying to look as though it was an every day occurrence , the crowd generously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bravo , fatty , " " Good for you , " " You 'll loose that in Siberia , old boy , " and other familiar expressions that street crowds are wont to shower upon public performers . When the French De Dlon car passed Conneaut , a small town twenty Miles west of Erie , she had a slight mishap to her machinery , which delayed her for a little time , so that she did not arrive in Cleveland until 1:10 P. M. , Just one and a half hours after the Thomas car . When Roberts arrived at Willoughby , twenty miles east of Cleveland ; he was met by a number of autoniobiles , decorated with flags , which had tome out to escort the Thomas car into the-city . ' Led by a fast sixty horse power car , Roberts drove his machine the nine miles along Euclid Avenue to the ** Hotel at a speed of thirty-five miles an hour .

Led by the pilot car , the ' Thomas racer passed safely over all the dangerous spots and arrived at Kirk Brothers ' garage here in Toledo , at 9:35 ; having made the run of ! re ? miles from Erie In 14 hours and 3e minutes . After a slight repast Roberts and Schusterm , his engineer , retired Lo their well-earned rest . At 11 o'clock to-night it was reported that the De Dion car had stopped at Fremont , a town thirty miles east of this place , for the night , owing to the heavy snowstorm , and would proceed in the morning- . This leaves the American car thirty Miles in the lead of the De Dion and 118 miles ahead of the Italian car . Roberts had intended , if the De Dion , car got here to-night , to go right through to Chicago to-morrow , but as the French car is thirty miles to the rear it is possible that the Thomas car will remain at South Bend to-morrow night and arrive in CIIicago for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked to have gone - through to Qhicago to-morrow , but I am afraid the snowstorm has put a stopper on that : It i 's 203 miles from here and that would be too much under the conditions . My arms are nearly pulled off with the strain of driving to-day such a distance over rough roads when I had to keep moving the wheel in order to prevent tile car getting off the track . I shall leave ' , here about S o'clock in the morning and try to make South Bend . " There is a blinding snowstorm here late to-night and the streets are now covered with a foot of snow . If the storm continues throughout the night , local automobilists say that it will be impossible for any of the cars to move to-morrow . POSITION OF CARS IN THE NEW YORK TO PARIS RACE .

Roberts set out at the best speed he could carry under the conditions , and determined that his car would be first in Cleveland at any cost . The pace was set by a six-cylinder test car from the ' Thomas factory at Buffalo , which accompanied Roberts yesterday afternoon to Erie . Although it was so early in the day , numbers of people were waiting in the streets to see the start , and a crowd of Italians questioned Capt . Hansen anxiously as to the possible whereabouts of the Zust car and when it would pass through the city . The road to Cleveland through Ashtabula was an up and down course on the switchback principia , which enabled the occupants of the Thomas ? ar speedily to digest their breakfasts .

" " Give it to them ! " " Si-. berla fur yours ! " as he flashed past groups standing on the sidewalks , with his head bent over the wheel to avoid as traffic laws for the occasion , and the spacious avenue was fairly alive with vehicles . The people collected in groups at the ' corners of the streets to cheer , and outside the hotel , where the Thomas car stopped for a few moments at 11:40 A.
