txt With a flood of invective that attested the bitterness of his spirit , District Attorney Jerome made here to-day his final argu- ? men , in the proceedings brought by the King Committee of Metropolitan Street Railway stockholders to obtain his removal from office . He laid before Commissioner Richard T.m . Hand , appointed by Gov . Hughes to hearthe testimony , a collection of epithets that began by calling William F. King . Chairman of the prosecuting committee , a " milker of corporations , " and wound up by labeling Supreme Court Justice Seabury " a cad . " William R. Hearst , figured in the word picture as a " hydraheaded corporation . " Much of the evidence taken by the Armstrong Insurance Investigating Committee was characterized as " twaddle , " and a great deal was heard about " yapping yellow journals " and " muddle ! headed fools . " Mr. Jerome 's argument consumed both , of to-day 's sessions , and to-morrow Franklin Pierce , attorney for the King Committee will be heard , and after that , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a word in reply . Then the records will go to Commissioner Hand for his report to the Governor . Mr. Jerome began the morning by paying his respects to the manner in which the case had been handled , and did not hesitate to make sarcastic reference to the course of Gov . Hughes . Before he began his speech , Franklin Pierce , counsel for the complainants , filed a voluminous brief . Mr. Pierce 's Brief . The brief declared that every thoughtful man knows that conditions in New York County are " a hundred times more dangerous to the welfare of society than murder itself , " and that " a graver calamity could not visit the people of New York than the continuation of the evil example and the disgraceful conduct of William Travers Jerome In the office of Public Prosecutor of New ' - York County . " II Mr. Pierce argued that even in the investigation of these charges , the District Attorney has conducted in a manner warranting his removal from office . lie declared that Mr. Jerome all through the examination threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind . " Mr. Pierce took the ground that the District Attorney 's failure to investigate and prosecute the alleged " jury-fixing " in the Metropolitan Street Railway cases was a case of neglect of duty which was wholly inexcusable . " The extent of the existence of bribery of jurymen , bribery of court officials , tampering with witnesses , and controlling by criminal methods ' the conduct of the whole court . " said he , " is of the highest importance . " Mr. Pierce quoted the testimony of Till-. inghast who served as a juror in many cases , and says : " He tells us he received money for every case in which : he sat as a juror for the Metropolitan , and describes vividly the manner in which it was received . Did n't Go After Lawbreakers . " When these facts were disclosed to the District Attorney , " says Mr. Pierce , " if he possessed any of the true spirit of a public prosecutor he would have gone after the lawbreaker . He did nothing of the kind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief gives the story of the attempts of Mr. Julian , who was an employe of the Met- , ropolitan for ten years and instrumental in the alleged briberies of juries , to furnish . the office of the District Attorney ' with The necessary evidence . Mr. Smyth is the only assistant in the District Attorney 's office who pretends to have investigated this matter . And yet this young man Smyth tells us he had come to the conclusion that it was Ira. , possible for him to secure sufficient evidence of the commission of one of these crimes . " The circumstances attending a hearing before Justice Seabury in the Supreme Court in which Mr. Jerome withdrew after an argument with the Justice , Mr. ' Pierce declared to show " as discreditable an act as ever done by a public official . Yet this District Attorney , who has been recreant to every official obligation , still persists In . vilification of this honorable Judge , upon whom he heaps every epithet which he can command . " The Perkins Case . Taking up the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief says : " It is undisputed that Mr. Jerome would not furnish any evidence to the March Grand Jury , and we have his own statement that if they had found an indictment against George W. Perkins he would refuse to sign it . " Such conduct on the part of the District , Attorney and his position that he would not sign an indictment of the Grand Jury is in and of itself misconduct  --  gross misconduct ; and it affords ample reason for his removal . " For the purpose of shielding Mr. Perkins from criminal prosecution he instituted a , proceeding before Mr. Justice Joseph L. Moss , City Magistrate . In that proceedings , instead of invoking the admissions of Mr. Perkins before the Armstrong Committee to the fact that the matter as these campaign disbursements did , not come before the Finance Committee and was wholly the work of Perkins and President McCall , he - prepared evidence directly to the contrary . " The criminal proceedings before Judge Moss was , so far as the District Attorney and the defendant 's attorney were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Thereby Mr. Jerome has procured-a decision which he says controls his action as against all other companies making campaign contributions . " IS it necessary for me to urge upon your Honor that this kind of crime 30 the . most dangerous to public morals , ' the tice Seabury in his investigation of the Metropolitan jury fixing charges in March , 1906 , was sufficiently improper to be a ground for removal . " There was considerable clamor going on right then , " Mr. Jerome continued . " One William Randolph Hearst was stirring mightily in the town  --  Hearst the many-headed hydra corporation , who is so hard to reach in any judicial proceeding . This many-sided gentleman had been running one Shearn for District Attorney , and Justice Seabury , with his eye on a Supreme Court Justiceship , was standing in with the outfit . So he organized this investigation with a full bench of newspaper men in attendance . " Mr. Jerome described the proceedings before Justice Seabury , laying stress upon the retention of counsel by Justice Seabury for Julian , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unjudicial proceeding . " said Mr. Jerome . " I admit I lost my ternper , but if I did so I forgot my official character in my manhood and I 'll have to take the burden of my act . I thought Justice Seabury was acting as a cad , and he was . It was the most extraordinary display of judicial incompetence that I ever witnessed . It was lugged in by rag-tag , bobtailed lawyers , who brought in dishonest men to have them swear to all sorts of depositions . But even with all the stuff that was presented to Justice Seabury he could not find sufficient evidence on which to hold Ambrose McCabe . I withdrew from the case when I considered that Judge Seabury had acted in an unseemly way . There was no reason why I should have stayed to hear the court disgustingly , rankly , and brazenly playing to the yellow journals . " Mr. Jerome characterized Tillinghast as a convicted felon , who , with Julian , was the centre of the McCabe prosecution . He contrasted Lawyer Pierce 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the growing eloquence of the learned counsel as he portrayed Tillinghast in a spirit of bon camaraderie taking Juror Hendersonis place . on a panel on which Tillinghast had not been drawn . Mr. Pierce 's assertion that the District Attorney before taking Stanley Bogg into court to retract his confession of jury bribery had failed to tell Judge Seabury what Bogg proposed saying , Mr. Jerome declared was utterly false . He added : Attacks Pierce 's Brief . " It is an illustration of the wording of a vague muddle-headed mind that dares to put into a brief such a statement as that . Because the District Attorney refused to take the word of these crooks and prosecute a reputable lawyer the yellow journals raised a wild cry . Jim Osborne and Shearn and some muddleheaded fools wanted to strike a blow at . me for failing to prosecute a man on evidence that a reputable man would not have used in an attempt to convict even a dog . " Taking up the charge that he failed to prosecute George W. Perkins of the New York Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the Armstrong Committee evidence as a muddle . Several persons went upon the stand before those sagacious statesmen who rule us from Albany , " he said , " and made statements that they would not have made had they felt that a criminal action might have been started against them . " The District Attorney freely admitted that he could have obtained abundant evidence against the officials of many financial institutions for making campaign contributions . Ile did not think he had any right to pick out any particular one . He contended that the $50,000 used for the purpose of defeating William Jennings Bryan for the Presidency was money well spent in the interest of the policy holders . Had Bryan been elected . " Mr. Jerome proceeded . " there would have followed a shrinkage in the value of securities of from 10 to 12 per cent . The District Attorney confessed that he was ' amazed when Justice O'Sullivan charged the Grand Jury contrary to the advice given by Mr. Jerome concerning the finding of an indictment in the Perkins case . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jury that recognized the style of another man , " continued Mr. Jerome . " I was sure I recognized the style of another man and still think so . Not one of these who were urging these prosecutions had the nerve to come out themselves . They were afraid . There were the yellow journals yawping and the judiciary scared as well . " The purpose or the Proceeding brought ! against George Perkins before Magistrate Moss , " resumed Mr. Jerome . " was not to secure his conviction , but to get a judicial decision on the general legal issues involved in the matter of campaign contributions . " Mr. Jerome said that the discrepancy in the two stories told by the Treasurer and other officials of the New York Life as to the Perkins payment arose from a confusion in his mind between the original payment of the $50,000 by Mr. Perkins , which was authorized by the Finance Committee . and their payment to Mr. Perkins , which was not so authorized . " But , " said Mr. Jerome , " assuming that the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation  --  even then it would destroy his value as a witness to use that fact in evidence . McCall was dead , so we have nothing left but the statement of Mr. Perkins . With the assertion of M Inocence in the matter , and even if I had been as bloodthirsty as the traditional bloodhound , I do n't see what I could have accomplished . " I dm charged with befriending and protecting these wicked capitalists , who are said to have spread their insidious poison through the whole life of New York City , yet there is no one who has ever made even the slightest insinuation that I ever took a dishonest dollar , most dangerous to the-political ate , " civic life of Our country of any existing ? " Of the charges- relating to the failure of the District Attorney to procure indictment against Thomas F. Ryan in the Wall and Cortlandt Streets Ferries Company deal , the brief says : alight Have Indicted Ryan . " On the Sth day of October , 1907 , An . . thony N. Brady came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating the affairs of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company , and testified to some startling facts , which are the basis of this charge . Our contention is that that testimony alone , with such facts as Mr. Jerome could easily have ' ascertained without availing himself of the testimony of Mr. Ryan , was sufficient to have gone at once before a Grand Jury and to have procured indictments against Mr. Ryan and probably against Thomas Dolan and P. A. B. Widener for grand larceny . " After reviewing the charge that the DisIlia Attorney was negligent in failing to find an indictment against the American ' Ice Company , the brief says : " I confidently maintain that much of the evidence ; here tends to show that he was really acting in accordance with the desires of the American Ice Company . " The brief concluded with a long review of Mr. Jerome 's conduct in this hearing and his character as shown by his acts . It was alleged that he violated the law against gambling by shaking dice at a dollar a throw in a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Reply . Mr. Jerome said , in part : " It has been very difficult to prepare any answer to what this committee has submitted as charges on account of the extreme gelatinous and unsubstantial Manner in which the charges were drawn . It is not difficult to knock a man of straw down when he is set up . but it is essential to have a certain amount of straw at least to have it stand erect before one can indulge in that pleasant pastime of knocking it down . The amount of what is vulgarly called hot air I think is very great , and any one who has ridden a bicycle against the wind knows how difficult it is to-make time against that kind Of resistance . " While it is very delightful to have the air cleared after the many months of fog I have lived in , on the other hand it is a little arduous to have had to devote some six weeks to dealing with such charges . I must say that I was astonished that a constitutionally elected officer who has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of the people of the State of New York should be - put to answer such a flimsy and mendacious get of charges after an answer was filed containing all the facts . This complaint is not verified even on information and belief . " The eminent gentleman who signed the charges was not even a stockholder in the Metropolitan Street Railway Company . Although ostensibly Chairman of the Stockholders ' Protective Committee , he was not even a stockholder . I suppose in my personal relations the ' -e has been no man in public 1if more antagonistic to me than Gov . Odell. and justly so , and yet when charges of a similar character were laid before him it impressed him as preposterous , anti I was ' not even called upon to answer . " I mean to make no comment on the Governor of the State of New York at present I have no doubt , after the many years that I have known him personally , some twenty-seven now , that he thought that it was better for me that ; - matters of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist might be adduced , and so in that spirit F ! have no doubt that he ordered this reference to your Honor . I accept the gift in the spirit in which it is given . " Mr. Jerome criticised Mr. Pierce 's methods in getting the Grand Jury minutes and taking them to his office to Copy . He said this was " committing a crime . " He said that Clarence Shearn and James W. Osborne . two men whom he bad whipped politically , were active in All these matter . He went on : ' It is pleasant to see the righteous indignation of Mr. King , this non-stockholding President of a stockholders ' committee , over the taking of the funds of widows and orphans to defeat Bryan , when he himself , as President of the Merchants ' Association , was milking the New York Life to the tune of some $10,000 or $15,000 . Conception of His Duty . " If the facts exist which show that have been derelict in the discharge of my duties , however base they were , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discharge of those duties . I have lived all my life in the City of New York . Twice I have run for office in that city and been elected , the last time against every political party , and all alone . I consider that I was elected to exercise my judgment in the discharge of the duties of that office and not the judgment of the irresponsible editors of yellow journals and what they might say I ought to do . " Nor on the other hand do I understand , nor have I ever understood , that public clamor was a thing that should direct my judgment or my activities , and when I read in the complainants ' brief that these facts were disclosed to the District Attorney , if he possessed any Of the true spirit of a public prosecutor he - would have gone after the law breaker as a bloodhound goes for the throat of his : victim . I think I see in that the kind of a keynote that one could dwell upon at some length . " The conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of a public prosecutor in the spirit of a bloodhound springing at the throat of his victim , is a conception so base that if there were proceedings to remove from the bar as there are from public office , a man as being unfit to discharge the duties of an attorney , surely nu better evidence would be needed or the unfitness f any man to practice law or to claim to be an honorable or decent fair-minded g ntle " I conceive that the duties that . were . laid upon me in that office and which I have striven to discharge were those to 1. be fair and just , to apply one law to all ; persons . not to apply one law to the poor ' and another to the rich man . " Mr. Jerome then took up the history of , the Metropolitan Street Railway jury-fix+ing investigation , and told how Louis E. tJulian , formerly the investigator of the street railway , came to John A. Henneberry , the chief clerk of the District Attorney 's office , in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that Julian was an investigator for the Metropolitan at the very time when Mr. . Pierce had said so much crookedness was oing on . The assertion of Julian that he : had no personal knowledge of the juryfixing was particularly emphasized . together with the character of Tillinghast the professional juror , who confessed that he had taken money for sitting in many cases when the Metropolitan was a defendant . Mr. Jerome declared it was itn ; possible to get evidence of a corroborative - character . The informants declared that - the vouchers covering the disbursements for jury-fixing were destroyed . and so , said Mr. Jerome . there was nothing to be done hut what Smyth and Nott die do . and that was nothing . Case Before Sealant-F . Next Mr. Jerome considered the charge that his conduct before City Court JusSimilarity of Charges . " In this Perkins matter I might remark on a striking similarity between the charge of Justice Goff to the April Grand Jury of 1906 and the charge of Judge O'Sullivan to the March Grand Jury , nor can one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spier spent-much of his time wandering around the floor of the Criminal Court Building where the Judge 's offices aresituated . " Mr. Jerome passed over the charges relating to the payment of $40,000 profit realized by the loan of New York Life money to the Nylic fund , and those relating to syndicate transactions which Mr. Pierce did not discuss in his brief , simply saying that there was nothing criminal in either matter . In referring to the Wall and Cortlandt Street ferries deal , in which Thomas F. Ryan , P. A. B. Widener . William C. Whitney , Thomas Dolan , and W. L. Elkins divided $550,000 received from the Metropolitan Securities Company , Mr. Jerome declared that although he had his suspicions that some persons were not telling the truth before the Grand Jury he had no way of proving it . He believed absolutely what Mr. Ryan said . however , and did not believe Ryan committed any wrong . Alluding to the efforts of the King committee to prove something against him , Mr. Jerome , becoming deeply serious , exclaimed : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done right than whether I keep that job . There is nothing I crave in political life . " Mr. Jerome said that he had gone thoroughly into the question of whether the American Ice Company had violated the ! law . and was unable to find anything upon which criminal action could have been taken up to the time Gov . Hughes ! ordered that he be superseded by Attor- I ney General Jackson in the matter . It is still merely a question as to what con- ' stitutes a monopoly , he said . " I may , " said Mr. Jerome , " have been mistaken ; in judging . but nobody except an ass claims to be infallible on the law . " Mr. I Jerome said he believed the contracts ! between the American Ice Company and the independent dealers who sold out to it were'valid and would hold in court .
