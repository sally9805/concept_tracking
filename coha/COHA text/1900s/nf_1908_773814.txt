txt 6o COMPARATIVE RELIGION Bay , a festival of the dead is observed , the equivalent of which appears to be found amongst all the Eskimo . M. Mauss ( L'Annee Sociologique , IX , 99 ) thus describes it : " It comprises two essential parts . It begins with praying the souls of the dead graciously to consent to reincarnate themselves for the moment in the namesake which each deceased person has ; for the custom is that in each station the child last born always takes the name of the last person who has died . Then these living representatives of the deceased receive presents , and having received them the souls are dismissed from the abodes of the living to return to the land of the dead . Thus at this festival not only does the group regain its unity , but the rite reconstitutes the ideal group which consists of all the generations which have succeeded one another from the earliest times . Mythical and historic ancestors as well as later ones thus mingle with the living , and communion between them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amongst people other than the Eskimo , a new-born child not only takes the name of the last member of the family or clan who has died , but is regarded as the reincarnation of the deceased . " Thus the number of individuals , // of names , of souls , of social functions in the clan is limited ; and the life of the clan consists in the death and rebirth of individuals who are always identically the same " ( l.c. 267 ) . The line of evolution thus followed by the belief in reincarnation results in the total separation of the belief from morality and from religion , and results in rendering it infertile alike for morality , religion , and progress in civilisation generally . Where the belief in reincarnation takes the form of belief in the transmigration of the soul into some animal form , it may be utilised for moral purposes , provided that the people amongst whom the belief obtains have otherwise advanced so far as to see that the punishments and rewards which are essential to the development of morality are by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction has established itself , the reincarnation theory will provide machinery by which the belief in future punishments and rewards can be conceived as operative : rebirth in animal form , if the belief in it already exists , may be held out as a deterrent to wrongdoing . That is , as a matter of fact , the use to which the belief has been put by Buddhism . The form and station in which the deceased will be re62 COMPARATIVE RELIGION born is no longer , as amongst the peoples just mentioned , conceived to be determined automatically , so to speak , but is supposed to depend on the moral qualities exhibited during life . If this view of the future life has struck deeper root and has spread over a greater surface than the doctrine taught in the Greek mysteries ever did , the reason may probably be found in the fact that the Greek mysteries had no higher morality to teach than was already recognised , whilst the moral teaching of the Buddha was far more exalted and far more profoundly true than anything that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself , on its own merits , were capable of affording a sure foundation for religion , Buddhism would be built upon a rock . To the spiritual community by which man may be united to his fellow-man and to his God , morality is essential and indispensable . But the moral life derives its value solely from the fact that on it depends , and by means of it is realised , that communion of man with God after which man has from the beginning striven . If then that communion and the very possibility of that communion is denied , the denial must prove fatal alike to religion and to morality . Now , that is the denial which Buddhism // makes . But the fact of the denial is obscured to those who believe , and to those who would like to believe , in Buddhism , by the way in which it is made . It is made in such a way that it appears and is believed to be an affirmation instead of a denial . Communion with God is declared to be the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communion to which it leads is so intimate that the human soul , the individual , ceases to be . Obviously , therefore , if it ceases to be , the communion also must cease ; there is no real communion subsisting between two spirits , the human and the divine , for two spirits do not exist , but only one . If this way of stating the case be looked upon with suspicion as possibly not doing justice to the teaching of Buddhism , or as pressing unduly far the union between the human and the divine which is the ultimate goal of the transmigration of souls , the reply is that in truth the case against Buddhism is stronger than appears from this mode of stating it . To say that from the Buddhist point of view the human soul , the individual , eventually ceases to be , is indeed an incorrect way of putting the matter . It implies that the human soul , the individual , now is ; and hereafter ceases to be . But so far from // admitting that the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul , now , is mere illusion , mayd . It is therefore logical enough , and at any rate self-consistent , to say that hereafter , when the series of transmigrations is complete , the individual will not indeed cease to be , for he never was , but the illusion that he existed will be dissipated . Logically again , it follows from this that if the existence of the individual soul is an illusion from the beginning , then there can strictly speaking be no transmigration of souls , for there is no soul to transmigrate . But with perfect self-consistency Buddhism accepts this position : what is transmitted from one being to the next in the chain of existences is not the individuality or the soul , but the character . Professor Rhys Davids says ( Hibbert Lectures , pp. 91 , 92 ) : " I have no hesitation in maintaining that Gotama did not teach the transmigration of souls . What he did teach would be better summarized , if we wish to retain the word transmigration , as the transmigration of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word transmigration altogether when speaking of Buddhism , and to call its doctrine the doctrine of karma . Gotama held that after the death of any being , // whether human or not , there survived nothing at all but that being 's karma , ' the result , that is , of its mental and bodily actions . " " He discarded the theory of the presence , within each human body , of a soul which could have a separate and eternal existence . He therefore established a new identity between the individuals in the chain of existence , which he , like his forerunners , acknowledged , by the new assertion that that which made two beings to be the same being was ? not soul , but ? karma " ( ib. , pp. 93 , 94 ) . Thus once more it appears that there can be no eventual communion between the human soul , at the end of its chain of existence , and the divine , for the reason , not that the human soul ultimately ceases to be , but that it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body to another , nor is eventually absorbed in the atman . Logically consistent though this train of argument be , it leaves unanswered the simple question , How can the result of my actions have any interest for me ? not hereafter , but at the present moment ? if I not only shall not exist hereafter but do not exist at the present moment ? It is not impossible for a man who believes that his existence will absolutely F // cease at death to take some interest in and labour for the good of others who will come after him ; but it is impossible for a man who does not exist now to believe in anything whatever . And it is on that fundamental absurdity that Buddhism is built : it is directed to the conversion of those who do not exist to be converted , and it is directed to the object of relieving from existence those who have no existence from which to be relieved . Where then lies the strength of Buddhism , if as a logical structure it is rent from top to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spirit of self-sacrifice . What it denounces , from beginning to end , is the will to live . The reason why it denounces the will to live is that that will manifests itself exclusively in the desires of the individual ; and it is to the desires of man that all the misery in the world are directly due . Destroy those desires by annihilating the will to live ? and in no other way can they be destroyed ? and the misery of the world will cease . The only termination to the misery of the world which Buddhism can imagine is the voluntary cessation of life which will ultimately ensue on the cessation of the will to live . And the means by which that is to be brought about is // the uprooting and destruction of the self-regarding desires by means of the higher morality of self-sacrifice . What the Buddhist overlooks is that the uprooting and destruction of the self-regarding desires results , not in the annihilation , but in the purification and enhanced vitality , of the self that uproots them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of individuality , but its highest realisation . Now , it is only in society and by living for others that this unselfishness and self-sacrifice can be carried out ; man can only exist and unselfishness can only operate in society , and society means the communion of man with his fellows . It is true that only in society can selfishness exist ; but it is recognized from the beginning as that which is destructive of society , and it is therefore condemned alike by the morality and the religion of the society . The communion of man with his fellows and his God is hindered , impeded , and blocked wholly and solely by his self-regarding desires ; it is furthered and realised solely by his unselfish desires . But his unselfish desires involve and imply his existence ? I was going to say , just as much , I mean ? far more than his selfish desires , for they imply , and are only possible on , the assumption of // the existence of his fellow-man , and of his communion with him . Nay ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the religious experience of mankind at large , the unselfish desires , the spirit of self-sacrifice , require both for their logical and their emotional justification , still more for their practical operation , the faith that by means of them the will of God is carried out , and that in them man shows likest God . It is in them and by them that the communion of man with his fellowman and with his God is realised . It is the faith that such communion , though it may be interrupted , can never be entirely broken which manifests itself in the belief in immortality . That belief may take shape in the idea that the souls of the departed revisit this earth temporarily in ghostly form , or more permanently as reincarnated in the new-born members of the tribe ; it may body forth another world of bliss or woe , and if it is to subserve the purposes of morality , it must so do ; nay ! more , if it is to subserve the purposes of morality , it is into the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any and whatever shape the belief takes , the soul is conceived or implied to be in communion with other spirits . There is no other way in which it is // possible to conceive the existence of a soul ; just as any particle of matter , to be comprehended in its full reality , implies not only every other particle of matter but the universe which comprehends them , so the existence of any spirit logically implies not only the existence of every other but also of Him without whom no one of them could be . It is in this belief in the communion of spirits wherever he may find it ? and where will he not ? ? that the missionary may obtain a leverage for his work . It is a sure basis for his operations because the desire for communion is universal ; and Christianity alone , of the religions of the world , teaches that self-sacrifice is the way to life eternal . MAGIC OF all the topics which present themselves to the student of the science of religion for investigation and explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none which has produced more confusion of thought , than magic . The fact is that the belief in magic is condemned alike by science and religion , ? by the one as essentially irrational , and by the other as essentially irreligious . But though it is thus condemned , it flourishes , where it does flourish , as being science , though of a more secret kind than that usually recognised , or as being a more potent application of the rites and ceremonies of religion . It is indeed neither science nor religion ; it lives by mimicking one or other or both . In the natural history of belief it owes its survival , so long as it does survive , to its " protective colouring " and its power of mimicry . It is , always and everywhere , an error , ? whether tried by the canons of science or religion ; 7o MAGIC 7 ' but it lives , as error can only live , by posing and passing itself off as truth . If now the only persons deceived by it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of religion would have been saved from much fruitless controversy . But so subtly protective is its colouring that some scientific enquirers have confidently and unhesitatingly identified it with religion , and have declared that magic is religion , and religion is magic . The tyranny of that error , however , is now well-nigh overpast . It is erroneous , and we may suppose is seen to be erroneous , in exactly the same way as it would be to say that science is magic , and magic science . The truth is that magic in one aspect is a colourable imitation of science : " in short , " as Dr. Frazer says ( Early History of the Kingship , p. 38 ) , " magic is a spurious system of natural law . " That is , we must note , it is a system which is spurious in our eyes , but which , to those who believed in it , was " a statement of the rules which determine the sequence of events throughout the world ? a set of precepts which human beings observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 39 ) . The point , then , from which I wish to start is that // magic , as it is now viewed by students of the science of religion , on the one hand is a spurious system of natural law or science , and on the other a spurious system of religion . Our next point is that magic could not be spurious for those who believed in it : they held that they knew some things and could do things which ordinary people did not know and could not do ; and , whether their knowledge was of the secrets of nature or of the spirit world , it was not in their eyes spurious . Our third point is more difficult to explain , though it will appear not merely obvious , but self-evident , if I succeed in explaining it . It will facilitate the work of explanation , if you will for the moment suppose ? without considering whether the supposition is true or not ? that there was a time when no one had heard that there was such a thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had observed such facts as that heat produces warmth , that the young of animals and man resemble their parents : in a word , that he had attained more or less consciously to the idea , as a matter of observation , that like produces like , and as a matter of practice that like may be produced by like . Having attained to that practical idea , he will of // course work it not only for all that it is worth , but for more . That is indeed the only way he has of finding out how much it is good for ; and it is only repeated failure which will convince him that here at length he has reached the limit , that in this particular point things do not realise his expectations , that in this instance his anticipation of nature has been " too previous . " Until that fact has been hammered into him , he will go on expecting and believing that in this instance also like will produce like , when he sets it to work ; and he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable means for attaining his end . As a matter of fact , however , as we with our superior knowledge can see , in the first place those means never can produce the desired effect ; and next , the idea that they can , as it withers and before it finally falls to the ground , will change its colour and assume the hue of magic . Thus the idea that by whistling you can produce a wind is at first as natural and as purely rational as the idea that you can produce warmth by means of fire . There is nothing magical in either . Both are matter-of-fact applications of the practical maxim that like produces like . // That , then , is the point which I have been wishing to make , the third of the three points from which I wish to start . There are three ways of looking at identically the same thing , e.g. whistling to produce a wind . First , we may regard it , and I suggest that it was in the beginning regarded , as an application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the general maxim that like produces like . The idea that eating the flesh of deer makes a man timid , or that if you wish to be strong and bold you should eat tiger , is , in this stage of thought , no more magical than is the idea of drinking water because you are dry . Next , the idea of whistling to produce a wind , or of sticking splinters of bone into a man 's footprints in order to injure his feet , may be an idea not generally known , a thing not commonly done , a proceeding not generally approved of . It is thus marked off from the commonplace actions of drinking water to moisten your parched throat or sitting by a fire to get warm . When it is thus marked off , it is regarded as magic : not every one knows how to do it , or not every one has the power to do it , or not every one cares to do it . That is the second stage , the heyday of magic . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated person believes in it , when , if a man thinks to get a wind by whistling he may whistle for it . These three ways of looking at identically the same thing may and do coexist . The idea of whistling for a wind is for you and me simply a mistaken idea ; but possibly at this moment there are sailors acting upon the idea and to some of them it appears a perfectly natural thing to do , while to others there is a flavour of the magical about it . But though the three ways may and do coexist , it is obvious that our way of looking at it is and must be the the latest of the three , for the simple reason that an error must exist before it can be exploded . I say that our way of looking at it must be the latest , but in saying so I do not mean to imply that this way of looking at it originates only at a late stage in the history of mankind . On the contrary , it is present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proof is the fact generally recognised that magicians amongst the lowest races , though they may believe to a certain extent in their own magical powers , do practise a good deal of magic which they themselves know to be fraudulent . Progress takes place when other people also , and a // steadily increasing number of people , come to see that it is fraudulent . In the next place , just as amongst very primitive peoples we see that some magic is known by some people , viz. the magicians themselves , to be fraudulent , though other people believe in it ; so , amongst very primitive peoples , we find beliefs and practices existing which have not yet come to be regarded as magical , though they are such as might come , and do elsewhere come , to be considered pure magic . Thus , for instance , when Cherokee Indians who suffer from rheumatism abstain from eating the flesh of the common grey squirrel " because the squirrel eats in a cramped position , which would clearly aggravate the pangs of the rheumatic patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 ) , or when " they will not wear the feathers of the bald-headed buzzard for fear of themselves becoming bald " ( ib. ) , they are simply following the best medical advice of their day , ? they certainly do not imagine they are practising magic , any more than you or I do when we are following the prescriptions of our medical adviser . On the contrary , it is quite as obvious , then , that the feathers of the bald-headed buzzard are infectious as it is now that the clothes // of a fever patient are infectious . Neither proposition , to be accepted as true , requires us to believe in magic : either might spring up where magic had never been heard of . And , if that is the case , it simply complicates things unnecessarily to talk of magic in such cases . The tendency to believe that like produces like is not a consequence of or a deduction from a belief in magic : on the contrary , magic has its root or one of its roots in that tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce magic amongst other things , magic is not the only thing which it produces : it produces beliefs such as those of the Cherokees just quoted , which are no more magical than the belief that fire produces warmth , or that causa aequat effectuna , that an effect is , when analysed , indistinguishable from the conditions which constitute it . To attempt to define magic is a risky thing ; and , instead of doing so at once , I will try to mark off proceedings which are not magical ; and I would venture to say that things which it is believed any one can do , and felt that any one may do , are not magical in the eyes of those who have that belief and that feeling . You may abstain from eating // squirrel or wearing fine feathers because of the consequences ; and every one will think you are showing your common sense . You may hang up the bones of animals you have killed , in order to attract more animals of the like kind ; and you are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wives whose husbands are absent on hunting or fighting expeditions may do or abstain from doing things which , on the principle that like produces like , will affect their husbands ' success ; and this application of the principle may be as irrational ? and as perfectly natural ? as the behaviour of the beginner at billiards whose body writhes , when he has made his stroke , in excess of sympathy with the ball which just wo n't make the cannon . In both cases the principle acted on , ? deliberately in the one case , less voluntarily in the other , ? the instinctive feeling is that like produces like , not as a matter of magic but as a matter of fact . If the behaviour of the billiard player is due to an impulse which is in itself natural and in his case is not magical , we may fairly take the same view of the hunter 's wife who abstains from spinning for fear the game should turn and wind like the spindle and the hunter be unable to hit it ( Frazer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that like produces like . Some applications of that principle are correct ; some are not . The incorrectness of the latter is not at once discovered : the belief in their case is erroneous , but is not known to be erroneous . And unless we are prepared to take up the position that magic is the only form of erroneous belief which is to be found amongst primitive men , we must endeavour to draw a line between those erroneous beliefs which are magical and those erroneous beliefs which are not . The line will not be a hard and fast line , because a belief which originally had nothing magical about it may come to be regarded as magical . Indeed , on the assumption that belief in magic is an error , we have to enquire how men come to fall into the error . If there is no such thing as magic , how did man come to b ? lieve that there was ? My suggestion is that the rise of the belief is not due to the introduction of a novel practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . It is due in the first instance to the fact that the practice is regarded with disapproval as far as its consequences are concerned and without regard to the means employed to produce them . Injury to a member of the community , 8o COMPARATIVE RELIGION especially injury which causes death , is viewed by the community with indignant disapproval . Whether the death is produced by actual blows or " by drawing the figure of a person and then stabbing it or doing it any other injury " ( Frazer , p. 41 ) , it is visited with the condemnation of the com-munity . And consequently all such attempts " to injure or destroy an enemy by injuring or destroy-ing an effigy of him " ( ib. ) , whenever they are made , whether they come off or not , are resented and disapproved by society . On the other hand , sympathetic or homoeopathic magic of this kind , when used by the hunter or the fisherman to secure food , meets with no condemnation . Both assassin and hunter use substantially the same means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community views the object of the assassin is extended also to the means which he employs . In fine , the practice of using like to produce like comes to be looked on with loathing and with dread when it is employed for antisocial purposes . Any one can injure or destroy his private enemy by injuring an effigy of him , just as any one can injure or destroy his enemy by assaulting and wounding him . But though any one may do this , it is felt // that no one ought to do it . Such practices are condemned by public opinion . Further , as they are condemned by the community , they are ipso facto offensive to the god of the community . To him only those prayers can be offered , and by him only those practices can be approved , which are not injurious to the community or are not felt by the community to be injurious . That is the reason why such practices are condemned by the religious as well as by the moral feeling of the community . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exposed by science or recognised by common sense . When they are felt to be futile , there is no call upon religion or morality especially to condemn the practices ? though the intention and the will to injure our fellow-man remains offensive both to morality and religion . With the means adopted for realising the will and carrying out the intention , morality and religion have no concern . If the same or similar means can be used for purposes consistent with the common weal , they do not , so far as they are used for such purposes , come under the ban of either morality or religion . Therein we have , I suggest , the reason of a certain confusion of thought // in the minds of students of the science of religion . We of the present day look at the means employed . We see the same means employed for ends that are , and for ends that are not , antisocial ; and , inasmuch as the means are the same and are alike irrational , we group them all together under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as the proceedings grouped together have the common attribute of being proceedings which can not possibly produce the effects which those who employ them believe that they will and do produce . But this grouping becomes perfectly misleading , if we go on to infer , as is sometimes inferred , that primitive man adopted it . First , it is based on the fact that the proceedings are uniformly irrational ? a fact of which man is at first wholly unaware ; and which , when it begins to dawn upon him , presents itself in the form of the further error that while some of these proceedings are absurd , others are not . In neither case does he adopt the modern , scientific position that all are irrational , impossible , absurd . Next , the modern position deals only with the proceedings as means , ? declaring them all absurd , ? and overlooks entirely what is to primitive man the point of fundamental importance , viz. the object // and purpose with which they are used . Yet it is the object and purpose which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in his eyes , to class together the things which he approves of and the things of which he disapproves would be monstrous : the means employed in the two cases may be the same , but that is of no importance in face of the fact that the ends aimed at in the two cases are not merely different but contradictory . In the one case the object promotes the common weal , or is supposed by him to promote it . In the other it is destructive of the common weal . If , therefore , we wish to avoid confusion of thought , we must in discussing magic constantly bear in mind that we group together ? and therefore are in danger of confusing ? things which to the savage differ toto caelo from one another . A step towards avoiding this confusion is taken by Dr. Frazer , when he distinguishes ( History of the Kingship , p. 89 ) between private magic and public magic . The distinction is made still more emphatic by Dr. Haddon ( Magic and Fetichism , p. 20 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very same means when employed against the good of the community are regarded , by morality and religion alike , as nefarious , which when employed for the good of the community are regarded with approval . The very same illegitimate application , ? I mean logically illegitimate in our eyes , ? the very same application of the principle that like produces like will be condemned by the public opinion of the community when it is employed for purposes of murder and praised by public opinion when it is employed to produce the rain which the community desires . The distinction drawn by primitive man between the two cases is that , though any one can use the means to do either , no one ought to do the one which the community condemns . That is condemned as nefarious ; and because it is nefarious , the " witch " may be " smelled out " by the " witchdoctor " and destroyed by , or with the approval of , the community . But though that is , I suggest , the first stage in the process by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means the whole of the process . Indeed , it may fairly be urged that practices which any one can perform , though no one ought to perform , may be nefarious ( as simple , straightforward murder is ) , but so far there is nothing magical about them . And I am prepared to accept that view . Indeed , it is an essential part of my argument , for I seek to show that the belief in magic had a beginning and was evolved out of something that was not a belief in magic , though it gave rise to it . The belief that like produces like can be entertained where magic has not so much as been heard of . And , though it may ultimately be worked out into the scientific position that the sum of conditions necessary to produce an effect is indistinguishable from the effect , it may also be worked out on other lines into a belief in magic ; and the first step in that evolution is taken when the belief that like produces like is used for purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step is taken when it comes to be believed not only that the thing is nefarious but that not every one can do it . The reason why only a certain person can do it may be that he alone knows how to do it ? or he and the person from whom he learnt it . The lore of such persons when examined by folk-lore students is found generally to come under one or other of the two classes known as sympathetic and mimetic magic , or homoeopathic and contagious magic . In these cases it is obvious that the modus operandi is the same as it // was in what I have called the first stage in the evolution of magic and have already described at great length . What differentiates this second stage from the first is that whereas in the first stage these applications of the principle that like produces like are known to every one , though not practised by every one , in the second stage these applications are not known to every one , but only to the dealers in magic . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended to the dealer and have passed out of the general memory ; and others may simply be extensions of the principle which have been invented by the dealer or his teacher . Again , the public disapproval of nefarious arts will tend first to segregate the followers of such arts from the rest of the community ; and next to foster the notion that the arts thus segregated , and thereby made more or less mysterious , include not only things which the ordinary decent member of society would not do if he could , but also things which he could not do if he would . The mere belief in the possibility of such arts creates an atmosphere of suspicion in which things are believed because they are impossible . When this stage has been reached , when he who // practises nefarious arts is reported and believed to do things which ordinary decent people could not do if they would , his personality inevitably comes to be considered as a factor in the results that he produces ; he is credited with a power to produce them which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not possess . And it is that personal power which eventually comes to be the most important , because the most mysterious , article in his equipment . It is in virtue of that personal power that he is commonly believed to be able to do things which are impossible for the ordinary member of the tribe . Thus far I have been tracing the steps of the process by which the worker of nefarious arts starts by employing for nefarious purposes means which any one could use if he would , and ends by being credited with a power peculiar to himself of working impossibilities . I now wish to point out that a process exactly parallel is simultaneously carried on by which arts beneficent to society are supposed to be evolved . Rain-making may be taken as an art socially beneficial . The modus operandi of rain-making appears in all cases to be based on the principle that like produces like ; and to be in its // nature a process which any one can carry out and which requires no mysterious art to effect and no mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is a proceeding which is beneficial to the tribe as a whole , it is one in which the whole tribe , and no one tribesman in particular , is interested . It must be carried out in the interest of the tribe and by some one who in carrying it out acts for the tribe . The natural representative of the tribe is the head-man of the tribe ; and , though any one might perform the simple actions necessary , and could perform them just as well as the headman , they tend to fall into the hands of the headman ; and in any case the person who performs them performs them as the representative of the tribe . The natural inference comes in course of time to be drawn that he who alone performs them is the man who alone can perform them ; and when that inference is drawn it becomes obvious that his personality , or the power peculiar to him personally , is necessary if rain is to be made , and that the acts and ceremonies through which he goes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or not as efficacious , without his personal agency and mysterious power . Hence the man who works // wonders for his tribe or in the interests of his tribe , in virtue of his personal power , does things which are impossible for the ordinary member of the tribe . Up to this point , in tracing the evolution of magic , we have not found it once necessary to bring in or even to refer to any belief in the existence of spiritual beings of any kind . So far as the necessities of the argument are concerned , the belief in magic might have originated in the way I have described and might have developed on the lines suggested , in a tribe which had never so much as heard of spirits . Of course , as a matter of fact , every tribe in which the belief in magic is found does also believe in the existence of spirits ; animism is a stage of belief lower than which or back of which science does not profess to go . But it is only in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes involved with the belief in spirits . Originally , eating tiger to make you bold , or eating saffron to cure jaundice , was just as matter of fact a proceeding as drinking water to moisten your throat or sitting by a fire to get warm ; like produces like , and beyond that obvious fact it was not necessary to go ? there was no more need to imagine that the action of the saffron was due to a spirit than to imagine // that it was a water spirit which slakes your thirst . The fact seems to be that animism is a savage philosophy which is competent to explain everything when called upon , but that the savage does not spend every moment of his waking life in invoking it : until there is some need to fall back upon it , he goes on treating inanimate things as things which he can utilise for his own purposes without reference to spirits . That is the attitude also of the man who in virtue of his lore or his personal power can produce effects which the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony and the effect follows ? or will follow ? because he knows how to do it or has mysterious personal power to produce the effect . But he consults no spirits ? at any rate in the first instance . Eventually he may do so ; and then magic enters on a further stage in its evolution . ( See Appendix . ) If the man who has the lore or the personal power , and who uses it for nefarious purposes , proposes to employ it on obtaining the same control over spirits as he has over things , his magic reaches a stage of evolution in which it is difficult and practically unnecessary to distinguish it from the stage of fetichism in which the owner of a fetich // applies coercion to make the fetich spirit do what he wishes . With fetichism I deal in another lecture . If , on the other hand , the man who has the lore or the personal power and uses it for social or " communal " purposes ( Haddon , p. 41 ) comes to believe that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of his superior knowledge or superior power , it is necessary to invoke the aid of spirits , he will naturally address himself to the spirit or god who is worshipped by the community because he has at heart the general interests of the community ; or it may be that the spirit who produces such a benefit for the community at large , as rain for example , will take his place among the gods of the community as the rain-god , in virtue of the benefit which he confers upon the community generally . In either case , the attitude of the priest or person who approaches him on behalf of the community will be that which befits a supplicant invoking a favour from a power that has shown favour in the past to the community . And it will not surprise us if we find that the ceremonies which were used for the purpose of rain-making , before rain was recognised as the gift of the gods , continue for a time to be practised as the proper rites with // which to approach the god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then in danger of being misinterpreted by students of the science of religion , for they may be regarded as evidence that religion was evolved out of magic , when in truth they show that religion tends to drive out magic . Thus Dr. Frazer , in his Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship ( pp. 73-75 ) , describes the practice of the New Caledonians who , to promote the growth of taro , " bury in the field certain stones resembling taros , praying to their ancestors at the same time , " and he goes on to say : " In these practices of the New Caledonians the magical efficacy of the stones appears to be deemed insufficient of itself to accomplish the end in view ; it has to be reinforced by the spirits of the dead , whose help is sought by prayer and sacrifice . Thus in New Caledonia sorcery is blent with the worship of the dead ; in other words , magic is combined with religion . If the stones ceased to be employed , and the prayers and sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion would be complete . " Thus it seems to be suggested in these words of Dr. Frazer 's that religion may be evolved out of magic . If that is what is suggested , // then there is little doubt that the suggestion is not borne out by the instance given . Let us concede for the moment what some of us would be inclined to doubt , viz. that prayers and sacrifice offered to a human being , alive or dead , is religion ; and let us enquire whether this form of religion is evolved out of magic . The magic here is quite clear : stones resembling taros are buried in the taro field to promote the growth of taros . That is an application of the principle that like produces like which might be employed by men who had never heard of ancestor worship or of any kind of religion , and who had never uttered prayers or offered sacrifices of any kind . Next , the religious element , according to Dr. Frazer , is also quite clear : it consists in offering sacrifices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are your offerings , in order that the crop of yams may be good . " Now , it is not suggested , even by Dr. Frazer , that this religious element is a form of magic or is in any way developed out of or evolved from magic . On the contrary , if this element is religious ? indeed , whether it be really religious or not ? it is obviously entirely distinct and different from sympathetic or homoeopathic magic . The mere fact that the magical // rite of burying in the taro fields stones which resemble taros has to be supplemented by rites which are , on Dr. Frazer 's own showing , non-magical , shows that the primitive belief in this application of the principle that like produces like was already dying out , and was in process of becoming a mere survival . Suppose that it died out entirely and the rite of burying stones became an unintelligible survival , or was dropped altogether , and suppose that the prayers and sacrifices remained in possession of the field , which would be the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic had died out and its place had been taken by something totally different , viz. religion ; or that what was magic had become religion , that magic and religion are but two manifestations , two stages , in the evolution of the same principle ? The latter statement was formally rejected by Dr. Frazer in the second edition of his Golden Bough , when he declared that he had come to recognise " a fundamental distinction and even opposition of principle between magic and religion " ( Preface , xvi ) . His words , therefore , justify us in assuming that when he speaks , in his Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship , of the " transition from magic to religion , " he can not // mean that magic becomes religion , or that religion is evolved out of magic , for the " distinction and even opposition of principle " between the two is " fundamental . " He can , therefore , only mean that magic is followed and may be driven out by something which is fundamentally opposed to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between magic and religion ? and is it such as to require us to believe with Dr. Frazer that magic preceded religion , and that of two opposite ideas the mind can conceive the one without conceiving ? and rejecting ? the other ? The fundamental opposition between magic and religion I take to be that religion is supposed to promote the interests of the community , and that magic , so far forth as it is nefarious , is condemned by the moral and by the religious feeling of the community . It is the ends for which nefarious magic is used that are condemned , and not the means . The means may be and , as we see , are silly and futile ; and , for intellectual progress , their silliness and futility must be recognised by the intellect . But , it is only when they are used for purposes inimical to the public good that they are // condemned by religion and morality as nefarious . If therefore we talk of a fundamental opposition between magic and religion , we must understand that the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion nor morality condemns the desire to increase the food supply or to promote any other interest of the community . Whether a man uses skill that he has acquired , or personal power , or force of will , matters not , provided he uses it for the general good . The question whether , as a cold matter of fact , the means he uses are efficacious is not one which moral fervour or religious ardour is competent by itself to settle : the cool atmosphere and dry light of reason have rather that function to perform ; and they have to perform it in the case both of means that are used for the general good and of those used against it . I take it therefore that what religion is fundamentally opposed to is magic ? or anything else ? that is used for nefarious purposes . The question then arises whether we have any reason to believe that magic used for nefarious purposes must have existed before religion . Now by nefarious purposes I mean purposes inconsistent with or destructive of the common good . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until there is a community , however small , having common interests and a common good . As soon as there exists such a community , there will be a distinction between actions which promote and actions which are destructive of the common good . The one class will be approved , the other disapproved , of by public opinion . Magic will be approved and disapproved of according as it is or is not used in a way inconsistent with the public good . If there is a spirit or a god who is worshipped by the community because he is believed to be concerned with the good of the community , then he will disapprove of nefarious proceedings whether magical or not . But Dr. Frazer 's position I take to be that no such spirit or god can come to be believed in , unless there has been previously a belief in magic . Now , that argument either is or is not based on the assumption that magic and religion are but two manifestations , two stages , in the evolution of the same principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first as magic subsequently manifests itself as religion ; and " the transition from magic to religion " implies the priority of magic to religion . But , as we have seen , Dr. Frazer U // formally postulates , not an identity , but an " opposition of principle " between the two . We must therefore reject the assumption of an identity of principle ; and accept the " opposition of principle . " But if so , then there must be two principles which are opposed to one another , religion and magic ; and we might urge that line of argument consistently enough to show that there can be no magic save where there is religion to be opposed to it . Now , there is an opposition of principle between magic used for nefarious purposes and religion ; and the opposition is that the one promotes social and the other anti-social purposes . Nefarious purposes , whether worked by magic or by other means , are condemned by religion and are nefarious especially because offensive to the god who has the interests of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies also manifested themselves will not be doubted ; and neither need we doubt that the principle that like produces like was employed from the beginning for social as well as for anti-social purposes . The question is whether , in the stage of animism , the earliest and the lowest stage which science recognises in the evolution of man , there is ever found a society // of human beings which has not appropriated some one or more of the spirits by which all things , on the animistic principle , are worked , to the purposes of the community . No such society has yet been proved to exist ; still less has any a priori proof been produced to show that such a society must have existed . The presumption indeed is rather the other way . Children go through a period of helpless infancy longer than the young of any other creatures ; and could not reach the age of self-help , if the family did not hold together for some years at least . But where there is a family there is a society , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There also , therefore , there are social and anti-social tendencies and purposes ; and , in the animistic stage , the spirits , by which man conceives himself to be surrounded , are either hostile or not hostile to the society , and are accordingly either worshipped or not worshipped by it . Doubtless , even in those early times , the father and the husband conceived himself to be the whole family ; and if that view had its unamiable side ? and it still has ? it also on occasion had the inestimable advantage of sinking self , of self-sacrifice , in defence of the family . I00 COMPARATIVE RELIGION MAGIC Tor Thus far I have been concerned to show how , starting from a principle such as that like produces like , about which there is nothing magical in the eyes either of those who believe in magic or of those who have left the belief behind , man might evolve the conception of magic as being the lore or the personal power which enables a man to do what ordinary people can not do . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief . The first is that the belief is rotten before it is ripe . Those applications of the principle that like produces like which are magical are generally precisely those which are false . The fact that they are false has not prevented them from surviving in countless numbers to the present day . But some suspicion of their falsity in some cases does arise ; and the person who has the most frequent opportunities of discovering their falsity , the person on whose notice the discovery of their falsity is thrust most pointedly , is the person who deals habitually and professionally in magic . Hence , though it is his ' profession to work wonders , he takes care as far as may be not to attempt impossibilities . Thus Dr. Haddon ( l.c. , p. 62 ) found that the men of Murray Island , Torres Straits , who made a " big wind " by magic , only made it in the season of the southeast trade wind . " On my asking , " he says , " whether the ceremony was done in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it in northwest . ' That is , the charm is performed only at that season of the year when the required result is possible ? indeed when it is of normal occurrence . In this , as in other cases , I found that the impossible was never attempted . A rain charm would not be made when there was no expectation of rain coming , or a southeast wind be raised during the wrong season . " The instance thus given to us by Dr. Haddon shows how the belief in magic begins to give way before the scientific observation of fact . The collapse of magic becomes complete when every one sees that the southeast trade wind blows at its appointed time , whether the magic rites are performed or not . In fine , what kills magic regarded as a means for.producing effects is the discovery that it is superfluous , when for instance the desired wind or rain is coming , and futile when it is not . And whereas morality and religion only condemn the end aimed at by magic , and only condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic as a means to any end is superfluous and silly . // Science , however , shows this but slowly ; and if we wish to understand how it is that the belief in the magician 's power has survived for thousands of years down to the present moment amongst numerous peoples , we must remember that his equipment and apparatus are not limited to purely nonsensical notions . On the contrary , in his stock of knowledge , carefully handed down , are many truths and facts not generally known ; and they are the most efficacious articles of his stock in trade . Dr. Frazer may not go farther than his argument requires , but he certainly goes farther than the facts will support him , when he says ( l.c. , p. 83 ) " for it must always be remembered that every single profession and claim put forward by the magician as such is false ; not one of them can be maintained without deception , conscious or unconscious . " If now , in conclusion , we look once more at the subject of magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the missionary , we shall see that there are several conclusions which may be of use to him . In the first place , his attitude to magic will be hostile , and in his hostility to it he will find the best starting-point for his campaign against it to be in the fact that everywhere magic is felt , to a greater // or less extent , to be anti-social , and is condemned both by the moral sentiments and the religious feeling of the community . It is felt to be essentially wicked ; and in warring against it the missionary will be championing the cause of those who know it to be wrong but who simply dare not defy it . The fact that defiance is not ventured on is essential to the continuance of the tyranny ; and what is necessary , if it is to be defied , is an actual concrete example of the fact that when defied it is futile . Next , where magic is practised for social purposes , where it mimics science or religion and survives in virtue of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact superfluous and silly ; and where the natives themselves are beginning to recognise that the magic which is supposed , for instance , to raise the southeast trade wind wo n't act at the wrong season , it should not be difficult to get them to see that it is unnecessary at the right season . The natural process which tends thus to get rid of magic may be accelerated by the sensible missionary ; and some knowledge of science will be found in this , as in other matters , an indispensable part of his training . Finally , the missionary may rest assured in the conviction that his flank will not be turned by the // science of religion . The idea that religion was preceded by and evolved out of magic may have been entertained by some students of the science of religion in the past , and may not yet have been thrown off by all . But it holds no place now in the science of religion . To derive either science or religion from the magic which exists only by mimicking one or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insect which imitates the colour of the leaf whereon it lives precedes and creates the tree which is to support it . FETICHISM THE line of action taken by the missionary at work will , like that of any other practical man , be conditioned , not only by the object which he wishes to attain , but also by the nature of the material on which and with which he has to work . He requires therefore all the information which the science of religion can place at his disposal about the beliefs and practices of those amongst whom his work is cast ; and , if he is to make practical use of that information , he must know not only that certain beliefs and practices do as a matter of fact obtain , he must know also what is their value for his special purpose ? what , if any , are the points about them which have religious value , and can be utilized by him ; and what are those points about them which are obstructive to his purpose , and how best they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give him this estimate of values , to guide him as to the attitude he should assume and the way in which he may utilise or must // attack native practices and beliefs , is the object with which the applied science of religion , when it has been constituted by the action of Hartford Theological Seminary , will address itself . Now , it may seem from the practical point of view of the missionary that with regard to fetichism there can be no question as to what its value is or as to what his attitude should be towards it . But , even if we should ultimately find that fetichism is obstructive to religion , we shall still want to know what hints we can extract from the science of religion as to the best way of cutting at the roots of fetichism ; and therefore it will be necessary to consider what exactly fetichism is . And , as a matter of fact , there is a tendency manifesting itself amongst students of the science of religion to say , as Dr. Haddon says ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetichism is a stage of religious development " ; and amongst writers on the philosophy of religion to take fetichism and treat it , provisionally at any rate , if not as the primitive religion of mankind , then as that form of religion which " we find amongst men at the lowest stage of development known to us " ( Hoffding , Philosophy of Religion , E. T. , ? ? 45 , 46 ) . If , then , fetichism is the primitive religion of // mankind or a stage of religious development , " a basis from which many other modes of religious thought have been developed " ( Haddon , p. 91 ) , it will have a value which the missionary must recognise . And in any case he must know what value , if any , it has . Now , if we are , I will not say to do justice to the view that fetichism is the primitive religion of mankind or a stage from which other modes of religious thought have been developed , but if we are simply to understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat paradoxical to say the least ? that fetichism has no religious value , and yet is the source of all religious values . The inference which may legitimately be drawn from this second view is that all forms of religious thought , having been evolved from this primitive religion of mankind , have precisely the same value as it has ; they do but make explicit what it really was ; the history of religion does but write large and set out at length what was contained in it from the first ; in fetichism we see what from the first religion was , and what at the last religion is . On this view , the source from which all religious values spring is fetichism ; fetichism has no value of any kind , and therefore the Iog COMPARATIVE RELIGION evolved forms of fetichism which we call forms of religion have no value either of any kind . Thus , science ? the science of religion ? is supposed to demonstrate by scientific methods the real nature and the essential character of all religion . Now , the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object and method of science ? a false conception which is slowly but surely disappearing . The object of all science , whether it be physical science or other , whether it be historic science or other , is to establish facts . The object of the historic science of religion is to record the facts of the history of religion in such a way that the accuracy of the record as a record will be disputed by no one qualified to judge the fact . For that purpose , it abstains deliberately and consistently from asking or considering the religious value of any of the facts with which it deals . It has not to consider , and does not consider , what would have been , still less what ought to have been , the course of history , but simply what it was . In this it is following merely the dictates of common sense ; before we can profitably express an opinion on any occurrence , we must know what exactly it was that occurred ; and to learn what occurred we must // divest our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of religion to set aside preconceptions as to whether religion has or has not any value ; and if it does set them aside , that is to say so far as it is scientific , it will end as it began without touching on the question of the value of religion . In fine , it is , and would I think now be generally admitted to be , a misconception of the function of the science of religion to imagine that it does , or can , prove anything as to the truth of religion , one way or the other . There is , however , another error in the reasoning which is directed to show that in fetichism we see what religion was and essentially is . That error consists not only in a false conception of what religion is , ? the man who has himself no religion may be excused if he fails to understand fully what it is , it is based on a misunderstanding of what fetichism is . And so confusion is doubly confounded . The source of that misunderstanding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travels , London , 1814 , XVI , 493 ) , who says : " I once asked a negro with whom I could talk very freely . . . how they celebrated their divine worship , and what number of gods they had ; he , laughing , answered that I had IIo COMPARATIVE RELIGION puzzled him ; and assured me that nobody in the whole country could give me an exact account of it . For , as for my own part , I have a very large number of gods , and doubt not but that others have as many . For any of us being resolved to undertake anything of importance , we first of all search out a god to prosper our designed undertaking ; and going out of doors with the design , take the first creature that presents itself to our eyes , whether dog , cat , or the most contemptible creature in the world for our god ; or , perhaps , instead of that , any inanimate that falls in our way , whether a stone , a piece of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new-chosen god is immediately presented with an offering , which is accompanied by a solemn vow , that if it pleaseth him to prosper our undertakings , for the future we will always worship and esteem him as a god . If our design prove successful , we have discovered a new and assisting god , which is daily presented with a fresh offering ; but if the contrary happen , the new god is rejected as a useless tool , and consequently returns to his primitive estate . We make and break our gods daily , and consequently are the masters and inventors of what we sacrifice to . ' Now , all this was said by the FETICHISM Ill negro , as Bosman himself observed , to " ridicule his own country gods . " And it is not surprising that it should have been , or should be , accepted as a trustworthy description of the earliest form of religion by those who in the highest form can find no more than this negro found in fetichism when he wished to ridicule it . Let us hold over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a form of religion ; and let us enquire how far the account given by Bosman 's negro accords with the facts . First , though there is no doubt that animals are worshipped as gods , and though there is no doubt that the guardian spirits of individuals are chosen , or are supposed to manifest themselves , for example , amongst the North American Indians , in animal form , and that " the first creature that presents itself " to the man seeking the manifestation of his guardian spirit may be taken to be his god , even though it be " the most contemptible creature in the world " ; still students of the science of religion are fairly satisfied that such gods or guardian spirits are not to be confused with fetiches . A fetich is an inanimate or lifeless object , even if it is the feather , claw , bone , eyeball , or any other part of an animal or even of a man . It is as II2 COMPARATIVE RELIGION Bosman 's negro said , " any inanimate that falls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it " is immediately presented with an offering , " and , so long as its owner believes in it , " is daily presented with a fresh offering , " he is stating a fact that is beyond dispute , and which is fully recognised by all students . A typical instance is given by Professor Tylor ( Primitive Culture , II , 158 ) of the owner of a stone which had been taken as a fetich : " He was once going out on important business , but crossing the threshold he trod on this stone and hurt himself . Ha ! ha ! thought he , art thou there ? So he took the stone , and it helped him through his undertaking for days . " When Bosman 's negro further goes on to state that if the fetich is discovered by its owner not to prosper his undertakings , as he expected it to do , " it is rejected as a useless tool , " he makes a statement which is admitted to be true and which , in its truth , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object is not a fetich , he casts it aside as being nothing but the " inanimate " which it is . Bosman 's negro , however , says not that the inanimate but that " the new god is rejected as a useless tool . " That we must take as being but a carelessness of expression ; the evidence of Colonel // Ellis , an observer whose competence is undoubted , is : " Every native with whom I have conversed on the subject has laughed at the possibility of it being supposed that he could worship or offer sacrifice to some such object as a stone , which of itself would be perfectly obvious to his senses was a stone only and nothing more " ( The Tshi-speaking Peoples , p. 192 ) . From these words it follows that the object worshipped as a fetich is a stone ( or whatever it is ) and something more , and that the object " rejected as a useless tool " is a stone ( or whatever it is ) and nothing more . When , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make and break our gods daily , " he is not describing accurately the processes as they are conceived by those who perform them . The fetich worshipper believes that the object which arrests his attention has already the powers which he ascribes to it ; and it is in consequence of that belief that he takes it as his fetich . And it is only when he is convinced that it is not a fetich that he rejects it as a useless tool . But what Bosman 's negro suggests , and apparently intended to suggest , is that the fetich worshipper makes , say , a stone his god , knowing that it is a stone and nothing more ; and that he breaks his fetich believing it to be a god , . I I14 COMPARATIVE RELIGION Thus the worshipper knows that the object is no god when he is worshipping it ; but believes it to be a god when he rejects it as a useless tool . Now that is , consciously or unconsciously , deliberately or not , a misrepresentation of fetichism ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they base themselves who identify religion with fetichism , and then argue thai , as fetichism has no value , religious or reasonable , neither has religion itself . Returning now to the question what fetichism is ? a question which must be answered before we can enquire what religious value it possesses , and whether it can be of any use for the practical purposes of the missionary in his work ? we have now seen that a fetich is not merely an " inanimate , " but something more ; and that an object to become regarded as a fetich must attract the attention of the man who is to adopt it , and must attract the attention of the man when he has business on hand , that is to say when he has some end in view which he desires to attain , or generally when he is in a state of expectancy . The process of choice is one of " natural selection . " Professor Hoffding sees in it " the simplest conceivable construction of religious ideas . The choice is entirely elementary // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the simplest form of a judgment of worth . The object chosen must be ' something or other which is closely bound up with whatever engrosses the mind . It perhaps awakens memories of earlier events in which it was present or cooperative , or else it presents a certain ? perhaps a very distant ? similarity to objects which helped in previous times of need . Or it may be merely the first object which presents itself in a moment of strained expectation . It attracts attention , and is therefore involuntarily associated with what is about to happen , with the possibility of attaining the desired end " ( Philosophy of Religion , E. T. , p. 139 ) . And then Professor Hoffding goes on to say , " In such phenomena as these we encounter religion under the guise of desire . " Now , without denying that there are such things as religious desires ? and holding as we do that religion is the search after God and the yearning of the human heart after Him , " the desire of all nations , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things as religious desires ? yet we must for the moment reserve our decision on the question whether it is in such phenomena I16 COMPARATIVE RELIGION as these that we encounter religious desires , and we must bear in mind that there are desires which are not religious , and that we want to know whether it is in the phenomena of fetichism that we encounter religious desires . That in the phenomena of fetichism we encounter desires other than religious is beyond dispute : the use of a fetich is , as Dr. Nassau says , " to aid the possessor in the accomplishment of some specific wish " ( Fetichism in West Africa , p. 82 ) ; that is , of any specific wish . Now , a fetich is , as we have seen , an inanimate object and something more . What more ? In actual truth , nothing more than the fact that it is " involuntarily associated with what is about to happen , with the possibility of attaining the desired end . " But to the possessor the something more , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely an " inanimate " but also a spirit , or the habitation of a spiritual being . When , however , we reflect that fetichism goes back to the animistic stage of human thought , in which all the things that we term inanimate are believed to be animated by spirits , it is obvious that we require some differentia to mark off those things ( animated by spirits ) which are fetiches from those things ( animated by spirits ) // which are not . And the differentia is , of course , that fetiches are spirits , or objects animated by spirits , which will aid the possessor in the accomplishment of some specific wish , and are thought to be willing so to aid , owing to the fact that by an involuntary association of ideas they become connected in the worshipper 's mind with the possibility of attaining the end he has in view at the moment . To recognise fetichism , then , in its simplest if not in its most primitive form , all we need postulate is animism ? the belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very natural selection which has already been described . At this stage in the history of fetichism it is especially difficult to judge whether the fetich is the spirit or the object animated by the spirit . As Dr. Haddon says ( p. 83 ) , " Just as the human body and soul form one individual , so the material object and its occupying spirit or power form one individual , more vague , perhaps , but still with many attributes distinctively human . It possesses personality and will . . . it possesses most of the human passions , ? anger , revenge , also generosity and gratitude ; it is within reach of influence and may be benevolent , hence to be deprecated and placated , and its aid enlisted . " I18 COMPARATIVE RELIGION A more advanced stage in the history of fetichism is that which is reached by reflection on the fact that a fetich not unfrequently ceases to prosper the undertakings of its possessor in the way he expected it to do . On the principles of animism , everything that is ? whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of spirit , or soul , and body . In the case of man , when he dies , the spirit leaves the body . When , therefore , a fetich ceases to act , the explanation by analogy is that the spirit has left the body , the inanimate , with which it was originally associated ; and when that is the case , then , as we learn from Miss Kingsley ( Travels in West Africa , pp. 304-305 ) , " the little thing you kept the spirit in is no more use now , and only fit to sell to a white man as a big curio . ' The fact that , in native belief , what we call an inanimate thing may lose its soul and become really dead is shown by Miss Kingsley in a passage quoted by Dr. Haddon : " Everything that he , " the native , " knows by means of his senses he regards as a twofold entity ? part spirit , part not spirit , or , as we should say , matter ; the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he holds , is not permanent . He will point out to you a lightning-struck tree , and tell // you its spirit has been broken ; he will tell you when the cooking-pot has been broken , that it has lost its spirit " ( Folk-Lore , VIII , 141 ) . We might safely infer then that as any object may lose its spirit , so too may an object which has been chosen as a fetich ; even if we had not , as we have , direct testimony to the belief . Next , when it is believed that an object may lose its spirit and become dead indeed , there is room and opportunity for the belief to grow that its spirit may pass into some other object : that there may be a transmigration of spirits . And when this belief arises , a fresh stage in the history of fetichism is evolved . And the fresh stage is evolved in accordance with the law that governs the whole evolution of fetichism . That law is that a fetich is an object believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the earliest stage of its history anything which happens to arrest a man 's attention when he is in a state of expectancy " is involuntarily associated with what is about to happen , " and so becomes a fetich . In the most developed stage of fetichism , men are not content to wait until they stumble across a fetich , and when they do so to say , " Ha ! ha ! art thou there ? " Their mental attitude becomes inI20 COMPARATIVE RELIGION terrogative : " Ha ! ha ! where art thou ? " They no longer wait to stumble across a fetich , they proceed to make one ; and for that procedure a belief in the transmigration of spirits is essential . An object , a habitation for the spirit , is prepared ; and he is invited , conjured , or conjured , into it . If he is conjured into it , the attitude of the man who invites him is submissive ; if conjured , the mental attitude of the performer is one of superiority . Colonel Ellis throughout all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of giving possible offence to any superhuman agent " that ( in the region of his observation ) we may well believe that even the makers of fetiches did not assume to command the spirits . But elsewhere , in other regions , it is impossible to doubt but that the owners of fetiches not only conjure the spirits into the objects , but also apply coercion to them when they fail to aid their possessor in the accomplishment of his wishes . That , I take it , is the ultimate stage in the evolution , the fine flower , of fetichism . And it is not religion , it has no value as religion , or rather its value is antireligious . Even if we were to accept as a definition of religion that it is the conciliation of beings conceived to be superior , we should be compelled by // the definition to say that fetichism in its eventual outcome is not religion , for the attitude of the owner towards his fetich is then one of superiority , and his method is , when conciliation fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that fetichism , except in what I have termed its ultimate evolution , is religion and has religious value ; or , to put it otherwise , that what I have represented as the eventual outcome is really a perversion or the decline of fetichism . Then , in the fetichism which is or represents the primitive religion of mankind we meet , according to Professor Hoffding , " religion under the guise of desire . " Now , not all desires are religious ; and the question , which is purely a question of fact , arises whether the desires which fetichism subserves are religious . And in using the word " religious " I will not here place any extravagant meaning on the word ; I will take it in the meaning which would be understood by the community in which the owner of a fetich dwells himself . In the tribes described by Colonel Ellis , for instance , there are worshipped personal gods having proper names ; and the worship is served by duly appointed priests ; and the worshippers consist of a body of I22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such are some of the salient features of what all students of the science of religion would include under the head of the religion of those tribes . Now amongst those same tribes the fetich , or suhman , as it is termed by them , is found ; and there are several features which make a fetich quite distinguishable from any of the gods which are worshipped there . Thus , the fetich has no body of worshippers : it is the private property of its owner , who alone makes offerings to it . Its raison d'etre , its special and only function , is to subserve the private wishes of its owner . In so far as he makes offerings to it he may be called its priest ; but he is not , as in the case of the priests of the gods who are worshipped there , the representative of the community or congregation , for a fetich has no plurality of worshippers ; and none of the priests of the gods will have anything to do with it . Next , " though offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made in private " ( Jevons , History of Religion , p. 165 ) ? there is no public worship ? and " public opinion does not approve of them . " The interests and the desires which the fetich exists to promote are not those of the community : they are antisocial , for , as Colonel Ellis // tells us , " one of the special attributes of a suhman is to procure the death of any person whom its worshipper may wish to have removed " ? indeed " the most important function of the suhman appears to be to work evil against those who have injured or offended its worshipper . " Thus , a very clear distinction exists between the worship of a fetich and the worship of the gods . It is not merely that the fetich is invoked occasionally in aid of antisocial desires : nothing can prevent the worshipper of a god , if the worshipper be bad enough , from praying for that which he ought not to pray for . It is that the gods of the community are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of the community , and that the fetich is there to further desires which are not for the good of the community , ? hence it is that " public opinion does not approve of them . " At another stage of religious evolution , it becomes apparent and is openly pronounced that neither does the god of the community approve of them ; and then fetichism , like the sin of witchcraft , is stamped out more or less . But amongst the tribes who have only reached the point of religious progress attained by the natives of West Africa , public opinion has // only gone so far as to express disapproval , not to declare war . If , then , we are to hold to the view of Professor Hoffding and of Dr. Haddon , that fetichism is in its essence , or was at the beginning , religious in its nature , though it may be perverted into something non-religious or anti-religious , we must at any rate admit that it has become non-religious not only in the case of those fetichists who assume an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also in the earlier stage of evolution when the fetichist preserves an attitude of submission and conciliation towards his fetich , but assumes the attitude only for the purpose of realising desires which are anti-social and recognised to be anti-religious . But , if we take ? as I think we must take ? that line of argument , the conclusion to which it will bring us is fairly clear and is not far off . The differentia or rather that differentia which characteristically marks off the fetich from the god is the nature of the desires which each exists to promote ; the function which each exists to fulfil , the end which is there for each to subserve . But the ends are different . Not only are they different , they are antagonistic . And the process of evolution does // but bring out the antagonism , it does not create it . It was there from the beginning . From the moment there was society , there were desires which could only be realised at the cost and to the loss of society , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society was realised . The assistance of powers other than human might be sought ; and the nature of the power which was sought was determined by the end or purpose for which its aid was employed or invoked ? if for the good of society , it was approved by society ; if not , not . Its function , the end it subserved , determined its value for society ? determined whether public opinion should approve or disapprove of it , whether it was a god of the community or the fetich of an individual . Society can only exist where there is a certain community of purpose among its members ; and can only continue to exist where anti-social tendencies are to some extent suppressed or checked by force of public opinion . Fetichism , then , in its tendency and in its purpose , in the function which it performs and the end at which it aims is not only distinguishable from religion , it is antagonistic to it , from the earliest period of its history to the latest . Religion is social , an I26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , condemned by the community . Public opinion , expressing the moral sentiments of the community as well as its religious feeling , pronounces both moral and religious disapproval of the man who uses a suhman for its special purpose of causing death ? committing murder . Fetichism is offensive to the morality as well as to the religion even of the native . To seek the origin of religion in fetichism is as vain as to seek the origin of morality in the selfish and self-seeking tendencies of man . There is no need to enquire whether fetichism is historically prior to religion , or whether religion is historically prior to fetichism . Man , as long as he has lived in societies , must have had desires which were incompatible with the welfare of the community as well as desires which promoted its welfare . The powers which are supposed to care whether the community fares well are the gods of the community ; and their worship is the religion of the community . The powers which have no such care are not gods , nor is their worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . The essence of fetichism on its external side is that the owner of the fetich alone has access // to it , alone can pray to it , alone can offer sacrifices to it . It is therefore in its inward essence directly destructive of the unity of interests and purposes that society demands and religion promotes . Perhaps it would be going too far to say that the practice of making prayers and offerings to a fetich is borrowed from religious worship : they are the natural and instinctive method of approaching any power which is capable of granting or refusing what we desire . It is the quarter to which they are addressed , and the end for which they are employed , that makes the difference between them . It is the fact that in the one case they are , and in the other are not , addressed to the quarter to which they ought to be addressed , and employed for the end for which they ought to be employed , that makes the difference in religious value between them . If we bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious and moral feelings of the communities in which it exists , we shall not fall into the mistake of regarding fetichism either as the primitive religion of mankind or as a stage of religious development or as " a basis from which many other modes of religious thought have been developed . " I28 COMPARATIVE RELIGION Professor Hoffding , holding that fetichism is the primitive religion , out of which polytheism was developed , adopts Usener 's theory as to the mode of its evolution . " The fetich , " Professor Hoffding says ( p. 14o ) , " is only the provisional and momentary dwelling-place of a spirit . As Hermann Usener has strikingly called it , it is the god of a moment . ' But though Professor Hoffding adopts this definition of a fetich , it is obvious that the course of his argument requires us to understand it as subject to a certain limitation . His argument in effect is that fetichism is not polytheism , but something different , something out of which polytheism was evolved . And the difference is that polytheism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods , but only spirits . Inasmuch then as , on the theory ? whether it is held by Hoffding or by anybody else ? that the spirits of fetichism become the gods of polytheism , there must be differences between the spirits of the one and the gods of the other , let us enquire what the differences are supposed to be . First , there is the statement that a fetich is the " god of a moment , " by which must be meant that the spirits which , so long as they are momentary and // temporary , are fetiches , must come to be permanent if they are to attain to the rank of gods . But on this point Dr. Haddon differs . He is quite clear that a fetich may be worshipped permanently without ceasing to be a fetich . And it is indeed abundantly clear that an object only ceases to be worshipped when its owner is convinced that it is not really a fetich ; as long as he is satisfied that it is a fetich , he continues its cult ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he , and not the rest of the community , has access to it . Next , Hoffding argues that it is from these momentary fetiches that special or specialised deities ? " departmental gods , " as Mr. Andrew Lang has termed them ? arise . And these " specialised divinities constitute an advance on gods of the moment " ( p. 142 ) . Now , what is implied in this argument , what is postulated but not expressed , is that a fetich has only one particular thing which it can do . A departmental god can only do one particular sort of thing , has one specialised function . A departmental god is but a fetich advanced one stage in the hierarchy of divine beings . Therefore the function of the fetich in the first instance was specialised // and limited . But there it is that the a priori argument comes into collision with the actual facts . A fetich , when it presents itself to a man , assists him in the particular business on which he is at the moment engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided that it assists him afterwards and in other matters also . The desires of the owner are not limited , and consequently neither are his expectations ; the business of the fetich is to procure him general prosperity ( Haddon , p. 83 ) . As far as fetiches are concerned , it i ; simply reversing the facts to suppose that it is because one fetich can only do one thing , that many fetiches are picked up . Many objects are picked up on the chance of their proving fetiches , because if the object turns out really to be a fetich it will bring its owner good luck and prosperity generally ? there is no knowing what it may do . But it is only to its owner that it brings prosperity ? not to other people , not to the community , for the community is debarred access to it . The next difference between fetichism and polytheism , according to Hoffding , is that the gods of polytheism have developed that personality which is not indeed absolutely wanting in the spirits of fetichism but can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The transition , " he says , " from momentary and special gods to gods which can properly be called personal is one of the most important transitions in the history of religion . It denotes the transition from animism to polytheism " ( p. 145 ) . And one of the outward signs that the transition has been effected is , as Usener points out with special emphasis , " that only at a certain stage of evolution , i.e. , on the appearance of polytheism , do the gods acquire proper names " ( ib. 147 ) . Now , this argument , I suggest , seeks to make , or to make much of , a difference between fetichism and polytheism which scarcely exists , and so far as it does exist is not the real difference between them . It seeks to minimise , if not to deny , the personality of the fetich , in order to exalt that of the gods of polytheism . And then this difference in degree of personality , this transition from the one degree to the other , is exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of religion . " The question therefore is first whether the difference is so great , and next whether it is the real difference between fetichism and religion in the polytheistic stage . The difference in point of personality between the spirits of fetichism and the gods of polytheism is not // absolute . The fetich , according to Dr. Haddon , " possesses personality and will , it has also many human characters . It possesses most of the human passions , anger , revenge , also generosity and gratitude ; it is within reach of influence and may be benevolent , is hence to be deprecated and placated , and its aid to be enlisted " ( p. 83 ) ; " the fetich is worshipped , prayed to , sacrificed to , and talked with " ( p. 89 ) . But , perhaps it may be said that , though the fetich does " possess personality , " it is only when it has acquired sufficient personality to enjoy a proper name that it becomes a god , or fetichism passes into polytheism . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the evolution of proper names . There was a period in the evolution of the human race when men neither had proper names of their own nor knew their fellows by proper names ; and yet they doubted not their personality . The simple fact is that he who is to receive a name ? whether he be a human being or a spiritual being ? must be there in order to be named . When he is there he may receive a name which has lost all meaning , as proper names at the present day have generally done ; or one which has a meaning . // A mother may address her child as " John " or as " boy , " but , whichever form of address she uses , she has no doubt that the child has a personality . The fact that a fetich has not acquired a proper name is not a proof that it has acquired no personality ; if it can , as Dr. Haddon says it can , be " petted or ill-treated with regard to its past or future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeniable . If it can be " worshipped , prayed to , sacrificed to , talked with , ' ' it is as personal as any deity in a pantheon . If it has no proper name , neither at one time had men themselves . And Hoffding himself seems disinclined to follow Usener on this point : " no important period , " he says ( p. 147 ) , " in the history of religion can begin with an empty word . The word can neither be the beginning nor exist at the beginning . " Finally Hoffding , to enforce the conclusion that polytheism is evolved from fetichism , says : " The influence exerted by worship on the life of religious ideas can find no more striking exemplification than in the word god ' itself : when we study those etymologies of this word which , from the philological point of view , appear most likely to be correct , we find the word really means he to whom sacrifice is made , ' or he who is worshipped " ' ( p. 148 ) . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In that case there would be a relationship between the root of the word gott ' and giessen ' ( to pour ) , as also between the Greek XAM , whose root xu = the Sanskrit hu , from which comes huta , which means sacrificed , ' as well as he to whom sacrifices are made " ' ( p. 396 ) . Now , if " god " means either " he to whom sacrifice is made " or " he who is worshipped , " we have only to enquire by whom the sacrifice is made or the worship paid , according to Professor Hbffding , in order to see the value of this philological argument . A leading difference between a fetich and a god is that sacrifice is made and worship paid to the fetich by its owner , to the god by the community . Now this philological derivation of " god " throws no light whatever on the question by whom the " god " is worshipped ; but the content of the passage which I have quoted shows that Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the worship paid by the community . If that is so , and if the function or a function of the being worshipped is to grant the desires of his worshippers , then the function of the being worshipped by the community is to grant the desires of the community . // And if that is the distinguishing mark or a distinguishing mark of a god , then the worship of a god differs toto caelo from the worship paid to a fetich , whose distinguishing mark is that it is subservient to the anti-social wishes of its owner , and is not worshipped by the community . And it is just as impossible to maintain that a god is evolved out of a fetich as it would be to argue ? indeed it is arguing ? that practices destructive of society or social welfare have only to be pushed far enough and they will prove the salvation of society . If in the animistic stage , when everything that is is worked by spirits , it is possible and desirable for the individual to gain his individual ends by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more desirable for the community to gain the aid of a spirit which will further the ends for the sake of which the community exists . But those ends are not transient or momentary , neither therefore can the spirit who promotes them be a " momentary " god . And if we accept HOding 's description of the simplest and earliest manifestation of the religious spirit as being belief " in a power which cares whether he man has or has not experiences which he values , " we must be careful to make it clear that the // power worshipped by a community is worshipped because he is believed to care that the community should have the experiences which the community values . Having made that stipulation , we may accept H6ffding 's further statement ( p. 147 ) that " even the momentary and special gods implied the existence of a personifying tendency and faculty " ; for , although from our point of view a momentary god is a self-contradictory notion , we are quite willing to agree that this tendency to personification may be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the search after a power essentially personal . But that way of conceiving spiritual powers is not in itself distinctive of or confined to religion : it is an intellectual conception ; it is the essence of animism , and animism is not religion . To say that an emotional element also must be present is true ; but neither will that serve to mark off fetichism from religion . Fetichism also is emotional in tone : it is in hope that the savage picks up the thing that may prove to have the fetich power ; and it is with fear that he recognises his neighbour 's suhman . A god is not merely a power conceived of intellectually and felt emotionally to be a personal power from whom things may // be hoped or feared ; he must indeed be a personal power and be regarded with hope and fear , but it is by a community that he must be so regarded . And the community , in turning to such a power , worships him with sacrifice : a god is indeed he to whom sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose interests and whose morality ? with whose good , in a word , he is from the beginning identified . " In the absence of experience of good as one of the realities of life , no one , " H6ffding says , " would ever have believed in the goodness of the gods " ; and , we may add , it is as interested in and caring for the good of the community that the god of the community is worshipped . It is in the conviction that he does so care , that religious feeling is rooted ; or , as H6ffding puts it ( p. 162 ) , it is rooted in " the need to collect and concentrate ourselves , to resign ourselves , to feel ourselves supported and carried by a power raised above all struggle and opposition and beyond all change . " There we have , implicit from the beginning , that communion with god , or striving thereafter , which is essential to worship . It is faith . It is rest . It is the heart 's desire . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRAYER THE physician , if he is to do his work , must know both a healthy and a diseased body , or organ , when he sees it . He must know the difference between the two and the symptoms both of health and disease . Otherwise he is in danger of trying to cure an organ which is healthy already ? in which case his remedies will simply aggravate the disease . That is obviously true of the physician who seeks to heal the body , and it is equally , if not so obviously , true of the physician who seeks to minister to a mind , or a soul , diseased . Now , the missionary will find that the heathen , to whom he is to minister , have the habit of prayer ; and the question arises , What is to be his attitude towards it ? He can not take up the position that prayer is in itself a habit to be condemned ; he is not there to eradicate the habit , or to uproot the tendency . Neither is he there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise missionary will acknowledge its existence with thankfulness . His business is not to teach his flock to 138 // pray , but how to pray , that is to say , for what and to whom . But even if he thus wisely recognises that prayer is a habit not to be created , but to be trained by him , it is still possible for him to assume rashly that it is simply impossible for a heathen ever to pray for anything that is right , and therefore , that it is a missionary 's duty first to insist that everything for which a savage or barbarian prays must be condemned as essentially irreligious and wicked . In that case , what will such a missionary , if sent to the Khonds of Orissa , say , when he finds them praying thus : " We are ignorant of what it is good to ask for . You know what is good for us . Give it to us ! " ? Can he possibly say to his flock , " All your prayers , all the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hope of salvation lies in ceasing to pray for them " ? If not , then he must recognise the fact that it is possible for the heathen to pray , and to pray for some things that it is right to pray for . And he must not only recognise the fact , but he must utilise it . Nay ! more , he must not only recognise the fact if it chances to force itself upon him , he must go out of his way with the deliberate purpose of finding out what things are prayed for . He will then find himself in I40 COMPARATIVE RELIGION more intimate contact with the soul of the man than he can ever attain to in any other way ; and he may then find that there are other things for which petitions are put up which could not be prayed for save by a man who had a defective or erroneous conception of Him who alone can answer prayer . But it is a blundering , unbusinesslike way of managing things if the missionary has to go out to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out these things for himself ? and perhaps not find them out at all . The applied science of religion should equip him in this respect ; it should be able to take the facts and truths established by the science of religion and apply them to the purposes of the missionary . But it is a striking example of the youth and immaturity of the science of religion that no attempt has yet been made by it to collect the facts , much less to coordinate and state them scientifically . If a thing is clear , when we come to think of it , in the history of religion , it is that the gods are there to be prayed to : man worships them because it is on their knees that all things lie . It is from them that man hopes all things ; it is in prayer that man expresses his hopes and desires . It is from his prayers that we should be able to find out // what the gods really are to whom man prays . What is said about them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reflection , and is in many cases demonstrably different from what is given in consciousness at the moment when man is striving after communion with the Highest . Yet it is from mythology , or from the still more reflective and deliberative expression of ritual , of rites and ceremonies , that the science of religion has sought to infer the nature of the gods man worships . The whole apparatus of religion , rites and ceremonies , sacrifice and altars , nature-worship and polytheism , has been investigated ; the one thing overlooked has been the one thing for the sake of which all the others exist , the prayer in which man 's soul rises , or seeks to rise , to God . The reason given by Professor Tylor ( Primitive Culture , II , 364 ) for this is not that the subject is unimportant , but that it is so simple ; " so simple and familiar , " he says , " is the nature of prayer that its study does not demand that detail of fact and argument which must be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed the case that things which are familiar may appear to be simple ; but it is also the case that sometimes things // are considered simple merely because they are familiar , and not because they are simple . The fact that they are not so simple as every one has assumed comes to be suspected when it is discovered that people take slightly different views of them . Such slightly different views may be detected in this case . Professor Hoffding holds that , in the lowest form in which religion manifests itself , " religion appears under the guise of desire , " thus ranging himself on the side of an opinion mentioned by Professor Tylor ( op. cit. , II , 464 ) that , as regards the religion of the lower culture , in prayer " the accomplishment of desire is asked for , but desire is as yet limited to personal advantage . " Now , starting from this position that prayer is the expression of desire , we have only to ask , whose desire ? that of the individual or that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and familiar phrase of " the accomplishment of desire " there lurks a difference of view which may possibly widen out into a very wide difference of opinion . If we appeal to the facts , we may take as an instance a prayer uttered " in loud uncouth voice of plaintive , piteous tone " by one of the Osages to Wohkonda , // the Master of Life : " Wohkonda , pity me , I am very poor ; give me what I need ; give me success against mine enemies , that I may avenge the death of my friends . May I be able to take scalps , to take horses ! " etc . ( Tylor , II , 365 ) . So on the Gold Coast a negro in the morning will pray , " Heaven ! grant that I may have something to eat this day " ( ib. , 368 ) , not " give us this day our daily bread " ; or , raising his eyes to heaven , he will thus address the god of heaven : " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agries , give me slaves , riches and health , and that I may be brisk and swift ! " ( lb . ) . On the other hand , John Tanner ( Narrative , p. 46 ) relates that when Algonquin Indians were setting out in a fleet of frail bark canoes across Lake Superior , the chief addressed a prayer to the Great Spirit : " You have made this lake ; and you have made us , your children ; you can now cause that the water shall remain smooth while we pass over in safety . " The chief , it will be observed , did not expressly call the Great Spirit " our Father , " but he did speak of himself and his men as " your children . " If we cross over to Africa , again , we find the Masai women praying thus ; and be it observed that though the first person singular is used , // it is used by the chorus of women , and is plural in effect : ? I " My God , to thee alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thee only I invoke each day , 0 morning star in highest heaven . God of the thunder and the rain , Give ear unto my suppliant strain . Lord of the powers of the air , To thee I raise my daily prayer . II " My God , to thee alone I pray , Whose savour is as passing sweet As only choicest herbs display , Thy blessing daily I entreat . Thou hearest when I pray to thee , And listenest in thy clemency . Lord of the powers of the air , To thee I raise my daily prayer . " ? Hor LIs , The Masai , p. 346 . When Professor Tylor says that by the savage " the accomplishment of desire is asked for , but desire is as yet limited to personal advantage , " we must be careful not to infer that the only advantage a savage is capable of praying for is his own selfish advantage . Professor Tylor himself quotes ( II , // 366 ) the following prayer from the war-song of a Delaware : ? " 0 Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife ! Prevent that they shall mourn for me ! Let me succeed in this undertaking , That I may slay my enemy And bring home the tokens of victory To my dear family and my friends That we may rejoice together . . . . Have pity on me and protect my life , And I will bring thee an offering . " Nor is it exclusively for their own personal advantage that the Masai women are concerned when they pray for the safe return of their sons from the wars : ? " 0 thou who gayest , thou to whom we pray For offspring , take not now thy gift away . 0 morning star , that shinest from afar , Bring back our sons in safety from the war . " ? HoLLIs , p. 351 . Nor is it in a purely selfish spirit that the Masai women pray that their warriors may have the advantage over all their enemies : ? 0 God of battles , break L The power of the foe . // Their cattle may we take , Their mightiest lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For triumph o'er the foe . This is the time for prayer Success our arms may know . III " Morning and evening stars That in the heavens glow , Break , as in other wars , The power of the foe . Iv " 0 dweller , where on high Flushes at dawn the snow , 0 Cloud God , break , we cry , The power of the foe . " ? lb. , p. 352 . Again , the rain that is prayed for by the Manganja of Lake Nyassa is an advantage indeed , but one enjoyed by the community and prayed for by the community . They made offerings to the Supreme Deity that he might give them rain , and " the priestess dropped the meal handful by handful on the ground , each time calling in a high-pitched voice , // Hear thou , 0 God , and send rain ! ' and the assembled people responded , clapping their hands softly and intoning ( they always intone their prayers ) , Hear thou , 0 God " ' ( Tylor , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is with the desires of the community that the god of the community is concerned , and that it is by a representative of the community that those desires are offered up in prayer , and that the community may join in . The appeal , to facts shows , also , that an individual may put up individual petitions , as when a Yebu will pray : " God in heaven protect me from sickness and death . God give me happiness and wisdom . " But we may safely infer that the only prayers that the god of the community is expected to harken to are prayers that are consistent with the interests and welfare of the community . From that point of view we must refuse to give more than a guarded assent to the " opinion that prayer appeared in the religion of the lower culture , but that in this its earlier stage it was unethical " ( Tylor , 364 ) . Prayer obviously does appear in the religion of the lower culture , but to say that it there is unethical is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Pro148 COMPARATIVE RELIGION fessor Tylor expresses later on in the words : " It scarcely appears as though any savage prayer , authentically native in its origin , were ever directed to obtain moral goodness or to ask pardon for moral sin " ( p. 373 ) . But it might be misunderstood to mean that among savages it was customary or possible to pray for things recognised by the savage himself as wrong , and condemned by the community at large . In the first place , however , the god of the community simply as being the god of the community would not tolerate such prayers . Next , the range and extent of savage morality is less extensive than it is ? or at any rate than it ought to be ? in our day ; and though we must recognise and at the right time insist upon the difference , that ought not to make us close our eyes to the fact that the savage does pray to do the things which savage morality holds it incumbent on him to do , for instance to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his tribe , to carry out the duty of avenging murder . And if he prays for wealth he also prays for wisdom ; if he prays that his god may deliver him from sickness , that shows he is human rather than that he is a low type of humanity . It would seem , then , that though in religions of low // culture we meet religion under the guise of desire , we also find that religion makes a distinction between desires ; there are desires which may be expressed to the god of the community , and desires which may not . Further , though it is in the heart of a person and an individual that desire must originate , it does not follow that prayer originates in individual desire . To say so , we must assume that the same desire can not possibly originate simultaneously in different persons . But that is a patently erroneous assumption : in time of war , the desire for victory will spring up simultaneously in the hearts of all the tribe ; in time of drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the people ; at the time of the sowing of seed a prayer for " the kindly fruits of the earth " may be uttered by every member of the community . Now it is precisely these desires , which being desires must originate in individual souls , yet being desires of every individual in the community are the desires of the community , that are the desires which take the form of prayer offered by the community or its representative to the god of the community . Antisocial desires can not be expressed by the community or sanctioned by religion . Prayer is the essential // expression of true socialism ; and the spirit which prompts it is and has always been the moving spirit of social progress . Professor Tylor , noticing the " extreme development of mechanical religion , the prayer-mill of the Tibetan Buddhists , " suggests that it " may perhaps lead us to form an opinion of large application in the study of religion and superstition ; namely , that the theory of prayers may explain the origin of charms . Charm-formule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual prayers , and as such are intelligible . Where they are mere verbal forms , producing their effect on nature and man by some unexplained process , may not they or the types they have been modelled on have been originally prayers , since dwindled into mystic sentences ? " ( P. C. II , 372-373 ) . Now , if this suggestion of Professor Tylor 's be correct , it will follow that as charms and spells are degraded survivals of prayer , so magic generally ? of which charms and spells are but one department ? is a degradation of religion . That in many cases charms and spells are survivals of prayer ? formula from which all spirit of religion has entirely evaporated ? all students of the science of religion would now admit . That prayers may // stiffen into traditional formule , and then become vain repetitions which may actually be unintelligible to those who utter them , and so be conceived to have a force which is purely magical and a " nature practically assimilated more or less to that of charms " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied . But when once the truth has been admitted that prayers may pass into spells , the possibility is suggested that it is out of spells that prayer has originated . Mercury raised to a high temperature becomes red precipitate ; and red precipitate exposed to a still greater heat becomes mercury again . Spells may be the origin of prayers , if prayers show a tendency to relapse into spells . That possibility fits in either with the theory that magic preceded religion or still more exactly with the theory that religion simply is magic raised , so to speak , to a higher moral temperature . We have therefore to consider the possibility that the process of evolution has been from spell to prayer ( R. R. Marett , FolkLore XV , 2 , pp. 132 ? 166 ) ; and let us begin the consideration by observing that the reverse passage ? from prayer to spell ? is only possible on the condition that religion evaporates entirely in the process . The prayer does not become a charm until the I52 COMPARATIVE RELIGION religion has disappeared entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no religion is , and out of which consequently no religion can be extracted . If then , per impossibile , it could be demonstrated that there was a period in the history of mankind , when charms and magic existed , and religion was utterly unknown ; if it be argued that the spirit of religion , when at length it breathed upon mankind , transformed spells into prayers ? still all that would then be maintained is that spoken formulae which were spells were followed by other formule which are the very opposite of spells . Must we not , however , go one step further and admit that one and the same form of words may be prayer and religion when breathed in one spirit , and vain repetition and mere magic when uttered in another ? Let us admit that the difference between prayer and spell lies in the difference of the spirit inspiring them ; and then we shall see that the difference is essential , fundamental , as little to be ignored as it is impossible to bridge . The formula used by the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself suffice to show whether it is religious in intent and value . Thus in West Africa the women of Framin dance // and sing , " Our husbands have gone to Ashantee land ; may they sweep their enemies off the face of the earth " ( Frazer , Golden Bough , ' I , 34 ) . We may compare the song sung in time of war by the Masai women : " O God , to whom I pray for offspring , may our children return hither " ( Hollis , p ? 351 ) ; and there seems no reason why , since the Masai song is religious , the Framin song may not be regarded as religious also . But we have to remember that both prayers and spells have a setting of their own : the desires which they express manifest themselves not only in what is said but in what is done ; and , when we enquire what the Framin women do whilst they sing the words quoted above , we find that they dance with brushes in their hands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore suggested that the whole ceremony is magical , that the sweeping is sympathetic magic and the song is a spell . The words explain what the action is intended to effect , just as in New Caledonia when a man has kindled a smoky fire and has performed certain acts , he " invokes his ancestors and says , Sun ! I do this that you may be burning hot , and eat up all the clouds in the sky ' ( Frazer , ib. , 116 ) . Again , amongst the Masai in time of // drought a charm called ol-kora is thrown into a fire ; the old men encircle the fire and sing : ? " God of the rain-cloud , slake our thirst , We know thy far-extending powers , As herdsmen lead their kine to drink , Refresh us with thy cooling showers . " - Horns , p. 348 . If the ol-kora which is thrown into the fire makes it rise in clouds of smoke , resembling the rainclouds which are desired , then here too the ceremony taken as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoken spell . It is true that in this case the ceremony is reenforced by an appeal to a god , just as in the New Caledonian case it is reenforced by an appeal to ancestor worship . But this may be explained as showing that here we have magic and charms being gradually superseded by religion and prayer ; the old formula and the old rite are in process of being suffused by a new spirit , the spirit of religion , which is the very negation and ultimately the destruction of the old spirit of magic . Before accepting this interpretation , however , which is intended to show the priority of magic to religion , we may notice that it is not the only interpretation of which the facts are susceptible . It is // based on the assumption that the words uttered are intended as an explanation of the meaning of the acts performed . If that assumption is correct , then the performer of the ceremony is explaining its meaning and intention to somebody . To whom ? In the case of the New Caledonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Masai old men , to the god . Thus , the religious aspect of the ceremony appears after all to be an essential part of the ceremony , and not a new element in an old rite . And , then , we may consistently argue that the Framin women who sing , " Our husbands have gone to Ashantee land ; may they sweep their enemies off the face of the earth , " are either still conscious that they are addressing a prayer to their native god ; or that , if they are no longer conscious of the fact , they once were , and what was originally prayer has become by vain repetition a mere spell . All this is on the assumption that in these ceremonies , the words are intended to explain the meaning of the acts performed , and therefore to explain it to somebody , peradventure he will understand and grant the performer of the ceremony his heart 's desire . But , as the consequences of the assumption do not favour the theory that prayer must be pre156 COMPARATIVE RELIGION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words explain the meaning of the acts performed . Let us consider the possibility that perhaps the actions which are gone through are meant to explain the words and make them more forcible . It is undeniable that in moments of emotion we express ourselves by gesture and the play of our features as well as by our words ; indeed , in reading a play we are apt to miss the full meaning of the words simply because they are not assisted and interpreted by the actor 's gestures and features . If we take up this position , that the things done are explanatory of the words uttered and reenforce them , then the sweeping which is acted by the Framin women again is not magical ; it simply emphasises the words , " may they sweep their enemies off the face of the earth , " and shows to the power appealed to what it is that is desired . The smoke sent up by the New Caledonian ancestor worshipper or the Masai old men is a way of indicating the clouds which they wish to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kei Islands : " When the warriors have departed , the women return indoors and bring out certain baskets containing fruits and stones . These fruits and stones they anoint and place on a board , // murmuring as they do so , 0 lord sun , moon , let the bullets rebound from our husbands , brothers , betrothed , and other relations , just as raindrops rebound from these objects which are smeared with oil ' " ( Frazer , op. cit. , p. 33 ) . It is , I think , perfectly reasonable to regard the act performed as explanatory of the words uttered and of the thing desired ; the women themselves explain to their lords , the sun and moon , ? with the precision natural to women when explaining what they want , ? exactly how they want the bullets to bounce off , just like raindrops . Dr. Frazer , however , from whom I have quoted this illustration , not having perhaps considered the possibility that the acts performed may be explanatory of the words , is compelled to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anointing stones in order that the bullets may recoil from the men like raindrops from the stones is a piece of pure sympathetic or imitative magic . " He is therefore compelled to suggest that the prayer to the sun is a prayer that he will give effect to the charm , and is perhaps a later addition . But independently of the possibility that the actions performed are explanatory of the words , or rather that words and actions both are intended to make clear to the sun precisely // what the petition is , what tells against Dr. Frazer 's suggestion is that the women want the bullets to bounce off , and it is the power of the god to which they appeal and on which they rely for the fulfilment of their prayer . There is , however , a further consideration which we should perhaps take into account . Man , when he has a desire which he wishes to realise , ? and the whole of our life is spent in trying to realise what we wish , ? takes all the steps which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he has done everything that he can do , he may still feel that nothing is certain in this life , and the thing may not come off . Under those circumstances he may , and often does , pray that success may attend his efforts . Now Dr. Frazer , in the second edition of his Golden Bough , wishing to show that the period of religion was preceded by a non-religious period in the history of mankind , suggests that at first man had no idea that his attempts to realise his desires could fail , and that it was his " tardy recognition " of the fact that led him to religion . This tardy recognition , he says , probably " proceeded very slowly , and required long ages for its more or less perfect accomplishment . For the recognition of man 's powerlessness to influence the course of // nature on a grand scale must have been gradual " ( I , 78 ) . I would suggest , however , that it can not have taken " long ages " for savage man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always come off . It is , I think , going too far to imagine that for long ages man had no idea that his attempts to realise his desires could fail . If religion arises , as Dr. Frazer suggests , when man recognises his own weakness and his own powerlessness , often , to effect what he most desires , then man in his most primitive and most helpless condition must have been most ready to recognise that there were powers other than himself , and to desire , that is to pray for , their assistance . Doubtless it would be at the greater crises , times of pestilence , drought , famine and war , that his prayers would be most insistent ; but it is in the period of savagery that famine is most frequent and drought most to be feared . Against them he takes all the measures known to him , all the practical steps which natural science , as understood by him , can suggest . Now his theory and practice include many things which , though they are in later days regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural means of producing the effects which he desires . But when he has taken all
