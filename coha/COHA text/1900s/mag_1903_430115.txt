 | WHEN , last year , Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan was gathering into his gigantic ocean trust a group of British transatlantic steamship colnpanies , and their veteran officials were glad and proud to become lieutenants of the great American financier , it is said that Mr. Morgan offered to Herr Bailin , director-general of the largest German line , a salary of a million dollars if he would bring the German ships into the combination , and that the stalwart Teuton promptly refused ! This , at least . was the story exultantly told at the time by the German newspapers . It may be true or untrue . ' but it is entirely consistent with the splendid tenacity and devoted patriotism which , in the short space of two decades , have brought the German Empire up from maritime insignificance to its present position as the second sea power of the Old World . The German steamship companies have not gone into Mr. Morgan 's trust . They proved strong enough to say " No " to even his masterful proposition , and to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely intact their Teuton nationality and separate existence and secure all the benefits of the combination without incurring its full responsibilities . Moreover , their example , in building ships of huge size and high speed . has aroused the British GovernA power mighty enough to do this certainly deserves the respectful attention of the American people . How is it that Germany , in the face of the fierce rivalry of Britain , has managed to set her merchant flag afloat on every sea ? This triumph did not immediately follow the consolidation of the German states into the empire . In 1873 , Germany . according to the Bureau Yeritas , had 1,098.816 tons of merchant shipping ; in 1881 , she had gained only to 1,243. - 285 tons . The German Government during this time had permitted what is known as a free ship " policy , ? that is , it had allowed German merchants to build or purchase vessels in foreign countries and place them beneath the German flag . Under this policy , German shipowners procured some steamers in Great Britain and sailing vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the German statesmen and their people that " free ships " only are , as all the rest of the world has found them , absolutely impotent to create a great , active . prosperous merchant marine . Germany had hitherto practised this policy because she could not do otherwise . She had no  | large modern shipyards ; no adequate forces of skilled workmen no means of fabricating the essential iron and steel . As an observer has said , " There were then no machine works of higher character than blacksmith shops in any of the North Sea ports of Bremen , Hamburg , Lubeck , or Stettin . " Even the earlier German ironclads were constructed in British shipyards , and the dependence of the empire upon her great mercantile rival was complete and ignominious . The North German Lloyd and Hamburg-American steamship companies , which in 1880 were mere pygmies as compared with their present magnitude , went to the yards of their British competitors for their steamers , not because they desired to , but because they were forced to , ? they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps toward maritime independence were exactly like those taken a few years later by the United States . She resolved to modernize her navy , and to make her new ships thoroughly German in construction . The Vulcan yard at Stettin was intrusted with the beginnings of this task , and , under liberal and persistent government encouragement , it has done its work so well that it now " builds steel cruisers and battleships not only for the Fatherland , but for . Japan , China . and the republics of South America . " THE NEW DEPARTURE . By the year 1881 , the indomitable patriotism of Bismarck , having compacted the political organization of the empire and established its domestic trade and industry , began to turn toward the sea . In a significant memorial to the German Parliament , Bismarck 's master-mind analyzed the maritime policies of Germany 's near neighbors , Great Britain and France , which were expending millions of dollars upon direct subventions to their great lines of steamships . Bismarck pointed out that Germany was ceasing to be a merely agricultural and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets for her surplus goods were indispensable to her prosperity . She could not gain those markets , he insisted , unless there were German ships to convey German commerce , and there could be no German ships for distant traffic unless the government offered the same protection and encouragement which Britain and France gave to the great steam lines that were the real : backbone of their merchant marine . To this appeal of the great man , who was both brain and soul of the empire in those years , the Reichstag responded with an important measure of maritime legislation , granting a subsidy of 4.100.000 marks ( $1.047,500 ) for a German steamship service to China and Australia . The  | contract for this service was secured for a fifteenyear period by the North German Lloyd Company , of Bremen , which already had a wellestablished steam line to the United States . The North German Lloyd had come into existence in 1857 , following the Hamburg-American Company , which had begun its work ten years earlier with sailing vessels , carrying freight and passengers from Hamburg to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportions by the German immigrant traffic to the United States . which became enormous after 1850 . Prudent management always characterized these enterprises , and in 1881 , when Bismarck began to make his country great upon the ocean , they formed the best part of the German merchant marine . The first of the East India subsidized steamships sailed from Bremerhaven on June 30 , 1886 , amid truly national rejoicing . A wave of enthusiasm for the sea , its trade . and its power now began to roll over the empire from the Baltic to the upper Rhine . This newly aroused maritime patriotism of the German people made itself felt in the terms of the subsidy arrangement . Instead of purchasing its steamers in England or szcotland , the North German Lloyd was now compelled to perform its new service with ships built in Germany by German workmen . and . as far as possible , of German materials . This was made an express condition of the subsidy , and it gave a great impetus to the development of German shipyards . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which for more than a century has limited the privilege of American registry to American-built vessels . There were long - established British and French lines that would have been glad enough to carry German mails and German freight and passengers to Hongkong and Hiogo , to Sydney and Alexandria , that would have cost the German government and people no additional subsidy . But government and people were moved by a profoundly patriotic impulse . They were determined to have their own ships to convey their own goods . and they were not merely willing but eager to make some sacrifice in order to achieve their purpose . At first the patronage of the new imperial steamship service was insufficient to meet the expenses . Just as these fine steam lines to the far East would never have been started without the stimulus of a subsidy , so without the support of that subsidy they would soon have been abandoned . But slowly and surely there came the expansion of German traffic , which Bismarck 's statesmanlike vision had foreseen . In 1888 , the goods transported in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 74.515,000 marks . In 1895. this commerce had risen to 166,575 tons , valued at 160,430,000 marks . In 1887 , Germany 's exports to Asia 310 THE AMERICAN MONTHL Y REVIEW OF REVIEWS .  | and Oceanica were valued at 41,256,000 marks ; in 1896 , they had advanced to 176,246,000 marks , ? a fourfold increase , which far more than repaid the cost of this splendid reenforcement of German commerce and the German mercantile marine . STILL ANOTHER STEP . In May , 1890 , the imperial government took another step in direct encouragement of German trade and shipping by arranging with the North German Lloyd Company for a monthly line of steamers to Zanzibar and South Africa for an annual subsidy of 900,000 marks ( $214 , - 000 ) . In October , 1898 , the successful contract for the Asian and Australian service was renewed for another fifteen-year period , with increased speed , more numerous voyages , and a larger class of steamers . At the same time the imperial subsidy was raised to 5,590,000 marks ( .1,330,420 ) , and the Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . These imperial mail subsidies , though interesting and important , are only one of the agencies by which the German Government has aided the growth of its magnificent merchant fleet . Since 1879 all materials for shipbuilding have been imported free of duty , ? a privilege which , as to ships for foreign trade , has been allowed since 1890 in the United States . The German Government railways have transported steel , iron , lumber , etc. , to the shipyards at the mere cost of handling . This , of course , has had the practical effect of an indirect bounty upon German shipbuilding . In some German states such a bounty seems to have been directly bestowed , for the United States consul at Hamburg declares , in a report to the State Department : In 1891 , the government , upon the suggestion of the Chamber of Commerce , concluded to pay premiums to shipowners for promoting the interests of the merchant marine . Over 10,000,000 marks ( $2,380,000 ) have been paid as premiums for new-built ships , and about the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts in increasing the efficiency of mail carriage by steamships . Nor is this all . As Mr. Frank H. Mason , our able consul-general at Berlin , states in a report to Washington : Not only has the German merchant marine been thus liberally and consistently supported by subsidies of money from the public treasury , but it has been encouraged , applauded , and honored by the entire influence of the imperial government , which in a country like this , where royal favor is so potent and eagerly sought for , is an important element of success . The Emperor is not only an enthusiastic yachtsman and sailor , but he is under all circumstances an ardent and powerful advocate of expansion and improvement of the German fleet and merchant marine . No capitalists or business men are more honored in Germany than those who have contributed to these results . When , in November last , Consul Meier , founder of the North German Lloyd Company , died , in his ninetieth year , the honors bestowed upon his memory were of princely splendor and solemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulgaria from her long , perilous battle with wintry seas , the Emperor 's thanks and medals met him at the gang plank , and he and his men became heroes in the recognition of their government and countrymen . It is not strange that with such a noble spirit  | of devoted patriotism behind it the German steam fleet has increased fourfold in sixteen years , ? has grown more rapidly , in fact . than any other merchant fleet in Christendom . There is a hostile element , it is true , which has fought Germany 's advance upon the sea , but it is a small faction and shrinking . As Consul-General Mason says , , ' There are not lacking conservatives ? mainly Agrarians and socialist reactionaries ? who have opposed this policy , as they oppose improvements in the canals and internal water routes of this country ; but they do not control the policy of Germany , and in all probability never will . " NEW PORTS AND DOCKS . German liberality to merchant shipping is manifest also in the expenditure , since 1 SSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 75,000,000 of this went into the channel and docks of Hamburg alone , and the rest , instead of being wasted on creeks and goose-ponds in the remote interior , was used where every dollar of it counted directly for the enhancement of commerce , ? at Bremen and other genuine ocean ports . Germany has built dry docks for moth the navy and the merchant service . Besides the great . solid masonry structures at Wilhelmshaven and elsewhere , there were twentyseven large floating steel docks in 1900 . German foresight has also provided schools for the training of young seamen , and physicians to guard their health .  | The German policy of maritime protectionism . while a consistent part of the general imperial policy , has , therefore , not been restricted , to subsidies for mail service or bounties for shipbuilding . Indeed , it is doubtless true that the Haulburg-American , the older of the great German steamship companies , has grown until recently with very little aid from direct subventions . This is only a part of the truth , however . The Hamburg-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the aroused maritime ambition of the German people and the favor of the imperial government . It was not until the enforced building of the subsidized North German Lloyd liners in German yards had developed native skill and industry that the HamburgAmerican management saw its way clear to place in Germany a contract for its first thoroughly German ocean greyhound . After the Auyuste Victoria came the I'lh'st Bdm m ; ' e1 . The other great German shipping corporation . the North German Lloyd , also gives marked preference now to home builders . In the first half of the period between 1883 and 189,5 the North German Lloyd spent 31.000,000 marks for shipbuilding in Germany and 36,000,000 marks in Britain . But in the second half of this period 63,000,000 marks were expended in Germany and only 6,000,000 marks in Britain . The privilege of German registry for foreign ships for general commerce has not yet been withdrawn , but the powerful influence of the imperial government is quietly exerted against the practice .

Of steamships of over ten thousand tons launched between 1892 and 1896 , and of over twelve thousand tons launched between 1896 and 1898 , five were British and ten were German . The three ocean monarchs that hold the record between England and New York sail under the imperial ensign . The Iie/se ) . FT'ilhelni deg ( ) osse came out in September . 1,897 , lowering the best time from Southampton by two hours .

The lip /see on her maiden voyage ran at an average speed of 21.29 knots an hour from land to land , covering a 3,050-mile course in 5 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat by two knots the best single day 's run , ? the 562 knots of the Lceuniu . This superb North German Lloyd ship came from the Vulcan yard . at Stettin , which had been developed into a great plant by the construction of the China and Australian liners . Prince Hohenlohe 's report to the Reichstag stated , " All experts assert that without the influence of the government mail service ( the North German Lloyd subsidies ) such a steamer as the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse could not have been built . " But the Kaiser Wilhelm did not long remain the champion of the North Atlantic . The same Vulcan yard at Stettin launched , on January 10 , 1900. a still greater and swifter steamship for the Hamburg-American New York service , the celebrated Deutschland . This leviathan is 686 feet long , or 38 feet longer than the Kaiser Wilhelm , with a tonnage of 16,200. and a horse-power of 35,000 . In August , 1900 , the Deutschland ran from New York to Plymouth , England , in 5 days , 11 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 hours , and 6 minutes from New York to Queenstown . In this passage , extraordinary for so new a ship , the Deutschland ran from land to land at an average speed of 23.32 knots an hour . The best record thus far made eastward by the Kecc , - Wilhelm had been 22.79 knots an hour . In September , 1901 , a third German champion appeared ? the Keonpi'inz Il illrelin. of the North German Lloyd service . It is significant that the very names of these huge vessels bespeak the intense German national pride in the country 's merchant shipping . The Kronprinz Wilhelm . is larger than the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse , but smaller than the Deutschland . She is 663 feet long , 66 feet wide , and 43 feet deep , with a tonnage of 14,800 and a horse-power of about 30,000 . This new-coiner has , for the time being , wrested the supremacy from the Deutschland . Like the imperial mail liners , and her two giant rivals in the Atlantic trade , the Kronprinz 1171-helm , was launched from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion appears , also from the famous Vulcan yard. ? the Kaiser Wilhelm , IL , of the North German Lloyd Company . 706 ; feet long . 72 feet wide , and 52 feet deep . larger still than the Deutschland and Kron1 , rinz 11'ilhelm , and intended to be even swifter . She will make her first voyage from Bremen to New York in the early spring . The great German passenger ships are not , however , all record breakers . Both the North . German Lloyd and the Hamhhurg-American possess large new ships of great cargo capacity and moderate speed , of which the Grosser Iirrf'artt , 15 knots and 13,000 tons , and the Graf 11Talelersee , 13j-T knots and 13,000 tons , are good examples , ? fine , useful steamers of a type more profitable , doubtless . in the long run than the coal-hungry ocean greyhounds . WAGES LOW , SKILL HIGH . Although the North German Lloyd and , to a much less degree , the Hamburg-American Com- pany are liberally subsidized for their new East India service , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large direct subventions for their express service between Germany and New York , where they have been long established , and are so strong as to defy competition . The German mail pay for this service to the North German Lloyd in the fiscal year 1900 was $120,982 to the HamburgAmerican , . $52,948 . Our own government in the same year gave for carrying eastward mails $100,823 to the former and $35,18i to the latter company . The German North Atlantic subvention is considerably less than the sum paid 1 ) y the united States to the American and by Great Britain to the Cunard and White Star lines . However , in one other point the German companies have an important practical advantage . ? that is , in the cost of manning and maintaining their steamers . The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse , for instance , is a very much larger and somewhat swifter ship than the American liner St. Louis . The German has more passenger and freight room , and , therefore , a greater actual earning capacity . But the 500 officers and men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages , while the 380 officers and men of the smaller St. Louis receive $11,306 . The American rate of pay . which is fixed by the rate in the absolutely protected coastwise trade , and by the requirement that at least 50 per cent . of the crew of a mail ship shall be American citizens , is as near as may he twice the German average . Thus the chief officer of the St. Louis earns $120 a month ; the chief officer of the Wilhelm der Grosse , $66.64 . Able seamen on the St. Louis earn $25 a month ; on the Kaiser , $14.75 . Firemen on the American liner earn $40 a month . and trimmers $30 ; firemen on the German liner earn from $16.66 to $21.42 ; trimmers , from $13.09 to $15.47 . Yet the great German steamer. even with these low wages . is well manned and skillfully handled . That is undoubtedly one secret of Germany 's swift advance in mercantile sea power , ? the possession of labor which is cheap . intelligent , and efficient . This advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scandinavia in a still more marked degree , and they have made no such progress upon the ocean . Scandinavian sailors man the fleets of halt the world , but not one first-class steamship line flies the flag of Norway or of Sweden , and a large part of the steam ' ' tramps " and sailing craft that do wear Scandinavian colors are really British-owned . The main influences which have given Germany the second greatest merchant fleet in Europe are the patriotism of her people and the wise and persistent efforts of her government . 316 THE AMERICAN MONTH ,  | In shipyards and on shipboard German wages for skilled labor are not merely lower than American wages , but British wages as well . It costs $9,891 a month to man the White Star Oceanic , as compared with the $7,715 of the faster Kaiser Wilhelm .
