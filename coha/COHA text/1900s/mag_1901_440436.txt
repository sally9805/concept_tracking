to understated Mr. McKinley as President you must understand him as a man . This seems easy , since he has lived so simply and so openly . But , on the contrary , it is hard , because , more than most Presidents , Mr. McKinley has been at once misunderstood and successfully misrepresented . Like all his predecessors , he is neither the saint that his friends , nor the sinner that his enemies , have painted ; but , unlike most of his predecessors , he has been made to appear , partly by friends and partly by enemies , very different from the man he really is . Nothing illustrates the popular misunderstanding of Mr. McKinley more than the astounding delusion , entertained by seine Republicans as well as by many Democrats who do not know him , that he is , and has been ever since 18945 , more or less under the influence of Senator Hanna . Tins sums up , in a way that is as unjust as it is picturesque , all the notions to the effect that Mr. McKinley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even opinions , that can not be changed at the command of a stronger man . Newspaper cartoons , which now have more influ ence than newspaper editorials , are largely responsible for these strange beliefs , but they have been fostered by uninformed editors and politicians misled by deceptive appearances and by malice . It is interesting to see how ignorance alone misleads writers about President McKinley who are friendly to him , as when they speak of him as " stolid and solemn " because they have only seen his manner in public , when the fact is that be is a man of humor , who enjoys even the cartoons at his own expense , and is as fond of good jokes , and as apt at telling them , as Abraham Lincoln . Remembering the fate of public men who have clone otherwise , Mr. McKinley has kept his wit and humor for private conversation , and thus , naturally enough , has been accused of leaving none . These writers would probably be unwilling to believe that Mr. hIcKinley was is constant reader of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found recreation in the humorists of the Civil War . As it takes more faith to he an infidel than a believer , no it takes more credulity to believe in the McKinley of fiction than in the McKinley of fact . It 300 Mr. McKinley as President . scorns incredible that intelligent and educated men and women should be able to believe , even on the authority of both newspaper cartoons and editorials , that the man who has done what Mr. McKinley has done could be under the domination of any other man . Even after taking from President McKinley all the achievements of his administration that can possibly be credited to others , it most be admitted that he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors , with possibly one or two exceptions , in what he has clearly done himself . From such work it ought to be easy to infer the workman . At all events , the only way to understand President McKinley 's first administration is to recognize the fact that it was his administration . There is no doubt about this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , and all the characters in it are rightly appreciated because thoroughly understood . If it be said that Washington is friendly to Mr. McKinley , it can be said that Washington is familiar with Mr. McKinley . He has had to meet the disadvantage that the prophet finds proverbially in his own country and in his own house ; for he has lived in Washington for almost a quarter of a century , and has grown steadily into larger powers before the eyes of many men who remember what he was when he first came to the House of Representatives . He has had to live down that familiarity which , in the beginning of a career , is still apt to breed contempt . It has been hard to do this , just as it has been hard to take command of men who were his commanders when he first appeared in public life . But to make himself the acknowledged leader under these circumstances means more than if he had gained the place by coming first to Washington with the prestige and authority of a President elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personal man- ner , which has had so much to do with his success , has had quite as much to do with the misunderstanding of him . The expression of a kindly and equable nature governed by the moderation and patience suggested by the crest of his Scotch ancestors , an olive branch clasped in a mailed hand , with the motto " Not too much , " its strength failed to impress those who think that brusqueness and bluster and bragging are the necessary signs of power . " A very parfit gentil knyghte " is to many people a weakling simply because he is gentle , and they have had to know Mr. McKinley well to appraise him properly . Even close acquaintance has not helped those of op. posite qualities to appreciate him . His " suaviter et fortiter " is one of the secrets of his success in making his way to the headship of his party , through the ranks of his colleagues , without alienating any considerable number of them , and without making personal enemies of any of his political opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Cabinet , which has contained such a large proportion of strong men , with Senators and Representatives of all parties , and with public men generally . Mr. McKinley has had his own way more than most party leaders , more than most of his predecessors in the White House . But he has had it in his own way . Always tactful , serene , patient , modest in manner , never sounding a trumpet of announcement or indulging in noisy threatenings or complaining recriminations , he has not had credit for his courage , persistence , and determination . He has cared more for real success than for making people think that he would have it or had won it . Now , most men are still children who are impressed by appearances . They like to be told , even by the President himself , that Ile is doing or going to do great things , especially if , as in the case of Andrew Jackson , he publicly defies some enemy , or talks contemptuously of the coordinate branches of the government . Most Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court , about whose powers and functions they know very little ; and they are rather pleased than otherwise when he acts as though he agreed with this opinion . Even if such a President actually fails to accomplish , perhaps because of a bellicose and blustering manner , any real , substantial success in the way of legislation or diplomatic negotiations ; even if he is destructive rather than constructive , and leaves the country and his party worse off than when he became President , he nosy remain a hero indefinitely to many people . Not only is Mr. McKinley 's manner different from that of the Presidents that such men admire , but his theory of the presidency is equally different . Trained as he was , ahnost from his youth up , in the House of Representatives , intimately acquainted with all the phases of Congress and deeply imbued with its spirit , while possessed of the friendship of most of its leaders of his time , it was very natural that he should consider it entitled to its full constitutional powers and duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute equality with the President of the United States . Mr. Garfield was the only President of our time , except Mr. McKinley , who came to the White House after such an experience at the Capitol , and Inc had precisely the same theory of the relations between the President and Congress . According to this theory , Congress ought not to dominate the President , the President ought not to dominate Congress , but they should cooperate as far as practicable for the good of the country . As human nature is very much the same in Congress as in a stock exchange , a church convention , or a newspaper office , the President who deals with Congress tactfully and courteously will , in the long run , get more of what he wants than the President who does not do so . He may not get so much credit for what he does gain , from tissue people who like to see a President fight Congress , especially in that flattering way which consists in appealing to them to make Congress do what the President wants done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country appears most clearly in the sayings and doings of the people who want " a strong man in the White House , " who shall show his strength by fighting the Senators and Representatives , who have been chosen quite as directly by the popular voice as he has . They like an arrogant egotism in the President , and would be quite willing to have him dominate Congress all the time , and the Supreme Court part of the time . They think the President is very much more likely to be right , and certainly more nearly represents the popular will , or at least what the popular will ought to be , than the other two branches of the government , and that he ought to fight as hard to get what Ile wants in legislation as to protect the executive prerogatives from encroachment . What they want , apparently , is a President who shall be the whole government , as in Mexico . President McKinley had the point of view of Congress before he took the point of view of the President . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic , and as representative of the people as he is , and that , individually , there may be men in both houses who would be able to take his place at short notice , without detriment to the country . He remembers , too , how he looked at the President when he was a member of the House , and how what the President said and did affected him . It is , therefore , comparatively easy for him to practice the Golden Rule in dealings with Congress as in dealings with others . By treating Senators and Representatives , collectively and individually , in this deleted material // opportunity came to him Mr. McKinley was ready for it , and he had patience to wait for the opportunity . He might have been nominated for the presidency at Chicago , in the Republican National Convention of 1888 , had ho been willing to desert John Sherman , who could not be nominated , but whom McKinley , as a member of the Ohio delegation , load been instructed to support . He was the most popular man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the hall . After live ballots had shown that none of the candidates had a majority , on the sixth ballot one vote was cast for William McKinley , and this was cheered by two thirds of the convention . Seventeen votes were cast for him by the next state called ; and while the convention was cheering for him , and it seemed evident that it would nominate him , lie sprang upon a chair and stopped it all by an appeal , or rather a demand , " that no delegate who would not cast reflection upon me shall cast a ballot for Inc . I can not , " said Mr. McKinley to the convention , " I can not , consistently with the wish of the state whose credentials I hear , and which has trusted use ; I can not , consistently with my own views of personal integrity , consent , or seem to consent , to permit my name to be used as a candidate before this convention . I would not respect myself if I could find it in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could even be ground for any one to suspect that I wavered in my loyalty to Ohio , or my devotion to the chief of her choice and the chief of mine . " And on the seventh ballet Benjamin Harrison was nominated . Four years later Mr. McKinley was tested again , while presiding as chairman of the Republican National Convention at Minneapolis , where he load gone to advocate the renomination of President Harrison . The anti-Harrison managers , without consulting Mr. McKinley , sought to unite a majority of the convention in his support , and were apparently succeeding . They had induced the Ohio delegation , of which he was a member , to vote for him . Front the chair Mr. McKinley challenged the announcement of the Ohio vote , and demanded , as a member of the delegation , that its roll should be called . Upon this poll of the delegation , his alternate , under his instructions , voted for Benjamin Harrison , while all the other votes were cast for Mr. McKinley ; but Mr. McKinley 's action prevented the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received 182 votes , Mr. Harrison was renominated on that ballot . When the fullness of time for his nomination came , at St. Louis , in 1896 , he received the nomination on the first ballot with 664 votes , 84 being cast for Thomas B. Reed , 61 for M. S. Quay , 58 for Levi P. Morton , and 35k for William B. Allison . In 1900 he was nominated before the convention met at Philadelphia , by the voice of his party , and , when the roll was called , received the votes of all the 926 delegates . All this time Mr. McKinley had been broadening and deepening in mind and heart . All this time , through prosperity and adversity , public and private , he had been getting a stronger and wider grip upon the majority of his countrymen . The McKinley tariff bill of 1890 , although he was not entirely responsible for it , retired him from Congress , but made him governor of Ohio , and eventually President of the United States . There was nothing accidental in it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution under favoring circumstances . It was the old story of an American country boy 's success through steady and deserved promotion , without wealth , or a college education , or high social position too aid or hindrance . At fifty - three , ripened and enriched intellectually , lie was elected President of the United States as though 304 Mr. McKinley as President . by inevitable logic . He was ready for his great task . How great it was to be neither he nor any one else could have imagined then . Few seriously thought that the United States was in danger of war with Spain , and even those who thought war possible did not conceive the extent and character of its consequences . Mr. McKinley was elected , as he thought , and as almost everybody else in his party thought , to substitute on the statute books , in cooperation with the Republican Congress elected at the same time , a modification of the McKinley tariff bill for the Wilson-Gorman tariff law , and thus to restore the prosperity which had for some reason disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the enactment of a law for the maintenance of the existing gold standard , and to remedy the defects in the Treasury system which , under the conditions of the former administration , had compelled it to issue two hundred and thirty million dollars in new bonds , and at the same time to make a last effort to secure an agreement on " international bimetallism . " To accomplish these things was felt to be enough for one administration , with the minor matters which naturally would be disposed of besides . If the Cuban question , with all its consequences , could have been postponed for four years , and if the Chinese question , with all its consequences , had not arisen , Mr. McKinley could still have pointed , at the end of his first administration , to a record of work accomplished that would have been extremely creditable . The Fifty-Fifth Congress , on Isis recommendation and under his inspiration , passed the Dingley tariff law to take the place of the Wilson-Gorman law , at the extra session which he called promptly after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under his inspiration , passed the law to maintain the gold standard , to provide for refunding at two per cent , the lowest rate of interest ever paid by the United States government , and to extend the national banking system to small towns . These two measures ht themselves would make a very respectable showing for an administration in time of peace . While neither the President nor Congress can make prosperity to order , they can make conditions which are favorable or unfavorable to it . The Wilson-Gorman act , which was consid. erect to be so largely a protectionist measure that President Cleveland allowed it to become law only against his pi.otest , did not yield sufficient revenue , because the Supreme Court annulled its provision for an income tax ; and this kept the " endless chain " going which drew the gold out of the Treasury , and compelled the issue of bonds to put more gold in the Treasury , since there was no law to protect the gold reserve necessary to maintain the gold standard . Following close on the commercial panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , and so the return of prosperity . Sentiment , as usual , played a large part in the matter , President McKinley , who was nominated chiefly because of his record on the tariff question , and elected largely because of his position on the money questions , stood , after his victory at the polls , as the prophet of " good times , " and the long-desired confidence began to return before he was inaugurated . Redeeming his pledges in the order in which it could be best clone , as well as in the order of making them , President McKinley first secured the necessary revenue , and at the same time satisfied the sentimental desire for a Republican tariff . He knew that that could be had quickly and easily , compared with any measure for the improvement of the financial system , in view of the differences over remedies for its ills which compelled delay and discussion . The drain of the Treasury gold was stopped , no that there was time to consider what // shmdd be and what could be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency system . By the time Congress met in regular session the President was ready with his recommendation , which , postponing all the more elaborate and experimental projects of " currency reform , " provided the plan on which the gold standard act of 1900 was built , ? of keeping United States notes redeemed in gold at the Treasury , to be paid out again only in exeluinge for gold . The President 's wisdom in pressing the tariff bill ahead of the currency refocus measure was shown by the fact that Congress could not agree upon a financial bill , and he had to wait until the first session of the next Congress for the law he desired . By that time , good crops , and a demand for them , and for an unparalleled amount of our manufactures , abroad , besides the extraordinary demand at home , caused by the Spanish War , had reversed the conditions of the former administration , so that gold was pouring into the Treasury . After the law was passed , this influx of gold continued until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . In inducing Congress to pass these two important acts President McKinley showed over and over again his tact and skill and courage , and utilized his friendly relations with Senators and Representatives of the opposition , as well as of his own party , to the utmost advantage . In this work , as in all his dealings with Congress , President McKinley showed little care for getting the credit of what was done , compared with his great desire to secure results and maintain harmony . This way of thinking came out constantly in his unwillingness to exercise the veto power , which , he thought , ought to be reserved for rare occasions ; preferring to point out privately his objections to bills before or after they came to him , so that their sponsors might correct them by amendments or new legislation , without having to untxxxvIr. // deleted material // cooperation of Great Britain , and secured the absolute neutrality , and therefore the absolute protection , of such a canal when built , since the other Powers were known to be ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to the Senate on the eve of the presidential campaign , and side-tracked by Republican Senators upon Democratic criticism because it had not reserved the right to the United States to close the canal against an enemy in time of war . It was pressed , however , in the next session of Congress , only to be so amended as to provide for an exclusively United States canal before it was ratified . The attempt which the President made through the Wolcott Commission to secure an international agreement on bimetallism failed , as was inevitable in view of the conditions ; but its very failure helped the gold standard movement . President McKinley 's personal qualities make him most successful in the performance of all the social functions of his office , formal and informal . President Arthur , hitherto unexcelled among modern Presidents in charm and courtesy to callers and guests , has been surpassed by President McKinley . ' ' I ran into a bank of roses , " said a Senator who went angrily to the White House to ask the removal of a Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to complete his request : and this sums up in a striking way the experiences of all those who talk with the President . He likes to please . He would rather say yes than no , although he says no firmly enough whenever it is absolutely necessary to deny a request , but he always makes his visitor feel his desire to gratify him . Although he has never been a society man , he has performed the duties of entertaining at dinners and receptions ? whirls are so much more important than they seem outside of Washington ? in a most acceptable manner . His kindness and thoughtfulness have appeared in number less personal courtesies to those in special joy or special sorrow , which have given him a personal place in Washington such as no other President has ever had . All this , and much more of a minor character , would have made an enviable record for President McKinley in his first administration , if there had been no Spanish War or Chinese upheaval . The war with Spain , which President McKinley did everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of his life , and the one that he best improved . In it he lifted his administration to the plane of those of Washington and Lincoln , and linked his name with theirs for our time , if not for all time , as the liberator of millions from the yoke of Spain . The country wanted war , but was not prepared for it ; the President did not want it , lint was prepared for it when it came . Throughout the war he was not only the actual commander in chief , but the director of our diplomacy . The story of the United States in the summer of 1808 is as dramatic and as brilliant and as glorious as any that history tells . Spain was expelled from her last strongholds in the West Indies and in the East Indies , and shut up in the home peninsula ; the islands she had misgoverned carne under our flag ; the United States , as the champion of the millions whom Spain had oppressed , came out of her isolation , and received recognition from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other man , " ' This was my work , " while , with characteristic modesty , thoughtfulness , and generosity , he was praising and thanking other men , all of whom did not deserve to be so praised and thanked . The suddenness and completeness of our achievement won the admiration of the world . Its consequences made no ass active instead of a passive world power , and gave us new duties and responsibilities , which we may regret , but could not honorably avoid . deleted material // ers , and left him only the alternative of guiding it into the best expression , or of being swept aside by it . When he saw that there was nothing left but this ( ilioire , by choosing quickly and acting calmly and courageously , he was able to prevent a formal declaration of war at the first , and any official recognition of the paper republic of Cuba , with all the embarrassing consequences which that would have entailed . He also kept the full direction of the war , and was able to bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealings with other countries . After the explosion of the Maine , the President was preparing , through the State , War , and Navy departments , for the conflict that seemed likely to come . Through the State Department he was making our position clear to foreign nations , trying to conciliate their friendship , and getting valuable information about their intentions . Through the War and Navy departments , especially the latter , he was doing all that could be done to get the army and navy into a state of readiness . Both were very far from being ready , ? a fact which the men and the newspapers who were advocating the war-making measure of recognizing the independence of the republic of Cuba probably did not realize . At last the verdict of the Court of inquiry came , and its significant con-elusion , although it did not hold the Spanish government or any Spaniard responsible , confirmed in most American minds the suspicion that the Maine bad been blown up by Spanish agencies . All that President McKinley could do then was to delay the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better prepared fur it , with the faint hope that , in the interval , Spain might come to a better understanding with the Cubans by agreeing to give up the island . He has been criticised because he did not hold out longer against the demand for war , but those who were in Washington at the time can see no justice in this criticism . Spain prevented him from doing so by characteristic procrastination and persistence in a fatuous course . Congress , which had shown its confidence in the President by the unprecedented action of giving him fifty million dollars to spend in his own discretion for " the national defense , " remained on good terms with him ; but with almost unanimous voice , all the Democrats and the majority of the Republicans being openly in favor of war with Spain , it insistent that he should cut short the negotiations which he was still carrying on , and recommend war . Speaker Reed could not restrain the Republicans of the House . One by one the conservative men in the Cabinet and Congress who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobart , his most trusted counselor , joined more or less strongly in the general demand . No President with less personal influence could have held Congress back so long . Finally , when he could do no more , and there was /to hope of accomplishing anything by further resistance , he recommended armed intervention , after a last appeal to Spain ; and Congress , under the guidance of his counsels authorizing this , refused to recognize the republic of Cuba , but promised that We would make Cuba independent . Spain responded by breaking off diplomatic relations , and the war was on . Its striking events are so fresh in the public mind that they need not be rehearsed . President McKinley played the same part that President Lincoln played in the Civil War , night and day , sometimes all night and day , from the " war room " in the White House . The War Department , with a Secretary chosen with no thought of war , an antiquated bureau system , and some inefficient officials among many who were highly efficient , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and no one regretted more than Ile any ill consequences that followed , or made 310 Mr. McKinley us President . more allowance for them . He could find compensation for whatever was lacking in the War Department in the almost faultless administration of the Navy Department , which shone the more by contrast . At the head of the State Department , after the war began , he had his closest personal friend and most trusted adviser , William R. Day ; and in their administration of its affairs no real mistakes have been discovered , although there was some criticism at the time . When the inner history of that war comes to be written , it will be seen that the administration 's achievements in diplomacy were more remarkable than its achievements on the sea or in the field . The way in which the invaluable moral aid of Great Britain was secured , when all other Powers were indifferent or unfriendly to us , and still regarded us as a second or third class power , and the way in which they were later brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cultivate our friendship , made a wonderful impression upon the world . President McKinley , who seemed to overlook nothing , made the war the occasion for establishing more firmly the most enlightened rules of naval warfare , and thus incidentally conferred a lasting benefit on all maritime nations . It was by the administration 's diplomacy that the war was brought so quickly to an end ; for Spain would have dragged it on indefinitely , in spite of her defeats , if it had not been for the pressure brought upon her , through France , by the other Powers to end what had become a trying and even dangerous situation to most of them , with the threat looming large before their imaginations that the United States , for the first time , would invade Europe by attacking the Spanish coast . President McKinley made peace in the courteous and clement fashion characteristic of him , and with such acknowledgments to France and her representatives as furnished recognition for their timely assistance , and drew our ancient ally back to us , with her modern ally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending Admiral Dewey to capture or destroy the Spanish fleet in the Philippines , had no intention of acquiring that archipelago for the United States . He merely sought to make war most effectively on Spain . Nor , when Admiral Dewey , having no other port open to him in that part of the world , and having shattered the only sovereignty there was in the Philippines , remained in Manila harbor , was there any intention on the part of the Presi ? dent to take even the city of Manila as a permanent possession . The Philippines had not been in his scheme of action any more than they had been in the thought of the country . It was a providence , or an accident , according to the point of view , that the most striking victory of the war came at the most unexpected point and time , and with the most unexpected consequences . But events marched fast from May until September , when Secretary Day and the other members of the Peace Commission went to Paris to negotiate the treaty of peace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident that , for our own intones ; in the East , and for the protection of those who had trusted us in particular , and of all the inhabitants of the Philip . pines in general , we must remain in the archipelago . Upon this principle , the cession of the entire archipelago was obtained in the treaty of peace concluded on December 10 , 1898 ; the United States agreeing to pay Spain twenty million dollars , and the treaty providing that " the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined by the Congress . " Proclamation was hu ? mediately made by our representatives in the Philippines that the authority thus obtained by the United States would he used only for the protection and benefit of the natives ; that " we come , not as // hivadersor conquerors , but as friends ; " and every effort was made to impress this ripen the people . The President has been more severely criticised for taking the Philippines than for any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his political opponents generally , but many of his OW11 party , have contended that he ought not to have done so , although they have not agreed as to what he should have done . It is a matter of fact that the treaty of peace , carrying the title to the Philippines , was ratified by the two-thirds vote of the Serrate on the 6th of February , 1899 , and the twenty million dollars promised to Spain was immediately appropriated by large majorities ill both houses of Congress ; and neither of these things could have been accomplished except by the leave of those who differed from the President . And Congress has left the whole matter to the President ever since . The President , it should be said , has been criticised also , though less severely , by those who thought that he ought to have prevented the insurrection by having the leaders apprehended before they were ready to strike , instead of allowing them to obtain advantage of his policy of conciliation . To this the reply is that until the treaty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun , he could not honorably do anything in the Philippines but what he did do , to say nothing of his desire to win the affection of the people . In this effort lie has spared no pains . He sent first the Schurman Commission , and then the Taft Commission , to treat with the natives , with a view to convincing them of our good intentions , and setting up suitable local and general governments for them , offering amnesty and even reward to armed insurgents ; and those efforts are gradually producing the result desired . The President has constantly emphasized the difference between Aguinaldo and his associates of the Tagal tribe , and the people of the other eighty tribes of the archipelago ; justly holding the former responsible for the insurrection , and believing that the latter would willingly have accepted the sovereignty of the United States , and the good government that it means . He has argued that only as a sovereign power can we guide the Filipinos to self-development and self-government ; that a protectorate would be impossible ; and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponents , " without the consent of the governed , " than we could establish a government of our own . The logic and the practical wisdom have been in the President 's argument rather than in that of his opponents , many of whom were trying to rush us into war with Spain when he was trying to prevent it , and are now unwilling to take the necessary consequences . They have called President McKinley , the most democratic of men , au " imperialist , " and have accused him , known to be a lover of peace and a hater of war , of leaning to " militarism . " Nevertheless , while the people generally have grown as weary as the President himself of the long and costly struggle in the Philippines , fomented and maintained in a measure by the President 's critics , it seems certain that a majority of the voters would have condemned at the polls a surrender to Aguinaldo or an abandonment of the purpose of tine President in the Philippines ; and that the overwhelming majority of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when , in the providence of God , our nation , reunited by war , prosperous and powerful beyond tine dreams of its founders , must meet new responsibilities in new ways . By the treaty of peace , the United States took Cuba in trust for its people , then without other government than that of Spain , and it took Porto Rico absolutely as partial indemnity , as the island commanding the entrance to the proposed Nicaraguan Canal , and for the benefit of the Porto Ricans , The United permission . 312 Mr. . illeKinley States , through the declaration of Congress , having promised Cuba independence upon the establishment of a stable government , President McKinley , through Major General Leonard 1Vood and other competent officers , has been endeavoring to construct a state out of the ruins that we found when we took possession on the 1st of January , 1899 . He is able to say with truth : " We have restored order and established domestic tranquillity . We have fed the starving , clothed the naked , and ministered to the sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have stimulated industry , introduced public education , taken a full and comprehensive enumeration of the inhabitants . " Local governments administered by the people have been chosen for all the municipalities of Cuba , and by the first Monday in November last a convention , chosen by the people , had assembled to frame a constitution , which must be acceptable to Congress , preparatory to independence and adjustment of Cuba 's relations to the United States . But although by that time the army of occupation had been cut down from 43,000 to less than 6000 , the fact that the President had not withdrawn it and all other American authority from the island , precipitously and without action of Congress , was used to sustain the accusations of " imperialism " and " militarism , " and even insinuations that the promise of the United States would not be kept ; while the embezzlements of two or three postal officials in Cuba , in spite of the prompt exposure and prosecution of them by the administration , were dwelt upon . Much more was made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in the opposition , of a determination to treat Porto Rico as a special form of territory , not intended to become a state , and for two years to be distinguished by a duty of fifteen per cent of the Dingley tariff on its imports and exports in its dealings with the United States . De- as President . claring that " the Constitution follows the flag , " although that doctrine is eon. trary to the precedents , and without waiting for the authoritative decision sought from the Supreme Court of the United States , the opponents of the President 's policy stirred up a strong sentiment against this form of imperialism . The President had said , in his animal message in December , 1899 , that it was our plain duty " to give Porto Rico freedom of trade with the United States and his critics harped upon that , ignoring the fact that it was found afterwards to be necessary to provide revenue temporarily for the island by very small tariff duties , all the money collected here as well as there being spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disordered by Spanish misrule , could not raise adequate revenue by internal taxation . Congress was careful to provide that this tariff taxation should cease in two years , and earlier if sufficient revenue were provided otherwise . The President sent an admirable man in Governor Allen , and gave him assistants of like character , to cooperate with the natives , who were given a larger measure of self-government than Louisiana had under Jefferson , in the reorganization and up . building of the island . Guam and other small islands taken from Spain have been governed wisely and without seri. ous criticism . From the time that Mr. John Hay succeeded Secretary Day as the head of the State Department , the President 's attention was directed with special care , amid all his other responsibilities , to the necessity of maintaining our commercial and other treaty rights in China , in view of tine gradual encroachments of Russia , Germany , England , and France upon the territory and authority of that empire . In due time , Secretary Hay , by the President 's direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others assent to the maintenance of the " open door " of commercial and financial dealings with China , guaranteed to es as to the other Powers by the treaties with China , and declarations that no further territorial acquisition would be made by the Powers in China . This success in an entirely new rule among the nations gave our government a position of leadership in China ; so that when , in May , 1900 , the anti - foreign Empress Dowager and her advisers encouraged anti-foreign demonstrations by the patriotic society known as the " Boxers , " which led to attacks upon the diplomatic corps and the other foreigners in Pekin , and finally their imprisonment in the British legation compound under intermittent assaults from imperial troops , the concerted movement for their rescue was led by the United States , helped greatly by having the Philippines as a base of operations . Moreover , Secretary Hay , on the 3d of July , laid down the principles which were accepted by the other Powers , for the settlement of this matter with China , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement , with the strict understanding that there would be no territorial indemnities , and no interference with the open door in the exaction of penalties for the past and guarantees for the future . In the rivalries among the European Powers over this settlement , they paid a remarkable tribute to the success of the McKinley administration in foreign affairs by competing with one another for the favor and influence of the United States . President McKinley , who had been accused by his critics of entangling alliances with Great Britain and other countries , notwithstanding his constant refusal to enter into such alliances , was able to secure every advantage the United States desired by acting concurrently with the Powers as they accepted his principles of dealing with the Chinese question , and finally to prevent the dismemberment of the Chinese Empire and maintain the open door . Without undertaking to anticipate the judgment of posterity , it seems safe to say that President McKinley has had a great part to play , and has played it well , and that it was fortunate for the republic that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century .
