 |p867  I AM opposed to the reception of the money offered to the American Board by John D. Rockefeller primarily because I do not think that the money thus offered rightfully belongs to the man who offers it . Mr. Rockefeller 's fortune has recently been estimated by a man who is reputed to be a financial authority in Wall Street as approximating one thousand million dollars . All this has been gathered within a generation . No intelligent student of commercial affairs believes that any such amount of money could be accumulated in so short a period by fair and honorable means . The bulk of the fortune raises a strong presumption against the legitimacy of the means by which it has been acquired . It is claimed by some of those who advocate the acceptance of the money that no proof exists of its having been illegally acquired . The ignorance of some of these apologists is almost equal to that of Mr. Rockefeller himself . No witness ever placed upon the stand in any court has displayed an ignorance so comprehensive and far-reaching and colossal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed respecting his own business . It is worth while in passing to illustrate this point , for it throws light upon this entire subject . " The South Improvement Company " was one of the schemes invented by the Standard Oil magnates by which the railways were used to plunder their competitors and enrich themselves . The organization and the methods of this company were abundantly proved in court , and the company was driven out of business . A few years afterward , before a Committee of the New York Legislature , Mr. Rockefeller , under oath , took part in the following colloquy : " There was such a company ? " " I have heard of such a company . " " You were not in it ? " " I was not . " Mr. Lloyd appropriately adds : " So help me God ! " On the same day another of the former trustees and one of the closest associates of Mr. Rockefeller , being asked by a Congressional Committee who made up that South Improvement Company , named as among them the principal members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all stood the name of John D. Rockefeller . Again , when Mr. Rockefeller was asked by the New York Legislature whether the companies under his management had not had more favorable rates from railroads than other refineries he replied : " I do not recall anything of the kind . " " You have heard of such things ? " " I have heard much in the papers about it . " ( Testimony , Trusts , New York Senate , 1888 , Q. 420 . ) And again , under oath , he made the following reply : " Do I understand you that they the Standard Oil managers have not sought in any way to make the operation of refineries outside the Trust so unprofitable that parties would either come into the Trust or have to abandon the business ? has anything of that sort been done ? " " They have not ; no , sir , they have not . " All this must be borne in mind in reading the statements now made in behalf of this system by its officers and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident that their memory is not at all to be depended on . But if they have forgotten nearly everything , there is no good reason why the rest of us should forget . The mass of evidence which has been spread before the country by investigating committees of Congress and of the State Legislatures , and in the records of courts , makes the confessed ignorance of men who are called to be public teachers rather inexplicable . It is impossible here to reproduce this  |p868  testimony . It has been summarized by Mr. Lloyd and Miss Tarbell , and either by abundant citations or by the reproduction of documents opportunity is given to every reader to verify the statements made . To represent either of these books as based on " mere rumor " is to exhibit gross ignorance or something worse . They are carefully digested evidence , and they put it within the power of every intelligent man to find out whether they are true or not . I will refer to only two or three facts which bear directly upon the legality of the methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transaction was investigated before the Federal District Court in this city in which it was proved that the Standard Oil Company had , by methods of its own , coerced the receiver of a railway into carrying its oil for ten cents a barrel , while it charged its competitors twenty-five cents , and paid over to the Standard the extra fifteen cents of its competitors ' money . The contract was annulled by the court , the receiver was removed from office ; the upright judge , in delivering his decision , applied to the transaction such terms as these : " Abhorrent , " " dangerous , " " gross , " " illegal and inexcusable , " an " unparalleled wrong . " And added : " A judge who would tolerate such a wrong or retain a receiver capable of perpetrating it ought to be impeached and disgraced from his position . " This is the characterization by a court of a kind of business which the Standard Oil Company carried on for several years . Mr. A. J. Cassatt , of the Pennsylvania Railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen months the railways had paid to the Standard the sum of $10,000,000 in rebates . " ( Hudson 's " Railways and the Republic , " p. 84 . ) It was after this that Mr. Rockefeller swore that his company had never , no never , received any favors whatever from the railroads . Thus it was , by a method characterized in court by such strong words as those of Judge Baxter quoted above , that the foundations of this vast fortune were laid . With such a power accumulated and ready to be wielded in the destruction of its rivals , the Standard Oil Company marched on , conquering and to conquer . During the decade between 1882 and 1892 " Standard Oil " was organized as a " Trust , " in which were included a large number of corporations . In 1892 the Supreme Court of Ohio pronounced this " Trust " illegal and ordered it dissolved . It must , then , have been illegal through the entire period of its existence . The court did not create the law , it interpreted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made in contravention of the law . The fact that ten years elapsed before any one was found with courage enough to apply the law does not make its gains for that decade legitimate . It was disobeying the law all that time and presumably knew it . The able lawyers employed by it were showing it how to evade the law . In 1898 and 1899 an attempt was made by the Attorney-General of Ohio to find out whether the order of the court dissolving the Trust had been obeyed . The company was ordered to produce its records , and about that time sixteen boxes of books were taken from the Standard offices in Cleveland and burned . These books , the officers of the Standard contended , were not the ones wanted by the court . " Then produce the ones we want , " replied the court . But they never were produced . For what reason ? Because , said the officers , if we produced them we might incriminate ourselves . Here is the statement made by the Secretary of the Standard Oil Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances which might be used against the Standard Oil Company of Ohio tending to prove it guilty of offenses made criminal by an act of the Legislature of Ohio , passed April 19th , 1898 ; " Because they disclose facts and circumstances which may be used against myself personally as an officer of said company tending to prove me guilty of offenses made criminal by the act aforesaid . " When these gentlemen come into court and swear that their own books prove them guilty of criminal practices , I submit that we have something more than mere " rumor " and " gossip " tending to show that their money has been illegally acquired .  |p869  It is not needful to multiply these proofs of flagrant lawlessness . These are all matters of record . Even those to whom no gains are discredited unless they have been gotten illegally might , I should think , find some reason for scruple in the facts which I have cited . And the insistent patter of some talkative people that the objection to this money is based on mere suspicion or hearsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making these objections have some knowledge of the facts with which they are dealing . All these legal proceedings in which judgment has fallen upon the Standard Oil Company have taken place within a stone 's throw of the place where I am writing . But the doctrine that no gains are infamous but those which have been condemned in court is hardly worthy of Christian teachers . How large a part of this enormous fortune has been gained by the direct infraction of the law I do not know . But a great deal of the rest of it has certainly been won by methods which , if legal , are utterly indefensible . This system has always employed astute lawyers whose function it has been to find ways of doing injustice without incurring legal penalties . I suppose that most of its operations in later years have been those for which no legal remedies have yet been found , but they are none the less oppressive and accursed . In the April number of The World To-Day Mr. Charles A. Prouty , of the Interstate Commerce Commission , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the principal evil is the rebate . In the past this has been true , but the Elkins bill and other causes have largely abated this abuse , and railway self-interest can be relied on to check it still further in the future . Discrimination in the published rate itself is likely to be much more serious than the rebate . The great Trusts and monopolies exercise to-day such control over railway management that they can adjust rates in their own interest . The Standard Oil Company no longer accepts rebates ? it makes the rates themselves ; and the discriminations in its favor are worth enormous sums annually to that monopoly . " This is not rumor or guess work ; it is the testimony of an officer of the United States whose business it is to deal with the entire problem , and it presents a tremendous fact . The power which it describes is the power under which this gigantic aggregation of capital has been built up . It is a power which may be and which often is used for the oppression of the whole people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . Its heavy hand is felt in every direction ; it dictates to railway officials the terms of transportation ; it controls a large part of the mining wealth of the nation ; its sway in the realm of finance is despotic , giving it the power to ruin the credit of those who do not bow down to it . It is not merely on account of what this gigantic power has done in the past ; it is on account of what it is doing today that it ought to be counted a public enemy . The story of the last few months in Kansas reveals its nature and its motive quite as clearly as anything it has done in the past . It is now , as it has always been , an oppressor of the people . Its methods of robbery are more genteel and much more cowardly than those of the highwayman or the pirate , but they are not less flagitious . The man who , upon a railway directory exerts his influence to establish rates or policies by which he aggrandizes himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , just as truly a robber as the man who puts his pistol to your head in a dark alley . Unless the people can learn to discern and punish these cryptic injustices which are woven into the very fabric of our modern industrial system , there will soon be no hope for liberty here except as the result of a revolution . Is it necessary to argue that the wealth which has been heaped up by these organized piracies does not rightly belong to the men who have it in their hands ? It is not rightfully theirs . Therefore they have no right to give it . And what they have no right to give we have no right to take . That is the everlasting truth , and wo to the Church that blurs it with sophistries and refuses to hear and heed it . But are there not others equally culpable , men cry ; why single out this case for special condemnation ? Because , I answer , this is the clearest , the most conspicuous , the most aggravated case .  |p870  It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which investigation has been thoroughly made , and concerning which the truth is known . The operations of this system have been more daring , more lawless and more successful than that of any other aggregation of wealth . Because this is the arch-enemy he is the first to be attacked . If the Church is ever going to array itself against the power of Mammon which threatens to undermine morality , paralyze religion and overthrow liberty , this is the time to bear her testimony . Settle this question the right way and it will be comparatively easy to deal with those that follow . Settle it the wrong way , and you have established a precedent whose influence upon the life of the Church will be deadly . I must own that many of the arguments which I have heard in favor of the acceptance of this gift have revealed a confusion with respect to the primary principles of ethics that is astounding . Has the worship of money completely blinded our eyes ? We hear men contending that the Church has no right to refuse any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Any money is good money , " men say . " It is stupid to cavil about money . The worst man 's dollars will go just as far in saving souls as the best man 's . " They would have taken Judas 's thirty pieces of silver , I suppose , and used them for missionary purposes . Even the Sanhedrim could not quite do that . The astonishing statement has been frequently made that the Church has always received all money laid upon her altars , from whatever source . It might be well for such moralists to refresh their ethical perceptions by turning to Deut. xxiii , r8 , or by listening to this testimony from Uhlhorn : " As the Church would have no forced gifts , so it would have none from persons who dial not in spirit belong to her , who did not give from love or from property rightly acquired ( " Conflict of Christianity with Heathenism. page 199 . ) Certainly if any ethical principle respecting property is clear , it is the principle that property which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The partaker is as bad as the thief " is a maxim whose validity it is not best to dispute , even in the interest of missionary revenues . The secular newspapers , so far as I have had opportunity of judging , and I have seen a great many of them , are generally clear on this point . It is the " religious " papers that surprise me . Says the Memphis Appeal : " Captain Kidd was a pirate . If he had quietly dropped into a New England town some night and left a lot of stolen goods with a fence ' to be disposed of , the fence ' would have been liable under the law . If on the other hand he had made his way to a parsonage , told the minister who he was , and said that he wanted to make him a present of 10,000 Spanish doubloons to build a new chapel , what would be thought of the preacher who could accept that which it would be a crime for the fence to receive ? Certainly if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive stolen goods , it is immoral and improper for a religious organization to do so . " There are many other phases of this question , some of which I have tried to treat elsewhere . I trust that the discussion is going to result in a great awakening of the conscience of the American Church with respect to its relations to ill-gotten riches . Most certain it is that the wealth which has been won by wickedness can be only a curse to him who has won it and to them who covet it . The more of it the Church gets the feebler will be its life , and the wider and deeper the gulf between it and the millions of the honest working people .
