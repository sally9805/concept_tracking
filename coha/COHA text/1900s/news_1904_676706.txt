" We point to the recent revelations of corruption in the Post Office Department at Washington ; " To a depleted Treasury , shown by the last Treasury statement , at Washington ; " To the failure of the Attorney General to prosecute illegal trusts and combinations and the promoters thereof by criminal action ; " To the refusal of Congress to reduce , the tariff tax on those articles which enable the illegal trusts and combinations to plunder the people , and " To the fact that the Attorney General left it to a private citizen , at large expense , to uncover the Coal Trust , as proving the truth of the above charge against the Republican Party . PORTO RICO AND PHILIPPINES . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine that the Constitution follows the flag in Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands , or else that they are free and independent , so that the true glory of our country shall not be tarnished by the exercise of the despotic power , of denying to a helpless people a republican form of government . " We favor the election of United States Senators by a direct vote of the people . " We point to the growth of trusts and monopolies as one of the evil results of the ascendency of the Republican Party at Washington . By the present tariff law , and In numerous ways , special privileges and undue favors have been extended by a Republican Congress and a Republican President to favored classes and huge corporations . The older trusts have all been strengthened and new trusts , toe numerous to mention , have been created since the Government passed into the hands of the Republican Party in 1596 . " These trusts devour the prosperity which appears in the land as a result of the industry of the people and consequently the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . " If the people do not speedily dominate , regulate , and control these trusts , the trusts will permanently dominate and control the Government and continue indefinitely to levy exactions upon the people . " We submit that the Republican Party , Itself controlled by trusts , can not safely be relied on to curb the trusts , and we demand that the Government be taken out of the hands of the friends of monopoly and restored to the untrammeled representatives of the people .
