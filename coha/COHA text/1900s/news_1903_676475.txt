txt A. significant statement was issued by William J. Bryan to-night regarding the candidacy for-Senator of John H. Clarke , who was named for the office by the Democratic State Convention under Mayor Johnson 's lead . Despite the fact that Clarke bolted Bryan 's nomination in 1S06 and is opposed to free silver still , Mr. Bryan indorses him . The significant part of his statement is the paragraph in which he lays down the rule that it would be " unreasonable and unjust " to withhold support from a Democrat merely because that Democrat bolted in ' 1896 , when he supported the ticket in 1900 and is " sound " on everything but free silver . Leading members of Mr. Bryan 's wing of the party have been laying down the rule that no man can be dominated for President in 1904 who did not support the ticket in 1896 as well as in 1900 . This has been held to bar such men as Richard Olney and Edward M. Shet , ard , both of whom supported the ticket in 1900 , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that neither Shepard nor Olney can receive the nomination for that reason , although he said at the same time that Shepard was a splendid Democrat , and he deeply regretted that he was out of the running . It is being asked everywhere to-night whether this statement is not intended to establish a basis of reconciliation between the two wings of the Democratic Party , and whether , even if it is not so intended , Mr. Bryan can escape the consequences of his thus letting the bars down in Mr. Clarke 's case . The paragraph of Mr. Bryan 's statement , - in which he thus shows himself less radical than some of his supporters , is as follows : " To oppose him because of his action in , 1596 , in spite of the fact that he helped us ? heartily in 1900 , in spite of the fact that he has supported Johnson in all his reforms , in spite of the fact that he is now helping us on everything except one phase of one ' question , and in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead him to our side when he thoroughly understands the subject ? to , oppose him , I say , in spite of these things , would be unreasonable and unjust . " Mr. Bryan 's statement sets at rest the reports of differences between himself and Mayor Johnson and the rumors that he intended to oppose Mr. Clarke . The rest of ' the statement is as follows : ? ? I would have preferred the nomination of some one who had been active and earnest in the support of all the planks of our platform , but the delegates who indorsed , the Kansas City platform also indorsed Mr. Clarke , and after talking with him and listening ti his speech last night I am satisfied that his sympathies are with the people in their fight against organized wealth , and that , if elected Senator , he can be trusted to stand for the reform for which the Democratic Party is contending . " As an evidence that his sympathies are with tho masses I point to the fact that he . has long advocated the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without which other reforms are impossible . " He is opposed to government by injunction , and this question is a good test of his sympathies . He is in tavor of an income tax  --  another proof that he is not the representative of plutocracy . His views on imperialism and the tariff are sound and in line with Democratic principles . His one difference is on one Phase of the money question  --  namely , metallic money  --  and on this question I believe he was grievously in error in 1896 . " But since that time the arguments made in favor of a larger volume of money have been vindicated . Believing as I do that his sympathies are right , I shall trust him to carry out his platform on all questions that come before him rather than give encouragement to those who would elect a Republican Legislature and thus not only return Mr. Hanna , but prevent the enactment of needed State legislation . " On the more acute phases of the money question I believe he will be found in entiril harmony with the Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting an asset currency- or the Aldrich bill , neither do I believe he would support the Republican measures which provide for branch banks and for making the silver dollar redeemable in gold . " Mr. Clarke recognizes , as he said last night , that revolutions do not go backward ; he recognizes that the Democratic Party Is marching forward to meet the issues presented to plutocracy , and he is opposed to the scheme of the reorganizers . " While we might prefer some other Democrat to him , we certainly must prefer him to a Republican who hi against us on all questions , especially when the Leg , islature that will elect him will also give the people home rule , cheaper railroad fares , and more equitable taxation . " Mr. Bryan was the guest to-day of flit Ohio State Board of Agriculture , and this afternoon delivered a non-partisan address at the State fair grounds . John H. Clarke spoke from the same platform . Mr. Bryanleft late in the afternoon for Marion . Ohio , where he addressed a Democratic . meeting to-night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
