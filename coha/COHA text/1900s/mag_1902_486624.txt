Mr S. S Rider announces , in his Providence Book Notes , the near completion of his ' History of the Development of a Constitutional Government in Rhode Island . ' This off his hands , he will resume the issue of his much-prized Rhode Island Historical Tracts . Messrs . Scribner will publish next week Gen. De Wet 's vigorous work on ' The Three Years ' War . ' ? Little , Brown &; Co. give notice that their three-volume trade edition of ' The Speeches and Other Writings of Daniel Webster , Hitherto Uncollected , ' goes over till after the holidays . Nearer are ' The Last Days of Pekin , ' translated from the French of Pierre Loti , by Myrta L. Jones , and ' First-Hand Bits of Stable-Lore , ' by Francis M. Ware , finely illustrated In our favorable notice last year of the Blashfields " Italian ( Scribners ) we spoke of this work 's capacity for interleaving with photographs by tourists whom it had served as an uncommonly trustworthy unconventional guide-book Whether acting upon this hint or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the typographic infelicities pointed out by us , now offer the two volumes greatly enhanced in beauty and in value by forty-eight full-page illustrations from Alinari photographs . The selection has been admirably made and is remarkably unhaekneyed , we can not recall a better in a work of this character . Each subject is carefully described in the table . Here is a gift-book indeed . A presentable one-volume edition of Burns 's Poetical Works , annotated by William Wallace , LL.D ( London : Chambers ; New York : Dutton ) , is characterized by clear type and numerous illustrations from paintings , often of Scottish scenery . The notes are at the foot of the page . John Lane extends his pocket " Lover 's Library " with ' Love Poems of Herrick , ' with the usual delicate colored borders and pretty binding . A notable example of compression without illegibility and of comprehensiveness without bulk is offered by the latest volume in the " Oxford Miniature " series , viz , ' Aurora Leigh , and Other Poems , by Elizabeth Barrett Browning ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early poems , together with a general miscellany and the Sonnets from the Portuguese . The Oxford India paper enables the 948 pages to occupy no more cubic space than 3 inches x 41/2 x There are indexes by first lines and by titles . While discoursing de mininiis , we may mention a reprint of Thoreau 's ' Life without Principle , ' with Emerson 's brief sketch of the author , published at the Sign of the Hop-pole , Eden Bridge , Kent , Eng . There is not much to say of it except that the Chiswick Press has done well by the typography of the oblong page . Houghton , Mifflin &; Co have been well advised in going abroad for an illustrator of Kate Douglas Wiggins ' Penelope 's Irish Experiences ' in a new edition Mr. Charles E. Brook 's deft hand has adorned Mrs. Wig-gin 's lively chapters amusingly and characteristically with pen sketches in the letterpress , with which they harmonize very suc-cessfully Alice Barber Stephens 's designs for Little , Brown &; Co ' s new edition of Miss Alcott'g ' Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate wash-drawings , clever in execution , full of detail , with a feminine mastery of - female costume and a happy regard to the fashion of the day of the " little women . " Each has a full page to itself , if we except the vignette of the title-page . Few classics are so well treated . Messrs Wainwright and Palmer 's ' Harvard Alphabet ' ( Cambridge : Harvard Cooperative Society ) , Is a favorable sample of the college humor that has sustained the Lampoon for so many years . The verse is bright , and the illustrations ( by two unnamed designers ) make a good match . It should be said that much of the jingle is collegiate rather than Havardiensian , so that at other institutions this handsomely made volume is capable of finding favor . Yale , we are sure , would take kindly to the letter G. " G what a Game ! Why the deuce ca n't we score ? It is always the same , Dully Gee ! what a game ! The half-backs are lame And the line men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deuce ca n't we score ? " With the letter H , embodying an old Jo , the case might be different . ' Recollections of Dublin Castle and of Dublin Society , by a Native ' ( Brentano 's ) is amusingly written , evidently by one who has had experience of Dublin life in the fifties and sixties . Perusal will bring up many recollections , both sweet and bitter , to those who have lived in the metropolis of Ireland within the period treated . The book is , however , more than less of a caricature , and is as likely to be accepta-ble to thoughtful Irishmen as must be " nigger " literature to persons of the col-ored race The burlesque portratiure of the Earl of Carlisle ( Lord Morpetli ) , one of the best of noblemen , is peculiarly un-gracious . Books such as this and ' Ireland Sixty Years Ago , ' which appeared in the forties , are seldom written concerning phases of life among people who have the power to compel respect . It is pleasant to welcome a genealogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined as in the ' Descendants of Richard Everett of Dedham , Mass. , ' by the late Edward F. Everett of Cambridge ( Boston : T. R Marvin &; Son ) The family is not a very large one , and can not be said to have been always prominent in the whole length of the annals of New England . In the last century , however , it had its full share of honor in the . Persons of the Rev. Oliver Everett and his gifted sons , Alexander H and Edward , and grandson , William Everett ; Horace Everett of Vermont , the Rev. Dr Charles C. Everett of Harvard , and David Everett , author of " You 'd scarce expect one of my age . " The notices of all of these ; while short as biographies , may perhaps be described as models for their place in a book of family genealogy There are several portraits in the volume , among them two of the Hon. Edward Everett , one of then Hon Horace Everett . which might almost be taken for a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F Everett , which , in the opinion of a classmate , is a wonderfully good likeness The volume declares itself to be " privately printed , " yet appears to be offered for sale It comes to us byway of the above firm , but we understand that application for copies should be made to Mrs. Edward F. Everett , Cambridge , Mass . Seventeen years ago we spoke of a work by Dr. Douglas Graham as " a valuable professional book for which , and for the subject to which it is devoted , we venture to predict distinguished success . But it will come slowly . " The third edition of his ' Treatise on Massage ' ( Lippincott ) , illustrated and much enlarged , is evidence of this success . The treatise is a capital demonstration of the value of external treatment in many and serious conditions , and its considerable claims do not transcend the truth One might wish the style more dignified at times ; but facts are better than style , and these are perfectly satisfactory . We are glad to commend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Van Nostrand Co. bring out an eighth edition , " carefully revised and enlarged , " of Mackrow 's well-known and indispensable ' Naval Architects ' and Ship-builders ' Pocket-Book . ' More recent examples of ships might be cited than the obsolete Agincoart , Bellerophon , etc , while the persistent misspelling " Mesaure " ( p. 615 ) suggests that the revision might be still more " careful " Mrs Candace Wheeler 's ' How to Make Rugs ' ( Doubleday , Page &; Co ) is an earnest plea for the resuscitation of the hand-loom of our foremothers , put to the use of producing rag , cotton , and woollen rugs and Portieres She appeals fpr workers to the farmer 's family and rural communities , and incidentally to any " kind and cultivated " folk who can act as go-betweens for the country supply of the loom and the city demand The book is a practical one of direction as to details of coloring and weaving , with the true artistic feeling one would expect from the writer May the ideas of such women as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine-carpeted land ! Of Mr II . W Macdonald 's essay entitled ' Electric Waves ' ( Cambridge , Eng. : Univer city Press , New York Macmillan ) we can only say here that it constitutes a highly important contribution to the mathematical theory of electricity , going down to the veky bottom of the subject , and putting it in a much clearer light for the mathema-tician Part IX . of ' The Georgian Period , ' the excellent publication of the American Architect and Building News Co. , is at hand . In this number much attention is given to the neighborhood of Charleston . S. C. The text and plates may be considered as being in continuation of Part X. , forming with it a study of the very interesting and characteristic " Old Colonial " architecture of the Sea Island district and of the upper country which depends upon it Since the days when the exigencies of civil war carried some of us to the seacoast thereabouts , there has been little occasion to visit the somewhat out-of-the-way villages and places of summer resort in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found But the city of Charleston itself furnishes St. Michael 's Church , to which several plates are given , and St. Philip 's Church , which is almost as fully illustrated ; " There are also the unique and attractive village church at Santee and some admirable tombs , of the kind which were built on the plantation for the inhumation of successive generations , like the very well known instance at Mount Vernon The text is furnished by C R S. Horton , E Eldon Deane , and Olive F. Gunby . The same firm announces ' The Seats of the Colonists and Other Furnishings ' The idea once entertained of including colonial furniture in ' The Georgian Period ' has , it seems , been definitively abandoned ; and the work just named will be undertaken if the subscriptions are sufficiently numerous . The cost of it is to be $20 . Horace C. Dunham of Boston and W. Galsworthy Davy , a well-known English compiler of archmological books , will furnish measured drawings and photographs , and the book promises to be of very great interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the Sea ' ( Boston . Little , Brown &; Co ) is a compilation noticeable for wise selection and judicious condensation . Like many of its predecessors , however , its use will be confined to those who have more than elementary knowledge of cookery . The professional domestic cook , we fear , can hardly be induced to read it and follow faithfully its directions and suggestions . Nothing but praise can be bestowed upon this epitome of the more savory and piquant culinary concoctions of the various European nationalities . The author is to be congratulated upon the discrimination which leads her to include in her list garlic sauce ( Provence ) Unfortunately , she gives the formula in terms so general that it will not be intelligible to more than one in a thousand into whose hands the book may fall . The making of this sauce involves a great deal more than she indicates in the recipe . It is observable in almost all cooking com pilations issued in this country that a haison made of beaten yolks of eggs to combine or amalgamate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas abroad this amalgam is strenuously insisted upon . In the recipe for garlic sauce , Miss Keen makes no mention of this important factor . The sixteenth volume of the ' Collections of the Wisconsin Historical Society , ' just issued , is eminently a source book of knowledge regarding Wisconsin under the French regime from 1634 to 1727 . The editor , Secretary Thwaites , has here compactly stored multitudinous historic materials in part known only to himself , or not before translated , or accessible only in the archives of Canada or France . The work is distinctly annalistic , having topics ranged under more than a hundred dates . The seventy-three volumes of ' Jesuit Relations , ' edited by Mr. Thwaites , and as many more other works , are laid under contribution , so that many subjects imperfectly treated in former volumes of the Society onward from 1855 are elucidated . The rise and progress of fur trade and missions , which walked hand in hand , are cleared of many obscurities . Indians are shown 7,72 , purls natural/bus , just as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of benevolent assimilation between fur traders and natives is strikingly illustrated , each proving a curse to the other , the one becoming a hard master and the other a refractory slave . The corruption among French officials is a startling object-lesson that irresponsible power will be abused so long as man is man . A mission was established near the head of lake Superior in 1660 ; how Much had then been done in Massachusetts ? In 1701 more than 20,000 pounds of copper ore were mined on Blue Earth River , This history will be doubly read , thanks to thirty-five pages of index by Miss Blair , who , by her wonderful labor in that line for the ' Jesuit Relations , ' has won national laurels . Every page makes references we are eager to trace . The National Geographic Magazine for November controverts the prevailing impression that Lake Erie is getting lower . The contrary is true , according to Prof. E. L. Mosely , who asserts that " the slow tilting of the earth 's crust in the Great Lake region " is deepening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of submerged stumps and stalagmites , the formation of marshes , the conversion of peninsulas into islands , and of islands into reefs . " At many places in northern Ohio roads and houses have been moved south on account of the encroachment of the water . Many orchards have fallen into the lake The same is true of the Canadian shore . Nowhere is there any building up at all comparable with the amount of land lost . Since 1809 , when the first survey was made , more than 500 acres have been lost in Erie County along the lake and in the eastern part of Sandusky Bay , while the enlargement of the western part of the bay probably amounts to several square miles . " Considering its source , the article on the course of the retail coal trade by the Chief of Division of Mineral Resources is distinctly disappointing as a contribution to our knowledge of a subject of great importance .

In the Geographical Journal for November the Rev. George Grenfell describes the upper Congo as a-Waterway , its currents , floods , and the various obstacles to navigation . There is now on the river a fleet of more than a hundred steamers of all sizes , " from small launches up to crafts carrying between 200 and 300 tons . " This is the growth of twenty-one years , the first steamer having been launched in November , 1881 . It would be greater but for the difficulty of obtaining food " After leaving the Pool , nothing or next to nothing is to be obtained for the first 180 miles . . .

" Red borders and red designs give a lurid attractiveness to the cynicism . ? Henry Loomis Nelson writes of ' The So-called Steel Trust ' in the December Century , continuing that magazine 's series of articles on the great business combinations of the present industrial era . Mr Nelson is rigidly expository , not argumentative Indeed , he has fought so shy of the argumentative phases of the subject that one feels some defect in the exposition For the future he ventures only the conditional prophecy that " if the theory of the United States Steel Corporation is vindicated by the test of time , a great advance will have been made by it in the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the benefit of the consumer , as well as to the profit of those who have made the venture . " The reader may add for himself the obvious conclusion from the facts presented , that such a universally beneficent outcome of the Trust movement must depend upon the ability of the people , through the national Government , to impose , and the readiness of the combinations in good faith to accept , such legal regulation of the movement as will hold in check the temptation to extortion which great financial power always tends to excite ; and will give due assurance against the domination of Government agencies by corporate influences Prof W. T Hewett of Cornell University contributes a very interesting and appreciative sketch of the work of F W. Robertson , pointing out with keen perception the reasons why his influence must surpass in depth and permanency that of such men as Beecher , Spurgeon , Newman , Liddon , Caird and others , who attracted much wider attention in their time . Weir Mitchell makes a brief study of some seven hundred examples of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . The instances were collected during a period of ten months by a clipping agency , as the result of a discussion over the question whether the civilized world is improving in the quality of altruism Plenty of altruism in specific cases is developed , but the results are admitted to throw little light on the original question It would be interesting to have Dr. Mitchell discuss the fact that these displays of altruism in great peril are often by men whose everyday life is , to outward appearances , altogether selfish . ? Richard Harding Davis opens the Christmas Serebner 's with an article on " The Gentle Art of Bull-fighting . " With the eye chiefly upon the profuse illustrations , one might well question the ethical utility of such matter in an American family magazine , but the text puts very effectively the essential brutality and cowardice of bull-baiting , its utter lack of that evenness of chances as between the two sides to the contest which is the foundation of all true sport , as well as its spectacular brilliancy and its power to appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller contributes a few letters from Richand D.

Among the items of personal interest to be gleaned from them are his strong repugnance to photographic celebrity , his distrust of his own power as a judge of literature , his keen appreciation of the American interest in his books , and his love for the poetry of Paul Hamilton Hayne . The Editor moralizes upon the vast expansion of American wealth during the present generation , but without any definite conclusions In " The Field of Art " Will H Low mildly deprecates the announced intention of Columbia University to establish a department to include practical instruction in painting and sculpture . Aside from the features mentioned , and two short poems , the number is given up to fiction . ?

Among the more serious contents of the number the first place belongs , without contest , to Mr. Swinburne 's article on Goneril and Regan . His well-known tendency to superlatives is used without restraint . The one tragedy of " King Lear , " he says , would prove its author the greatest poet that ever lived as clearly as does his entire work , The ' Hebrew prophets and the author of Job may surpass him in imaginative sublimity and passion , but are quite incomparably inferior in imaginative intelligence . Sophocles is his peer in nobility , beauty , and kindliness , " but the gentle Shakespeare could see farther and higher and wider and deeper at a glance than ever could the gentle Sophocles . " Aristophanes , with all his infinitely joyous wit and infinitely inexhaustible humor , can set nothing against Falstaff or the Fool . All this from the first column , but it fairly represents any page of the four . In connection with Sophocles , Mr Swinburne remarks that " Antigone herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cordelia in the heaven of heavens  --  is not so divinely human as Cordelia . " This rather strikingly recalls two lines of Carducci 's in his stanzas " Beside Shelley 's Urn , " a sort of trionfo , passing in review in pairs the inhabitants of " Fancy 's resplendently lovely sea-girt island " .

NEW EDITIONS OF POE . The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe . Edited by James A. Harrison . 17 volumes . Thomas Y Crowell &; Co 1902 The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe With a critical introduction by Charles F. Richardson 10 volumes . G. P. Putnam 's Sons . 1902 . At last Poe has come into his own His text was long the most neglected in our native literature ; it is now , if not the best , certainly the most edited of all Our classics can not be too often issued , and both these new editions have , each in its own way , novel points of excellence unshared by others The coincidence of their publication strongly emphasizes the established place of Poe in our standard literature , and the care with which his fame is cherished . The Virginia edition is , indeed , an old-fashioned labor of love , the work of three gentlemen of the University of Virginia where Poe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Virginia product . The more sumptuous " Arnheim Edition " of Messrs . Putnam , introduced . by Professor Richardson of Dartmouth College , presents Poe exclusively as a " world-author " In other respects , the two editions are also opposed , and , if the former receives greater attention here , it is because of its unusual claims The " Arnheim " is a careful standard reprint , in substance , and is content to take its place with others . The Virginia editors are of a different mind They endeavor to reconsti- tute the text ; they claim that they have freed it from the corruptions of other editors , and that it is now presented in its original integrity for the first time . Such a claim  --  the question being what is the standard text of one of our most distinguished authors  --  deserves scrutiny . The first point made by the Virginia editors ( and it is often reiterated ) is , that they have gone to the original sources . A hasty reader might get the impression that they only had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , as Poe 's executor , for so much of Poe 's work as he included in his edition It is not the fact of going to the sources that counts , but rather the use one makes of them . Griswold attempted no more than a fairly good reprint of what seemed permanent or interesting in the miscellaneous papers of a writer , lately dead , whose place in literature was still to be judged . The edition so made served its purpose until , with the increase of Poe 's fame and the lapse of time , something more seemed due him . Stedman and Woodberry then gave a new edition ; they went to the original sources , rearranged the matter , modernized the mode of printing as regards spelling , punctuation , and so forth , corrected errors in dates , names , quotations , foreign terms , and the like , and , in a word , established a text such as any author desires of his own works . This was , in feet , a critical edition There is another way of editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original state This the Virginia editors have adopted . They have retained the contemporary form in which Poe 's writings appeared , in all the details of the printing , and have corrected errors only in the most necessary cases , and then with notice to the reader It is a facsimile method of editing . Either method has advantages of its own , and both have been applied to many great authors , but , in general , the former is the best for the general public ; the latter is the most useful to the special literary student . With this general statement as to the character of the editing , and with the remark that the arrangement is chronological , by divisions , the results may best be illustrated by taking the parts separately , and examining them with regard to the three prime virtues of editing ? fulness , accuracy , and authority . In the " Tales " and " Poems " there is no new matter , and the verbal text does not differ in any material point from that generally received , such variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrections . The original sources , printed and manuscript , are the same used by other editors , except that the first publication of " The Angel of the Odd " in the Columbian Magazine has been found and collated . The identification had been previously made by the late W. M. Griswold Further research by the editors might not have been fruitless , however , for example , the first publication of " The Sphinx , " for the text of which Griswold has been the only authority , was in Arthur 's Magazine , January , 1846 , and an earlier text of " Mystification " than any collated may be found in the American Mouthly for June , 1837 . The novel feature of the edition , under " Tales " and " Poems , " is a variorum , showing the state of the text in the different forms published by Poe . As is well known , Poe was accustomed to revise his work of all sorts , and print it over again whenever he had a chance The extent of this revision is remarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compilation is complete for this section Woodberry had already done the same thing for the " Poems , " but the extension of this method to the " Tales " is the most peculiar and valuable trait of the Virginia edition To confine attention to the " Poems , " " The Raven " may be regarded as a fair example by which to test the accuracy of the collation " The Raven " was issued by Poe in the American Whig Review , corrected in the Broadway Journal , and revised in the edition of ' 1845 , it now is given either in a fourth form , that of Griswold , or a fifth , that of the Lorimer-Graham copy ( originally Griswold 's ) of the 1845 edition , with MS. corrections by Poe . There are thus five distinct forms of the poem If the variorum of the Virginia editors be compared with these , the following results appear In , the account of the first form , two readings , mortals and something , are recorded , but do not occur , in that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occur , a variant in stanza xi , 5 is omitted , and a misprint vied for tried , should be noted ; there is no account of the third form , there is no account of the fourth form , except a reference made to it in the account of the first , and the reference is incorrect ; the fifth form is the one adopted in the text . The editors give , however , an account of the form in the Southern Literary Messenger , which is verbally the same as that in the Whig Review , but differs in punctuation . In describing this , they omit six readings , give in stanza xi . the Broadway Journal reading by mistake , and in stanza ii , 2 ( as also in the Broadway Journal form in the same place ) adduce a variation where none exists . The raven is an ill-omened bird , and makes here a pretty nest of errors It is not given to editors to be faultless , and this is a peculiarly trying kind of work ; the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be trusted , so far as we have examined it A few other errors may be noted in passing , in case the work should be revised , as it needs to be in " Al Aaraaf , " 1831 , lines 26-30 , are omitted ; in " Israfel , " 1831 , viii 4 , so for as ; in " The City of Sin " ( misprinted Sea ) , 1836 , the omission of six lines from 1831 is not noted The date of " To One in Paradise , " in Godey 's , should be 1834 . Misprints are numerous throughout the notes , one in the body of the text , " The Valley of Unrest , " line 22 , three for titers , may be worth correction Apart from these matters of detail , we observe that the variant readings of the Philadelphia papers are entirely omitted , as well as those of the Wilmer manuscript and of the manuscript facsimile of the lines to Mrs Shew . To pass to the critical writings , it is hers that the editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if enthusiasm for their author and laborious patience in his service were all there is to editing , they might well be satisfied They have greatly increased the bulk of the section , partly by including reviews hitherto thought too valueless to be revived , and partly by printing the earlier forms of later critical writing in addition to the latter The method followed is , in fact , the same as in the " Tales " and " Poems , " only , instead of giving the variants in notes , the original articles are reprinted It is better that there should be repetition , it is said in explanation , than that anything of Poe 's should be lost . The results are occasionally surprising , owing to Poe 's inveterate habit of using his old material over again . For example , a long review of Hall 's ' Book of Gems , ' from the Southern Literary Messenger , ' August , 1836 , was reprinted , very slightly revised , in the Broadway Journal 1845 ; the editors , therefore , give it twice  --  once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again in volume xii 139 as " later criticism . " Some passages will be thus found
