 | IT is now nearly fifteen years since the tragic close of " Tess of the D'Urbervilles , " and the pure beauty of the setting in nature given to the narrative , brought Mr. Thomas Hardy to the zenith of his popularity ? if such a phrase may be allowed in connection with a writer whose views of life are notoriously free from conventionality . The number of his enthusiastic admirers was greatly increased ? perhaps in exact proportion with the number of those readers who censured " Tess " on the score of its alleged unwholesomeness ; articles , and even books , descriptive of his life and works , began to appear with considerable frequency ; and some people , like myself , soon took advantage of a new uniform edition of his novels to read again , or for the first time , all the predecessors of the story that was being generally accepted as its author 's masterpiece . With great delight such readers traced the progress of Mr. Hardy 's genius from the powerful but still crude and involved " Desperate Remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Under the Greenwood Tree " ( 1872 ) , ? which proved that idealism and realism are not of necessity inimical , since here the Wessex peasant took his place in English literature not so very far away from Shakespeare 's clowns ? on through the idiosyncratic and therefore the less charming but not the less striking love-story " A Pair of Blue Eyes " ( 1872-73 ) , through " Far from the Madding Crowd " ( 1874 ) ? in which Mr. Hardy first , perhaps , made his calling and election clear , and displayed a balance of powers scarcely afterward maintained ? through the interesting tour de force entitled " The Hand of Ethelberta " ( 1876 ) , up to the powerful and individual creation which many competent judges have pronounced to be his greatest performance , " The Return of the Native " ( 1878 ) ? when this sentence and this paragraph may end , so that we may recall the part played by sombre nature in Mr. Hardy 's works ? for this is the novel that made Egdon Heath a possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charm succeed compelling power , seems fitting enough . We are therefore not surprised or disappointed when we pass to that genial , semi-historical romance , " The  | Trumpet Major " ( 1879 ) , which has its relations with the dramatic poem that forms the subject of this paper . Then came two Hardyesque performances , idiosyncratic , not to say outre , or , in plain and less emphatic English , out of the common , and , as is usual in such cases , somewhat out of the way ? " A Laodicean " ( 1880-81 ) and " Two on a Tower " ( 1882 ) . These were followed by a story which for sheer strength ranks very high in Mr. Hardy 's works , " The Mayor of Casterbridge " ( 1884-55 ) , and this in turn by the not much less impressive novel " The Woodlanders " ( 1886-87 ) . After this Mr. Hardy gathered his good though scarcely masterly short stories into " Wessex Tales " ( 1888 ) , and added to them another collection interesting both to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A Group of Noble Dames " ( 1891 ) . The next year , with " Tess of the D'Urbervilles , " saw Mr. Hardy take his place as one of the two greatest British novelists of the later Victorian period . None of his previous books , as we have seen , had produced so deep an impression upon the larger public ? none had come so near answering all the requisitions that contemporaries of an author are inclined to make upon a book of his before they will even tentatively declare it to be a masterpiece . I thought " Tess , " when I first read it , to be Mr. Hardy 's best novel ; and , despite my respect for " The Return of the Native " and for the critics who expatiate upon its greatness , I still hold to this opinion , relying not a little , like a true Philistine , on the fact that the public shares it or , at least , at one time seemed to share it . That public opinion , whatever its value , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are warranted in resting satisfied with the support it gives , will be maintained by few students of any form of human activity . But public opinion is stability itself when it is put in comparison with prediction , whether public or individual . If in the year " Tess " was published any of Mr. Hardy 's numerous readers had been asked to cast the novelist 's literary horoscope for the next fourteen or fifteen years , the chances are that , while some might have predicted that he would never again write a story which would make a wide and deep impression , scarcely a reader , even of the few that might have known that Mr. Hardy had dabbled in verse in his youth , would have ventured to predict that he would not only cease for the years to write fiction , but would actually make a deliberate attempt on a rather grandiose scale to win for himself the fame of a great poet . Yet such a prophet would have been absolutely correct in his prediction . The group of stories entitled " Life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jude the Obscure " ( 1895 ) , the far from attractive and I suspect not widely read novelette , " The Well Beloved " ( 1897 ) , while probably not amenable to a great part of the censure which the second of the  | three books received , certainly added nothing to Mr. Hardy 's reputation as a writer of fiction . It began to look as if the Hardyesque had swallowed Hardy . Then the world was rather disconcerted by the appearance of a volume entitled " Wessex Poems " ( 1898 ) , in which the critics said it might manage to discover some of the old intelligence and power , some of the old grim outlook upon life and its miseries , but very little poetry . The world did not know that Mr. Hardy had returned to his first love , and , if it had known the fact , it would not have greatly cared . In its rough and ready way , it had classed him as a novelist and , in our expressive phrase , it wanted him " to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of a peace-loving world , in these days , when the number of writers to be reckoned with is so formidable that it is only a commonplace to point out how the pursuit of culture has become one of the most fatiguing forms of " the strenuous life . " Being anything but strenuous myself , I have no intention of doing battle with the world in behalf of " Wessex Poems , " or of its companion volume , " Poems of the Past and the Present " ( 1901 ) . I will not even join issue with those critics who treated the books , on the whole , with less courtesy than they deserved ? not so much as formal poetry , but as the sincere expression of a mind and heart exceptionally strong and deep , as well as of a writer whose past services to our literature were entitled to great respect . All I wish to do in the rest of this paper is to consider in a somewhat cursory fashion Mr. Hardy 's two latest volumes ? instalments of a work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently , of most of the professional critics , ? the first and second parts of his vast dramatic poem upon the Napoleonic era , entitled " The Dynasts . " Our author was never anything less than bold . We are therefore not surprised to find him announcing on his title page that his drama , when completed , will consist of three parts , nineteen acts , and one hundred and thirty scenes . ' This is not an entirely accurate statement of the facts in the case , as Mr. Hardy presents them ; for the drama is completed already in manuscript , and will be published entire , if the author is sufficiently encouraged by the reception of his work . So , at least , a modest note at the end of the First Part may be interpreted . A clear , fairly long preface endeavors to explain some of the anomalous features of the composition that are likely to shock the conventional critic . We learn that Mr. Hardy 's choice of the " Clash of Peoples " as a subject was " mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the coast where  | George III had his favorite summer residence during the Napoleonic wars . This was the region most alarmed by the Emperor 's plans to invade England , and traditions of that stirring time still linger in the minds of its inhabitants . And here , finally , lay the native village of Nelson 's flag-captain at Trafalgar ? Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy . The " first published result of these three accidents , " to use Mr. Hardy 's own restrained language , was " The Trumpet Major . " When that was finished , he found himself tantalized by having merely touched the fringe of a vast subject which he had not time thoroughly to investigate . He was also piqued by that minimizing of England 's part in the great drama which he found to characterize the imaginative works devoted by continental writers to Napoleon 's career . So he bore the theme in mind , and at last , some Eight years ago , he outlined the " play " which is now perplexing critics . He claims for his work " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a claim which , as far as my knowledge extends , is amply justified . If anything , he is too faithful to the facts ; for , as he confesses , he has paraphrased such spoken or written utterances as he could determine to be authentic ? with the result that he sometimes calls to mind the least poetically happy portions of Shakespeare 's chronicle plays , not a form of drama particularly relished to-day . He intends , he tells us , to give a list of his authorities in the Third Part . It ought to be valuable ; but I at least should prefer an essay dealing both with Mr. Hardy 's adventures among books and documents , and with the travels which I suspect account for some of the remarkable descriptions of localities with which the stage-directions ? Europe is its real stage ? of this colossal drama abound . ' " It was thought proper , " the author next proceeds to tell us , " to introduce as supernatural spectators of the terrestrial drama , certain ' It almost seems as if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind the enthusiastic passage in DeFoe 's " Compleat Gentleman , " where that learned student of geography describes the pleasures that lie open to a reader with tastes similar to his own : " How agreeable a diversion is it to him to read the public prints with his colleccion of maps and charts before him , where he can see the British Squadron blocking up the Spanish Plate Fleet at Porto Belo , and immediately turn his eye and see another British Squadron , awing the Russian Navy at Revell and Narve , and they , tho ' double in number , not daring to put to sea to succour the Spaniards . The next moment he has turn 'd over a leaf , and the like chart presents Gibraltar to his view , and the Spaniards battering themselves to pieces instead of the town , and wasting their army in a fruitless , unskillfull seige , without so much as comeing near enough to draw a sword in the whole war . There also he sees another English Squadron keeping the seas open and convoying troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town in overmatching all the forces of Spain , whether by land or by sea . "  | impersonated abstractions , or Intelligences , called Spirits . " His defence of these " contrivances of the fancy " is interesting , and amounts to a confession that mythology and " the celestial machinery " of " Paradise Lost " being hopelessly antiquated , and some comment both human and extra-human upon the passing show seeming desirable , there was need of a " scheme of contrasted choruses " which should give a " modern expression of a modern outlook . " How modern the outlook and the expression are may be judged from the fact that " the First or Fundamental Entity " is not referred to by the Spirits as God or He , but as It . At this point we may cease to condense Mr. Hardy 's preface , in order to consider what he himself evidently regards as a crucial feature of his drama , if drama it may be called . Was there any real need for the creation of these spiritual witnesses and commentators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy succeeded in making them acceptable ? I am inclined to answer the first question in the negative , although it is interesting to have sympathetic and ironical and oracular comments upon so tremendous a cataclysm , when one knows that they are made by Thomas Hardy , whether or not they represent his personal opinions . But such readers as " The Dynasts " is likely to secure are fairly competent to make their own comments upon the scenes unfolded before them ; and Mr. Hardy , in making his , has felt obliged on many occasions to present them in lyrical verse , a form of expression in which , me judice , he is far from an adept . With the substance , the thought of his choruses , I have no quarrel , though doubtless it would be easy to quarrel with it from certain points of view ; but with the form there seems to be room for dissatisfaction . Lyrical charm is almost completely absent , and lyrical power is almost frustrated , save exceptionally , by a strained diction and a rhythmical roughness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to the matter later , and will only record here my belief that , if Mr. Hardy had omitted his choruses , he would have greatly diminished the number of his hostile or unsympathetic readers and critics . After explaining his introduction of spirits , Mr. Hardy informs us that no attempt has been made to secure for such a " chronicle piece " the " completely organic structure of action " and the " development of character and motive " that are " demanded in a drama strictly selfcontained . " The reader , ? that is , the spectator in thought , since " The Dynasts " is clearly " a play intended simply for mental performance , and not for the stage , " ? must become a " performer whenever called upon , " must fill in the gaps , or such " a historical presentment on an intermittent plan , in which the dramatis personae number some hundreds , becomes in his individual case unsuitable . "  | As for the objection of the critics that " to declare a drama as being not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicate cancel each other , " Mr. Hardy argues that the " question seems to be an unimportant matter of terminology . " That it is a matter of terminology may be freely confessed ; that it is unimportant will not be readily admitted by any critic who has been perplexed by the vagueness of the terms employed by his fellow-critics . It might have been wiser to have entitled this colossal creation a dramatic poem , or , since many scenes are in prose , a dramatic composition . It might also have been more prudent for Mr. Hardy to have refrained from speculating whether " mental performance alone may not eventually be the fate of all drama other than that of contemporary or frivolous life . " With skilful wielders of blank verse struggling heroically to write tragedies , with dramatic schools and chairs of dramatic literature being established among us , it would seem polite to cast no doubt whatsoever upon the probability that the twentieth century will witness the creation of a poetic drama in English surpassing that of the glorious days of Elizabeth and James . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance of what he regards as illusions , and I , for one , have found the closing pages of his preface interesting and suggestive . We are now in the presence of the monstrous performance itself , and we first encounter a table of contents long enough for a treatise , and a list of characters entering the First Part in which the individuals who bear historic names number no less than eighty , if I can trust my count , though some of them , it should be noted , do no speaking . As for the spirits and the unnamed soldiers , sailors , courtiers , and citizens , they would certainly require the Napoleonic Empire for a stage . It is less of an exaggeration to state that the men decidedly outnumber the women , though I may premise here that the scenes in which the Empress Josephine and Queen Louisa of Prussia are brought forward in the Second Part , where women come more to the front , are among the best that Mr. Hardy has achieved . The Fore Scene is given over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The free trajection of our entities ? shows plainly enough why some critics are disconcerted at Mr. Hardy 's appearance as a poet . The prosaic quality of the word moves in the following passage , together with the misplaced rhyme it makes , deepens our compassion for the perplexed critics : Our thought being now reflexed To forces operant on this English isle ,  | Behooves it us to enter scene by scene , And watch the spectacle of Europe 's moves In her embroil ? Yet shortly afterward we have four lines that at least serve to show why Mr. Hardy believes in his own capacity to write poetry : We 'll close up Time , as a bird its van , We 'll traverse Space , as Spirits can , Link pulses severed by leagues and years , Bring cradles into touch with biers . One finishes the Fore Scene with the feeling that one has been reading a mixture of prose and poetry , chaotic but impressive through a pervading force of imagination and reflection . This feeling persists for all the scenes in which the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the acts and scenes that follow would demand considerable space ; to comment upon them , however briefly , would be out of the question . It must suffice to say that the play begins on a " Ridge in Wessex , " in March , 1805 , with a conversation between passengers in a stage coach , which in its realism reminds us of the Hardy we once thought we knew . Then the scene shifts to the office of the Minister of Marine in Paris , and we have an unfamiliar Hardy essaying blank-verse . A by no means feeble scene in the old House of Commons follows , Sheridan and Fox baiting Pitt , and that statesman replying ? all in verse that is fairly adequate , and in a realistic tone that makes me at least feel that Mr. Hardy has succeeded better in representing a deliberative assembly than Robert Browning did in " Strafford . " Skipping to the third scene of the second act , we come upon the camp and harbor of Boulogne , and upon one of the very best features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of the locality and of a dumb-show that takes place before the characters begin to speak . Some of these descriptions are most strikingly imaginative , and are worthy of Hardy , the novelist , at his best . In this third scene , Napoleon , whom Mr. Hardy consistently presents as Napoleon , makes his first appearance . It is doing no injustice either to him or to our author to say that we prefer the next scene but one which shows us Egdon Heath once more , with two old men waiting to light the signal fires and " Private Cantle of the Locals and his wife Keziar down at Bloom's-End " ? all of whom might have stepped out of " The Return of the Native . " Skipping still ? I do it here for the reader 's sake , but felt no inclination whatever to do it for my own sake when I was reading the book ? we arrive at the first scene of the fourth act , which gives us a very satisfaetory dialogue between Pitt and Geoge III , an unfortunate monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene shifts  | to Ulm , and we have an opportunity of judging how Mr. Hardy will handle what must be the main material of the writer that deals with Napoleon ? the movements of leaders and troops . It seems to me that in his battle scenes he has grappled manfully with his difficulties and , on the whole , attained a success worthy of much praise . Certainly the fifth act , which is mainly devoted to Trafalgar , is a vivid presentation of that tremendous event ; and the dying scene of Nelson contains real poetry , which , however , is exchanged in the closing chorus for a jumble of words , not precisely for doggerel . The sixth act gives us Austerlitz and the death of Pitt , and is a natural breaking-point for the First Part . I , myself , do not see how ally reader interested in a great historic period and endowed with a fair appreciation of imaginative literature can put down the opening volume of " The Dynasts " without feeling that it is a remarkably able book , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem . To judge it technically as drama , or as poetry , and , finding it wanting , to forbear to ask whether a composition so pregnant with thought and imagination is not a piece of literature that transcends the conventional categories and canons and as yet defies analysis , seems to me a rather blind and hazardous procedure . The way in which American critics have been forced to accept as poetry what thirty and forty years ago most cultivated readers denominated the " barbaric yawps " of Walt Whitman ought to induce in the critics of " The Dynasts " a reserve and caution which thus far many of them have not displayed . And if a writer who essays blank verse can not be a poet unless he uses that measure as Tennyson did , what becomes of Robert Browning and not a few of our early dramatists ? The Second Part , though it also is divided into six acts , is longer than the First Part , and , mirabile dictu , contains a good many more characters . If I am not mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poetic quality . A very fair proportion of its forty-three scenes seem to rise above the adequate to the good ; and , even if we deny to each and every scene the epithet great , we are not thereby stopped from asking ourselves whether we are justified in denying that epithet to the volume as a whole . At the very least it is an impressive composition , which only a great writer could have conceived and executed . It begins in Fox 's lodgings , Arlington Street , carries us to Jena , Berlin , Tilsit ? where Napoleon , Alexander of Russia , and Queen Louisa play the leading parts , and most interestingly ? then to Spain , where the licentious Queen and Don Manuel Godoy , Prince of Peace , give us all the evidence we need of the moral rottenness of the Bourbons , and of the necessity of that role of scourge which Napoleon was permitted by Providence to play .  | The part he played in the divorce of Josephine it would be somewhat impious to- saddle on Providence , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the Emperor and Empress comport themselves as a truly great dramatist might have done . Still , he can not fairly be said to have fallen short of effectiveness either in the scenes devoted to this domestic tragedy , or in those that give us the wooing and espousing of Marie Louise . As for the scenes dealing with Wagram , Talavera , Walcheren , and Torres Videas , they perhaps surpass the battle scenes in Part First ; and the pathetic scene with the mad George III in the room in Windsor Castle makes us feel that Hardy the playwright has not lost the skill Hardy the novelist had in sounding the depths of the human heart . And we know that he is still the same master of irony , when we close this second volume with the entertainment at Carlton House , where the Prince Regent , later to be his unmajestic Majesty George IV , " sits like a lay figure , in a state chair of crimson and gold , with six servants at his back . " Even the final chorus does not deter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the third instalment of this amorphous but none the less memorable literary experiment . Hark at the wind-combed Ural pines ; See how each , pendulum-wise , inclines ; Mark the cloud 's labyrinthine lines ; Behold the tumbling Biscay Bay ; The midland main in silent sway ; As urged to move them , so move they . No less through regal puppet-shows The rapt Determinator throes , That neither good nor evil knows ! This is not great lyrical poetry ; there is probably little , if any , great dramatic poetry throughout the multitude of scenes ; but there is some good , and a great deal of passable , verse ; there is some excellent prose ; and there is a continuous manifestation of imagination and intelligence for which I am glad to acknowledge myself deeply grateful . It is not my duty to insist that Mr. Hardy should have given us in the past ten years another novel worthy to stand beside " Tess " and " The Return of the Native . " He has chosen to give us " The Dynasts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of that extraordinary work that is not respectful , and , if condemnatory , at least somewhat tentative .
