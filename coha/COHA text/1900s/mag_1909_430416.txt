WITH the establishment of children 's reading rooms in the public libraries , and with the problem of how best to govern the reading of young people , there has recently been emphasized the corresponding problem as to how far the parent should be considered as an immediate library factor . The public library is a. democratic institution ; while there is a desire to place books of the highest quality upon the shelves , the librarian must perforce strike a medium as well , for one can hardly expect all children to possess the same mental caliber , or to be endowed with the same power of retention . The library has to consider the children of labor quite as much as those of the " well-to-do , " and statistics will show that the reading done by the former class is of a higher quality than that done by the latter . Furthermore , there is a distinction to be made between the American poor and the foreign poor in our own country . The former regard public privileges in the light of their right as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they interpret the opportunity as a special privilege , and their enthusiasm carries them a greater distance . That the parents should consider the quality of reading done by their children is a foregone conclusion . That in our large cities where the library has become a system the parent does not show that interest is likewise a foregone conclusion . The library authorities are now concerned as to how the interest of the parent can most successfully be enlisted in the work which the children 's reading rooms are trying to accomplish . The woman who works from morning till night has little time in which to examine children 's books . The woman whose business is leisure has likewise little time , because the spirit of indifference has been developed in her through the fact that the state has taken unto itself the education of her child , as well as the direction of his reading . But there is a mean between these two . The children 's librarian guarantees that the shelves contain only those books which are suitable for girls and boys , from the picture-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are issued all over the country are a fair indication of how desirous the librarians are to assist the parent in solving this problem of book selection . But even though the children 's rooms are accomplishing good results , there is still that lack of the parent 's immediate interest which would do much to increase the usefulness of the room as a cultural force . Many librarians govern their room through the policy of trying to infuse into it a spirit of " homeiness . " They recognize that there are many children who are deprived of childhood associations because of the fact that from their earliest years they are surrounded by the strenuous atmosphere of a struggle for existence . But they adopt that policy quite as much for some of the " well-todo " children , who are subjected at home to an atmosphere of artificiality which is even more warping to their natures . After all , the librarian has to interpret the feelings of children from the standpoint of when she was their age ; she will comprehend the desires of her young readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed . Her duties , however , are so multifarious , and the children who come to her desk so different in temperament , that she finds it hard to reckon fully with the individual , to give to each boy and girl that direct attention which can only be based upon an intimate knowledge of the individual capabilities and the individual dreams . This is where the parent 's assistance is indispensable , and unfortunately this is where the parent is lacking . In a general way , we would say that the indifference of the average parent as to what children read is deplorable . There are some homes where from the earliest  |p398a  years the child is surrounded by books , and there creeps into his system that love for a story which no amount of conscious training could give him . But the average home has now been led to expect that the library will relieve it of any responsibility of this kind . The parent thinks that it is the teacher 's duty to teach , and it is difficult for the public school in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation ; and the instances are rare in the public library when the child comes to the reading room with an adult , or seeks for a book upon the shelves recommended by the parent . Children are particularly sensitive in regard to the way the libraries handle them . The story is told of a boy who entered the room and looked for something to read . In kindly fashion , the librarian approached him . " Well , my clear , " she said , " can I find you a. nice book ? " Quickly the boy flashed round and said , " I ai n't your clear , and I 'll find my own book . " In some respects this is a good indication of a child 's recognition that there is a difference between the librarian and the parent . Since it is now generally recognized that the children 's reading room needs the parent as an essential factor , there confronts the librarian for answer the all-important question : How shall the co-operation of the parent be gained ? In our public schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the teacher is brought into direct contact with the parent . The two meet at a semi-social function , where , relieved of some of the official stiffness , they may tape up the requirements or delinquencies of individual pupils . While it is not the province of the librarian to do too much of this social work , she has found it necessary herself to attend some of these meetings , and to give the parents some idea of what books are best suited for children of different ages . Curiously , with the establishment of so many Carnegie libraries , it has been found that many parents have remained away ' because of the fact that they have been awed by the inspiring amplitude of the building . In some of the tenement districts the mothers and fathers are actually afraid of the " official " look of the building , and the librarian is now trying to counteract this timidity . She goes to the mothers ' meetings in the school , because she knows that it is only at the school that she can reach those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give their children good picture books to look at , she suggests suitable stories for parents to tell their children , she begs them not to depend wholly upon the library for books , but when they can afford it , to buy books for their children . And as a result I have in mind instances which will cover two of the points emphasized . A year after the suggestion was made by a librarian for parents to read aloud to the children before going to bed , a German mother met the librarian and told her that she had tried the experiment and found it splendid . Soon after the suggestion had been offered that children should buy books a little girl brought the librarian forty cents and asked her to get some book for her . The libraries are now beginning to issue book lists which shall serve as guides to parents in their shopping . Especially notable in this direction is The Child 's Own Library , issued by the Brooklyn Public Library . In the prefatory note , Miss Hunt , the compiler , writes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first year to cultivate a taste for the best literature . The fine old hymns , the jingling nurseryrhymes , the beautiful picture books , will interest and charm the very youngest . Bible stories , fairy tales and fables , Stevenson 's Child Verses , will be enjoyed at a surprisingly early age ; while at four , a child whose mother has read aloud to him every day will take delight in many things which would grade for fifth-year pupils to read by themselves . If the old and beautiful custom of reading aloud to children before bedtime every night in the year could be revived in every American family , its influence would be of inestimable good to the nation . " There is no need for us to say that we do not know exactly what position a parent should hold as a library factor ; the position emphasizes itself . Yet , though the position is there to be filled , the parent still needs educating as to how to fill it . The work being done by the library has not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a librarian one night just before the closing hour and said to her : " What for you do to my boy ! He reads de books , he tells de oders all ' bout it , and he stays in de house nights . He have only one licking since he read liberries for staying out late . I tank you . " These instances of appreciation are more  |p398b  common in communities that are provincial ; and it must always be borne in. mind that the conditions confronting a large city differ materially from those confronting a small one . The foreign parents need to be- educated to a better understanding of the benefits offered by a public library . Many of them believe that a child 's time is wasted when he sits down to read . Many of them do not even realize , in the face of their struggle for existence , that a child must be given time to study , and time to go to the library in order to look up certain facts . This is not the education that well-to-do parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ease of personal comfort should not extend into the realm of intellectual effort . There is some truth in what a librarian said regarding the reason for the difference between the solid reading done by the children of poor parents and the light reading done by the children of rich parents . This reason is , that the latter do not care to give their boys and girls any reading material that will put them to personal discomfort . They wish their children to assimilate their reading easily , and they are loath to give them books which are sufficiently beyond their comprehension to stimulate them and make them work mentally . This accusation may seem somewhat hard , but it is nevertheless true . The library system has grown so within the last few years , that it has perhaps taken unto itself too much of that responsibility which should belong to the parent . Now that the children 's reading rooms are organized , the parent as a library factor should be absolutely required . Not only should a mother and father stand guarantee when a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to the library room in order to examine the juvenile books upon the shelves . The reading card of a boy and girl should be so arranged that at a glance the parent 's attention can be drawn to the character of reading the child is doing month by month . The women 's clubs should be in co-operation with the libraries , as to deciding what books are best for children to read . We have plenty of good books , stories that are not inane , non-fiction that is not so matter-of-fact that it is regarded by the child as a task rather than as a pleasure , fairy tales that are not so scientific as to be folk-lore , poems that are not so hackneyed as to be wearisome . All these things are the heritage of every child ; and yet few parents have sufficient knowledge of them to be aware of their true value . Book lists are suggestive , and the librarians are conscientious in their efforts to make these lists complete ; but they realize that it is the parent 's duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents in one scale with the temperamental make-up of the child in the other . Library statistics are constantly striving to show the increase in circulation . Circulation means absolutely nothing , unless the spirit behind this circulation is active . One city will boast that children are drawing from the library more nonfiction than in an adjoining town ; but that town may have a different point of view ? it may claim that while this statement is true , on the other hand the children of its community are reading a better class of fiction , which means that the imaginative stimulus of those children is of a more healthy character . After all , the children 's reading room , while it may be considered an educational institution , is primarily a room in which the children mentally are supposed to be given a good time . While the library is rightfully involved with the school problem , and while the school is rightfully involved with the library problem , still compulsory education on the one hand is different from the voluntary love of reading for reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made , one which I have had occasion to emphasize before , the undeniable fact that above the public school child and the public library child is the home child , and in this distinction is to be found another reason why the parent should be considered as a library factor . No teacher can reach that understanding of a child that a parent can . The New England conscience has made this thoroughly understood by the New England parent even to this day , and we find the smaller libraries throughout the New England states co-operating with the parent . But despite the fact that the opportunity lies at the very door of the parent , the librarian is in a position where she understands better how to stimulate , how to attract the attention of boys and girls ; and it is herein that she is able , at mothers ' meetings or at Saturday morning meetings held in the library building itself , to offer suggestions which  |p398c                    @ @
