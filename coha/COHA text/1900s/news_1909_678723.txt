txt WASHINGTON , Dec. 4 . ? Senator Charles A. Culberson of Texas to-day resigned his post as leader of the minority in the Senate on account of ill-health , and , in spite of the requests of his friends , refused to reconsider his decision . Mr. Culberson is now at Atlantic City , where he has been for a week fighting a case of grip , and he is not expected in Washington until after the holidays . His resignation came in the form of a , letter today to Senator Money of Mississippi , Vice Chairman of the Democratic caucus . In it he said : As ' you and all my Democratic associates know , I have not been at all well for nearly a year . Last March I had a severe attack of the grippe . Without taking the necessary rest 1. - oin such an attack , I remained In Washington in attendance upon the senate throughout the recent extra session . The result was that I continued ill during all the session , and at its close I was much reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered in the comparatively short vacation which I have been able to take . The approaching session of the Congress promises to be a long . exacting and arduous one , and , in my present condition , I do not feel that I should undertake the extra duties which will devolve upon the chairman or our caucus . It would probably retard or prevent my early and full restoration to health . The Democratic caucus will meet on Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock to elect Mr. Culberson 's successor . Every Demo- ' eratle Senator in the city is said to favor . giving the leadership to Mr. Money , and though Mr. Money 's own health is not . strong and he retires for good from thi Senate in two years , it is thought that sufficient pressure will be brought to bear on him to . induce him to accept the ; post . Other possible candidates are Senator Bailey of Texas , to whom the posk was offered once before , and Senator Ba-o= con of Georgia , ranking Democrat on that Committee on Foreign Rrelations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason assigned /31 ? . ; him for his resignation , it is known 014 other causes have contributed to his deq , ) cision to leave the leadership of the part to other hands . In his own State he hail I been severely criticised , while his leaders j ship of the Senate minority has always . been regarded as a compromise affair , ae ? his selection was due more to his lack of enemies than to any definite following . In Texas , Mr. Culberson 's rigid adherence to the declared party policy on , tariff matters was not well received . There has always been an undercurrent of antag4 onism between him . and his junior . Mr* - Bailey , and last yeir their votes on man of the moot points over which the Demo-0 cratic Party split were found in opposite 1 columns . Mr. Bailey voted for duties olv ? hides , iron ore , and other things whilt* Mr. Culberson , though voting with hil colleagues on hides , stood out for the . lower duties against Senator Aldrich on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , however , has chiefly been for his failure to make the most of his opportunities . He was blamed for letting Senator Bailey assume the prac- , tical leadership of the minority on the floor and in general for letting go of the ' fruits of his place . In the fight for the ? income tax amendment to the Constitution Mr. Bailey was actually made floor leader , and in the tariff debate , though his course was often flatly against the mandate of the party platform and was not at all satisfactory to his colleagues . his fluency of speech gave him a certain prominence . It is certain that Mr. Bailey could nor get the leadership by a unanimous vote . and that was his reason for declining the post before . Mr. Money , if he will accept it , will cause no dissentions- in the party and will probably be elected by an unanimous vote . But Mr. Money is 70 years old and feels the weight of his years . His eyesight has almost failed him , and though he is recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches are read afterward for their literary flavor. his low-speaking voice weakens his effectiveness on the floor . Once last year . however , Mr. Money showed that he could rise to an occasion and uphold the best traditions of Democratic oratory . It was when Senator Root . then serving the first few weeks of his term as Senator , assailed the unbusiness .. like methods of Senator La Follette . Bristow , and other insurgents  --  all his seniors . In one of the most effective speeches ever heard in the Senate , Mr. Money , like a father scolding a foolhardy son , told Mr. Root that his comments were those only of a young Senator and that he would do well , instead of trying to make Senator change their well-tried ways , to act himself like a . Senator . Senator Bacon of Georgia , who Is als mentioned for the place , will certainly fail of election . His speeches were fa.j mous for their length and dreariness an &; should he be raised to the leadership it le/ feared that they would never end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Money at once wired to Atlantic City urging delay untit Mr. Culberson could talk the matter ovefi with his friends . An answer came from ; Mr. Culberson saying that his decisio was final . When Mr. Culberson passe through here a week ago he told Mr Money that he was thinking Of resignin the leadership . Mr. ' Money urged against it then .
