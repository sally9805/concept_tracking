WHEN Napoleon caused the names of his dead soldiers to be inscribed on the face of Pompey 's Pillar , some one criticised the act as " a mere bit of imagination . " " That is true , " replied Napoleon , " but imagination rules the world . " The subject of imagination is a large one . Even our morals come , in part , from the imagination , ? as the virtue of pity . Doubtless it would be impossible for a human being absolutely devoid of imagination to feel the emotion of pity . But let us consider the application of imagination to one thing : namely , to business . It would be easy to trace the world 's inventions to its imaginative men , and tell of the gain to the individual from a single thought . We had all watched children go scuffling along to school , stubbing their toes at every step , and it meant nothing to us . But one day an imaginative man watched them , and saw the effect of putting a thin strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world gave him a million dollars . It could afford to , out of the many millions it saved . Or , leaving inventions aside , we might trace the imagination which made the waterfall of Niagara feed the electric lamps in the city of Buffalo , twenty miles away . But , confining our thoughts within an even smaller circle , let us follow the workings of the imagination in the most material form of business , ? that of ordinary merchandising . I believe that imagination is as valuable ? I do not say as essential , but as valuable ? in the management of trade , as in any of the arts . It is as valuable , it is as applicable , and with the single exception of the art of literature , it is as essential . But just what do we mean by imagination ? If our research is to be carried to any distance , the word should be clearly defined . Is not the best definition , to put it concisely , this : Imagination is the synthesis of the mind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the putting together of things into a compound , not the separation of a compound into its parts . It is the relating of one thought or object to another and different one ; or , rather , the relating of separate elements or objects . Its nature is dual ; it manifests itself in two directions , ? range and intensity . here on the wall hangs h sword carried in the Civil War . Two men of imagination look at it . One of them instantly imagines the conditions of society which brought about the war ; he thinks of slavery , of the horrors of the middle passage , of the scenes of terror in the Bight of Benin , and lo , in a twinkling he is a hundred years and three thousand miles away from that sword . That is range . The second man looks at the same sword , and he sees the battle , the charge at the fortifications , and the fearful slaughter . He hears the bugles blowing the advance , and he listens to the deafening roar of the cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounded sound in his ears . Already a whole epic is acting itself out upon the stage of his brain , and that simple sword is its beginning and its end . That is intensity . Imagination , then , is the ability , upon seeing any object , to construct around that object its probable or possible environment ; thus , apprehending any force , to realize what produced it , and what it will produce . The man of imagination writes a drama . His dramatic instinct apprehends the power of contrasts ; he constructs a plot ; he realizes what each person will do , and why he will do it . His characters take possession of his will ; they act out their own destiny , ? often against their author 's own desire . He relates it all together . Take the simplest instance of this relating of one thing to another in business . Let me say here , in passing , that I shall not introduce into this article any supposititious occurrences ; each illustration is an actual fact , either in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And one other point : it is difficult at times to draw the line between imagination and sagacity . Starting in sagacity , a man 's action often proceeds by imagination . The two become blended . Perhaps it is not too much to claim that , as sagacity emerges from the present , the existing , and the seen , into the future , the unborn , and the unapprehended , it becomes imagination . I shall try to confine myself to instances of action which proceed forth from imagination . We were about to consider the simplest illustration of this relating of one thing to another in business . Let me tell the story of two bootblacks . We can scarcely go lower in the business scale . These two boys , of about the same age , I found standing , one Saturday afternoon , on opposite sides of a crowded thoroughfare in Springfield . So far as could be judged , there was no preference between the different sides of the street , for an equally large crowd seemed to be moving on both sides . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box slung over his shoulder , and , standing on the curbstone , solicited the passers-by to stop and have a shine . Each boy had one " call , " or method of solicitation , which he repeated at regular intervals . The two solicitations were entirely different , but each was composed of four words . They never varied them . Yet one of these boys , by the peculiar wording of his solicitation , secured twice as much business as the other , so far as one could judge , and I watched them for a long time . The cry of the first boy was , " Shine your boots here . " It announced the simple fact that he was prepared to shine their boots . The cry of the second boy was , " Get your Sunday shine ! " It was then Saturday afternoon , and the hour was four o'clock . This second boy employed imagination . He related one attraction to another ; he joined facts together ; his four simple words told all that the first boy said , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply that he was there to shine shoes , but that to-morrow was Sunday ; that from present appearances it was likely to be a pleasant day ; that he , as a bootblack , realized they would need an extra good shine ; and , somehow , the sentence had in it a gentle reminder that the person on whose ears it fell had heretofore overlooked the fact that the next day was the Sabbath , and that any self-respecting Christian would wish his shoes shined before he repaired to the sanctuary . Perhaps it was merely good luck that this boy secured twice the business of the other , but I have seen too many of such experiences to think of them as accidental . Take another case , not in my own experience , but which happened to Heinemann , the European publisher . He once noticed two peddlers standing side by side , selling toy dolls . One of them had a queer , fat-faced doll , which he was pushing into the faces of the passers-by , giving it the name of a well-known woman reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling rapidly , while the man beside him , who had a really more attractive doll , was doing comparatively little business . A thought occurred to Heinemann , and he tried an experiment . Calling the second peddler to one side , " My friend , " he said , " do you want to know how to sell twice as many of these dolls as you are selling now ? Hold them up in pairs , two together in each hand , and cry them as The Heavenly Twins . ' " The toy-vender somewhat grudgingly followed his ad-I ice . It was at a time when Sarah Grand 's famous novel was at the height of its popularity , and the title of the book was on every one 's tongue . Perhaps it was merely another case of good luck , but the Heavenly Twins dolls were an instantaneous success , and within one hour the vender of the woman-reformer dolls gave up the fight , acknowledged himself beaten , and moved five blocks down the street to escape the ruinous competition . Here , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case it was the relating of a popular name to an absolutely foreign subject . Of course the relation was wholly illogical , but it " got there " just the same . The imaginative man sends his thought through all the instincts , passions , and prejudices of men ; he knows their desires , and their regrets ; he knows every human weakness and its sure decoy . Let me illustrate now that use of the imagination in business which is cleverly built on the frailties of mankind . It may be instanced in as many ways as there are human weaknesses . Under this head comes the subscription book , offered to you in a delicately-worded circular , explaining that an edition of two hundred copies only is to be printed , and the plates then destroyed , thereby ensuring the rarity of the book . If we stop and think a moment , we recognize that here is a direct appeal to vanity and selfishness . Yet how it works ! Men are gratified even to be included in the list of recipients of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tantamount to an insult , for it assumes your overmastering allay and selfishness , by making its strongest appeal in this direction . Another weakness in human nature is the inability to throw away an element of value , even though it'cannot be utilized . Many years ago a firm of large retailers of Oriental rugs in this country , the representative of leading houses in Smyrna and Constantinople , found itself overloaded with goods . The situation was critical , unless a certain part of their stock could be turned over at once . The firm had but one proposition to make : namely , a great sacrifice sale of its smaller sizes of rugs , with a reduction in price of from fifty to sixty per cent , to ensure the movement of at least a thousand rugs , at retail , within one week . An average price on small Oriental rugs ? take them as they come ? would be $30 to $35 . This called for an average loss of profit on each rug of from $15 to $20 . But just here imagina- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , which was based upon the inability of the average person voluntarily to throw away an element of value . This was twenty years ago , and the plan has since lost much through familiarity ; but in those days it was a novelty , and it worked most effectively . Briefly , it purposed ? not to sell rugs , oh , dear , no ! ? but to determine the relative advertising merits of the different newspapers of the city in which this house was located . A test was to be made for six days . Of course , the firm was willing to pay something for such information , and so in each paper there was printed a facsimile of a one-dollar bill , made out in the name of the firm , and good during the next six days , to the extent of one dollar , on the purchase of any Oriental rug at their establishment . The imitation one-dollar note was somewhat crude , but in size and general appearance it suggested a dollar bill , and results showed that it was difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least , they found it as hard to let it go unused , as if it had been indeed a genuine dollar . To all intents and purposes it was a one-dollar bill , provided it was spent at a certain store during a certain limit of time , and for a certain article . It seems incredible'now , for the experiment was not 436 Imagination tried in a large city , yet within three days the volume of rugs sold amounted to the largest total yearly discount limit ; in other words , the greatest discount given to any retail house , if the volume of its sales in one year could he made to equal this total . The anticipation of one thousand rugs was far exceeded in the performance , and the week ended with sales of sixteen hundred rugs . On these there had been a total discount of sixteen hundred dollars , with but little more than the customary daily amount of advertising , and a complete saving of the large sacrifice which had at first seemed to the firm to be inevitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it failed , the firm must have suffered ten days ' delay at a time of pressing necessity . I had faith in the plan , however , because it was founded on a principle in human nature , ? the inability to throw away an element of value . Mark this fact ! It was not the price . It never is . It was the reason for the price . If , instead of giving the buyer one dollar toward his purchase money , they had taken twelve dollars off the rug , there might have been sold , perhaps , two hundred of those rugs ? scarcely more But by making one-twelfth as good an offer in a more imaginative form , they sold ? not two hundred rugs , but sixteen hundred . That is imagination in business ! When the late Phillips Brooks held series of religious services on Sunday evenings in Faneuil Hall , some doubt was expressed as to the size of the audi-ence , since it was plainly announced that these services were for the " waifs " and " strays " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young men who had the matter in hand left to me the ques-tion of deciding what course would in-sure the largest possible attendance . I went the first night , and found the hall well filled . The second night the attend-ance had dwindled perceptibly , and the third Sunday night there was scarcely more than half an audience . I called the committee together , and told them that in Business the audience had grown so small that we must hereafter have admission wholly by ticket . I still remember their consternation at this proposal . Their argument was a very natural one : if you can not get people to come now , when there is no barrier whatever to their coming , how do you expect to get them to come when you refuse to admit them unless they have a ticket ? But we carried the plan through , and thereafter no one was admitted who did not have a ticket . From that night the hall was full at every service . The ticket resembled in appearance a season ticket to the most expensive course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the people who got these tickets found it quite impossible to sacrifice an element of value , however slight that value was . They were entitled to attend divine service that night at Paneuil Hall , while Tom , Dick , and Harry , their neighbors , were not . And this slight advantage many of them could not relinquish . Mr. Moody , the evangelist , found it necessary to employ this same method when he held services in the great tabernacle on Tremont Street many years ago . His attendance , large at first , soon fell off materially ; but Mr. Moody , to correct this , announced that attendance would be by ticket only ; within a week the great tabernacle was crowded at every service , and this continued up to the last meeting . II Perhaps we might leave the domain of hilliness for one moment , and remind ourselves of the working of this law in the privacy of our own homes , when one 's wife says , " My dear , there are only a few more of these strawberries left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd eat them up to-night so they wo n't spoil ! " There is the clement of value again , which so rarely can be thrown away gracefully . But returning to business , let me relate another experience along the same line . It happened back in the eighties , but human nature has not changed in the intervening twenty years . A leading organ manufactory found that by actual count they had , in the preceding fifty years , manufactured and sold a larger number of organs than any other maker in the world . In other words , they held the world 's record of sales , the number being 200,000 . The problem was to determine how best to utilize the advantage contained in this fact . I suggested that they utter a prize for the best popular conception of the number 200,000 ; that they publish this offer widely throughout the country , which , in itself , would call attention in an interesting way to the fact that they had manufactured 200,000 organs . They were then to take the fifty best conceptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and publish the whole in an attractive pamphlet , of which they should issue an edition large enough to make the cost of t he book not to exceed one cent . It could be mailed for another cent , so that they : multi supply them to the public at a cost of two cents ; or , in other words , any one enclosing a two-cent stamp in a letter would receive the book by snail ; and if a large number of these books could be distributed , it would be substantially free advertising , for it would be advertising which involved no expenditure beyond the sending away of the books . It was found that an edition of 100,000 copies would have to be printed to bring the cost to Ibis low limit , and the finn questioned whether so many as this could be disposed of by a simple offer that the book would be sent on receipt of a two-cent stamp . But their doubts yielded to my arguments , and they issued the book . Pour months later , in discussing another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispose of the book , and their chagrin at finding so large an edition on their hands , which they could not use . It appeared , on further conversation , that to dispose of them they had advertised them once in the Youth 's Companion , a paper which at that time had a circulation of over 400,000 copies . They showed me the advertisement . It measured about six inches , single column , and , in good plain type , announced that a book entitled " How Large is 200,000 ? " had been prepared , with over fifty illustrations , finely printed , making an attractive volume of forty-eight pages , which would be sent free on receipt of a two-cent stamp . In all the time which had elapsed since that advertisement had appeared , they had received 788 replies , and , consequently , an edition of 99,212 books was still upon their hands . The man who was responsible for this operation felt his humiliation , but nevertheless he believed that he could get rid of those books , by an advertisement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller space ? virtually a mere repetition of the previous offer . Accordingly , the following advertisement appeared . At the top were the words , PRIZE REBUS . Under this heading there was a simple rebus , one of the old-fashioned kind so dear to the " regular subscriber , " although this particular puzzle was so easy of solution that any person of ordinary intelligence could not fail to work it out in a reasonable time . Under the rebus was the offer , which was to the effect that the books had been prepared , that a certain edition had been printed , that no more would be thereafter printed , and that the books would not be distributed thereafter upon request , but would be given as prizes to any one who could solve the rebus there given . Of course the rebus , being exceedingly simple , would be readily solved ; it then entitled its interpreter to a book , and we find ourselves at once back on the old ground of a person entitled to an advantage , and called upon to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slight expenditure , or sacrifice the advantage with no expenditure . The advertisement was inserted once , and nothing further was heard from the Organ Company for a time . Then came a letter saying , " Where is this thing going to end ? We have sent out 23,000 books on that one advertisement up to last Saturday night . We have now a force of five women employed in opening letters and mailing books . Had we not better prepare another edition ? " So it went on for ten weeks more , finally breaking all known records for the number of replies from any single advertisement . Now , what was the defect in the first offer ? It employed no imagination . It did not reckon with human nature . Or rather , it went directly contrary to a law of human nature . There is a belief , deep-seated in the human mind , that the thing which you can get for nothing is worth nothing . The public very properly accepted this book at its publisher 's own appraisal ; he offered it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible to go further , and tell how the advantage was followed up in this case , and organs were sold to the people who had solved the prize rebus , but that is what Kipling calls " another story , " and does not properly belong under this particular weakness of human nature . I want to give just one more illustration under this head . A leading publisher conceived the idea of preparing a series of pictures of the great scenes of the Civil War . There were many pictures in the series , and they were finely executed from originals by famous artists . No pains or expense was spared , and , sure of success , a very large edition was printed . They were offered to the public at five dollars each . It was never intended to reduce this price , except to quote a slightly lower rate for the complete series . But the pictures were a dead failure . Some time after they were placed on the market the account on the books of the firm stood charged with an expenditure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $700 , representing the sales of the first six months . Net loss up to that date , $49,300 . It was evident that this was a bad investment . The question was whether it would not be wise , in view of the signal failure of the enterprise , to reduce the pictures to a price of one dollar , which would represent less than the actual manufacturing cost , it is true , but which would go far , if the entire edition of fifty thousand could be sold , to reimburse the company for the very large sum which had been put into these pictures , and which , at present , there seemed to be no way of taking out . The plan was not to spend any money in advertising , but to announce to the trade , and to storekeepers generally , that these five-dollar pictures were now reduced to one dollar . If the plan had been carried out along the lines then proposed , the result must have been an absolute failure . It is doubtful if a thousand more pictures would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its efficacy may be left to the judgment of any student of human nature . A circular was to be prepared and mailed to every member of the Grand Army of the Republic , which at that time numbered over 361,000 men . Enclosed with that circular was to be a receipt for $4 on account , to apply on the purchase of one of the war pictures . It was to be made out in the name of the member and signed by the publishers . The circular was to state that the regular price of the picture was $5 , but that a comrade of any Grand Army Post could secure the picture for the nominal price of $1 . The picture would be delivered to him upon payment of $1 , with the accompanying receipt for $4 , which must be attested by the Secretary of his Post . It was easy to imagine ho* this plan would work . By virtue of his membership in the Grand Army , the recipient was entitled to secure a $5 picture for 81 . The offer would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of his membership in this National Order , had only to pay $1 to secure an equivalent of $5 . Let us admit at once that thousands of these men did not care to pay $1 even for a $5 picture , But how many of them , do you suppose , would tear up the signed receipt for $4 ? Instead , they would keep it in their pocket , look at it every few days , mention it to some of their friends , and end by making the generous offer to one of these friends that if he would like to avail himself of the chance , he could do it in his name . In other words , John Brown , as a G. A. R. man , is entitled to the picture , but John Brown does not care to buy it . I I is friend , John Smith , who is not in the G. A. It , however , will be very glad to take advantage of such an opportunity , and so Brown buys the picture for Smith in his ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4 receipt and Smith 's $1 in money . Inasmuch as the sales of these pictures would be naturally among members of the Grand Army , the offer amounted to a virtual reduction of the price from $5 to $1 ; yet how much more attractive was this form of making the reduction , which preserved the pictures from the shock of a precipitate and sensational discount . nr We have now taken two weaknesses in human nature , namely , selfishness and acquisitiveness , and shown the baser use of the imagination in business , which rears its fabric on such weaknesses ? using the word " baser " not to imply a moral defect , but merely to designate such usages as relatively less pleasing than other instances which might be cited . If time afforded , it would be easily possible to select other weaknesses of mankind , and instance how the imagination is employed in such cases ; then , to take the reverse of these cases , that is , the traits not in themselves weak or base , but of which advantage is taken ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material or concrete , the reasoning by analogy , the impression of value by quantity , the impression of quality by multiplication of argument , andIsimilar instances . It must be remembered always that it is not the price of an article which is important , but the reason for the price . This is one of the backbone truths of merchandising , and when once a seller gets a firm hold of this fact , and is able to apply it in its highest efficiency , he can almost devastate the trade . I have seen on more than one occasion the delight with which a retail advertiser first clearly grasps this idea . We can detect something of it in one of the illustrations just used ; but now what is the reason which underlies this law ? Is it not this : that the argument for the price is the imaginative part of the transaction ; the price itself is absolutely unimaginative . Admit that the reason for the price is an important thing in the transaction , and that a high price with a good reason will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , and it is only reaffirming , in another form , the potentiality of the imagination in business . The bankrupt stock , the fire sale , the manufacturer 's remnants , the annual clearance , the removal sale , the **26;440;TOOLONG sale ? what are these , and many more , but arguments for the price ? And note this one point : that without the argument the price is powerless . Reduce your fur-lined overcoats from $100 to $80 , and your liberal discount attracts little attention . Why ? Because there is no reasonable explanation for the reduction . Why should you present overcoats to the public ? But announce that , owing to an expiration of your lease , and the imperative command that you vacate your present store within two weeks , you will reduce the price of your fur-lined overcoats from $100 to $80 , and you may sell easily all you have to offer . Instinctively , the public sees the whole picture , ? the proprietor 's anxiety , the inevitable removal , the vanishing days , the final sacrifice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity . This is only half the reduction previously considered ; but one is business without imagination , and the other is business with it . 440 Imagination Approach the whole question from another standpoint . Perhaps there is no better index of the value of imagination in business than the immense importance which attaches to the selection of a name for any article . To describe an article in an imaginative vein is to sell it at once to many persons ; merely to give it a good name is to sell it to a few . So important is this matter held to be by those who have successfully grasped the value of imagination in business , that it has been used for no less an object than the stifling of competition . Let us assume that tomorrow you decide to embark in the business of manufacturing a toilet soap , to compete with some of the well-known makers . It is important that it should have a significant or attractive name . That is a first consideration . But , right at the outset , you discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new soap . Its color , transparency , and clearness suggest the title of " amber soap . " Yes , surely " amber soap " does have an attractive sound . But you can not use the word " amber , " for you find that this is one of a list of twenty-four possible names for a toilet soap , preempted by registration as a protectionary measure , years ago , by one of the leading American soap-makers . They have covered over one hundred names in the past quarter of a century , willingly paying the registration charges of twenty-five dollars for every title . Of course , they do not intend to use them ; they register them to fight off competition , believing ( and here is the important point ! ) that no clever business man ( and it is such competition which alone they fear ) ? that no clever business man would embark in the enterprise of manufacturing a new soap , when from the start he was prevented from employing the powerful weapon of imagination in giving it a suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the ablest heads in the business world , believes that it can discourage competition by simply depriving the would-be competitor of in Business the appeal to the imagination in the naming of his soap , how great a value must we attach to imagination in business ! More striking instances of this endeavor to intercept competition may be found by a perusal of the trade-names and trademarks registered in Great Britain . Ten years ago there were only 27,000 trade-names registered in the United States as against 182,000 registered in England . The English , from whom we have borrowed the idea of protection by registration , take most of our American names that have any originality or value , if the owner for any reason has left them unregistered at the expiration of the six months during which the trade-name is protected for filing in Great Britain . English manufacturers have gone to the extent of protecting themselves , not merely in their own line of goods , but in all lines of manufacture , thereby preventing their trade-name from becoming commonplace by its repeated use . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , not merely as the name of a soap , but for practically every article of household use to which the name could be applied . By a peculiarity of the English Copyright laws , it is not permitted to cover every article with one name . The various articles of domestic use are arranged in groups , and one article in each group must be left unprotected , to conform to the law . In this case at hand , no little ingenuity has been used in selecting as the subject of each omission an article to which the name " Sunlight " could scarcely apply ; as , for example , Sunlight Andirons ; I think this was one of the articles in one of the groups left unprotected . The English charge is ? 10 for each registration , exclusive of all fees , and some manufacturers have expended close to $50,000 in this form of protection . When we see shrewd manufacturers investing such sums on their belief that you ruin a man 's chances when you curtail his ability to employ imagination , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? // I shall try now , before concluding this article , to illustrate the use of imagination in business by three business problems . I select them partly because of their remoteness from the present in point of time ( there being little harm in my speaking of the occurrences at this late date ) , and partly because they typify widely different cases . The first is a retail problem , the circumstance of a carpet house . The general question was whether the volume of business could be enlarged . This firm was advertising extensively in the papers , and such advertising is the fool 's first resort , and the wise man 's last one . It is the proper remedy in about one in four cases of the kind here considered . It could hardly be used advantageously in a carpet business , for the reason that carpets are not tempting merchandise . In other words , one is not prompted by any advertisement to rush opt and buy carpets . One buys them when one needs them . The buying of carpets is done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a family decides that it wants a new carpet . This is usually at the strenuous period known as " spring cleaning . " But there is amore important time than this , and that is when the family is removing from one house to another . Probably from twenty to thirty per cent of all buying of carpets is induced by a change of residence . Estimated roughly , there is one day in the year when each householder may buy carpets ; accordingly , on three hundred and sixty-four days of the year the advertising of specific carpets for that man is wasted . For every man it would be wasted three hundred and sixty-four out of three hundred and sixty-five days , and such a proportion of waste will not permit of profitable advertising . The important thing , ! lien , was to get at people when they were about to move , and it seemed at the start that the key to the situation was the real-estate agent . In this direction work was began . . The plan was to secure from real- estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all changes and removals from house to house in that city and its suburbs . The work had proceeded only a short distance , however , before it became evident that this was a wrong analysis of the case . The real-estate agent was not the correct clew ; it was the furniture-mover I Many persons might effect a change of residence , especially in the upper class ( and these changes were most valuable ) , without the transaction passing through the hands of any real-estate agent . But no one could remove from one residence to another , whether it was from a great establishment on Washington Square to another on Fifth Avenue , or whether a lodger with one trunk moved from is room on Bleeker Street to a room on Houston Street , without employing the furniture-mover . Accordingly new plans were laid , a competent man was engaged to carry them out , and work proceeded on the following lines . A club was formed of all the furniture-movers in that city and its suburbs . Of course , there were isolated cases here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but within ten days an organization was perfected , comprising forty-one of the leading furniture-movers , employing seventy-six wagons . A formal agreement was entered into and signed with each furniture-mover . The consideration for which they performed their service was comparatively slight . It has long been a custom with business houses to pay for the painting of a delivery wagon on the condition that it shall bear their advertisement ; the name of the owner then appears in small letters , and the wagon ostensibly is a delivery wagon of the house whose name it bears . It is generally supposed that an advertisement thus painted on a wagon moving about through the streets of a city for a year , is well worth the cost of the painter 's bill . This old idea that furniture-movers like to escape the painting of their wagons was made to do duty here , and the repainting became a part of the compensation given to them under the agreement . Their wagons were all painted with the name of this carpet house ; a further consideration was that the house should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be repainted as often as required , say once in two years , and all repairs were to be paid for unless they were occasioned by gross carelessness . Contracts were made with seven or eight leading carriage-painters in the city in which this occurred , and exceptionally low rates secured by reason of the large quantity of work . Similar contracts were also made with wheelwrights for repairs . To describe the consideration given by the furniture-mover to the carpet house , let me tell what would have happened had you , at any time desiring to move from one part of that city to another , called upon one of these furniture-movers , with a view to securing his services , The conversation might have been substantially on these lines : Customer . I am about to move from 32d Street to 57th Street . I do n't know exactly how many loads there will be , but it is an ordinary houseful of furniture . I should like to know your charge for the job . Furniture-Mover . Where are you now located ? ( Customer gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Customer gives the address . Both replies are at once entered on a slip . ) When do you propose to move ? ( The date is given . ) Just how many loads would there be ? How many rooms are there in the house ? ( Replies noted . ) Customer . Do you employ reliable and satisfactory men ? Furniture-Mover . Yes , sir . Here is my business card , and you will see upon the back of it what John Smith &; Co. , the well-known carpet house , say about me . At this he hands the customer a business card , supplied to him without charge by the carpet house , and on the back of this business card there is a letter from John Smith &; Co. , stating that they understand that this man is a reliable furniture-mover , who employs suitable help . The attitude with which the furniture-mover proudly regards the endorsement of John Smith &; Co. is , in itself , an evidence that in the furniture-moving business , at least , Smith &; Co. is readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime , the customer sees along the curb a number of neat-looking , attractive wagons , on cads of which is the advertisement of John Smith &; Co . By direct agreement with the Smith carpet house , the furniture-mover is obliged to fill out within one hour , and forward to them by mail , a printed blank as follows : ? Name of party about to move : ? ; present address of party : ? ; new location to which he is to move : ; date when he expects to move : ; number of loads he will carry : ; etc. , etc . From forty-five to ninety of these blanks were received daily at the carpet house . When the system was started , it was the custom to send a representative , with samples , to call immediately upon the parties about to move . For a very short time one representative did all this work , but within three months it required six representatives , of whom four went in " sampler " carts built for this especial work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Adams Express money-wagon . The carts were finely fitted up , and contained a complete line of samples , not only of carpetings , but of upholsteries , draperies , shades , etc . The memoranda received at the carpet house went immediately to the manager of the retail department ; by him they were separated according to their locality ; the presumably large customers were handed to the more expert representatives , while some poor devil who was moving with a trunk from one room to another received no call , but , instead , a circular or special letter , according to his importance , in which the house offered its services in connection with any refurnishing which he might have to do , and suggested that one of their representatives call with samples on his daily round , for which , of course , there would be no charge . Meanwhile all newspaper advertising was stopped . The business grew to such size that at the end of a year the carpet house had bought and was operating its own repair and paint shop . The plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was found necessary to employ two men whose sole business it was to go daily among the furniture-movers and keep them sharply up to their end of the agreement , ensuring immediate reports on all names , and complete memoranda . This experiment showed one solution of how to enlarge a retail carpet business . It was literally a gold mine , and the business of the house was greatly increased . IV So the retailer meets his difficulties and applies imagination in their solution . But the wholesaler has his problems too , and we shall find that the same panacea has lost none of its virtues as we examine a plan for the extension of a business in lithographic novelties . This house was one of the three firms who had supplied the great market of the world with its Christmas cards . The Christmas-card industry had waned , but they had taken it at its flood , and nicely calculated the moment of the ebb . The instant that the upper class of society abandoned the sending of Christmas cards , this firm was keen enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short life , and from that day drew in its manufacturing , carried a short stock , and was well equipped to take advantage of any new turn . ( The firm afterwards made a study of the question whether the custom of sending Christmas cards could be reestablished , deciding finally that as the custom had gone out through the upper class of society , it could only ranter through that class , and no way of reestablishing it in that direction seemed to suggest itself . Many ways were open to revive the custom in other classes of society , but this firm wisely concluded that it would be impossible to work the revival upwards . The popularity of the bicycle is the only exception I know to this general rule , and it has been one of the curious anomalies in trade movements in recent years . ) The establishment in question then turned its attention to the manufacture of art novelties , booklets , hangers , etc . For these there was a fairly large demand , and the question was how to double that trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed entirely by little stationery and periodical stores ? about the smallest calibre of storekeeper that can be imagined . It was out of the question to sell to the consumer direct , as that would instantly antagonize the retailers then handling the goods . It seemed almost impossible to infuse any enterprise and life into these little two-by-four storekeepers , in whose hands lay absolutely the future prosperity of the business . However , upon a closer study of the conditions , the point which attracted attention was the wide divergence in the volume of business done by different stores . Two , located in Cleveland , Ohio , and in Providence , Rhode Island , in the same relative location , and appealing to the same class , were doing a totally different business . The two constituencies were substantially alike ; but one store was doing a business of 8300 , and the other of 83000 . This indicated broadly that but few of these little storekeepers understood how to push their business , and it at once suggested the course which should be taken : first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of affairs ; and secondly , for this house to offer , as a committee of the whole , to investigate the various methods by which the business could be developed , reporting estimates and figures , with attested results as to each method . In other words , if a man in Philadelphia had employed successfully the method of making five , ten , fifteen , and twenty-five cent counters , the house proposed to investigate the whole system and its results , and report its findings to all who joined the movement . If another man in another city had established $1 , $2 , $8 , and $5 packets , and made a great success , the workings of that system would be explained , telling just what to avoid and what to do . In a similar way , to investigate the sending of canvassers , with books of samples , to interview customers in person ; the advertising in magazines ; and all the different ways by which one and another man in different parts of the country had made any success . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . The first circular was sent out , and within six weeks 2000 small storekeepers and their clerks had united with the lithographing firm in the undertaking . The movement was continued successfully for several years . It grew out of its original limitations , and the monthly reports began finally to discuss methods of salesmanship , taking individual articles and illustrating different methods of presentment . Here we see a different application of imagination , a sort of outward application to lubricate the stiffening joints of business . Let me now , as a last illustration , take an instance where the medicine was compounded to be taked internally . It was the question of a humble employee . We will say his name was Mills , and he was one of flue army of workers in the service of a wholesale clothing house . Ite came to me with his serious problem : he had been employed by this house for three years ; he had received one small raise of salary at the end of the first year , and now , after two years of waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalled on the road to business success , one of the innumerable teeth in the mighty gear , of no special value , and with no prospects whatever for the future . He wanted to marry ( on $6 a week ! ) , and this had added to his discontent with his surroundings . He came to ask me whether he had not better give up his situation , and trust to luck to find something better . I urged at once against such a course , and told him to look for something better while still holding his present situation . He said he had tried that for some time , but found himself restless . I said to him , " Mills , the important thing for you in this matter , is to ascertain whether you are paid all that you are worth ; and , that settled , whether you can make yourself worth any more . But first of all let us see if you can make yourself worth any more , whether you are paid it or not . If you can , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fair opportunity . " He agreed with me in my hypothesis , but said he did not quite understand how that could be found out . I said , " I can not find it out to-day , but if you will put yourself in my hands absolutely for three months , I will guarantee that we shall both have an answer to that question . " He agreed , and I went ahead . Here were my instructions to him : " For the first thirty days I want you to put your mind on one thing only ; drop all outside nonsense , and focus your entire attention , thought , and energy upon this question : By what method which you . can devise , can your house sell $100,000 worth more of goods every year than they are now selling ? ( Mills gasped ! ) Or $10,000 worth more ? Or $1000 worth more ? Or $100 worth more ? When you have discovered your plan , work it all out on paper , put down the figures in black and white , verify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a favorable moment , to the man on whom you must depend for your raise of salary . However good the idea may be , when you present it to him view it tentatively ; tell him as modestly as you can that you believe that the prosperity of the house should be as truly your concern as his ; that both your fortunes are in the same boat ; say frankly that you hope it may not seem presumptuous that you should seem to suggest reforms or changes , but that you are really interested in the success of the business , and it is this interest which must be blamed for any seeming intrusion on your part . Put it to him modestly ; if he decides that the idea is not good , say you are sorry for having wasted his time , and get out as quickly as you can . Then go to work on another idea . When you carry this to him , if he negatives it also , make your excuses and ask him if there is any objection to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the business can be extended . " In a general way , with a good deal more of explanation , I think I made him understand how he was to present his idea , so that in no case would he be in danger of losing his position or the good will of the firm , by seeming to have their interests very closely at heart . Thirty days passed , and Mills came to me . His report was brief . With all his thinking , he had found no method by which the business of the firm could be extended even one hundred dollars a year . I then put him to work upon his second month 's labor , which was this : " See whether you can discover any method by which , while losing no present advantage or trade , the firm can transact its present volume of business with greater economy , so that , by your improved methods of conducting the business , there shall be effected a saving of $50,000 a year ; or $5000 a year ; or $500 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather long breath as he left on to go to work for thirty days on this proposition ; but he , more or less manfully , went through the second stage of his labors , and at the end of another thirty ( lays he came back to me with his report . Ile had been able to discover no new method whereby the firm could economize on its present system . He had , however , discovered one thing , namely , that he would not need to go ahead for another thirty days with our experiment , for lie had about made up his mind that he would continue where he was . I said to him , " So Mills , you do n't care for any more of my advice ? Well , this time I am going to give it to you , without your wanting it . My boy , just realize for one moment where you stand . With the enormous volume of clothing business which is being done , and with the undoubted expansion which can be effected , you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , to increase the volume of this business one hundred dollars a year ; with the elaborate and necessarily wasteful methods in which that great business is transacted , you are not near enough to it to be able to point out a better system in any department whereby the small sum of fifty dollars a year may be saved . Note , Mills , let me give you a last word of advice , and it is valuable advice . My boy , lie low ! Attract just as little attention to yourself as you can . Do n't let the proprietors or manager remember that you have been three years in their employ , if you can help it . You are an absolutely unproductive man . If they knew how little capable you are of development and progress , they would change you off to-morrow for some young man of greater promise . Lie low , my boy . Keep out of prominence as much as you can , and go down on your knees to-night and thank God that you have got a situation where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that you are a bit inferior to thousands of other young men who are in the stores and wholesale houses in this city ; but you , like them , are simply sitting upon the head of the one brainy man who sits in the counting-room . He has to solve all these problems . You and fifty others in your establishment are just sitting on top of his head , like so many dead weights . If the business prospers you expect a raise of salary , when it is his head-work that has gained every inch of the progress . He has to carry you all . " The young man went off , sadder and wiser than he came . For the five years thereafter in which I was able to follow his course , he held the same place and at the same salary . Now , in a last word , what was the object of this experiment ? Of course , I did n't expect that this boy was going to revolutionize the clothing trade . It was simply to find out whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his business . I was will-ling to stake my prediction of his fate on the result of that one question , and I think the years have shown that I was right . If space permitted , it would be worth while to enumerate the great variety of problems which arise in business . To every one of these problems , imagination , if you will employ it , will open the door . If you want some day to relieve the tedium of a railroad journey by employing your imagination upon a test problem , let me give you one . It was the first client I ever had . Two young men in Indiana conceived the idea that there would be a fortune for them if they could secure a whale , load him on a large special car , and carry him over the United States , giving exhibitions in every town and city through which they passed , where their car could be side-tracked for one day , while the great fresh-water public saw the whale at twenty-five cents a head . They investigated the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture every last cent that both of them had saved . They had two elaborate cars constructed in the Pullman shops . They were built on the Pennsylvania Railroad pattern ; one was a car of extra length , with special appliances for switching , curves , etc. , and was to hold the whale . The sides of the car let down , and served as an inclined platform upon which people could walk up and view the " monster of the deep . " The other car was a hotel car , and contained bedrooms and living-rooms , accommodations for their families , business office , ticket-office , safe , etc . They were really fine cars , costing many thousands of dollars . They even went so far as to have all their printing prepared , giving a thrilling account of the capture of the whale , and every detail , discreetly omitting the mention of its exact size . Thousands and tens of thousands of posters , flyers , and circulars were printed , and then the two cars started from the Pullman works in the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Albany yards , where they were sidetracked while the two men went down to Nantucket to arrange for the purchase of the whale . There is a recognized industry on the Atlantic coast in whales . The year before these young men arrived in Boston over forty whales had been caught and brought in to Nantucket . Any one capturing a whale , dead or alive , was enabled to dispose of it to an enterprising buyer in Nantucket , who stood always ready to purchase . These young men found , however , upon arriving at Nantucket , that no whale had been captured since they refused the last one , which had been landed in July , ? ten weeks too early for their purposes . Usually the catch extends well into November , and they had counted upon the cold weather to help them in the first stages of their undertaking . But that year only fourteen whales had been caught , and although they waited in Nantucket until the season closed , no more whales appeared . Without a cent of money , with their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two elaborate cars , the problem is to carry these young men through one year , making them earn enough to provide for all their necessities of life , including car-storage , and equip them in the fall of the following year with a large whale . That problem was solved ; those two young men were kept alive , and their families supported , and one year later I saw the tail of a sixty-five foot whale vanishing over the railroad tracks westward , where it eventually gladdened the hearts of thousands of wild and woolly Westerners at twenty-five cents a peep . I will not weary you now with an account of how it was done , but I recommend it as a pleasant little exercise for the imagination . And now , shall we not all agree that there is a faculty which can accomplish in business such remedial and constructive work as we have been considering ? It is not enterprise , nor thrift , nor industry , nor sagacity , nor courage . Nor can all these qualities combined supply the place left vacant by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by any of these roads a man may win to success . But the faculty of which I now conceive MAKES HIM CAPABLE OF UNDERTAKING ANY BUSINESS ! He may be a successful bootblack , or the able president of a bank , or the astute manager of a circus . He may fail , for the imagination which enables him to comprehendhuman nature in the aggregate does not necessarily enable him to understand it in the individual . He may know human nature , but not individual nature . Hence he may be a judge of methods , but not of men . And now is any apology needed for these illustrations ? To some readers , perhaps , they may seem sharp and shrewd , with a little flavor of the pavement . But business is intellectual warfare , a battle of wits , ? in which one does not repulse solid shot with blank cartridges . It is not a theory , but a condition , which confronts the business man . He takes his medicine as he finds it compounded . It does n't taste as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one asked him what he liked . He is n't picnicking . He 's at war . He smiles through the bitter drink , and orders it up for the whole company when his turn comes !
