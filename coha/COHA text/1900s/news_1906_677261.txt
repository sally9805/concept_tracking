On the contrary , they had thanked the Governor foj the militia 's services . If charges had been made they were made by outsiders .

Greely here felt it necessary to interpose and explain . He said that so far as he knew there was no conflict of authority , and that , as a United States Army officer , he could not asstr-90 charge of the State militia .

Payson of the Water Committee made a report about the water supply . He said that a number of the city 's most Important reservoirs had been destroyed or much damaged , and the water pipes were in no condition to meet the demand . ' Patera was no storage water for fire purposes , and consequently no means of protection against fire if it should break out at this time . Herrmann Schussler , the Spring Valley Water Company 's chief engineer , expressed the opinion that it would be unwise to experiment with the electric lines . He compared the unburned portion of the city to a " lot of kindling wood , standing on end , " and said that " since we have saved that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . " Citizens Control All Finances . Chairman James D. Phelan made a statement for the Fineries Committee . He said that the plan for the handling of the relief fund as outlined in *resident Roosevelt 's prodlematida of day was perfectly satisfactory - to 04 Finance Committee . He stated that the idea was ' to ckitralize ' The - doritroi ' of the fund in one body . Gov . Pardee then turned Over . to him control of the contributions which had been sent daily to the Governor . Brig . Gen. Funston also formally surrendered the $35,000 remaining unused of the $50,000 contributed by the Guggenheim interests . Thus , control of the entire relief fund is now in the hands of the Finance Committee . The Rev. Mr. Baker of Oakland was made a member of the Finance Committee , to represent Gov . Pardee . Gen. Greely announced at noon that the army had taken over control of the relief stations- for the distribution of food . Distribution will be under a system devised by Dr. Devine , the special agent of the Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " under the new system of distribution would not occur Gen.

Funston , and would devote himself to the sanitation of the city , the unusual relations of the army with the city , and to other special affairs . Col. George Torney , who is in immediate command of sanitation , announced that the situation was encouraging . Every pecaution had been taken in the city parks , where tens of thousands of people were finding shelter . The control of the city parks had been transferred to the city Board of Health , and Col.

Torney said the Chinese , confident of the ability of the Federal Government to give them the fullest protection , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these people could then be Made as the city saw fit . Plans for Spending Relief Fund . ' what to do with the immense amount of money that has been contributed to the relief of San Francisco 's homeless people was the question that to-day received Careful consideration by all those now engaged in relief work . So many Inquiries have come to the heads of the various departments , civil and military , asking for and by whom the money contributed would be expended , that The Associated Press was asked to communicate to the country the assurance that every dollar would be put to the use for which it was intended . While the complete details of disbursing and accounting for the immense sum of money already contributed have not been formulated , they have been thoroughly discussed in committee , and may be briefly stated as follows : All expenditures will be authorized by the Finance Committee of the Citizens ' and the Red Cross funds . The members of this Committee are bankers , business then . and jurists of San Francisco , and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee will audit all accounts and make a detailed report to the War Department , where a final audit and statement will be made . At noon to-day the distribution of food to the City of San Francisco was formally turned over to the United States Army . Under this System many abuses that have prevailed in the giving out of supplies by various local and outside relief organizations . acting independently , will be discontinued and the direction of all the stations will be centralized in the depot of the Quartermaster of the United States Army , at the post under Major Duvol . Red Cross Works for Harmony . The impression , which seems to have prevailed in Eastern cities , that there was friction over the concentration and distribution of Red Cross supplies was corrected to-day by Dr. Devine . General Agent of the Red Cross Society , who repeated his assertion of yesterday that absolute harmony prevailed and that the work was carried on to the entire satisfaction of everybody . He wished it to be known that the Red Cross work had been carried out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its supplies now on hand would be made with-. out the slightest confusion . The reports from the leading hospitals at the Presidio and at Golden Gate Park to-day showed that the number of patients is fewer than yesterday . The decrease is probably due to the fact that the privilege of free transportation over the railroads to any part of the State expired at noon to-day , and many of the patients who were suffering from minor injuries and complaints left the hospitals in time to take advantage of the generosity of the railroads . A statement by Dr. James H. Ward , President of the Board of Health , to-day , showed that there are now thirty hospitals in use , all the smaller institutions established during the confusion of the first few days following the fire having been abolished and the patients removed to the larger establishments . Tuberculosis hospitals have been established separately from the others . Every well and other source of water supply throughout the city is examined by competent Inspectors , to provide against any possibility o ? contamination .

" Notwithstanding the enormous and widespread destruction , the homes of 150,000 people are still standing and practically uninjured .

" One of the most encouraging reports with reference to the work of rebuilding the burned district is that of the San Francisco Planing Mill Owners ' Association . Fifteen of the thirty-nine mills escaped the fire , and two of them are now in operation . The association says it will soon be in position to furnish all the mill work necessary . Three of the handsomest buildings in the business district of this city are to be restored as soon as men and material can be obtained . The first of these is the St. Francis Hotel , the second the Crocker building , and the third the Shrove building . The Interior of these structures was burned out . Their reconstruction will consist of practically nothing but a replacing of floors , partitions and fittings . This . announcement is official . President P.

The Buckman also brought 8,000 blankets and 400 tents . Marines Destroy Liquor . The marines yesterday destroyed a considerable quantity of liquor in that section of the city En which they hold sway . This branch of the navy controls and polices the best portion of the residence district , and although they have ruled with an iron hand , their authority has been exercised with such good judgment and discretion that not a siingie Complaint has been made . It was understood by storekeepers whose places escaped that they could open for business , but they overlooked the fact that only such places as had no bars attached would be permitted to do so . As a result a detail of marines destroyed hundreds of dollars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other proprietors had the choice of closing again or having their stock poured into the street .

Opposite Goat Island the paddle wheel struck an abandoned scow with a clash . , Many of the passengers ran to the opposite side of the boat , which listed heavily . The cry went up that it was capsizing , and a mad rush was made for life preservers . They were torn from the cases and quickly donned .

Unless pro-'I visions reach . Honolulu within a short time the residents there will likely be in dire straits . "
