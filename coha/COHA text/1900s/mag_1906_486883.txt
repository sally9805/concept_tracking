The irritation of the Japanese over the exclusion of children of that race from the schools of San Francisco has become a selrious matter  --  so serious that President Roosevelt has thought it worth while to dispatch a member of his Cabinet , Victor H. Metcalf , to the Pacific Coast to investigate the trouble . Yet to those irresponsible agitators who have endeavored to induce the United States to treat the Japanese as it has the Chinese , Japan 's official protest against discrimination in the schools will smack only of impudence . For a nation of yellow people to arrogate unto itself the methods of civilized Powers in protecting its citizens against wrongs suffered abroad is the purest insolence . Why talk of treaties and treaty rights ? Is not the Japanese an Asiatic ; is he not accustomed to living on six cents a day at home ? Are not his morals open to criticism , and is not his honesty questioned ? As for our national pledges  --  we had a treaty with China , but the Supreme Court held that Congress could violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not until recently been - in a position to show effective resentment . Last winter , they started a boycott on American goods , and a different tone was assumed by the representative-of the Chinese Government ; and a more vigorous policy in future is the inevitable result of the Chinese awakening . The Japanese , flushed by success in one of the world 's notable wars , conscious of extraordinary development as a nation , can not be expected to sit by calmly and see their subjects treated with contumely . With a civilization in some ways superior to our own , they can hardly be blamed if they cry out against what the Japanese minister called the subjection to indignities of " poor , innocent , little Japanese children . " The Japanese Minister was quick to say he is aware that the San Francisco discrimination is purely local , but that fact , he added , can hardly be understood by his countrymen . Particularly , we fancy , in view of the formation of an association in California to bring about the exclusion of all Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue no longer being available as a stepping-stone to office , an unscrupulous California editor began an anti-Japanese campaign a couple of years ago , for the purpose of winning a seat in the United States Senate . Were the mass of the Japanese people familiar with our internal affairs , they would realize that this aspiring statesman was merely imitating numerous Southern politicians who , in default of any other Issue , raise , a hullabaloo about negro domination . Down with the Japanese ! is not quite so effective a cry as Denis Kearney 's shrieks against the Chinese used to be , because there are not yet one hundred thousand Japanese in all the United States ; still , it may serve the purpose with professional labor agitators and ignorant voters . The common arguments  --  if so they may be dignified  --  were summed up by Representative E. A. Hayes of California , who in Congress last March made a long attack upon the Japanese . Mr. Hayes explained that , while there are some good and pure Japanese men and women  --  a " small minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that concubinage is rife in Japan ; that all Japanese are native-born liars and quite untrustworthy in business ; and that their new civilization is merely a veneer . Of course , Mr. Hayes made much of the complaint about cheap labor . In his view , the landing of 76,000 Japanese since 1900 constitutes a " most real and impending danger to the material and moral welfare " of the people of California . He told of 2,000 Japanese picking fruit in Santa Cruz County , where white girls used to pluck the berries before . Convinced that 2,750,000 Japanese are now platting to descend upon us and " sweep the entire country west of the Rocky Mountains clean of white laborers , " Mr. Hayes was naturally urgent that the bill before the last Congress to extend the provisions of the Chinese exclusion act to all Japanese and Koreans should be passed . He indulged in this kind of claptrap in spite of the fact that the whole Pacific Coast is suffering for lack of labor . The development of all its industries is retarded for want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand Chinese and Japanese would be a great blessing . That the protest of the Japanese is in accordance with their treaty rights is indisputable . Were the boot on the other foot , we know how quickly an indignant State Department would rise up on behalf of injured Americans . Unfortunately , Mr. Roosevelt can not promise Viscount Aoki the discontinuance of the San Francisco discrimination . In like manner the United States Government was helpless after the ' New Orleans massacre of Italians in 1891 . Unless Congress passes a statute in execution of the treaty with Japan , all that Mr. Roosevelt can do is to beseech California to mend her ways . That State will do well to heed the warning , and allow no temporary exigencies , such as the plea that fire has destroyed schoolhouses , to alienate Japan . Trade with that country is one of its and the nation 's great assets , an asset that ought to increase in value . Viewed from a broader aspect , the friendship of Japan is something the United States can not afford to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and Japan " are the two great powers in the new world of the future . " There should be no misunderstandings between them . ? MUSEUM EXTENSION IN SCHOOLS . H. G. Wells , the Socialist critic of things American , tells how , attending the meeting of a Boston literary club , he was obsessed by the conviction that the mind of the world was dead , and he sought relief by tramping the streets for an hour or so . We do not know whether his evening walk took him past the Museum of Fine Arts , or as far as Simmons College or Harvard University . In any case , the sight of any of these in- - stitutions ought to have reassured him as to the mind of Boston , if not of the world . These three bodies are associated in a novel and interesting alliance , descriptively but rather cumbrously entitled a Committee for the Utilization of Museums of Art by Schools and Colleges . President Eliot of Harvard is chairman of the committee , President Lefavour of Simmons College , vice-chairman. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of Fine Arts to accept the secretaryship . The work surely could be under no better personal or official auspices . Before noting what is peculiar in this new step , we should recall briefly other forms of art propaganda in the schools . For many years public-spirited committees and individuals have sought to place in the public schools - fine reproductions of the best works of art . This practice is very common in the cities . Free ; lectures , such as are conducted by Columbia University and by university extension committees generally , have given much attention to the criticism and history of art . Something of the sort is done incidentally by the schools of painting . Loan exhibitions are a customary and successful feature of settlement work among the poor . In all these activities the museums have played a passive part . They have , however , very generally made it easy for bodies of school children to see the collections . Such visitations are frequent , the ciceorone being a volunteer enthusiast , a public-school teacher , or , more frequently , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this relation already established that the Boston committee desires to improve and extend . A little observation of parties of school children , in the Metropolitan Museum , for example , will show that these visits are often discouragingly unprofitable . Museum gazing is fatiguing at best , and when youngsters are solemnly marched about by one who has little more knowledge than they , and no means of expressing the collective feeling , the performance , however well-meaning , is not very useful . What children , and for that matter most grownups , . need in art museums is intelligent and eager guidance . This it is that the Boston committee hopes to provide ; accordingly , it will for the present concentrate its efforts upon educating and stimulating school teachers in matters of art . It is felt , and rightly , that the culture of the teacher is the measure of the pupil 's appreciation : hence the true objective of art propaganda through the schools . For the coming season the committee has provided two sets of lectures primarily for teachers , one dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , the second with limited fields in art history . The six lectures in the general course will he of a distinguished sort . America could afford no better trio than W. P. P. Longfellow , to treat architecture ; Prof George Santayana , sculpture ; John La Farge , painting and the minor arts ; while the more specific purposes of the course are represented by two educators , Prof. H. Langford Warren of Harvard , who will speak on " What May the Schools Do to Advance the Understanding of Art ? " and Walter Sargent of the State Board of Education , who will discuss " Museums of Art and the Public Schools . " We have given this entire list because it is a gauge of the seriousness of the movement . The bane of similar attempts in the past has been the half-baked lecturer and the pushing amateur . Evidently , the Boston people are on their guard against both , and hold only the true democratic principle that only the best instruction is good enough for the people . This ideal is worthy of imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaporing in matters artistic as to produce a veritable disgust with the word and the thing . We trust that the affiliation between Columbia University , the National Academy , and the Metropolitan Museum  --  a compact primarily for academic purposes  --  will also result in increasing the amount of popular instruction in art , and in materially raising its quality . For those who are more immediately concerned with the museums than with the schools , the implications of the Boston movement are very interesting It is no secret that either through its curators or through its accredited representatives the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is planning to undertake direct instruction in the history and appreciation of art . Such viva-voce teaching , in the presence of the very objects of study , is surely the ideal , whether for the professional student or for the casual enthusiast . To have been a Peripatetiker in the Berlin Museum with Billet Curtius , or to have heard August Mau descant on Greco-Roman painting at Naples , is one of the rare privileges that stick in the memory . Difficult as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedantry and dilettanteism , the Method is surely the humane and fruitful one . Some such undertaking , on the more modest scale suitable to youth , seems to be the logical next step at Boston  --  the goal , indeed , wherever lovers of art are trying to make our art museums more directly serviceable to the people through the schools . HOW TO GROW OLD . Almost as much advice is given indirectly to the aged as is given directly to the young . The question is asked openly , " What shall we do with our boys ? " But a question , as pressing in many cases , though never put above a 1 ) hisper , is , " What can we do with old men and old women ? " Possibly , the objects of the latter inquiry , conscious of their sclerotic vessels and rheumatic Joints , may themselves have misgivings about their function in the social economy . To them it may seem as'if there were danger that the term " tristis senectus " of the Roman poet might be adopted now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting old have a fair idea of their duty in avoiding draughts , unwholesome diet , and undue excitement . Growing old , however , would not be so serious a business if one could only do it usefully , comfortably , and gracefully . In the Revue ScientiAque , Dr Bridou makes some suggestions about the mode in which men may avoid the evils of degeneracy , when the body begins to fail , and the sun is in the west There is a correspondence between each step in the advancing years and certain habits and processes of mind and body . For example , the child is naturally restless , turbulent , and playful ; these are signs of good health ' But the gestures and acts of children , if observed in old men , are symptoms of sickly excitement , physical disorder , and disintegration . When the practices of youth are adopted or retained by age , we recognize that there is retrogression , which means relaxation of one 's hold on life . But if , with advancing years , emotions are concentrated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be self-control and moral health . Men who like Bismarck are active in the affairs of state , or who like Lord Kelvin have their attention engaged upon new discoveries in science , feel chiefly the physical disadvantages of advancing years , but their minds have the vigor of youth This is a fact which few old people recognize , and so they must expect une din maussade et ranounihre It is really not by the affectation of youth that old age is to preserve itself from degeneracy and senile imbecility . The sprightly old lady who dyes her hair , paints her face , smiles away the downward droop of her mouth , and dresses like a Mutants ; the old viveur who believes that by keeping his youthful vices he conceals his ad vancing years , who , being no longer gratified by the return of passion , seeks to escape the horror of disenchantment by reverting to the indulgences but not to the joys of youth  --  these people are unconsciously out of step with the music . The imitation of the elan and impulse of youth seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates a growing moral incapacity . In America , the aged are at a peculiar disadvantage .

Their advice is sought because of their , - experience , but their active days are almost done . In the Old ' World they have a better chance . The septuagenarian may be seen mounted in Rotten Row ; here he is fortunate to be pushed by the elbow into a cab . There are many white-haired men sitting in Parliament as in the Reichstag , still active in the service of an empire  --  in striking contrast to certain Senators here who retain their seats , but seem too old or too , feeble-minded ' to resign .

For it is then , as Sophocles says , that there has been escape from the control , not of one mad master , but of many .

NEW LIGHT ON CARDINAL NEW-MAN . A great gathering of ecclesiastics was present on October 9 at the consecration of the church which has been erected at The Oratory , Birmingham , in honor of Cardinal Newman . The Archbishop of Westminster said in his sermon that it had been but right for Catholics to " appeal to the whole English-speaking world " to help in erecting this memorial to Newman . It might well be that Protestants would be glad to unite in a tribute to a man who was a religious genius and a master of style Indeed , Newman the writer seems destined to live longer than Newman the ecclesiastic . Many who can not follow his reasoning , yet feel the spell of his English in printed sermons which still have power to make the hearts of readers burn within them , as did his spoken words the hearts of the Oxford undergraduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tractarians . Men whole diameters away from Newman 's theological position turn often to his " Apologia " to taste again of its simple eloquence. - Estimates of Newman the man have varied with the personal or ecclesiastical point of view . Carlyle 's rough contempt for his intellect was one of the things that startled or shocked the world on Froude 's publication of the " Reminiscences " Kingsley 's attack on Newman 's personal sincerity was terribly punished , yet there were those who had their doubts . Newman 's " Grammar of Assent " did not tend to lay them ; since that book could be popularly described as an attempt to show that you could believe anything if only you tried hard enough . Yet the Cardinal himself disclaimed being a controversialist . Once when a Protestant Champion challenged him to a public debate , ' he quietly replied : " I have really no taste or aptitude for controversy , but my friends are good enough to say that I have some little skill on the violin . " It was left , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character Lord Acton , the great scholar and stout Catholic , was thrown much into Newman 's society , and in Some of the letters just published in " Lord Acton and His Circle , " there are many liftings of the curtain on New-man 's private life . Acton was backing the Rambler and often consulted Newman about that and other Catholic periodicals . Here is a report of a conversation in 1858 , when the Rambler was in trouble : I had a three hours ' talk with the venerable Newman , who came out at last with his real sentiments to an extent which startled me with respect both to things and persons , as Ward , Dalgairns , etc , etc ; natural inclination of men in power to tyrannize ; ignorance and presumption of would-be theologians I did not think he would ever cast aside his diplomacy and buttonment so entirely , and was quite surprised at the intense interest he displayed in the Rambler . He was quite miserable when I told him the news and moaned for along time , rocking himself backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toothache He thinks the move provoked both by the hope of breaking down the P and by jealousy of Dollinger He asked whether we suspected any one He has no present advice , being ignorant of the course of such affairs in Rome , except that we should declare that we do not treat theology in our pages . He wants us to have rather more levity and profaneness , less ' theology and learning A good story , he thinks , would turn away wrath , and he enjoys particularly your friendly encounters with Bentham , Combe , Buckle , and the like Lord Acton , to be sure , held a racy pen , yet his picture of Newman as acting like " an old woman with a toothache " suggests that all was not perfect serenity in The Oratory , after Newman 's submission to Rome . On another occasion , in 1860 , Acton found him a victim of the blue devils : I never saw Newman so much out of spirits , so distributively angry . . . I have never heard him speak openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke during the half-hour I was with him We are not told the objects of " New-man 's wrath " , " he wished me not to repeat " ; but the hint that his " vehement language " was reported to be " in substance the same that I have been hearing these nine years from Dollinger , " leaves little doubt ? that it was the Ultramontanes with wham Newman was " distributively angry . " This inference is borne out by another letter of Lord Acton 's , this one written to R. H. Hutton in 1891 , and only now made public by the latter 's son . In it , Lord Acton said that his own impressions of Newman were based " chiefly on the years 1858 to 1864 . " He added It happened that those were precisely the years in which a semblance came over him of what he would certainly not have called Liberalism , but which showed itself in his dubious attitude towards the temporal power , and even in the Oxford scheme and the treatment of Liguori , and which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faber , and even Ward . These revelations are mainly of interest as showing that a spirit like Newman 's had much to brook even after he had gone over to the Roman Communion . But the dread of Liberalism which , as there is good evidence to show , first pushed him and Pusey into the Oxford Movement , was always powerful with him , and sufficed to make him acquiesce in measures to combat it , ! even though he disliked them . Where Acton and Dollinger openly protested against the excesses of - Ultramontanism , Newman 's rule was to submit Yet Lord Acton 's intimate disclosures give us fresh knowledge of how often New-man 's proud soul had to lay to itself the command of " Faust " ? soltst eatbaren .

We share this way of thinking , and feel that there are many reforms more worth the attention of orthographic ironmasters than that of spelling . To speak candidly , we have a little reform of our own , only awaiting its subsidy , namely , the consolidation of the many disguised compounds in the English language . In the natural course of things linguistic , everybody knows , set combinations of words come to express a single idea . The process is represented on the printed page by the hyphen , the finished product by the true compound word . All this is in the interest of simplicity . We gain when a hat-rack becomes singly and indivisibly a hatrack . But this useful tendency has halted half-way ; the printed page to-day is clogged by superfluous hyphens and by phrases that are no phrases , but true compound words Since the vocabulary of literature and the press knows no unsuccessful persons in commerce , why not write at once and plainly successfulbusinessman , conservativebanker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bucket-shops are infra-literary and ignored , when speaking of a Wallstreetmagnate one should mention him as a greatoperator , financialpower , or moneyking .

By the same token pulchritude being universal south of Mason and Dixon 's line , all females between the ages of ten and seventy resident in that locality should be described as South- nbeauties , or , specifically , as Kentuckybelles .

It is a striking fact that many of the phrases which need fusing into a single word apply to women . To a cynic this might suggest that the sex receives more than its share of lip-service .
