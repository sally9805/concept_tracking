" SUPPORTIN G " ' KO T LEY . Everybody must have noticed how the men who come forward to announce their determination to vote for McKinley , do so with an apologetic air They usually begin by saying that they hope no one will suppose that he is their " first choice , " or that they think him , per se , fit for the Presidency . This is especially the case with those who speak as representatives of the intelligent classes . To save their own reputation for intelligence , they have to include in their " support " of McKinley an amount of personal and political condemnation of their candidate which would seem positively insulting to a less meek man than he " Understand , " they say , " we know as well as you do that his convictions are made up for him as regularly as his bed is ; that he can turn himself inside out or upside down at the word of command ; that his Administration has been marred by frightful mistakes  --  and still , on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesser evil . " Yet so low is the Republican estate that the party managers hail such accessions with rapture . These left-handed compliments they seize upon delightedly as proof that the party has not , after all , driven away all intelligence or affronted every conscience " See , " they gleefully exclaim , " Mr. Ottendorfer is with us . To be sure , he says McKinley is a vermicular man , who ought never to have been thought of for the Presidency , and whose Administration has been a wretched failure Mr. Ottendorfer may not vote for him , but , anyhow , he is against Bryan . What a triumph that is for our candidate ! " They even pounce with joy upon the pronouncement of the Rev. Dr. Bacon against Bryan , although in the very same letter he said of McKinley- " We can not tell where to find him in any future emergency , but may calculate , with much probability , on finding him in contradiction to his avowed principles . " And this is called " supporting " a man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a candidate for President whose personality was such a drag upon his canvass . The veriest idolaters and myth-makers can not picture McKinley as a hero or a leader He is running for office purely on the badness of his opponent . Ask frank Republicans their opinion of the outcome if it were Cleveland against McKinley . They will admit that their man would be nowhere . Far from kindling enthusiasm and carrying a cause with him in inspiring leadership , he calls for apologies instead of for cheers , and is a dead weight upon the cause  --  the gold standard  --  which has to carry him This is an awful break with our Presidential traditions . Personality has notoriously always counted for much with Amen. - cans They like to swear by names rather than Pleasure &; They often make a popular hero out of the most refractory material Four years ago many of them persuaded themselves that they could see an heroic feature or two in McKinley . But they have given it up now . They will take him , if they do at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roosevelt , on his return to this State , will be expected to " bring words of cheer from the great West , " where he has been campaigning . If he were to give a truthful impression of the figure which McKinley is actually cutting in the canvass , his report would be something like this : " I am glad to be able to assure you , Republicans of New York , that the Lesser Evil is running like wild-fire over the prairies In the most intelligent circles , I found an earnest conviction that McKinley is not quite so bad as Bryan . And the plain people are equally enthusiastic about our peerless leader One monster parade , which I reviewed , bore a McKinley banner on which was inscribed the inspiring words , ' Our Medicine We hate it , but we are going to take it ' In Chicago the vast audience which packed the Auditorium was thrilled when a picture of McKinley was unveiled , underneath which was written , The Nation 's Choice  --  of Evils And I assure you , fellow-Republicans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did in St. Louis when I called for three cheers for McKinley , and added the sentiment , ' We love him for the blunders he has made ! ' " We would not be thought to jest about what is really a very serious matter . Inability to respect a candidate for its highest office is little short of a disaster for a democracy , . It often suffers strange delusions about public men , falls down before images with feet of clay , and all that ; but that is better than the political dejection which comes from the general conviction that voting is reduced to a balancing of dangers , and a choice between two unworthy personalities " Vote as you shot , " used to be the shibboleth . " Vote as you pray , " was another . This year the watchword is , " Vote as you take medicine " That is not a healthful or hopeful state of a democratic body politic . Casting a ballot in the spirit in which you would get a prescription filled , is a poor substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " It will not be an inspiring sight on election day  --  the number of good citizens who will be seen coming from the polls with pain and illness Written on their faces , and who will explain their melancholy and distress by saying that they had been voting for McKinley . One compensating feature of this campaign of the lesser evil is that even McKinley himself , on reading the terrible things said of him by his supporters , must begin to be aware that something is wrong . People have talked a good deal about " punishing " McKinley . Some have said that they mean to vote solely to punish him . But his punishment has already begun . To a man as vain as he is , it must sometimes seem a punishment greater than he can bear . His own idea of the campaign was that it was to be one long laudation of his person . He sent on from Washington to Philadelphia a platform pitched in a key of the grossest adulation-of his noble self . First he had the mortification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose . His self-praise was ruthlessly cut out of the platform . Then he has seen his personality steadily retire into the background , until his name has come to be mentioned with apologies which are themselves cutting indictments , and the Rupert he thought himself has been reduced to the humiliating role of the Lesser Evil . His only hope of election lies in the fact that people , echoing Candide 's famous cry about the best of worlds , will exclaim in horror , " If McKinley is the Lesser Evil , what must Bryan be ! " E X-PRE SIDENT HARRISON ON PORTO RICO . Ex-President Harrison rendered an important public service , and expressed a large share of public opinion , in the few , , words which he said last week on the present political campaign . He announced his support of the Republican nommees for the same reasons that he gave when McKinley and Bryan were candidates four years ago But he added that he did not approve of the bill for the government of Porto Rico . He regarded it at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He went on to say : " I still think so : I do not believe that the legislative power of Congress in the Territories is absolute , and I do believe that the revenue clause , relating to duties and imports , applies to Porto Rico . These views , I know , are not held by many able lawyers . It is a legal question  --  one that the political departments of the Government can not finally adjudge . The final and controlling word upon this question is with the Supreme Court of the United States Cases involving the question are , I understand , pending , and a decision , in which we must all acquiesce , can not be much deferred I think , therefore , that voters ought to vote with a view to the right decision of those questions that are directly and finally in control of the President and Congress . " These words put Mr Harrison in the ranks of the Anti-Imperialists , of the class to which Senators Hoar and Hale and Representatives McCall and Littlefield belong , for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles which he applies to Porto Rico apply to all of our colonial possessions . Moreover , if the Constitution requires uniformity of taxes , duties , and trade regulations in and among all the States , Territories , and places belonging to us , it is difficult to see why it does not carry to the newly acquired countries all the rights of citizenship which are common to the inhabitants of the United States . Mr. Harrison does not say what course of political action he should follow if the Supreme Court should decide as a matter of law that the Constitution does not require uniform taxes , duties , and trade regulations in all territory covered by our flag . Such a decision would still leave it open to all citizens to advocate the passage of laws to cover that defect and to fill that vacuum . It would net be necessary to amend the Constitution in that particular , but merely to apply by Congressional enactment the principle of equality of rights which forms the groundwork of our system of government . In such an endeavor we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ex-President Harrison as on that of Senator Hoar , or of Carl Schurz , or ex-Gov . Boutwell . The real significance of Mr. Harrison 's interview lies in the fact that he speaks for a host of people who , although they can not see their way clear to support Mr. Bryan in this campaign , intend to fight against Imperialism to the end of their lives if need be , because they believe it to be a virus in a republican system of government . We are told that Imperialism is a bugbear and a myth , that there is no such thing , that it exists only in the imagination . Evidently this is not Mr. Harrison 's view . He considers the Porto Rican bill not a mere misinterpretation of a fiscal clause in the Constitution , but " a grave departure from right principles . " What can this be but an attempt to govern people without giving them a share in the government , to impose taxation on them without representation ? What else has Imperialism consisted of , from the dawn of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She attempted to rule other Peoples without giving them any voice in public affairs , but only a municipal control , subject to her own whims She imposed taxation without representation . She became greedy , she raised up enemies to herself , and she fell into ruin . It is needless to recall Imperialism and the hideous course it ran in the Roman republic , except to say that those who call it a bugbear and a myth are unfamiliar with the world 's history . It is safe to promise Mr. McKinley and his party as vigorous a fight after the election as they have had at any time since the treaty of peace with Spain was ratified It is fairtoexpect , also , that some mouths which have been closed by party exigency heretofore will be opened as soon . as the smoke of battle rolls away It is well known that Senator Spooner and Congressman Cannon have never approved the policy of the Administration in the Philippines . They are representative men , and it is believed that they have a following , both in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as the discipline which the present campaign imposes is relaxed . Perhaps ex-President Harrison will then feel at liberty to go a little deeper into this subject than he did last week , and tell us what he thinks of Imperialism in general . Having already reached the highest honors his country can give , he is now above the suspicion of unworthy motives and beyond the reach of calumny . His influence among Republicans is probably greater to-day than that of any other man in private life . The country would listen to him with rapt attention . Surely he could have no fairer opportunity to be of service to the present and to coming generations of his countrymen . CONQUERORS AND CONQUERED The verdict of science on Imperialism is only beginning to be pronounced . The question has , so far , been passed upon mainly by national pride and by greed , flaunting in the thin disguise of philanthropy and the " mission of the higher races . " What science has yet more clearly to tell the world is , what is to become of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of conquest is upon conqueror and conquered , what racial gains and losses are involved in the forcing of foreign rule and foreign civilization upon Malay and Arab , Chinaman and Kaffir . It is a matter clearly falling within the purview of ethnography ; and accordingly we find the Congress of Ethnographical Sciences at the Paris Exposition giving attention to this important subject . One of the papers read before it was a calm discussion by M. Leclere of the reciprocal moral effects upon each other of a conquering in touch with a conquered race . In a word , M. Leclere 's conclusion is that conquest is bad for both races . Remember , he is speaking purely as a scientist . About trade he says nothing ; all the windy talk about being a " world-power " he passes by in silence ; the hypocrisies and excuses of conquerors are not for him . Fixing his eye solely upon the one question of the race-effects of conquest , he pronounces them an almost unrelieved evil . You may have to invade Asia or Africa by force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not forget , says M. Leclere , that in the process you impair the fibre of your race . It may be necessary for a Wreltinacht to send its armies and its administrators into deserts and swamps over-sea ; be that as it may for the politician , the scientist sees in it only a serious endangering of those national qualities which have raised a country to the rank of a world-power . To the ethnographer , a well-marked race is like a rare species of plant or animal . He notes the conditions under which it has been brought to perfection . He points out the environment which it needs for continuance in full vigor , and warns against the surroundings which mean its enfeeblement and decay . And it is the sober judgment of M. Leclere that conquest , under modern conditions , means decadence of the conquering race , demoralization and ruin of the conquered race . This is a cold douche for science to pour upon our hot and heady Imperialism ; but the truth must be told . And the mass of evidence ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables him to trace the process as if it were an . experiment in a laboratory First comes the physical deterioration on both sides . The conqueror succumbs to new diseases , to the strain of an . unaccustomed climate , or else survives with weakened powers . The conquered perish like flies . It is not merely that they fall like grain before the vices of civilization ; civilization itself kills them . Its breath slays them . Like wild animals under domestication , they expire through very deprivation of their savage life . " They die by looking at us , " said a French sailor . This is an old story . What lends chief value to M. Leelere 's paper is its close analysis of the subtle interchange  --  a sort of moral osmosis  --  which goes on between the higher conquering race and the lower conquered race . It is , in general , a give-and-take of what is had in each . Bagehot long ago observed that " the union of the Englishman and the Hindu produces something not only between races , but between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Java , the Germans in Africa , the French in . Annara , the Americans in the Philippines , to see what is meant . The foreign ruler is under a powerful temptation to throw off the moral restraints under which he has lived at home . Why should he observe moral conventions , which are largely social conventions , when they do not obtain in the community where he is living ? His power being usually arbitrary , he makes it violent and brutal , so as to bring it sharply home to men accustomed to cruelty . Fitzjames Stephen tried to introduce rules of evidence in the Indian criminal code . " What is the use ? " it was objected . " We can get any evidence we need by rubbing pepper into a man 's eyes . " Such cynical indifference and brutality are the commonest effect of full and irresponsible power when conferred upon members of a civilized race set to keep a turbulent lower race in order . They begin by decivilizing themselves . They become subdued to the element in which they work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the conquered take . They perish , but in their death they poison the life of their conquerors . The history of tropical colonization is one long vw lActori-bus ! M. Lee , Fere shows with appalling clearness how necessarily demoralizing are even the well-meant attempts of civilized races to benefit savage peoples . The first effect of bringing in a new standard of ' morals , of preaching a new religion  --  especially when this is done by conquerors possessing themselves of the country  --  is to loosen the bonds which hold native society together . It is a commonplace of the Chri  --  tian pulpit that , if our religiou 's faith were to be destroyed , morality would disappear and men would fly at each other 's throats . Yet precisely that is what we undertake to bring about in heathen countries ; and wa are surprised when like results follow like causes . Look at what we are doing in China to-day . We are ruthlessly desecrating the things most sacred to Chinamen . We are making a mock of their religion , their legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we find them untruthful , cruel , and murderous ! We go elaborately to work in a wholesale way to do in China what we admit would , if done in America , lead straight to social anarchy , and then we say  --  even missionaries say ? that we must kill a lot more Chinamen because they are acting like anarchists . This is not sweet reasonableness . We can not stop to speak of M. LeeWe 's exposure of the lying reports of French colonial Governors . They always represent the natives as now fully ready to " accept civilization . " We have already too long a line of official Philippine absurdities of that kind to make it possible for us to cast a stone at the French . Accepting civilization , however , we see to mean , from the standpoint of ethnography , accepting physical and moral death . And for conquerors the question is , Are they willing to accept barbarism ? have , in the end , always conquered their conquerors . Is it to be true of the higher races of to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral level of the races they have conquered ? This is a searching question which science puts to our glib Imperialists . CHANGES AT WEST POINT . The just published report of the Board of Visitors to the West Point Military Academy for 1900 might well have made more than a brief reference to the great change in the educational methods of that institution under its present management , and particularly during the incumbency of the present Commandant of Cadets , Lieut. - Col . Otto T. Hein , an officer of the First Cavalry . It is a striking fact that only within the last two years has the military efficiency of a cadet , which means so much to his future army life , been taken into account in determining his standing upon graduation . Still stranger is the fact that , for the first time in a century , West Point is now beginning to turn out young officers trained in the habit of command and in practical military exercisesinsteacl or graduating , as hitherto , men merely conversant with company drills and imbued with a sound knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . - To those who have regarded the West Point curriculum as beyond improvement , the statement that a cadet 's trainbrig VMS fOritierly confined merely to class-reetn work and to the most elementary drills , must seem astonishing . a - - For decades past the young lieutenant who joined his regiment fresh from West Point found himself latterly at a loss , despite the tact that he held the diploma of the most successful military school in the world . If he had been one of the few cadet officers , he was able to drill a company with ease , His classmate , who carried a rifle as a private throughout his four years , was less fortunate and less experienced . Neither was able to put his company under canvas , because neither had ever seen a tent raised . Neither was able to assist his captain in the detailed and exhaUsting paper work required of a company commander , because neither had ever seen the endless reports , rosters , requisitions , and returns required of that officer . Either might have forced upon him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjutant , signal officer , ordnance officer , and of acting quartermaster in charge of Government property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars , without . any more practical experience , of those various duties than the latest ap- , pointee from civil life totally devoid of previous military experience . If his troop or company were suddenly marched out on strike duty , or belieutenant went along to learn the fundamentals of his duty from grizzled noncommissioned officers or his commissioned superiors . If the command in-trenched itself , he saw intrench.ments for the first time . If it deployed for action , he found his place on the firing-line only when told where to go or because of Anglo-Saxon intuition ; in his four years at West Point he had never seen an attack formation , much less participated in one as a responsible officer . This state of affairs Col. Hein and his officers have ended , with the sanction of the two Superintendents who have been at West Point since 1897 . The supreme aim of turning out an officer trained to meet every emergency of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of having to go through the same drills , rifle on shoulder , with cwhich he became familiar in. the first six weeks of his stay at the Academy , up to the day of graduation , the cadet varies his " close order , " or company and battalion , drills with " practical exercises . " He masters the handling of a mountain-gun battery , a gatiing-gun battery , and a mortar battery , and awaits only the arrival of siege and coast-defence guns to add their intricacies to his knowledge of the handling of a mounted field battery . On his now regular practice marches , the cadet grooms , saddles , and unsaddles his- cavalry or artillery ' horse , raises his own tent , and " packs " his baggage-mules , as if to the cowboy =liner born . As an infantryman , la , is no longer confined to parade-grornad maneuvres , but has his . Sill ' of open-order drills , ' attack forma= tams , picket and guard and reconnoissance duty , while the same target work is required of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important changes of all are those by virtue of which the cadet is now trained in responsibility and coinma , nd , and is marked during his MEC1-07 , or first-class , year upon his military efficiency . By a careful system of rotation each cadet is given the opportunity to fill practically every officer 's position in the battalion . He must act as adjutant , as captain , as major , as lieutenant of cavalry , artillery , and infantry , as officer of the day and of the guard , and as instructor of the junior cadets , so that , no- duty will be strange to him when i he enters the regular service . Upon the. : way in which he conducts himself ati each one of these drills , upon his knewla edge , his bearing , his voice , his ability to teach others , etc. , each instructor passes and ' hands in a mark . The average of all thegrades counts towards determining the rank of the cadet and so the branch of the eervice to which he will be as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still but a very-small part of the cadet 's mark for the whole course , or even for the senior These changes at West Point were in , troduced by an . officer conversant with the latest European military advances . A few years ago it was often impossible to get an older regular officer to admit that American military methods could be improved upon . Lieut. - Col . Hein 's ready absorption and appreciation of foreign ideas is plain proof of the folly of this attitude . His demonstration of the great advantages which may be derived from sending an officer abroad as military attache should lead to a large detail of young officers to this duty every year . Even if this should be neglected , the presence of such well-trained officers as are now coming from West Point will do much for the reform and for the efficiency of the army . That we shall still have Eagans and Shafters ancl Otises with us must be expected , as long : as the War Department is run by the ' Corbin methods of political favoritism : which disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all except the ; simplest drills , of five-year soldiers who , never made a march , and of recruits placed upon the firing-line ignorant of the mechanism of their rifles ( as Gen .. Wheeler reports them in the Philippines ) , may confidently be counted on to . come to an end . If the taxpayer , thanks , to Mr. McKinley , has to foot a steadily increasing bill for his army , he may have the slight consolation of : knowing that his dollars are gradually buying him a better and better article , It seems to me that the care of Providence for the American people is never so strikingly displayed as during the Presidential campaign every four years . At that time about one-half of the voting population arises in its might , and , according to the other half , determines to put an end to the " great experiment . " The republic , which one party is bent on extinguishing by means of financial and political ruin , is preserved by the other side , for one more trial . The Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal work as early as Jefferson 's day , when one of the Federalist moralists exposed the design of the Republicans , as the other party were then called , to fling the Federalists ' wives and daughters " into the common stew/a . " At that period the fatal blow was to be dealt out of pure wickedness . It was later that a real reason appeared for breaking up the Union , in the shape of the Northern attempt to abolish slavery . But at every Presidential election something terrible was to result from the triumph of one side or the other , until in 1881 the continuance of the Union was threatened by " rum , Romaine ism , and rebellion . " I was dining one evening during that year with a friend and a party composed , iu the - Main , of persons of Cleveland had been elected , but had not taken his place . The Tribune was daily publishing lists of the enormous sums which would have to be paid in satisfaction of " rebel claims , " the total amount of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman was calling attention to the amount with horror , when Abram S. Hewitt , who was present , said , " I am on the Congressional Committee which has to pass these claims , and I can assure you that not one of them will be paid . " The effect of this on the gentleman who had brought the subject up , and who was a warm Republican , was very curious He was thunderstruck , and passed some minutes in silent meditation . " Well , " said he at last , " there must be terrible lying somewhere . " As every one else at the table was well aware that the air was full of campaign lies , this drew forth shouts of laughter , and the subject was buried in a discussion as to which side lied the more . About the same time a Republican friend of mine in the country wrote to me , offering to sell all his securities  --  and he was a man of some wealth  --  for half their face value in case of Cleveland 's election . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him again . Shortly afterwards I heard from one of our prominent financiers , the President of a great company , that the spectacle of workingmen killing each other in the streets would be witnessed frequently in New York as soon as Cleveland took his seat . Some people were so affected by the prospect of these horrors that it was seriously proposed that President Arthur should prevent their occurrence by refusing to surrender his place to Mr. Cleveland . I ridiculed these fears in the columns of the Nation , on the ground that they were tantamount to a confession that the Republic was a failure . They were really a confession that only half the people Were fit to rule sit The only notice I saw taken of my point was by the New York Evangelist , which protested against the idea that only one of the two great parties was capable of carrying on the Government . But I think the fears of the timid were not actually dissipated until Cleveland had taken his place as President . It is droll now to remember that these fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on by the fearless , clear-headed , and thoroughly honest prover Cleveland , instead of by the corrupt and time-serving James G. Blame . I do not think there is in our history an apter illustration of the confusion of the electioneering brain I happened , while writing on this topic , to be reading Sir William Anson 's edition of the autobiography of the Duke of Grafton , about 1766 . I was struck by the efforts made by all the parties , from the King down , to get the opinion of Lord Chatham on the crisis through which the Government was passing For many months no one was admitted to see the old orator . Even his knocker was muffled , to prevent people from approaching him . But on the 5th of December , 1777 , there was a great debate in the House of Lords on the accounts received from Gen. Burgoyne of his defeat at Saratoga , and on the employment of Indian savages by the Government . Chatham felt the occasion to be one of the first importance , and had himself carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " old Mugwump , " as I call him , or the " great man and illustrious patriot , " as the Duke of Grafton calls ham , to save his " sinking country . " Here is Lord Camden 's account , written to the Duke of Grafton , of what happened in the House : " I saw him in the Prince 's chamber , before he went into the House , and conversed a little with him , but such was the feeble state of his body , and indeed the distempered agitation of his mind , that I did forebode that his strength would certainly fail him before he finished his speech . " But he spoke enough to make his remarks a consuming fire for the Hannas , the Platts , and the Roosevelts of the day It appears now , according to the Expansionists , that so far as principle was concerned , the American Government might have begun its career of conquest from the day of its foundation , the only thing that prevented it was want of money or want of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks from the Turks , the Italians from Austria , and the Tyrolese from Bonaparte at so much a head , and have assumed the job of conquering or slaughtering them itself , without inconsistency . Yet a century ago the noble passage , beginning " Were I an American , as I am an Englishman , " was in every American schoolboy 's mouth . Instead of that , we now hear calculations as to how much stocks will fall if the wrong man is elected . It took the learned McKinley to find out this secret principle of the Constitution . E L G SUNSET OR DAWN . FLORENCE , September 24 , 1900 . The liberty with which Clericals and Socialists have held their congresses in Rome is a proof that all attempts to make capital out of the catastrophe of Monza have failed ; that the reactionists who , from the birth of the new kingdom , have regarded chains and handcuffs , arbitrary arrests , provisional imprisonment , gagging of the press , prohibition of public meetings , as the only methods of government , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional laws are unnecessary if only the ordinary laws be applied impartially to all classes and individuals . " The congresses in themselves have been nothing remarkable . The Clericals , up to a certain point , admitted the right to existence of the civil power by appealing to the state to permit " free teaching . " The conduct of the Vatican during the late events , its attempt to prove that King Humbert had recanted and received absolution ; the prohibition of funeral masses in some churches , the expulsion of the national flag from others ; the Vatican 's declaration of hostility at a moment of profound , let us even say hysterical , emotion , has done more to embitter old grievances and open new wounds than any mere assertion of the temporal power during the last thirty years had accomplished . Still , the pilgrimages from various partth of Italy , the tribes of youths educated in seminaries and conducted to Rome by their priestly tutors to receive the Pope 's blessing , while strictly forbidden to approach the Pantheon , where the two first Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a kingdom divided against itself , and that the civil power is unwisely providing its enemy with weapons which he will use to good purpose at the first opportune moment . It was rumored that the young King would have left his retirement at Capodimonte and been present at Rome during the commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the entry into Rome by the Italian army " through the breach of Porta Pia . " But this could hardly be expected of him during these first months of mourning , and it must be remembered that King Victor never came to Rome on the 20th of September , and Humbert once only , to celebrate the silver wedding of Rome to Italy in 1895 . The Socialist Congress has excited far more interest than the Catholic , but the hymns of triumph raised on the one hand , the wails of dismay and terror on the other , are , to Anglo-Saxon ears , equally exaggerated . True it is that during the late elections the Socialists captured 170,000 votes , the Republicans 80,000 , the Radicals 90,000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , compared with the 675,000 polled by the Conservatives , brings the so-called popular party within a measurable distance of their adversaries . But it must be remembered that the late elections were held in exceptional circumstances . The imprisonment of hundreds of peaceful citizens tried by military tribunals whose sentences were all quashed by the civil courts , cast a halo of martyrdom around the liberated prisoners . Then , the proclamation of exceptional coercive laws by royal decree , the attempt to alter the rules of the House by an ignoble manoeuvre , the distinct violation of the Statute , brought into the ranks of the Opposition such calm old statesmen as Zanardelli and Villa . The Government showed its utter ignorance of the feeling throughout the country by choosing that moment , despite its servile majority , for the general elections , and the result , for all who had eyes to see , was a fore= ' gone conclusion . Were Saracco , the present Premier , and one of the few survivors of the old Conservative party , the champions of order and impartial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be difficult to predict the result .
