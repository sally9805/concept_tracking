' Rome and the Renaissance : The Pontificate of Julius II. , ' translated by John Dennie from the French of Julian Klaczko , fully illustrated , and ' The Art of the Italian Renaissance , ' a handbook , by Prof. Heinrich Wolfam , containing more than 100 illustrations , are announced by G. P. Putnam 's Sons . E. P. Dutton &; Co. have nearly ready a new edition of ' The Autobiography of Leigh Hunt , ' with an introduction by Thornton Hunt , and new editing by Robert Ingpen , in two volumes . Thomas Y Crowell &; Co. will publish in the spring a Life of Dean Farrar , by his son , Dr. R. A. Farrar . The Scott-Thaw Co of this city are about to issue ' Zionism and Anti-Semitism , ' by Dr. Max Nordau and Dr. Gustav Gottheil ; a limited edition , all on vellum , of Halbein 's ' Dance of Death , ' with an introductory note by Austin Dobson , and reproductions of the cuts in the Lyons princeps edition of 1538 ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folio " Library of Noble Authors , " Sir Thomas More 's ' Utopia , ' with Holbein 's portrait and the original maps and illustrations .. The sixth and last volume of Lord Berners 's Froissart ( being volume xxxii. of the " Tudor Translations " edited by W. E. Henley and published by David Nutt , London ) has appeared . In noticing previous volumes we have expressed the opinion that this is , and must remain , the one English version of that wonderful picture of a wonderful time . We may add that this edition is provided with an excellent index , compiled by R W. Chambers . Among the Scribners ' importations we note the old favorite " Mermaid Series " of British dramatists in a new and much condensed form . Apparently the typography is unchanged , but the pages have been cropped close to the text , with the result of producing a tall volume in Elzevir form . The paper is thin and not wholly opaque . In this fashion the old volume of Marlciwe 's best plays , containing the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew of Malta , " and " Edward II. , " is brought into a booklet of convenient size for the pocket . Text , introduction , illustrative features , are unchanged from the octavo issue , which is still preferable for the shelf , while the miniature rejuvenation has distinct advantages for the class-room or the walking trip . Besides the Marlowe we have received Ben Jonson ( three volumes ) , Otway , Congreve , and Steele ' The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table ' has made its way into Macmillan 's pretty " Golden Treasury " series , and what gives this edition a special charm is the prefixed study of Dr Holmes by Leslie Stephen , familiar already as a chapter in his ' Studies of a Biographer , ' being a review , in effect , of Morse 's Life of Holmes . The personal note in this IntrOduction and the happy contrast of Holmes and Lamb are memorable features ; but it is all full of insight and delicacy and Sir Leslie 's extraordinary suggestiveness . A few of our readers may remember that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English of Dean Alford , the self-constituted ' defender of the Queen 's English . Encouraged by his successes with a rather slovenly writer , Mr. Moon presently picked flaws in Mr. George P. Marsh 's use of the mother tongue , and later of Lindley Murray 's . Then this luminary ( incongruously radiating a more than solar heat ) set , apparently well satisfied with itself . Now that the revolution of time has brought back the King 's English , Mr. Moon emerges from obscurity , with ardor unabated , tricks his beams , and emits , with a portrait of himself , ' The Bishop 's English , ' " a series of criticisms on the Rt . Rev. Bishop Thornton 's laudation of the Revised Version of the Scriptures , and also on the English of the Revisers " ( London : Sonnenschein ; New York : Dutton ) . Mr. Moon is in his eightieth year , though he does not look it , but that he is still quite capable of affording amusement is witnessed by his proposed designation of the Revisers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blasphemous version . " For particulars we refer our readers to the little book itself . James T. Keen 's ' Manual for Notaries Public , Justices of the Peace , and their Employers in Massachusetts ' ( Boston : Little , Brown &; Co. ) is an invaluable little handbook . It is expressly confined to Massachusetts , but we should think it would be of use anywhere . To the Massachusetts notary or justice it is a necessity , for his powers and duties have been materially changed by recent legislation , while the law of commercial paper has been made to a great degree statutory . The noting and extending of marine protests is fully treated by Mr. Keen , and the book abounds in forms . The whole machinery and practice of the notarial law ( relating to commercial paper ) , usually taken for granted and therefore not understood , is fully explained . A. book of this sort in the hands of a good teacher of law supplements and hoc the treatises on the substantive law of bills and notes . Japan in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-printed volume in English of over 800 pages , with a map showing in colors the geological formations of the empire . It is issued by Baron Hirata , Minister of State for Agriculture and Commerce , and has been prepared under the supervision of Mr. ' Zamawaki , with revision , we imagine , by Mr. Henry Satoh , for the English is excellent . In eight parts , the author treats of geography , population , administrative system , and land as an institution , under which last head , with other interesting information , we learn that the hereditary estate of a peer can not be sold , transferred , mortgaged , or hypothecated . The primary industries , agriculture , fisheries , mining and metallurgy , and forestry , and the various kinds of manufacturing industries are well described in detail Foreign trade , finances , the army and navy , communications , transportation , and education are all concisely treated , and the statistics are fresh , abundant , and clearly arranged . The historic matter incorporated makes the text readable Though there are redundancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have here what is probably the most satisfactory single volume treating of Japan 's resources and possibilities in the year 1903 . The proof-reading is unusually good . The financial information , so full , accurate , and thorough , makes this book worthy of serious study by economists . The general description of the Library of Harvard University , prepared by Alfred C Potter , of the staff , and published as No. 55 of the " Bibliographical Contributions , " sets an example that every library might well follow . As that of a great university , the scope of Harvard 's collection is wider , and yet more specialized in certain lines , than that of a general library could be , and is more frequently tested than happens In the case of a circulating or reference library . Under very liberal patronage , and under the direction of men who were scholars as well as specialists , the wealth of what has been amassed is extraordinary . The Riant , Child , Fitzedward Hall , the slavery and law collections may be noted , but constitute only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscripts are those of Sparks , chiefly transcripts , of Arthur Lee , Charles Sumner , and James Russell Lowell  --  certainly of sufficient moment to attract attention . Mr. Potter has skilfully prepared lists of gifts and bequests of bookd from 1638 , of book funds , beginning with the first Hollis legacy of 1781 , and of the official publications The issue is a suggestive record of our leading university library , whose very eminence cries shame on its inadequate building . The development of industrial education in Germany during ' the last quarter of a century has been remarkable It appears from the Consular Reports for September that while in 1882 there were only 22 industrial schools in Saxony , there are now 287 . In Hesse " there is not a single village , no matter how small , in the whole country , which has not an industrial school of some kind , " generally with workshops for actual practice . In Baden " fully 20,000 apprentices are learning how to make clocks , and cotton , woollen , and silk goods . " The Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of teaching apprentices every subject which has anything to do with the building or repairing of railway cars , etc . . . . Each apprentice in these schools receives a remuneration of 20 cents a day , which is put out at interest until the end of his three years , when he conies into possession of both principal and interest . " In all Germany pupils of both sexes are taught forty-four different trades and industries . Publications of the Lick Observatory , volume 6 , is devoted to meridian-circle observations made from August , 1896 , to March , 1901 , by R. H. Tucker . They include the declinations of the Bethlehem latitude stars , additional standard close-circumpolar stars , zodiacal stars for heliometer measures of the major planets , the southern stars of the catalogue of Piazzi , the reference stars for the photographs of Eros , and miscellaneous observations , including those of Eros , Nova Persei , comets , and comparison stars . In all , there are included about 11,700 full observations , and 2,700 observations in one coordinate only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature for the year 1902 , including separate works , society publications , and official documents , is chronicled in the September issue of the Annales de Geographic . The list is divided among sixty-eight subjects , and contains more than a thousand titles in thirteen different languages , with numerous cross-references Valuable explanatory and critical notes , by the editor , M. Louis Raveneau , and his fifty-three able assistants , accompany nearly every title . We note , as last year , that a fuller analysis is given to our Government publications than to those of any other country . Of the Monthly Summary of , Commerce and Finance it is said : " Ce recueil officiel americain est devenu des plus prdcieux pour toutes les questions d'ordre Sconomique et colonial . " The index of authors contains more than two thousand names . In Peterntann 's Mittethingen , number six , evidence is given to show that the glacier of Jakobshavn , the southernmost of the great Greenland glaciers , has receded seven and a half miles since 1851 , two miles within the last ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South Pacific islanders treats of their various modes of cultivating the soil . A material addition - to the knowledge of the seismic conditions of Asia Minor is to be found in a long list , with notes , of earthquakes observed since 1894 at seven stations in the peninsula . An interesting account of Diamantino , a town in western Brazil , given in number seven , shows that South America , not Africa , should now be called the " dark continent . " Diamantino is the last outpost of civilization on the verge of a vast unknown region inhabited by hostile tribes . The town , formerly noted for its diamond mines , was destroyed in a revolution in 1901 , and its future is uncertain . Other subjects discussed are the wanderings of the eastern Eskimo , and the Atlas Mountains of Morocco . One of the revelations furnished by the latest Heft , No. 150 , of the ' Statistik des Deutschen Reiches , ' the official digest of the last national census of Germany , is the remarkable fact that within that empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and professions , surpassing in number the sects and sectlets of America , which has not yet reached the 200-line , but seems to be making rapid strides in that direction . Germany reports 49 kinds of Protestant Christians , more or less closely connected with the State churches , and 107 " other Christian " confessions . Among the non-Christian creeds are found Mohammedans , Buddhists , Brahmans , fire-worshippers , sun-worshippers , etc . The list has special rubrics for atheists and materialists , and , rather singularly , closes with " confessors of no religion . " These data show clearly that the union of state and church does not prevent the development of the most extensive religious-dissent The Transactions ( Ifitteilangen , ) of the German Asiatic Society of Japan , volume ix. , part ii. , contain a paper , by Hans Sperry , of considerable value to artists and architects as well as to the general student , on the universal use , in old Japan , of bamboo as an article both of cultivation and of sale , as well as for material in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author reviews both the native and foreign literature on the subject . Dr. Hefele contributes a long paper full of detailed information on his travels in Saghalin , East Siberia , Mantchuria , China , and Korea . There is also a good German translation of the wonder-working grace of the goddess Kwannon , who , by the " way , anciently was a male , but changed sex when introduced into Japan and is worshipped under divers local names . It is well to recall that this society published last year a Festschrift , in celebration of its twenty-fifth anniversary , containing its history and a catalogue of its publications , most of them rich in science , and altogether a most creditable showing . The Korea Review for June , 1003 , follows up the Asiatic Society 's paper on Choe Chiwun , Korea 's greatest man of letters , with further commentary and illustration on the historical and literary side . A scholar from Nippon writes of the Japanese occupation of Seoul , in May , 1592 , showing that " the invader was not a barbarous destroyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual " The usual brief articles on local customs , archmology and folklore , the news calendar , and an instalment of Professor Hulbert 's Korean History , complete the table of contents . ? It is no flattering picture that Professor Woodberry paints , in the October Harper 's , of the South in American letters . Jefferson , " the one great dreamer ever born in this land , " might have been the fountain-head of a literature , but turned his talents in other directions . But the age of procreative energy in Virginia passed away even before Jefferson died . The higher life withered in the air of social tyranny , slavery catching and binding the master in the same chains with the slave . The great theme of slavery itself could generate literature in a Whittier or a Mrs. Stowe , but not in the soil sterilized by the actual presence of oppression . Poe is admitted as the one exception , " the one genius of the highest American rank who belongs to the South " , for Professor Woodberry holds that he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , in spite of all arguments to the contrary . Justin McCarthy writes entertainingly of the literary men whom he met in London in the early sixties , when he went to the metropolis to pursue a life of journalism and literature Kinglake struck him as " one of the most brilliant writers of his time or of any time , " though an ineffective and labored speaker in the House of Commons Newman seemed to have a faculty of eloquence entirely apart from mere rhetoric , winning his way by force of sincere and lofty thought , embodied in appropriate phrase , but wholly unaided by the arts and gifts which usually serve the great orator or preacher Ruskin 's chief service was to sound the battle-call to controversy and set people to thinking . Richard Burton , McCarthy knew as a man of irrepressible energy , impatient of differing opinion , the inevitable dictator of any assembly in which he was present , an indomitable dogmatist , but refined and ennobled in temper andman. - ners , as the years passed by , through the sweet and gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing out all that was best in him On the basis of stratified remains of at least five or six successive culture periods , Max Uhle , of the University of California , argues for a Peruvian civilization of no less than three thousand years ' duration Mary Applewhite Bacon presents a reassuring account of the efforts made to furnish industrial education to the children of the poor white families which have been drawn to the mill towns of the new South . The - " Easy Chair " editor renews his warfare against present-day popular fiction , while the " real editor " announces the beginning in the next issue of a new serial which " will furnish a fresh justification of the historical novel " ? a crooked pin for the Easy Chair , as it were ?

Booker Washington writes of the Fruits of Industrial Training , incidentally saying a word to reassure those who , like Prof Burghardt Du Bois , have feared that his policy involved the entire sacrifice of any aspirations for higher intellectual development among the negroes . Henry Van Dyke pleads for the adoption of a few new technical terms for the science of English verse . It was Poe , we believe , " Who talked like a book of iambs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn meties " but we doubt whether the substitution of stress for accent , bar for foot , seven-stress for heptameter , etc. , would be any less provocative of profanity . The natural sciences have already pretty effectually walled out the layman by a rampart of new terminology , let literature ponder well before taking the same course . Professor Van Dyke makes a brief but forcible plea for the study of English poetry as an effective means of culture . A Lawrence Lowell pushes the study of college rank and distinction in after life into a new field , showing that those who succeed in getting a place on the Harvard teams have much less than the average chance for future distinction The inevitable explanation is that football and baseball have been so highly developed on the technical side that very few students can hope to become expert players and give proper attention to their mental development at the same time . ? Volume v. of ' The Philippine Islands , 1493-1803 1898 ' covers but two years , 1582 and 1583 , those just succeeding the arrival at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domingo de Salazar . The latter is sometimes called " the Las Casas of the Philippines " for his attacks on the Spanish system of enslaving the natives under ithe " encomiendas " and excessive tributes We have , in his letters to the King in this volume , some eloquent protests against oppression of the natives , throwing many sidelights upon the condition of affairs in the second decade of Spanish occupation Gov . Pefialosa indirectly takes issue with the Bishop in his communications covering this period , but his defence is hardly convincing We are given , however , in this volume itself , glimpses of the temper and personal jealousies of the men involved in this rising " friar controversy of the Philippines " which should have cautioned the editors of the present work against so sweeping a statement as this in tho preface to volume v. : " The Spanish conquerors are ruthlessly oppressing the Indians , caring but little for the oppoSition made by the friars ; but Salazar exerts as far as possible his ecclesiastical authority , and , besides , vigorously urges the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws are accordingly enacted for the protection of the natives , but , of course , this interference by the Bishop occasions a bitter hostility between the ecclesiastical and tho secular powers  --  perhaps never to be quieted . " If the editors of this work wish to live up to their declarations of impartiality as between the factions whose strife has characterized all Philippine history , they must not be led into such unscholarly and by no means impartial statements as the foregoing The hostility between ecclesiastical and secular nowers in the Philippines did not begin solely , nor primarily , in the manner stated . The most we can say is that the early missionaries , in general , took a humanitarian view of the needs of the situation , whereas the greed that had drawn most of the first conquerors there led them to seek to exploit the natives when the natural riches they had foolishly hoped to find were not to be picked up off the ground as gold nuggets . But neither set of men had an entire monopoly of humanity nor of rapacity , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the work in question will show . ? Besides the above-mentioned correspondence , volume v contains further evidence as to the jealousies and dissensions between the civil authorities themselves , an interesting " report on the offices salable in the Philippines , " and the instructions to the Commissary of the . Inquisition in the Philippines ( this officer was a dependent ofthe Inquisition in Mexico , to whom persons apprehended were to be sent for trial ) . But the main document of this volume is the ' Relation of the Philippine Islands , ' by Miguel de Loarca , written from Panay about 1582 . Indeed , this is altogether the most valuable document yet produced in the series De Loarca was a soldier , undoubtedly an officer of Spanish troops , who had served in the islands from the arrival of the Legaspi expedition and had seen all parts known to the Spaniards up to 1582 . Without an undue amount of missionary prejudice as to the natives ' religious and other customs , and with a much keener appreciation than friars and civil rulers had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importance to tell , his relation carries a presumption of veracity in the evidence it bears of a keen observation ; and , while by no means such a scientific treatise as modern scholarship would demand , it is one of the most important of our early sources of information about the Filipinos . It occupies 154 pages in this volume , the old Spanish text and the translation being published page by page In connection with this document , more than ever , appears a defect in the editing , viz , in the lack of sufficient or sufficiently good annotations . One might also ask that some uniformity of spelling and rendition of technical and other frequent terminology be enforced  --  a rule all the more necessary where various persons are engaged in the work of translation ? The Club of Odd Volumes of Boston has reproduced Morton 's ' New-England 's Memoriall , ' with an introduction by Arthur Lord . So far as the mechanical execution is concerned , there is only praise to be given The value of Morton 's work has diminished greatly since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of the curious and " poetic " in his colorless annals to give him a place in any library of American history . The introduction contains some slovenly work , which could easily have been avoided For example , the writer quotes Lowndes 's mention of a London edition of 1669 , a copy of which he said had been sold in 1824 in the Nassau sale ; but Mr. Lord says " it is not probable that an edition was ever printed in London . " The Nassau catalogue gives no place of publication , but only the date 1669 . Lowndes 's note must have been based upon a personal examination , or was a mistake . A reference to Clavel would have shown that an edition was printed in London for R Chiswel and about 1669 , but no copy , unless that of the doubtful Nassau collection , is known Mr , Lord also describes a MS copy of the laws of Plymouth Colony , once in the possession of Dr. Ames , but is unable to trace its whereabouts It lies in the Boston Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years since In spite of such defects , this reprint is to be welcomed An index is much needed . ? The Collections of the New York Historical Society for 1895 comprise the fourth volume of W. S. Pelletreau 's ' Abstract of Wills in the Surrogate 's Office , 1744-1753 . ' As a source of genealogy and real-estate history the record is invaluable , and the accuracy and historical notes of the editor have added to its general utility . To the economic side much interest attaches The growth of the city in population , the preponderance of English names , and the multiplication of foreign names other than Dutch , point to a social change , while the evident increase in the amount of personal property and in property covered by the wills indicates the growing commercial importance and material prosperity of the town . The confusion of currencies noted in the earlier records has disappeared , but the same bewildering range of bequests exists ? from thousands of acres , plate and gold , to a piece of eight , a warming-pan , a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , but are infrequently mentioned , nor are implements of trade often specifically bequeathed , though a large number of the wills is of persons following some industry . Negroes are frequently named , and sometimes they are given their freedom  --  less frequently , their freedom and a sum of money . An " Indian boy " stands as the survival of a practice that disappeared long before negro slavery Books and " libraries " are to be met with , but the " great Bible " and " great Holland gun " were a family possession . As a curiosity may be quoted the subjects needed to qualify a man to be a Doctor : " good arithmetic , navigation and surveying , and Lattin " , but the testator intimates that his son may be either a doctor or a merchant . MURRAY 'S BYRON . The - Works of Lord Byron . A New , Revised , and Enlarged Edition . Poetry : Volume VI . Edited by Ernest Hartley Coleridge London John Murray ; New York Scribners . The new edition of Byron is nearly finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poetical Works , but it now appears that a seventh volume will be necessary , and this will contain epigrams and occasional poems , an extensive bibliography , and the index To the bibliography , which we believe has been entrusted to really competent hands , one may look for the correction and adjustment of much that has been left at loose ends in the work itself . The present volume , of more than 600 Pages , is entirely occupied with ' Don Juan . ' There is the usual gleaning of hitherto imprinted Byronic marginalia  --  much of it trivial , but all of it interesting  --  and , in addition , there is a considerable amount of " new material . " This new material consists of seven satirical and heavily annotated stanzas on Lord Brougham , originally meant to follow stanza 189 of the first canto , and of fourteen stanzas of a seventeenth canto , Printed from a manuscript formerly in the Possession of Hobhouse This is the fragment which Trelawny found at Missolonghi . It consists mostly of characteristic reflections , and contains one interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Temperate I am  --  yet never had a temper , Modest I am  --  yet with some slight assurance , Changeable , too  --  yet somehow Morn seniper ; Patient  --  but not enamoured of endurance ; Cheerful  --  but sometimes rather apt to whimper , Mild  --  but at times a sort of So cities furens , So that I almost think . that the same skis. ? I 'm one without  --  has two co. three within " Mr. Coleridge 's apparatus eritices is not easy to understand In fact , he seems constitutionally unable to express himself with precision on such matters as bibliography and the sources and history of his texts . In the volume before us this chronic disability becomes particularly troublesome . The editor informs us , at the outset , that " the text of this edition of ' Don Juan ' has been collated with original MSS in the possession of the Lady Dorchester and Mr. John Murray " - At this point one might expect a list of the manuscripts or at least some further statement about them ; or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere , certainly , it was the editor 's duty to give definite and collective information as to the extant manuscript materials and his manner of utilizing them But nothing of the kind will be found in the volume The reader must go to the several cantos and study the footnotes  --  he must infer , divine , and even guess outright  --  if he wishes to get at the facts which a little more care or skill on the editor 's part would have set before him in a dozen lines . Nor is this all Grant that Mr. Coleridge was not bound to make his volume easy to use in the way suggested He might at least have refrained from putting obstacles in the reader 's way He has , it appears , collated the Murray and Dorchester MSS The results of his industry will be found in a considerable number of variant readings , duly registered at the foot of the page , where variant readings should be So far , - so good . Unhappily , however , there is dire confusion in the labelling of these variants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are marked " MS. " simply , but sometimes " MS M " ( e. e , Murray MS ) is used There is apparently no distinction On page 72 , for example , two variants are followed by " MS M. " and three by " MS " In this particular instance one finds ample room for perplexity , since , in a note on stanzas 190-198 , Mr. Coleridge speaks of a " second or revised copy " of these stanzas , and also of " the first draft , " in terms which indicate that both are extant Yet it appears that all the variants on page 72 are from the first draft , and that the difference in their designation is mere oversight or whim It is not , however , until we reach canto iii . that the imbroglio becomes complete In this canto some variants are marked " MS , " one " MS . M , " and some " MS D. " The first two designations appear to be synonymous ; the third means . no doubt , " the Lady Dorchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word of the relations of " MS . M " and " MS , D. " Perhaps the editor expects us to extract the facts , by some alchemical process , from a note on page 143 , which note , however , characteristically involves a fresh problem in divination When we come to canto vi. , we are informed that " two MSS . ( A , B. ) are extant , A in Byron 's handwriting , B a transcript by Mrs. Shelley . " " The variants , " adds the editor , " ate marked respectively ALS A , MS . B. " Throughout this canto there is no difficulty , if we except the slip by which " MS " pure and simple is once used , apparently for " MS . A " ( p. 273 ) But canto vii . affords a fresh embarrassment The variants are almost all marked " MS , " but on page 310 we hear again of " MS . A " and " MS . B " Now , one would have supposed that these two MSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that they have something to do with canto vii Are we to infer that Mrs. ShelleY 's transcript included both cantos ? And , in that case , did her copy of canto vu. correspond almost exactly with MS A , so that " MS " in the textual notes now means " MSS " ? Who is to say : We have not exhausted the problems suggested by Mr. Coleridge 's apparatus eriticus , but we have probably said enough to convince the reader that this volume can not stand as a final edition of ' Don Juan ' Much may be done to , make up for such incoherence by careful attention to the manuscripts in the bibliography promised for volume vu , and it is with this in view that we have pointed out the defects of Mr. Coleridge 's method . The details may appear insignificant , but no one can deny that , if such things are to be recorded at all , they should be set forth accurately and in an intelligible way . It seems odd that the editor has not acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five volumes that precede ' Don Juan ' The commentary is managed better than the apparatus eritices It is based , as was fitting , on that in the edition of 1833 , but is both fuller and more exact Considerable pains have been taken to supply references and to verify quotations , and a great many of the notes are quite new . On the whole , the annotation is satisfactory . Yet it is not free from the freakishness and lack of care which mar the critical apparatus A few miscellaneous examples will make this clear Byron himself attached to " Thine ' incomparable oil , ' Macassar " what seemed ( and seems ) a sufficient comment- " ' Description des series ineomparables de l'Hulle de Macassar ' See the advertisement " To this Mr Coleridge appends the following Orphic saying : " ' An Historical , Philosophical , and Practical Essay on the Human Hair ' was published by Alexander Rowland , Jun , in 1816 It was inscribed , To her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte of Wales and Cobourg ' " " What of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Coleridge should have given us more information , or less . If there is any connection between Byron 's line and Mr. Rowland 's treatise on the Hair , he should have pointed it out If  --  as is apparently the case  --  there is no connection whatever , he should have denied himself the pleasure of citation . We may next give an instance of pure blunder  --  due to unskilful adaptation of a note in the edition of 1833 . " With the exception of La Fayette , " writes Mr. Coleridge , " who outlived Byron by ten years , and Lord St. Vincent , all ' the famous persons ' mentioned in stanzas ii. - iv had passed away.long before the First Canto . of Don Juan ' was written " ( p 14 ) We say nothing of the euphemistic phrase ' tpassed away , " which may be meant for a grim joke , coming as it does immediately after a list that includes four who were guillotined , one who poisoned himself , and one who was assassinated . Our concern is with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Don Juan ' was written in 1818 . Among the " famous persons " were " Buenapart6 , " who died'in 1821 , and " Dumourier , " who , as Mr. Coleridge informs us on the preceding page , died in 1823 . In note 1 , page 87 , we have quotation marks with no indication of the source of the words quoted The matter happens to be of no consequence . A less excusable oversight of the same kind leaves Byron 's reply to , Hazlitt 's criticism ( p. 12 ) quite adrift . According to the editor of 1883 , the note in question is " on Lord Byron 's MS. , " and is signed and dated " B. Venice , 1819. "
