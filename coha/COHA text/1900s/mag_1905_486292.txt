In his dealings with the Panama Commission , President Roosevelt has gone far towards justifying Senator Tillman 's description of him as , an undeniably " patriotic man , " who yet allows no obstacles of legality or propriety to deter him when bent on doing something . So bad an impression has his latest way of rushing to his goal made upon the Senate , that not one-friendly Senator was found to make objection - when unanimous consent was asked to have all of the President 's Commission appointments recalled and held under consideration . The whole affair is in a sad tangle . At the very , moment the President is trying to fill the Commission , a hill is actively pushed to abolish it altogether . In such circumstances , Mr. Roosevelt 's nominees may well feel like the Lord Chancellor out of office , who , when asked what he had to say about " the situation , " replied that the main evil of it was that he had no situation . We have a fresh illustration of the sort of " ruler " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sprang up " in Santo Domingo , and was wise enough to turn to the White House to " appeal to us to help " ; and it seems to show that the " chaos " which Mr. Roosevelt said he was preventing has supervened . It has been asserted by American correspondents in the island that President Morales dared not leave the " seat of government , " lest he fall out of that seat altogether , or - be assassinated if he showed himself in public to his loving subjects . An adventurer such as he is must live in constant uncertainty what he will be doing next day ; and if he has become persuaded that his fine scheme of sustaining himself in power by the aid of President Roosevelt is about to fail , nothing would be more natural than for him to run away . He is grandiloquently referred to as " General Morales " by some of President Roosevelt 's supporters ; but the man is , in reality , a renegade priest . He left the priesthood because he found the vows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican Congress , and before he had fought his treacherous way to the Presidency , he introduced a bill permitting priests to marry . The only piece of - benevolent Philippine legislation vouchsafed by the Fifty-eighth Congress was the bill providing for the construction of railroads . Bids have been advertised for , and some received , but on Thursday , Secretary Taft , after consultation- with the Bureau of Insular Affairs and Gov . Wright , decided to reject all- the proposals - in hand , change the terms somewhat , and - begin over again . Just what the ' competing offers were , or on what points they were unsatisfactory , has - not ' been made known . Yet the task of allotting these - contracts or concessions is - not only complicated and difficult , but very much out of our line . Several of the proposed routes are laid out in undeveloped regions where ! immediate --  profits from operation are absolutely out of the question . Secretary Taft and the other Philippine experts were so sure of the - unattractive character of the- business proposition presented that they persuaded Congress to authorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital of the new roads . Undoubtedly , it would be easy to get ' bidders on some lines , but our purpose is defeated unless the whole - network is constructed . The first attempt having failed , bids- will again be opened in January , and contractors who are willing to- forego the ' guarantee of profits , will be offered - every possible other inducement . It- is much better policy than that of the old-time prodigal land-grants , but paternalism and State-aid do not appear to mix well with cold business principles The most noteworthy feature of the relations between the United.States and Tahiti in the past has been the annual payment of $45,000 for the transportation of ten mails a year  --  aggregating some 400 pounds of letters and 6,000 of merchandise and printed matter  --  to that delectable island . It was our- impression that this $6.50 a pound rate was cut off last year and the figure restored to something nearer , the $350 a year which we had paid for mail-transportation by sailing vessel in the . nineties . So it can hardly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the French inhabitants that Uncle Sam was preparing to ' buy the island . The price mentioned , too ; is extremely high : four million dollars for about 15,000 popUlation - is equivalent to $266 apiece , whereas we bought the Filipinos , in Reed 's ' phrase , " for $2 a head , unpicked , " and these are-the last quotations we have on desirable islands . We should be exceedingly loath " to " dis appoint the - estimable Tahitians , ' but we fear that , with-the Philippine Tariff bill on a snag in the Hou-se ; POrte Rican citizenship - still a " matter ' fo-r didpute , and our adniinistration of its affair 's Under fire , this is hardly a propitiouktime to put through a bill paying for - mere - insular possessions . ' The commission appointed by the President last summer to recommend revision of the naturalization laws had no difficult task , inasmuch as it would be hard to propose any change in the pres-ent System that would not be a change for the better . Their report now made strikes first at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to - the- last degree that - some courts should make it notoriously - easier than others to attain citizenship , while it is simply ridiculous that the process should cost less at one place than another . The commission would make naturalization purely a Federal function , would issue a uniform - certificate on petition three months in advance , and , would abolish the two years ' " declaration of intention " entirely . Naturalization is - meanwhile to be- restricted to persons who intend to remain permanently in this country and who understand the- English language . As-to the last proviso , there may be difference of opinion , for at least a plausible plea might be made as- to the fitness for - citizenship of residents of largely foreign-born communities here , who retain their mother tongue and yet take an interest in our- affairs. , It must be remembered , - in this connection , - how much the States themselves have done to give- value to the certificate of nationalization . When it was possible for a man- to vote in many Western States on his- first papers , or no papers at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary as at present . There must be almost as- much satisfaction in being called " game " and a " good .. fellow " by the - President of the United . States as in being appointed to a postmastership At least ; that thought is all the ex-postmaster of Kokomo , Ind. , had for Christmas solace . On Decors. : her 6 , it will be remembered , announcement-was made , in new customary unofficial way , of a new policy in refer enicet-o- - Presidential postmasters . " When the term " of such an official d : has expire " - so the plan " was outlined , " he will be continued in the service if his record is reported to be ' good ' or'excellent . ' " The - man from Kokomo blunderingly supposed- that such a case as his own was referred to . Even the Congressman who had recommended his successor - spoke in high terms of Ms conduct of the office , and introduced him at the White House . " I wanted , " he said modestly , " to understand the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other man Was to be appointed , and he ' said that : he acquiesced : but , just ' for curiosity 's sake , we ' should ' like to-know What was " the scope of the re= tent " - order ? ! To ' whom does it ' ' apply ? Does it apply to anybody ? Why was it put out at all if the first case arising under it was to be decided in contravention of it ? What is the existing policy regarding postmasterships ? This case was apparently settled on the theory that postmasterships belong to Congressmen  --  the very doctrine which the President so effectively demolished only last year . Can it be that a general and immutable rule of conduct is not regarded as " practical " in the White House ? Another railway rate bill has been introduced in Congress , this one by Senator Dolliver of Iowa . The list of such bills is now long and imposing Each , according to " intimations from high sources , " has " the backing of the Administration . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall finally pass will be " the Administration bill . " The failures will he credited to their self-sacrificing sponsors . Senator tonfirer wants each member of the Interstate Commerce Commission to receive $10,000 a year , instead of $7,500 . The additional $2,500 is intended to persuade good men to serve , and thus to remove the objection that the Commission is " a refuge for the politically distressed " It is by no means certain , however , that the higher salary would produce the effect intended . Men of the right calibre take places on the Interstate Commerce Commission , as on the bench , not for the sake of the pay , but for the sake of the honor and the opportunity to perform an important public service . Some of the best men who have ever been on the Commission ? Judge Alfred M. Cooley , for example  --  have accepted the lower salary . The distress of decayed statesmen and other bone-hunters would be rendered only the more acute by the sight of an extra $2,500 on which they might lay their prehensile fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas that when next a Senator is to be chosen , the people may have something to say about it . Newspapers of the State are printing many letters from their readers urging that some such plan be agreed upon before 1907 , when Burton 's term expires . The Topeka Capital reports " a more general and wholesome popular interest than has been shown in a Senatorial election in perhaps twenty years . " Most of the citizens who " write to the papers " on the subject propose that the next Senator be nominated by a party State convention , exactly like the candidate for Governor . Senator Hopkins of Illinois is a product of this plan , and also Senator Burkett of Nebraska , though in the latter State the candidates ' names are also placed on the regular ballot , and thus subjected to the additional test of a popular vote . There are also advocates of choice of Senatorial candidates by the direct primary , a plan which has made astonishing progress in the past two years , though it has not yet had an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been chosen by any popular vote may very well he true ; we doubt if Platt could have been in this State . Yet ii is probable that Mitchell could ' have secured his Senatorship in one way as well as another ; and , in this State , Depew led his ticket when be was a candidate for Secretary of State Popular election , in itself , is not enough to secure us first-class Senators . - The contest for Speakership of the New York Assembly is such a shifting battle that prediction as to the outcome is futile . One or two facts , however , stand out clearly . The first is that Go-v . Higgins is not likely to be impeached for usurping the functions of the Legislature Temperamentally , he is not a usurper . He prefers to throw responsibility on others whenever he can do so , and let them enjoy the glory for success or the blame for failure Senators and Assemblymen who meekly took orders from Odell  --  who , under his command , left their thinking to be done by " wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolt against Higgins . The second fact which is now evident is that Gov . Higgins and the other opponents of the Odell machine would be in a much better position for fighting if their candidate had a stronger claim to the Speakership Against Mr Wads-worth 's character and aims no one brings any serious charge ; but his warmest friends can not assert that in his single term this young man has manifested the intellectual and moral power and acquired the experience needed for a Speaker in this trying crisis . We trust he will develop the necessary qualities , but he can not aspire to the office on the basis of proved strength . This is an argument which is now the only legitimate defence of the discredited and debilitated Odell organization . Enthusiasts for Government control , as being supernally wise , efficient and safe , will not draw much comfort from the testimony of the State Superintendent of Insurance on Thursday . Mr. Hendricks confessed to a state of affairs in his department almost as shocking as the insurance looting itself . Ignorance of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; inspections that were farces ; examiners blind of both eyes ; dictation by politicians  --  that is the kind of appalling admission drawn out by Mr. Hughes Inefficiency was never ' writ in larger capitals . The other horn of the dilemma is corruption . In either case , the shameful condition of this important branch of the State government calls for insant consideration by Gov . Higgins . He has amiably dawdled over it too long . Mr. Hendricks , by his own evidence , is no more fit to be State Superintendent of Insurance than a blind and deaf and toothless dog is to keep off chicken-thieves and burglars . The whole department needs a radical overhauling . A live and honest man must be put at its head , and the Platt and Odell dummy assistants replaced by somebody able to guard the policyholders ' interests . With such a revelation of imbecility or venality on the part of public officials set to watch them , the insurance grafters must be astonished at their own moderation . They might have carried off the very buildings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial aspects of the transaction by which the Metropolitan system has been absorbed by the Belmont lines is , of course , all the keener 0 ' 3 account of the price paid being as yet a secret . What all can see with half an eye , however , is the great importance of the combination from the public point of view . It is easy to say that the consolidation of all the city traction systems was " inevitable " ; that a single management means greater economy , etc . But all depends upon the thing aimed at . If we have in the making a new engine of political power ; if the intention is to confront the city with an intreuched and insolent monopoly , and to insist that all the new subway constructions be given to the Belmont interests on their own terms , the case is serious It will be for the Rapid Transit Commission and the municipal authorities to exert all their power in behalf of the public . If it be said that no other company can build and operate a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interchange which the Belmont lines possess , the reply is that those facilities are , in the long run , under the control of the city The weapon of competition is not yet wrested from our grasp , because we can compel even a giant monopoly to allow a competitor to live . A corporation , however vast , has not yet become our master . It is the power to regulate , to give orders that construction and operation of traction systems be for the public interest and convenience , which should be appealed to and exhausted before recourse to expropriation should be thought of . Rumors are being industriously circulated that William Ellis Corey , president of the United States Steel Corporation , will be unanimously reelected  --  possibly with a special vote of confidence . When the report was published that Corey was to be sued for divorce by hiS wife , and that a widely advertised actress was involved in the affair , people began to say that the president of the largest industrial concern in the world should be a man of more stability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corey was prepared to fight ; that if attacks Were made on his private life , other people whose private lives were unsavory must stand from under . Whether these threats have actually convinced any one Of the large holders of steel stock that Corey is the right Man to continue in the presidency , We are unable to say The inferences from the argument are , however , painfully obvious If the directorate of the Steel Corporation retains Corey on the ground that his business skill should not be confounded with his shortcomings as a man , the directorate will thus explicitly announce to the world that it cares only for shrewdness and is indifferent to character This would not be a reassuring declaration , for people are not yet ready to believe that a Steel Trust by its mere hugeness can defy the forces s- hick inevitably demoralize other enterprises The revelations of the last six months , if they have taught men anything , have reinforced the eternal truth that in positions of trust , high or low , skill without solidity of character is nothing . Campbell-Bannerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plain , blunt man may meet a clever tactician . Balfour 's friends indulged in a good deal of chuckling , at the time of his sudden resignation , over the way in which he had caught the Liberals in a trap- They would be forced to form a Ministry , which could be , in the nature of the case , only a disjointed collection of nobodies , and then the country - would see what it had lost in the ' Balfour Cabinet . But the Liberal Premier did , in fact , succeed in forming a Government which is confessed by all to be much stronger in personnel than Balfour 's own . And now Sir Henry comes forward to indicate a policy which will have the united support of the party , and apparently has already the approval of the country . The Home Rule issue , which was infallibly to split the Liberals , appears only in the subordinate pledge to turn over the administration of purely Irish affairs to Irishmen , as soon as the thing can be done . With Parliament what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland And on the issue of free trade , which Campbell-Bannerman put in the forefront , as it will be in the forefront of the electoral battle ; on peace with all the world ; on a freely elected Parliament in South Africa , with the cessation of what is practically slave labor by coolies , and oh the cutting 44W11. of military expenses , the Prime Minister was strong and satisfactory . The Liberal Government has begun auspiciously . Germans have been quick to see that the Liberal Ministry in England affords , the best possible hope of reestablishing cordial relations between the two nations . It would be unjust to say that the Balfour Government - countenanced the attacks of the Jingo English press upon the Kaiser and his people ; yet it was plain that , in its desperate clinging to official life , it could easily hint that , owing to complications with this or that country , it would be extremely unwise to " swap horses " just at that particular moment Fortunately , Campbell-Banuerman is under no such temptation . Moreover , the historic attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendship with other nations The presence in the new Cabinet of James Bryce would alone reassure Germany , for it is only a few months since he published an admirable letter of protest against the senseless anti-German campaign , for which the military and naval Jingoes were so largely responsible Evidently the Germans do not intend to lose a moment in beginning the work of pacification . The recent meeting of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce , which resulted in the friendliest resolutions on the subject of Anglo-German relations , was an echo of similar gathering in London , with Lord Avebury in the chair There will certainly be other such demonstrations . In his recent speech in the Reichstag , the German Chancellor denied that Germany had any thought of sending troops into Russian Poland . That plan was merely another invention of the hostile English press Germany , he declared , would remain absolutely neutral and let events in Russia take what course they might ; for this he gave his word . Accepting it at its full value , the question still remains , not what Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution will do to her . One of the very first questions to come before the Prussian Landtag is the voting of more money for the Germanization of Prussian Poland . The Berlin press admits that the great sums thus far spent have achieved very little , and calls for more money to build dikes to keep out the waves of Russian discontent . In Prussia itself the three-class suffrage appears more than ever intolerable  --  the worst of all electoral systems Bismarck called it  --  in view of Russian progress and the success of the universal-suffrage agitation in Austria and Hungary . It was proposed last month to have a street demonstration throughout Prussia on a given day , in Russian style , to demand Suffrage changes ; but tb9 so , cial-Democrats , Bebel leading , thought it - wiser not to run the risk of collision with the authorities and possible bloodshed . But the mere proposal shows how the Russian example is telling . The blood of the martyrs may be the seed of the Church , but sometimes the seed falls upon stony ground M. Brunetiere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Revue des Dews lifondes a pessimistic view of the condition of religion there Since the enactment of the Ferry laws , Catholic influence in France " has been seriously impaired . The dispersion of the congregations and the secularization of the state , " Will , he thinks , complete the ecclesiastical disaster Many French Catholics are disposed to look with indifference Upon the difficulties which now confront the clergy , and there is a lack of any ecclesiastical organization for concerted action As a remedy , it is recommended by M. Brunetiare that there should be a council of all the French bishops to assume systematic control . He does not desire the formation of a clerical party , like the German " Centre , " but only a kind of synod which may do something for the afflicted dioceses and parishes . In other words , he would have a clerical party affiliated with no political party . The fact that in a Catholic country like France the Centre should be so weak is very significant . But in things religious and ecclesiastical the French conscience has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In-some countries a policy of suppression has been a failure . No political coercion kept Scotland from being Presbyterian , nor certain Swiss cantons from being Protestant . But France has often passed from one extreme to another , following sometimes the policy of a monarch , sometimes that of a national assembly or parliament , and has gone with a light heart from one creed to another . The ieign of Henry IV . was first Protestant , then Catholic . Atheism was triumphant during the Revolution , but Napoleon made peace with the-Pope . In seeking a modus vivendi for the Church in France , M. Brunetl  --  re has his eye upon the ' United States , where the Catholics , without being allied to any particular party , have had their plenary councils , and unmolested have carried on their work But , in respect to this , it is idle to compare the two countries In America traditions are few and flexible .
