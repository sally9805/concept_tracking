txt The entire elevated railroad system in the Borough of the Bronx was at a standstill from a breakdown at 1 o'clock this morning . Enormous feed wires carry the immense electric power from the main power house to the power house of the Manhattan Railway Company at One Hundred and Sixty-first Street and Third Avenue . One of these wires or sets of wires ' feeding one of the two big dynamos to run the system in the Bronx broke down with a tremendous explosion that shook the building at 1 o'clock . Every elevated train in the borough stopped , and the chief engineer shut off all the power , not knowing what happened . This turned out every light in the building , all the lights in all the stations and in every train , and brought every train to a stop . There was tremendous excitement all along the line . The explosion made a loud report and blinded for some minutes all the men in the power house . The explosion was accompanied by sheets of flame and ? by play of blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big building and out of the windows . Chief Engineer B. E. Acklen was in the lower part cf the building , where the two big dynamos are , with his switchman , George Miller . When the explosion took place , they put their hands over their eyes to keep out the light , that even penetrated their eye-lids . Their eyes pained them , but they knew something must be done . Miller fell down from the shock , but recovered and crawled on his hands avid knees through the basement to the switchboard . He knew by long use where it was , and he felt around for the key . He was in the greatest danger of touching a switch that would kill . He found the big switchboard and the right key , and he at once turned it and shut off every light and every current in the elevated system of the borough . At that instant all the station and car lights went out and the train stopped . The excitement was very great through all the elevated trains . No one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with persons returning to their homes in the borough , there was a good deal of fear . Some trains were stalled in the middle of the road between stations , and these were in a bad way , as there was no way to get down from them . The station agents telegraphed everywhere to find out what was happening . Ticket agents ran down to telephone , conductors and motormen shouted to people in the street . and policemen ran up to the stations to try to find out what was the trouble . Miller and A ? hlen soon learned what had happened . They found that all the other ' men in the building had been partly blind- ? ed by the fierce streaks of flame , but none teas injured and all , including themselves , soon recovered . It was said the feed wire for one of the dynamos had parted , but that it could soon and easily be repaired ; Acklen found that one dynamo would work the system and that was turned on , and in a few minutes the lights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good order .
