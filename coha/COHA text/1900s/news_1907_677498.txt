txt We hope the quite authoritative disclaimer of any unfriendly sentiment or purpose toward this country on the part of Japan which we publish this morning will check the tide of senseless rumor and conjecture which has of late occupied so considerable a part of the space of newspapers and of the thoughts of men . Asked by THE ' rums to state for the information of the people of the United States the position of Japan , Viscount HAYASHI , his Imperial Majesty 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , authorizes Ambassador AOKI to make through THE TIMES " a categorical declaration of the absolutely pacific intentions of Japan . " Japan has , like other countries , her radicals and her agitators ; the usual proportion of her populace is no doubt excitable . But these absurd and mischievous rumors of a rupture of friendly relations or possibly of war over the San Francisco school controversy have sprung into being , it seems , out of spontaneous sources of fabrication in this country without any originating impulse from Tokio . In part , we suspect in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination of the California Representatives , who left the White House the other day in a condition bordering on excitement due , probably , to the straightforward and emphatic language employed by the President in telling them what the rest of the country thought of the behavior of the people of San Francisco . Some part in the mischief-making , too , must I be credited to sensational journalism , Which is never idle or delinquent when news or inventions worthy of big headlines are afoot . The rumors of a frowning and hostile attitude on the part of Japan were self-contradictory . To impute to that empire an intention to resort to any other measures than those of friendly negotiation for a settlement of the San Francisco differences would be to impute to her a headlong and half-insane irresponsibility altogether incompatible I with that steadiness , that wisdom , and that fine sense of correct procedure ' ' which her statesmen have for years exhibited in the conduct of international affairs . Japan has not been thus suddenly transformed . In particular , she has not for slight causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of her subjects from I San Francisco 's schools , determined to forfeit the sympathy and the friendship of the American people so conspicuously manifested during her recent war , ' and the sincerity of which we have given her no occasion to doubt . It is known in Tokio as well as it is known in Washington or New York that the American people are ashamed of the most un-American behavior of the hoodlum element in San Francisco . They have been disgusted by it , they condemn it . It is known to all the world that our relations with Japan present no other clash of interest or point of controversy . The San Francisco matter may be left to the resources of friendly negotiation and to the curative action of time , reflection , and the growth of a decent public opinion on the Pacific Slope . There both Governments are willing to leave it , and both are actuated by the friendliest sentiments and the purpose to maintain good understanding .               @ @ @ @ @ @
