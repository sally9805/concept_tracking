 | MOROCCO is the last Moslem derelict not yet cut , carved , controlled , or conquered by some European power . A century ago , independent Moslem lands stretched from the Atlantic to the Bay of Bengal . They lined North Africa . The Turkish Empire held its ancient boundaries . Persia and Afghanistan were untouched . North and central India were under Moslem rule . England has absorbed all India , and Afghanistan is a protected state . Persia is under Russian control . Turkey has lost half its territory , and the Sultan has just mobilized his army in the vain hope of protecting his last European province , Macedonia . Egypt is English . Tunis and Algeria are French . Tripoli will soon be Italian . All the lesser Moslem principalities , Oman and Zanzibar , the central Asian khanates , and the recent kingdoms which once stretched from Senegal to Somaliland , each owns some European overlord . Morocco alone of them all still holds its old boundaries , has no debt , owns no European protectorate . and maintains the rude independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African and Asiatic lands have absorbed European ideas . weapons , organization . and adiministration . Withdraw from Morocco a few score European residents in the interior , eliminate Tangier , with its Spanish colony of 6,000 or 5,000. and the 219,000 square miles . and 9.500,000 population of this Moslem empire in the extreme northwestern corner of Africa would still be as both have been for a thousand years , ? the same in peopple , in government , in institutions , in transport . trade . manufacture , an d agriculture . The great university at Fez , one of the very best in the Moslem world , whose graduates do better in Algerian institutions than the graduates of local schools , teaches the geography of Ptolemy , the medicine of Galen ( I have heard him gravely quoted ) . the logic of Aristotle . and the commentaries of Bokkhari and Malek , Moslem worthies . The judge expounds the Moslem adaptation of the Justinian code . The ruler lives , judges . and beheads as did Solomon .  | His viziers are to-day and to-morrow are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing has changed politically , socially , commercially . This territory , the size of France , as large as New England and the Middle States , with a population as large as Pennsylvania and Ohio , or Belgium and the Netherlands , sells to Europe $8,500,000 and buys X8.000,000 , or considerably less than half the exports and imports of a single square which holds the largest department store in the city where I write . On its either coast , Atlantic or Mediterranean , Morocco has no good harbor for nigh sixteen hundred miles . It has in all its area no river which will float a raft , and none which you can not , at ebb , ford in summer a mile from its mouth . Its Algerian frontier is a desolate and impassable series of passes and limestone ranges . The Atlas at the south , with its peaks of 12,0 0 0 to 15.000 feet . looks on the desert and the month 's caravan track to Timbuktu .

For one hundred miles of Rliffian ( the Riffs are independent Kabyle or Berber tribes ) coast , no vessel ever lands and no European sets foot , though on clear days the shore is in sight of Europe . This isolation has been the salvation of the Moslem and Morocco . Even at Peking , there are European envoys . There are none at theMoorish capitals of Morocco City and Fez , save as they journey for a special audience with the Sultan from Tangier . The unchanged population of the interior is sharply divided between the semi-independent Berber or Kabyle tribes of the mountains ( a white race , often blonde , of unknown origin ) , where a European travels only with grave risk , and the cities , with their two plains , ? one at the north , with Fez , Mequinez and a group of small cities , and the other at the south , with Morocco City and its ports , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , submissive , taxed and oppressed by the rude irregulars of the Sultan .

Theoretically . any member is eligible . Practically , the line is now limited to the Sherifian family of a tribal chief in Tafilet two hundred years ago .  | You see Morocco on the map , and you seem to see what is on the rest of the map , Algeria or Tunis ; but these are colored by this day . In Morocco , you are really looking at a territory past-dated by centuries . Its last Sultan , Mulai Hassan , 1873-9I , understood all this . He was a good Moslem . He lived a sober , sedate life . His leisure he spent hearing read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions . Ile wore the garb of centuries . He borrowed no money . He discouraged European travel . The adventurous explorer found himself headed off by polite but persistent guards . He had no European friends . He judged in the gate as his father had done . A n Englishman , Sir Henry de Aubrey MacLean , once an English subaltern , drilled his troops ; but the force was small , cost little , kept the hill tribes in bounds , and collected taxes on the plains . Morocco should have wanted " progress . " The Moors should be yearning for improvements . Quite the contrary . Your true Moslem is satisfied . His faith in his religion makes the average Christian belief seem trival . Renegade Christians who have become Moslem you daily meet . The converted Moslems you can count on your fingers .

To the Moor of place and breeding they are so far above our Western racket , hurry , and change that when Ben Sliman , a Moor of family , said , on his return from his mission as Envoy to the coronation of Edward Vii .. that he was glad to be again in a civilized , more literally polite , land , he spoke words of truth and soberness to which all floors would respond . 1 have myself known a Moor of means who , being able to live in London , and having tried it , preferred Fez . In an evil hour , there entered Mulai Hassan 's harem a Circassian girl , Lalla R'kia . She came in the good old way . It is an old trade ? that in women . Her family was none the less good , one that furnishes the harems of the great and has for generations . She bore a son , ? Mulai Abdul Aziz. the present Sultan . It is a bad cross ? Arab and Circassian known as such to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given to European imitation , with no Moslem temperament . One such ruined Egypt , and such have brought disaster to other lines , through all Moslem history . When Mulai Hassan died on the march , in 1894 , the boy was fourteen , ? a Moslem majority , ? and his ambitious mother , versed in the harem statecraft of her race and sex , with a shrewd lord chamberlain , Si ' Bon Ahmed . made him Sultan . The tribes rose and were put down , ? heads on the gate , every tenth man left handless and women sold by the hundred in the slave market , ? and there was peace until Bon Ahmed sick- ened and died in 1899 . His estates were confiscated and his slaves sold , and there followed a year of changing viziers , ? each as lie fell going off in chains and his slave household , delicate women folk and all , sold at auction . When you have seen it , as I have , you will know what the past was . A pretty girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule all grew slack , and when the queen-mother died the young Sultan , even now but twenty-four , set out to tighten them . He put aside older men , ? among them Haj 111okhtar Ben Abduilah , the last of his father 's " honest viziers , " ? and power came to a young man , late governor , Kaid M'heddi ul Menebbi . Reforms began . They are perilous . His new vizier had been minister in London and Paris . He was in touch with the West . The new Sultan got himself bicycles and cameras . A single consignment brought him two automobiles , twenty-five grand pianos , and fifty bicycles . In September , 1901 , he reformed the prisons ? by edict . The spring before , at the great feast , he called his governors together and told them to oppress no more . He launched a new system of taxes , and added to the simple tithe and land tax of the past a pestilent host of occupation imposts , all scientific and grating on local prejudice . He freed trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual ruin of the muleteer . He was interviewed by the Morocco correspondent of the London Times , Mr. Walter B. Harris , a man of great personal charm , and made him his intimate friend . Arthur Schneider , a New York artist , taught him to paint , ? an abomination to every good Moslem . Things began to happen . The French spread 15,000 troops out in 1900 , and occupied , 1901 , Tuat and Figuig , oases on the line the railroad must take from Algeria to Senegal . places long held by Morocco , and by 1902 , with two warships out , the Sultan accepted the new line and an interpretation of the treaty of 1845 which will cost more territory . The Fez mob got out of hand and slew a naturalized Jewish-American , Marcos Ezaguin , and York and Dixie were needed to settle the account . In August . 1901 , a Kabyle raiding party swept off from a small port , Arzila , a Spanish young woman and boy . Whites make higher-priced slaves . Mulai Hassan stopped this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss over single women . The Spanish minister , Senor Ojeda , now at Washington , collected an indemnity , but it was all a bad precedent and a worse sign . The whole land began to seethe . In October , a Moslem fanatic shot an English missionary , Mr. Cooper , in Fez , took refuge in the most sacred shrine in the empire , was dragged out and shot . It was just and plucky . The London Times praised it extravagantly ; but in Moorish bazaars and mosques they do not read the Times . The man , by Moslem law , was a murderer , Mulai Hassan would have executed him , and none would have said aught . Mulai Abdul Aziz has outraged every Moslem sentiment . Last November , the tribes began to rise . The Zeminour rose on the road from Fez to Rabat . The Beni ' - der plundered up to the gates of Tetuan . In the south , the smoldering rebellion in the Wad Sus spread across the Atlas .

By December , he had beaten the Sultan 's army ; by January , he was close to Fez . At the elevation of that lofty plateau ( Fez is 1,200 feet up , and the region beyond 2,000 to 3,000 , with snow-peaks even in summer ) the tribes can not be kept together in midwinter . The Sultan 's organized troops , inflicted a defeat on the ' Pretender , " as our dispatches call him ; but in the eyes of the Moslem , as he is of the royal caste , success and proclama. tion in the mosques would give him full title .

The local prediction of correspondents is all with the regular government : but all the bands of authority are unloosed . The Morocco question is brought near Europe . France has a fair claim on the hinterland , below the fertile strip along the Straits of Gibraltar . Settled and guarded , Morocco is good for 200,000,000 bushels of wheat . The ownership of this northern strip , opposite Spain and Gibraltar , halts action . There are many signs , in the freedom with which France is acting in the interior , that a secret treaty during the Boer war may have settled all . Meanwhile , Mulai Abdul Aziz has begun the fatal step of borrowing money . For a Moslem prince , that begins European control . His own safety lies in the jealousy of Europe and the objection to a fanatic seizing the throne and excluding Europeans from the interior , where German trade is growing and German traders multiplying .
