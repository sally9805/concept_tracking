FRANCE has never produced anything distinctive in decorative art but vanity , caprice and affectation . Has debased the Greek , weakened the Roman , burlesqued the oriental and corrupted the modern . The patronage of kings who could lavishly support , afforded time and material for both exquisite workmanship and careful experiment . Court fashions of vacuity and extravagance were so easy to copy they became universal . Republicanism always loves to imitate the bad taste of royalty . The good points of anything can not be copied ; they must be attained . No wonder popular appreciation fastened on Sevres and Saxe . Was not the royal monogram there ! Did not a king 's mistress announce that those who bought not as much as they could afford were not good citizens ? SaxeSevres ! The school of the stuck-on , the unrelated . Venus rising from the sea in a soup plate ! Roast beef and rosebuds ! Cupids in gravy ! At a New York hostelry for women one may discover the benign features of Martha , Washington beaming through the consomme . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begot the Cupid . Nothing has done more damage to good taste than this pernicious little beast . He is neither Christian nor pagan , flesh , fowl nor good red herring . It is so easy in  | case of decorative doubt to stick one in each corner of a ceiling or a butter plate ; to connect with garlands of tissuepaper roses and knots of blue ribbon . The festoon or " scallop " should be the rope for Cupid to hang himself on , for it is his companion in iniquity . It merely represents a string sagging between two nails , and is only really decorative ire momentary effects ; as in festal garlands strung from support to support . This difference between the passing and the permanent is an important decorative principle little thought of in modern life which makes great things fleeting and clings to trivialities . The " Empire " changed the joy of the Greek temple to affectation , its worship to " culture ; " ? " Colonial " tears t he roses from the garland and keeps the string . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway near Holland House , where one may notice over each window a square of sandstone carved with sculptured festoon of drapery . George IV used to call this " DishragTerrace , " ? the only instance on record of a British monarch having any taste . Sevres had its origin in the desire of Louis XIV , that Pericles of French history , to imitate the newly imported porcelains of China , already so prized . The first pate-lendre can scarcely be told from its models , but , as before , art should be a growth and not an mutation . With changed conditions original intention is forgotten . Symbols ceased to be symbols . Designs descend to crazyquilts . The scattered sprays whose studied relation of line and vibration of color is an art apart , become mere unrelated tulips and roses , with little less than Dutch heaviness perhaps and therefore called graceful . but without a bit of that growth and advancement which ' the Japanese took from the seine source . But the kingly cypher covered all defects , and kings can do no wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the art . Protected arts always become merely protected manufactures , forced to repeat the styles that made them famous . Even the Comedie Franraise is not above this criticism . One of the most interesting dinners I ever attended was given for me in an early visit to Paris by a member of the ancient Del Prado family of Spain . A prisoner ( luring the siege of 1870 , it had occurred to the old marrquice , a veteran bric-a-brac s 1 u m m e r , that royal mementoes were at a discount and Napoleon relics at the buttom of the pile ; so , - while others were gazing hungrily through the fences on the animals of the Jardin d ' Acclimalalion , she became a welcome figure at the deserted antigaaires and bought Napoleons for nothing and the rest at her own price . Plate-by-plate she matched her finds and could at last spread table for twenty-four , though only eighteen sat down on this occasion . It was indeed a royal dinner ? No one would have thought of what was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always placed with the guest card , been before us . Each course brought a cry of wonder and a new series of anecdotes . Was it creme d ' asperge that covered the graygreen reproduction in hard-paste of the early soft-porcelain a la ( 7r inoisc ? But the bonhonnieres were real pale-teodre and led to some dry technical details of the difference by a ceramisle present . Someone told how in 1709 , to cover the ravages of continual war and a dreadful famine , the king sent all his gold and silver plate to the melting pot and would only use china at his table ; and the example being followed by his nobles , the  | pride of France became her beautiful services . The next course that h e 1 d some trailed fancy , had to slip back a bit also to portray the beauties that surrounded Anne of Austria . Surely next , it was a gold-ringed carp that lay upon those reproductions of court scenes of the great Louis . The heavier Romanism of the regency brought in the first entree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were authentic which held the somewhat shocking realism of vegetable roses to recall La Pompadour , to whom France really owes the glory of Sevres , if there is any , for she took it entirely under her protection in its infancy ? but Pompadour was a better judge of religion than of art . The sorbets shed the color of rosecarne Du Barry stole from her predecessor and rebaptized with her own name . The guests now roused to enthusiasm and argument discussing the wonderful adventures and remarkable life of this milliner 's apprentice . No one seemed to understand her character till , as one lady said she showed her plebeian origin in being dragged screaming to the scaffold while Marie Antoinette asc e n d e d the steps still a queen , and another recalled that Du Barry need not have ascended those steps at all if she had not through the kindness of her heart let an aged friend escape instead of herself when there was a chance ; a long-haired poet , who for years had been librarian at the Musee Carnavalet , remarked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychical stages of lassitude and activity , tenderness and cruelty , philosophy and thoughtlessness every twentyfour hours ? those are far less rare beings who give the world an ideal of consistency to admire . " The subject of cosmic natures was continued till the turquoise and rocaillegold of Marie Antoinette served up the roast beef . Horrors ! the gleam of the knife , the drip , drip of the blood on all that tender loveliness ! Yet such is Sevres and such is life ; it is the contrasts that usually make realities unbeautiful . A lady-in-waiting at the court of Austria told how her pupil , a little archduchess named after her ill-fated relative , used to draw her finger over her  | throat after she said her prayers , and say : . If 1 am naughty will they cut my head off too ( ' From the mantel looked the well-known bust of white biscuit-ware which holds the traditional regal poise and scorn and people were as mixed as roast beef and blue ribbons in trying to comprehend what the poet meant by a " cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ate off tin plates iu his jailor 's kitchen . A princess , with the biggest diamonds I had then ever seen and a life-size crab in baroquepearls crawling over her bosom , filled up the gap by saying that she thought Napoleon was both cosmic and conventional and we got further confused , for cosmic ought to include everything . but it certainly does not include the conventional . Now for the royal N 's A gilded band dominated with the letter that in its clay dominated the world circled the roasted pheasant . The old general said it was grand to be able to condense history to a single initial , and the scion of the Napoleonic house present took a great deal of time in explaining his relationship , which nobody could understand . Then just a row of plates was laid on the table . Heavily painted scenes in Napoleon 's career , that would not permit of being covered ? a sort of silent service . Then another of all the por traits of Napoleon ; and it seemed a very sacrament just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came an extra course of fussy sentimentality that , some how , never seems to go well with cooking and be longs to annual exhibitions of pastry cooks . Some thing that looked like a stewed mushroom on a bit of artificial garden-mold in a miniature birdcage . The cage meant this , and the mold that , and the mushroom nobody knew what , but all was supposed to refer to Malmaison and Josephine , and the little blue plates beneath really had belonged to her . Of course , the first Bourbon rule of ten months that came with Napoleon 's departure for Elba ( lid not give much time for art ; but the Restoration serv ice was the most superb of the evening ; its having been easier t o gather than earlier pieces . It held some amber pudding and seemed to he of solid gold ? that marvelous lining laze which is really one of the wonders of Sevres , fired a n d burnished again and again . An old man covered with decorations , who looked a centenarian , told how  | remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cloth of gold . The lovely woman called Queen Hathor remarked that in the holy teachings of Syria color vibrations have the same influence as spirit vibrations ; that if we add a wave of beauty to another of the same kind we increase the other a hundredfold , while contrast is like hatred and jealousy ? it stabs and wounds and kills . Someone remarked that there were no Aiglon plates and how strange it was that the " Little Eagle " had returned to history only by way of the stage . Sweet-tooths were glad there were so many monarchs , for an extra dessert had to be served to recall bigot Charles X , whose interlaced C 's and fleurs-de-lys made the most beautiful monogram of the evening . Styles continued to grow grandiose and the compotiers now had heavy metal mounts . The bourgeoise profile of Louis Philippe looked more common place because surrounded with imitation jewels . All were glad to see the double eagle of the second empire with the fruit and nuts , for we could not have stood any longer dynasties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " cried one of the meekest ladies , and a royalist declared he was sorry for thrones to totter but he could eat no more . Yielding to the spell of rare wines and good digestion , people began to talk in somnolent tones of the last visit of Eugenie to Paris and what she must have felt to stop at the Hotel Continental wit h the balconies overlooking the Tuileries gardens ? h e r Tuileries . The princess and the apoleonic scion w ere both asleep and a very disa greeable w o m a n took the opportu- nity to say that she thought the Rue de la Paix meant more to Eugenie than the Tuileries . " You do not understand , " replied Queen Hathor ; " I have seen her wearing her crown of sorrows ? it has made a noble nature of her , the thorns have turned to blossoms . Tier thoughts are now in another world and it does not make any difference to her where she lives . " Someone cracked a nut loudly which woke the princess , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful evening ! the only deduction to be made was that Sevres might be very bad art but a very good kindergarten lesson in history . The chief merit of Sevres lies in the perfection of its creamlike porcelain from a material standpoint , and the brilliancy of its colors , which have almost the richness of enamels , though without the variety of tone which reflection , iridescence and translucence give to vitreous pastes . The most vaunted bleu-de-roi , a magnificent under-glaze of cobalt , is very painful unless softened with nets of gold . stripings of vermieelle or stipplings of oeil de perdrix . Nature seldom uses brilliant colors in flat tones but approaches by gradation or reserves for climax , as the high-light of a jewel . The dark sapphire or gros-bleu is more effective but does not go well with the white centers usually left in plates . In very rare pieces it is beautifully combined with apple-green . Of course , the turquoise will always be the favorite in this farni.11e-bleu , but again we lack the variety given in oriental work . RosePompadour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ribbon borders of giltedged green till the effect is merely calico . The continual combination of roses and tulips seems most clumsy and stupid in taste . There are almost no two flowers that so completely destroy each other 's character . Princess and peasant ! They are not even on speaking terms . Of course one finds marvelous finishings , flesh like the pastes of Bouguereau , details worthy of Meissonier . Two of the loveliest meat-studies I over saw were the Venus and Adonis and Leda and the Swan in Queen Victoria 's private collection at Buckingham palace . Among the most elaborate services of modern times was that offered Monsieur de Lesseps by the French government at the opening of the Suez canal . It would have seemed a great opportunity for w e alt h of Egyptian detail and historic ornament as seen in the magnificent costumes studied from the treasures in the royal museum  | at Boulak for the first production of Aida on the same occasion . But all was lost in the usual triviality , neither French nor oriental . The set cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty for the whole , " said the lady who gave me one of the cups de Lesseps presented her . Watteau began art as a scene painter and gave the courts the empty grace of the stage . Boucher and van Loo painted in the same atmosphere of unreality . French orientalism is a failure , not even the jumble of our " cozy-corners , " but deliberate change , for everything in French art must be made Parisian . Their elephants are boulevard-toys with skins of satin . Even the French ' sphynx ' is not a success . Her riddle is too easy to read . Some of the most prized collection pieces are actual bouquets in china . It was one of these which the new Dauphine Marie Joseph de Saxe sent to her father , king of Poland and elector of Saxony , to show that her adopted country could produce porcelain equal to Meissen . Saxony was ever the rival of ' Sevres. both in ancient and modern times , and as with Sevres , has recently started a new school which has completely changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later speak . but must first treat of both Sevres and Saxe as popularly known . Meissen . Saxe. or Dresden china , as it is usually called , and Dresden statuettes may be found in every badly furnished drawing room , parlor , salon , in the world . Seldom according with the surroundings , except perhaps in some palace ; for such charming inanities require all the accessories of idle and capricious wealth : gilded doors opened by liveried servants , the rustle of silks , smiles , laughter . affected graces , the minuet , the spinet , the songs of old time as interpreted by Yvette Guilbert . These dolls-in-porcelain with petrified laces give such trivial air . Especially as one often sees them on heavy mantels or piano tops . In a collector 's cabinet they become more personal , but as more personal , make one think of the . owner and wonder at the order of mind that can be interested in such a doll cupboard . What shall we say then of people who buy cheap imitations of such follies merely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlors of the rich ! Manufacture ever caters to this half-world of art , and one may find the **41;106;TOOLONG of bad royal taste down to the lowest bargain counter . In expression inane ; in action crude low comedy ; in poetry cheapest sentimentality ; in color not beyond ordinary chintz ; in design childish and unimaginative : they should be ranked with the marvels of confectionery that adorn a wedding cake , to be admired a moment and broken the next day . The expression studies of the Japanese are deep , wonderful , artistic even in. crudest grotesqueness . The line composition of their borders incomparable , the color riot of their phenix -- crowued princesses standing in snows of cherry blossoms beyond our gamut . Yet there is nothing in art that can not be used well if placed rightly , and another feast that comes to my mind was a Dresden dinner . Just as the diamond requires brillancy to sustain its brilliancy , so caprice requires caprice : silly Sevres the affectation of courts : flower-strewn Saxe the scattered abundance of fragile beauty . This time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally unprepared for the picture the dining ' room presented . It was as if Botticelli 's Flora had emptied her horn of plenty over the table . The chief treasures of the hostess being a magnificent pair of Dresden candelabra , she took these as the keynote and worked everything up to them . They were encrusted with artificial flowers in china of the usual calicogarden stupidity as if a servant had arranged them ; hyacinths , tulips , roses , forget-me-nots , mignonette and vegetables together , and of course supported by cupids . But their jumble was half softened and turned to profusion , for the cloth was a piece of old Louis XV brocade sprigged with almost the same design and its ground the color of child 's flesh . The hostess wore pink brocade with jewels of the jardiniere type , many small stones set in antique silver . So period and detail were forgotten in a scattering of flowers and the song was of spring . The birds sang . the brooks sparkled , the buds burst forth and the cupids were loves again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be boxed up the clay after the party . Such an effect could not be permanent . It is well to keep daylight from our follies . Out of sight everything that only gives  | brilliancy to a special occasion , and destroys the stateliness and grandeur or repose and simplicity of a home . You will enjoy celebrating all the more next time and your parlor will not have the incongruous effect of a secondhand auction room . The stranger to France who visits the Salon or the vitvines of the Luxembourg today will find , treasured like jewels , signed like paintings , examples of ceramic art unlike anything he has seen . Among them are pieces marked " Sevres " that the world would never recognize as such without the label ; for new schools have sprung up in all the capitols of Europe and , although too naturalistic and influenced by the affectations of the Art-Nouveau , one may turn with relief to them from the inanities of the past . In some one finds the greatest names of art . Even Rodin , colossal Rodin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been satisfactory , for it 's like leading the bull to the china shop and asking him to make cupids , yet the grand example of his treatment , the austerity of his drawing , the exquisite charm of his conception and the imprint of his great personality , have been an influence beyond the nods of kings and the smiles of courtesans . His hand seemed to be unable to accustom itself to the material and could not carry out the suggestion of his sketches , His first grand vase in rose-camileon faience was scarcely voted a success ; though its frank ; pagan sensuality appealed after the traditional insipidities ; but his great jar , " Le Jour , " is the pride of modern Sevres . Probably the finest set of royal Sevres in this country is the Napoleon service in the possession of Mrs James Spencer Cannon of New York , as even in the museum at Sevres there is nothing to equal it of the same period . It was ordered by Napoleon I in 1511-1812 for his stepson , Eugene Beauharnais , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon III , it passed on to Empress Eugenie , who gave it to her godson Baron B from whose chateau it was purchased . It is a coffee set of most exquisite design and surpassing workmanship : the color , a deep palm-green with arabesques in gold and especially graceful handles of gilded bronze . The medallions , copied from the poets of the Ufizzi gallery at Florence by Didier , the great portrait painter in china of that epoch , are less offensive than usual , being only in a monochrome of sepia . In the same collection of treasures I was fortunate enough to find also a replica of the famous biscuit bust of Marie Antoinette on its original pedestal . In the last few years , Saxe and Sevres have both done the right thing to keep abreast with the awakening . Both have established protected schools , where joined to the wonderful processes of ancient times , one finds the most advanced decorative thought , directed by great decorators ? artists , not scene and cabinet painters . Of course being joined to such factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . From the day Sevres opened its school , a new blossom of glory flowered for France . Not alone does Sevres much for the students , the students have clone much for Sevres in complete revolution of methods that will ' soon make the old productions take their proper places as mere historical curiosities unworthy of imitation . The crowd around these jars at the Luxembourg are beginning to learn the word Sevres over again , but they are very expensive , and much sought after , and it will be long before the world takes up the new spelling . Most of the designs are direct but very poetical studies from nature , with atmospheric charm and true decorative arrangement of line , though without any of the power of conventionalization that always comes later in art . The last time I saw Cupid he was sitting on a ball of dandelion down , bent by the breeze . I hoped it would blow him away forever . I like the Hindu Dipuc better ; spell him backward and you will find how closely they are related . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
