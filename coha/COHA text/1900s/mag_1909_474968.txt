IT was not until I obtained a letter composed in flowery Italian , falsely representing me to be a distinguished American , that I was finally able to pass through the iron-bound lodg-way into the gardens of the Palazzo Peschiere . I had not found the place easily . It was in a maze of lanes and narrow , curling streets , first up and then . down , and forever seeming to hide away from me , although I had its cornices more than once in view , because it overtopped many other buildings , and stood out here and there at different points glowing in a mellow color of reddish-yellow in the face of the morning sun . It rose up on a terraced eminence that was but one of a hundred circling causeways , each climbing higher up the swelling hills that were covered with glittering windows like the shining lights of embattled eyes . None of the Genoese that I had interrogated could tell me where it was that Charles Dickens had lived , or that he had ever lived at all in Genoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had stayed for a whole twelvemonth and wrote his Christmas Chimes and Old Curiosity Shop and made many notes ; and the things that fashioned his ideas , that fed his reflective appetite with almost boyish delight , remain to-day as they were then . I had gone into the Galleria Iiazzini , the long arcade of shops that opens mysteriously from a queer and dusty pocket , back of the old , old Teatro Carlo Felice , and was poring over some rusty photographs which a cackling crone was trying to explain to me in a sad jargon , when an ox-eyed boy . who would have been an ideal for a Florentine marble-worker , suddenly came to my side as if popping wu from nowhere , and further surprised me by telling me in very good English what I really was trying to find out . " The Palazzo Peschiere ? " Then he turned eagerly to this woman , who might have been the mother of Eve , and rattled off something in Italian that brought inc almost instantly the photograph . I looked upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how I bad hunted and hunted for it in all the queer streets and plazas of the town , wherever there was a picture shop ! No one would understand me , no matter how I would pronounce it , and I had given up in despair . As for the name of Dickens , it bad simply called forth a look of amazement . But here it was ? and this boy , whom I thanked with a lira , said : " That 's where Dickens lived ! " God bless his heart ! He was as tiny as Tim himself , His ox-eyes were screwed upon the picture as tight as my own . " And how do you know , and what do you know of him , my lad ? " " I 've been in England , sir , and learned to read . . . I learned David Copper-field by heart , and sometimes I go up to this great house and look through the gate , but the portiere always drives me away . " And so it was this Italian boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my diminutive courier through all the haunts of the town where the great master had been ? even down into the ships . and into the strange little cantinas along the harbor piazza , where we ate polenta hot from the frying - pan ; and while standing there by a great heap of fried fish that smelled good and was steaming , I met the boy 's father . old Bartolomeo , the fisherman , who was known all along the coast from Pegli to Nervi , and perhaps farther away than that . He was fond of Pietro. his boy who could speak such good English . One day Pietro took me to the street where he lived , and pointed up to the Clark heights of it where it ran growing narrower and narrower ? a defile between ancient stone walls that nearly touched each other at the top , within which the sun had never shone . It was full of dark and sombre crevices and dismal shadows , and stretched from the open windows that gave no light to cold , dark rooms where ropes hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue and yellow , which filled up the spaces of the passageway like the color bricks in a paint-box . For hundreds of years this cleft , this mere fissure , between prodigious piles of buildings had been the same . Through it the young man Christopher Columbus had walked , full of his Irreams ; and near by , but a single step around the corner . was the Vico dritto Pnutieello , the street where he was born . lb had been once a cabin-boy like Pietro . Here it was that Dickens often lingered on his walks , and in all the passages that intersected it . " Look where you may , " he wrote . " up steps , down steps , anywhere , everywhere ; there are irregular houses , receding , starting forward , tumbling down , seaming against their neighbors , cripVIM. ( 7 ) ( 17 (  - -  No 711 ? 47 piing themselves or their friends by some means or other , until one , more irregular than the rest , chokes up the way and you ca n't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietro , and for the second time gone to the prison - like gate and could explain through my interpreter to the Bcpotian portiere , who fingered my introductory letter suspiciously , that I was allowed to pass in with the boy at my heels . It was a hack garden which we first got into , with an abundance of forlorn grass and weeds and straggling trees , and such closed-up jalousies on the rear part of the structure as to give me an impression of a coffee-colored comedian 's face with his blinkers down . But as I followed the path that led around at the side of the house I was unexpectedly confronted by a scene that arrested my steps and filled me with wonder . The sky was as blue as turquoise , with an edging close down on the horizon as delicate as the hue of a robin 's egg . This exquisite silken canopy covered a vast amphitheatre of brown hills patched by blocks of buildings in white and pink that faced the semicircle in regular parapets . Over the brown hills , the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn hedges , was now falling a mantle of delicate mauve as the red sun began to sink , but down below us. looking over other parapets of houses and city parks , and away off where the great port was gathered like a Sargasso Sea of missing ships , stretched the Mediterranean , bluer than the sky itself , with great streaks of indigo that continued on and on in segregation ? and then seemed to be forever streaming on . But if the city that now encircled below me was full of din and rattle , and the great Via Roma , that led like an artery up the eminence close by , was crowded with people , there was no noise here in this picturesque garden , with its tall sentinel cypress trees , all held up by banks of masonry in graceful coping , and extending out like a platform into an arena . Then as I turned my eyes to the small things of the foreground I saw the old fountain with the urchin and the fish where Dickens had stood on many mornings watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and sat down on the edge of the basin , that now contained but a pool of brackish water and some matted grass . Somehow this condition of neglect seemed a painful cerement , indicating not time go much as tide ; but in the passing of the affairs of men sonic of the chips that are hewn float out on an everlasting sea . It was this whole panorama , that I saw now spread around me , from which Dickens drew his inspiration as he sat in the sun by this same fountain and once wrote to a friend , " I have written a tremendous book ! " But if the skies were blue on this day Dickens thought they were not always so deeply so as pictures had led him to expect . In a letter written to Maclise , the artist , he said : " I do n't exactly know what I have done for my country , in coming away from it ah , here was the tide in his affairs ! ; but I feel it is something ? something virtuous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun set on the blue Mediterranean . It lies before me now deep ly and intensely blue . But no such color ' is above me . Nothing like it . In the south of France ? at Avignon , at Aix , at Marseilles ? I saw deep-blue skies , and also in America ; but the sky above me is familiar to my sight .... But such green ? green ? green , I never saw , nor yet such lilac and such purple , as float between me and the distant hills ; nor yet ? in anything ? picture , book , verbal boredom suchawful , solemn , impenetrable blue as in that same sea . It looks as if a draught of it ? only so much as you could scoop upon the beach in the hollow of your hand ? would wash out everything else , and make great a privilege ? to sit in arboreal retreat and behold the same feast that was spread before his eyes , and to touch the concrete of the very place that housed him ; to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precious packet of his letters written in his own familiar hand ? to feel the almost spiritual existence of Charles Dickens . Ah , but did not Peter , the son of Bartolomeo , dance when the portiere 's spouse , a defiant-like daughter of Italy , came in pattering steps to tell me that could come into the palace ! But it was with an air that I have seen in the hoarding-house lady when asked for lodgings . And here was what Dickens wrote , for me to tell you all over again : " There is not in Italy a lovelier residence than the Palazzo Peschiere , or Palace of the Fishponds . It stands on a height within the walls of Genoa , but aloof from the town , surrounded by beautiful gardens of its own , adorned with statues , vases , fountains , marble basins , terraces , walks of orange treesand lemon trees , groves of roses and camellias .. All its apartments are beautiful in their proportions and decorations . . . overlooking the whole town of Genoa , the harbor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delightful prospects in the world . . . It is more like an enchanted palace in an Eastern story than a grave and sober lodging . I go back to it in fancy , as I have done in calm reality a hundred times a day ; time ; and with the opening of splendid thoroughfares , and the beautifying of its parks and the establishment of the Via di Cireonvallazione. which skirts the eminences in a series of lofty corsos and whips the boundary of the sea , it presents a spectacle that Dickens would have revelled in , for none of the everlasting characteristics of the town have been spoiled as he knew them . The Strada Nuova and the Strada Balbi , the famous streets of palaces , are still there , and so is the wonderful old lane , the Sestiere della Maddalena. where the jewellers are and the filigree shops ? just as they were more than a hundred , yes , two hundred , years ago ? " And where they are likely to remain some time yet . " said my charmingly adaptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished me with the only human link connecting with the memory of the great author . " I ca n't say how well my father knew him personally , " said the Signor , " but I remember he told me much of him , and seemed to know of his life here , and had read the Pickwic ? Papers in English . I think if any one might have known him here at all it is likely he did , for strangers came under his observation somehow , as they did to all . hotel - keepers in those days who lived in Italy . He used to point out to me on his walks of a Sunday in the country the place where Dickens first lived when he came to Genoa ? the Villa Bagnerello or the " Pink Pail , " as Dickens called it at Albaro , a quaint old place surrounded by vine - clad terraces and on a little niche by the seashore . He lived there for several weeks before he moved to the Palazzo Peschiere . " It was of his days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of Monte Faceio , along the city walls : " In not the least picturesque part of this ride , there is a fair specimen of a real Genoese tavern , where the visitor may derive good entertainment from real Genoese dishes , such as Tagliarini , Ravioli , German sausages strong of garlic . sliced and eaten with green - figs ; cock 's combs and sheep kidneys .... They often get wine at these Trattoria from France and Spain and Portugal . which is brought over by small captains in little trading-vessels . They bring it at so much a bottle . . . and usually divide it in two heaps , of which they label one Champagne and the other Madeira . The various opposite flavors , qualities , countries , ages , and vintages that are cotnposed under these two heads is quite extraordinary . The most limited range is probably from cool Gruel up to the old Marsala , and down again to Apple Tea . " And I presume this remains true to this day . In nearly every one of the chaotic lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wines for sale in a ten-foot room that could scarcely contain a respectable sample of each variety . Of " Astis " and " Marsalas " there are a score of labels . Dickens had with him his wife and young family , and in spite of his penchant for prowling he enjoyed his domestic life with that rare and unctuous heartiness which was so notably characteristic . lie was eminently a worshipper of the hearthstone . In the letters he wrote from Genoa to his friends , whenever his home affairs are torched upon they read with a smack and a glow that could so only be expressed by one of a very warm . sincere . and youthful nature . his letters to Douglas Jerrold were as enticing as his big bohemian-like nature could be . " Come ! " he said , you can work in Genoa ! I would put you in a painted mom as big as a church and much o r e comfortable . There are pens and ink upon the premises ; orange tree-. gardens , and shuttlecoeks , rousing wood fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , his was a welcome indeed ! What is there in all the world more distreskg , more pathetic , than unrequited love ? ( his has something akin to its marble touch in the ' inappreciativeness of friends for those things that are offered from . impulsive and generous hearts and lightly cast aside . Dickens was forever inviting his friends to share his companionship ? never in trouble , but only in happiness ; to do something or other that he thought would be pleasant for them to do ; and while he was thus inviting them in his unselfish delight , he was like the boy whom most of us know about who , on hearing that the gilded procession is coming , loses the joy of it himself while he gathers the household to come and see it . his letters during his Genoa year are remarkable in their solicitous and patient fervor in the interests of others . They rend with so every opportunity . I do not know whether this disposition on the parr of the Italian people is much changed . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre ; he attended the play in Genoa on every possible occasion . Meanwhile he was arranging for a series of amateur theatricals to take place in London directly on his return , and his mind was full with the project of the Daily News , the editorship of which lie assumed in the following year . Besides this he was framing his story The Cricket on lbe Hearth . In all his Italian journeys Dickens never seemed to care to tarry anywhere so much as in Genoa , for which he had a peculiar affection . While he was still holding his residence there he took a little trip into Florence , Rome , Naples , and Venice . Of Naples he spoke that candor he always did of everything he saw , and which few people dared , or do now dare . Ile said , " It is a fine place , but nothing like so beautiful as people make it out to he . " He thought the bay , as a piece of scenery , immeasurably inferior to the hay of Genoa , " which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in like manner will bear no comparison with Genoa . But there is none in Italy that will ? except Venice ! " And so it must have been a singular love for this city ? more than for any other Continental place ? that made Dickens stand so steadfast in his ardor . He was not even able to dismiss it while on his errands to London ; he thought Venice the wonder of the world , but he preferred his Genoese walks to the interruption of the gondolier 's stali and premi . One day he stole away from his beloved garden and went to London to stay a week in order to give a reading that he had long before consented to do , and also to visit his publishers . His first letter to his wife said , " If you had seen Macready last night , undisguisedly sobbing and crying on the sofa as I read , you would have felt , as I did , what a thing it is to have power ! " Here was a man who was affecting all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others falter , happy with his simple fountain of the urchin and the fish in the gardens of the Palazzo Pesehiere , or rambling through the open places at the foot of the ' Maddalena with his eyes boyishly set upon the windows of the little filigree shops . He loitered in the halls and lobbies of the famous open . palaces , " the walls of some of them , within , alive with masterpieces by Vandyke ! " or in the doors of the neighboring apothecary , or stood and watched the maccaroni seller , or else pondered over the psychological conditions that made so many monks out of masculine beings constantly in evidence and always repulsive to him . " If nature 's handwriting , " he wrote , " be at all legible , greater varieties of sloth , deceit , and intellectual torpor could hardly be observed among any class of men in the world . " But of the Cappucini he thought them the best friends of the people , comforters and counsellors . Of the Jesuits ? " they go slinking noiselessly about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would visit the wonderful interment-place called Campo Santo with its endless galleries of stone cupboards where the rich could vie with one another in excessive sculpturing . Much of it was extraordinary and pathetic then , but there is more of it now . Toward sunset he liked to go into one of the churches and sit reflectively . and then reach the garden to watch the fall of night . " And now the sun is going down in such magnificent array of red and green and golden light as neither pen nor pencil could depict , and to the ringing of the vesper bells darkness sets in at once without a twilight . Then lights begin to shine in Genoa and on the country road ; and the revolving lantern out at sea there , flashing for an instant on this palace front and portico , illuminates it as if it were a bright moon bursting from behind a cloud .
