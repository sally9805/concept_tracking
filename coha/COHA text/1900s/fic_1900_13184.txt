She sings under-breath , fantastically Say how many kisses be Lent and lost twixt you and me ? Can I tell when they begun ? Nay , but this were prodigal : Let us learn to count withal .

To cast me off :  --  Not thus , not thus . Peace , I can blind him yet , Or he 'll despise me . Nay , I will not be Thrust out at door like this . I will not go But by mine own free will . There is no power Can say what he might do to ruin us , To win Will Herbert from me ,  --  almost mine , And I all his , all his  --  O April-Days !  --  Well , friendship against love ? I know who wins . He is grown dread . . . . But yet he is a man . Exit Dickon into tap-room ( To The Player , suavely ) Well , headsman ? He does not turn Mind your office : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . What is to do , Do quickly . . . . Do you wait for some reprieve ? Guilty , you said . Nay , do you turn your face To give me some small leeway of escape ? And yet , I will not go . . . Coming down slowly Well , headsman ? . . . You ask not why I came here , Clouded Brow , Will you not ask me why I stay ? No word ? O blind , come lead the blind ! For I , I too Lack sight and every sense to linger here And make me an intruder , where I once Was welcome , oh most welcome , as I dreamed ! Look on me , then . I do confess , I have Too often preened my feathers in the sun , And thought to rule a little , by my wit . I have been spendthrift with men 's offerings To use them like a nosegay ,  --  tear apart , Petal by petal , leaf by leaf , until I found the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for once , and cast away . And so , at first , with you . . . . Ah , now I think You 're wise . There 's nought so fair , so . . . curious , So precious-rare to find , as honesty . ' T was all a child 's play then ; a counting-off Of petals . Now I know . . . . But ask me why I come unheralded , and in a mist Of circumstance and strangeness . Listen , love ,  --  Well then , dead love , if you will have it so . I have been cunning , cruel ,  --  what you will : And yet the days of late have seemed too long Even for summer ! Something called me here . And so I flung my pride away and came ,  --  A very woman for my foolishness !  --  To say once more ,  --  to say . . . p. 26 THE PLAYER No , I 'll not ask . What lacks ? I need no more ; you have done well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw But you could school him . Women should be players . You are sovran in the art : feigning and truth Are so commingled in you . Sure , to you Nature 's a simpleton hath never seen Her own face in the well . Is there aught else , To ask of my poor calling ? MISTRESS FYTTON I have deserved it In other days . Hear how I can be meek . I am come back ; a foot-worn runaway , Like any braggart boy . Let me sit down And take Love 's horn-book in my hands again , And learn from the beginning ;  --  by the rod , If you will scourge me , love ! Come , come , forgive . I am not wont to sue : and yet to-day I am your suppliant , I am your servant , Your link-boy , yes , your minstrel : so ,  --  wilt hear ?

He 'll win not Herbert from me ! Crossing to him Will you have music , good my lord ? THE PLAYER ( catching the lute from her ) Not that , Not that ! By heaven , you shall not . . . . Nevermore . p. 27 MISTRESS FYTTON So . . . But you speak at last . You are , forsooth , A man . And you shall use me as my due :  --  A woman , not the wind about your ears ; A woman , whom you loved . THE PLAYER ( half-apart , still holding the lute ) Why were you not That beauty that you seemed ? . . . But had you been , ' T is true , you would have had no word for me ,  --  No looks of love . MISTRESS FYTTON The man reproaches me ? THE PLAYER Not I  --  not I. . . . Will Herbert , what am I To lay this broken trust to you ?  --  To you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , Whom all hands reach for , and this woman here Had set her heart upon ! MISTRESS FYTTON ( with sudden fury ) What fantasy ! Surely he must have been from town of late , To see the gude-folk ! And how fare they , sir ? Reverend yeoman , say , how thrive the sheep ? What did the harvest yield you ?  --  Did you count The cabbage heads ? and find how like . . . nay , nay ! But our gude-wife , did she bid in the neighbors To prove them that her husband was no myth ? Some Puritan preacher , nay , some journeyman , To make you sup the sweeter with long prayers ? This were a rare conversion , by my soul ! From sonnets unto sermons :  --  eminent ! p. 28 THE PLAYER Oh , yes , your scorn bites truly : sermons next . There is so much to say . But it must be learned ; And I require hard schooling , dream too much On what I would men were ,  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make me con the truth . Yes , blind , you called me , And ' t is my shame I bandaged mine own eyes And held them dark . Now , by the grace of God , Or haply because the devil tries too far , I tear the blindfold off , and I see all . I see you as you are ; and in your heart The secret love sprung up for one I loved , A reckless boy who has trodden on my soul  --  But that 's a thing apart , concerns not you . I know that you will stake your heaven and earth To fool me ,  --  fool us both . MISTRESS FYTTON ( with some interest ) Why were you not So stern a long time since ? You 're not so wise As I have heard them say . THE PLAYER ( standing by the chimney ) Wise ? Oh , not I. Who was so witless as to call me wise ? Sure he had never bade me a good-day And seen me take the cheer . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am no longer anything . Speak : What are you ? MISTRESS FYTTON ( after a pause ) The foolishest of women : A heart that should have been adventurer On the high seas ; a seeker in new lands , To dare all and to lose . But I was made A woman . Oh , you see ;  --  could you see all ! What if I say . . . the truth is not so far , Watching him Yet farther than you dream . If I confess . . . He charmed my fancy . . . for the moment ,  --  ay The shine of his fortunes too , the very name Of Pembroke ? . . . Dear my judge ,  --  ah , clouded brow And darkened fortune , be not black to me ! I 'd try for my escape ; the window 's wide , No one forbids , and yet I stay  --  I stay . Oh , I was niggard , once , unkind  --  I know , Untrusty : loved , unloved you , day by day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew not , And more , and wondered why ;  --  then not at all !  --  Drank up the dew from out your very heart , Like the extortionate sun , to leave you parched ; Till , with as little grace , I flung all back In gust of angry rain ! I have been cruel . But the spell works ; yea , love , the spell , the spell Fed by your fasting , by your subtlety Past all men 's knowledge . . . . There is something rare About you that I long to flee and can not :  --  Some mastery . . . that 's more my will than I. She laughs softly . He listens , looking straight ahead , not at her , motionless but suffering evidently . She watches his face and speaks with greater intensity . Here she crosses nearer and falls on her knees . Ah , look : you shall believe , you shall believe . Will you put by your Music ? Was I that ? Your Music ,  --  very Music ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Thou hast my love . I 'll tell thee so , till thought itself shall tire And fall a-dreaming like a weary child ; . . . Only to dream of you , and in its sleep To murmur You . . . . Ah , look at me , love , lord . . . Whom queens would honor . Read these eyes you praised , That pitied , once ,  --  that sue for pity now . But look ! You shall not turn from me  --  p. 29 THE PLAYER Eyes , Eyes !  --  The darkness hides so much . MISTRESS FYTTON He 'll not believe . . . What can I do ? What more ,  --  what more , you . . . man ? I bruise my heart here , at an iron gate . . . . She regards him gloomily without rising Yet there is one thing more . . . . You 'll take me , now  --  My meaning . You were right . For once I say it . There is a glory of discovery ( ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be known But once ,  --  but once . . . . I wonder men will hide Their motives all so close . If they could guess ,  --  It is so new to feel the open day Look in on all one 's hidings , at the end . She shrugs her shoulders , rises , and stands off , regarding him fixedly So . . . . You were right . The first was all a lie : A lie , and for a purpose . . . Now ,  --  And why , I know not ,  --  but ' t is true , at last , I do believe . . . I love you . Look at me ! He stands by the fireside against the chimney-piece . She crosses to him with passionate appeal , holding out her arms . He turns his eyes and looks at her with a rigid scrutiny . She endures it for a second , then wavers ; makes an effort , unable to look away , to lift her arms towards his neck ; they falter and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition . Then she speaks in a strained voice . p. 30 MISTRESS FYTTON Oh , let me go ! She turns her head with an effort ,  --  gathers her cloak about her ; hesitates with averted eyes , then hastens out as if from some terror . The Player is alone beside the chimney-piece . The street outside is darkening with twilight through the casements and upper door . There is a sound of rough-throated singing that comes by and is softened with distance . It breaks the spell . THE PLAYER So ; it is over . . . now . He looks into the fire Fair , kind , and true .  --  And true .  --  My golden Friend ! Both . . . both , together . . . . He was ill at ease . But that he should betray me with a kiss ! By this preposterous world . . . I am in need . Shall there be no faith left ? Nothing but names ? Then he 's a fool who steers his life by such . Why not the body-comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm ?  --  Trying to drown out with enforcd laughter The query of the winds . . . unanswered winds That scourge the soul with a perpetual doubt . What holds me ?  --  Bah , that were a Cause , indeed ! To prove your soul one truth , by being it ,  --  Against the foul dishonor of the world ! How else prove aught ? . . . I talk into the air . And at my feet , my honor full of wounds . Honor ? Whose honor ? For I knew my sin , And she . . . had none . There 's nothing to avenge . He speaks with more and more passion , too distraught to notice interruptions . Enter Dickon , with a tallow-dip . He regards The Player with half-open mouth from the corner ; then stands by the casement , leaning up against it and yawning now and then . I had no right : that I could call her mine So none should steal her from me , and die for't . There 's nothing to avenge . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this home of Shows , With all the ruffian life , the empty mirth , The gross imposture of humanity , Strutting in virtues it knows not to wear , Knave in a stolen garment  --  all the same  --  Until it grows enamored of a life It was not born to ,  --  falls a-dream , poor cheat , In the midst of its native shams ,  --  the thieves and bears And ballad-mongers all ! . . . Of such am I. Renter Tobias and one or two taverners . Tobias regards The Player , who does not notice any one ,  --  then leads off Dickon by the ear . Exeunt into the tap-room . The Player goes to the casement , pushes it wide open , and looks out at the sky . Is there nought else ? . . . I could make shift to bind My heart up and put on my mail again , To cheat myself and death with one fight more , If I could think there were some worldly use For bitter wisdom . But I 'm no general , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands . . . I 'm no more Than one man lost among a multitude ; And in the end dust swallows them  --  and me , And the good sweat that won our victories . Who sees ? Or seeing , cares ? Who follows on ? Then why should my dishonor trouble me , Or broken faith in him ? What is it suffers ? And why ? Now that the moon is turned to blood . He turns towards the door with involuntary longing , and seems to listen No . . . no , he will not come . Well , I have nought To do but pluck from me my bitter heart , And breathe without it . Renter Dickon with a tankard and a cup . He sets them down on a small table ; this he pushes toward The Player , who turns at the noise . . . . So . Is it for me ? p. 31 DICKON Ay , on the score ! I had good sight o ' the bear . Look , here 's a sprig was stuck on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his sleeve I caught it up ,  --  from Lambeth marsh , belike . Such grow there , and I 've seen thee cherish such . THE PLAYER Give us thy posy . He comes back to the fire and sits in the chair near by . Dickon gets out the iron lantern from the corner . DICKON ( whistling ) Hey ! It wants a light . The Player seems to listen once more , his face turned towards the door . He lifts his hand as if to hush Dickon , lets it fall , and looks back at the fire . Dickon regards him with shy longing and draws nearer . DICKON Thou wilt be always minding of the fire . . . Wilt thou not ? THE PLAYER Ay . DICKON It likes me , too . THE PLAYER So ? DICKON Ay . . . . I would I knew what thou art thinking on When thou dost mind the fire . . . . THE PLAYER Wouldst thou ? p. 32 DICKON Ay . Sound of footsteps outside . A group approaches the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE PLAYER ( rising with passionate eagerness ) Brave lad  --  brave lad ! DICKON ( singing ) Hang out your lanthorns , trim your lights To save your days from knavish nights ! He plunges , with his lantern , through the doorway , stumbling against Wat Burrow , who enters , a sorry figure , the worse for wear . WAT ( sourly ) Be the times soft , that you must try to cleave Way through my ribs as tho ' I was the moon ?  --  And you the man-wi ' - the- lanthorn , or his dog ?  --  You bean ! . . . Exit Dickon . Wat shambles in and sees The Player . What , you , sir , here ? THE PLAYER Still here ; ay , Wat . While Wat crosses to the table and gets himself a chair , The Player looks at him as if with a new consciousness of the surroundings . After a time he sits as before . Reenter Dickon and curls up on the floor , at his feet with bashful devotion . p. 33 WAT O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A wry , damned . . . noisome . . . . Ay , poor Nick , poor Nick ! He 's all to mend  --  Poor Nick ! He 's sorely maimed , More than we 'd baited him with forty dogs . ' Od 's body ! Said I not , sir , he would fight ? Never before had he , in leading-chain , Walked out to take the air and show his coat . . . . ' Went to his noddle like some greenest gull 's That 's new come up to town . . . . The Prentices Squeaking along like Bedlam , he breaks loose And prances me a hey ,  --  I dancing counter ! Then such a cawing ' mongst the women ! Next , The chain did clatter and enrage him more ;  --  You would ' a ' sworn a bear grew on each link , And after each a prentice with a cudgel ,  --  Leaving him scarce an eye ! So , howling all , We run a pretty pace . . . and Nick , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That needed not be born ,  --  and bites into him . And then . . . the Constable . . . And now , no show ! THE PLAYER Poor Wat ! . . . Thou wentest scattering misadventure Like comfits from thy horn of plenty , Wat . WAT Ay , thank your worship . You be best to comfort . He pours a mug of ale No show to-morrow ! Minnow Constable . . . . I 'm a jack-rabbit strung up by my heels For every knave to pinch as he goes by ! Alas , poor Nick , bear Nick . . . oh , think on Nick . p. 34 THE PLAYER With all his fortunes darkened for a day ,  --  And the eye o ' his reason , sweet intelligencer , Under a beggarly patch . . . . I pledge thee , Nick . WAT Oh , you have seen hard times , sir , with us all . Your eyes lack lustre , too , this day . What say you ? No jesting . . . . What ?

Wilt tur n't about ? Leans towards him in cordial confidence Nay , you there , sirrah boy , Leave us together ; as ' t is said in the play , Come , leave us , Boy ! Dickon does not move . He gives a sigh and leans his head against The Player 's knee , his arms around his legs . He sleeps . The Player gazes sternly into the fire , while Wat rambles on , growing drowsy . WAT The cub there snores good counsel . When all 's done , What a bubble is ambition ! . . . When all 's done . . . What 's yet to do ? . . . Why , sleep . . . .

Some one opens the door a second , letting in a stave of a song , then slams the door shut . The Player , who has turned , gloomily , starts to rise . Dickon moves in his sleep , and settles his cheek against The Player 's shoes . The Player looks down . Then he sits again , looking now at the fire , now at the boy , whose hair he touches . THE PLAYER So , Heavy-head . You bid me think my thought Twice over ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast for thy dream . Well , I will watch . . . Like slandered Providence .
