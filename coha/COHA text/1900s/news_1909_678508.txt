G. S. Wegener of Oak Park , who was driving the car , lost control of it , and at the east end of the structure it collided with a steel girder .

S. , iri years old ; left arm broken , teeth knocked out , and chin cut by glass . Saved by Bridgetender . But for the presence of mind of W. D. Haight , night bridgetender , the automobile with its occupants would have gone into the river . From the bridge house , where he operated the electric lever , Haight saw the machine dash through the chain , and from the way the machine wabbled from side to side he knew It was beyond the control of the driver . He stopped the swinging of the bridge and quickly turned it back to position . Had he failed to do this the auto must have gone into the river off the swinging structure , The accident occurred a few minutes before 8 o'clock . A boat passing from the south had whistled for the bridge to open . Haight set the electric gong ringing and the illuminated danger signal flee feet in height spelled out tho word " stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehleles approached the bridge from the west end . An ' auto containing J. H. Reid , 531 West Jackson boulevard , came to a stop about seventy-five feet west of the bridge . Safety Chain Is Broken . While the electric gong was sounding its danger signal Policeman Robert Lind puiled the safety chain across the approach to the structure , blocking the street . His hand still clutched the chain as the Wegener machine rushed upon the bridge , smashing the linked barrier . Wegener and his party were on their way to the Illinois theater . Mr. Russell , who is on his way to Germany , had been the guest of honor at a small dinner given by the Wegeners at their home . Mr. Wegener seems to have had a premonition of danger . When he went home early in the evening he told Mrs. Wegener he was exceedingly tired and asked that he be excused from going to the theater after dinner . Mrs. Wegener insisted that it would appear discourteous to their guests and that he must go . But I feel queer about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhuch rather remain at home . " Finally he consented reluctantly to drive the party to the city , saying he probably would not attend the performance himself , but would return home , after taking tho party to the door of the theater . Mrs. Wegener agreed to this arrangement , thinking , of course , her husband would change his mind once he was on the way . Those who saw the Wegener machine approach the bridge say It was going at high speed . Owing to the wet , slippery condition of the street , which is on an incline , Mr. Wegener was unable to stop the auto . As the machine tore through the safety chain the glass wind shield was smashed and the particles struck the occupants in the face . Mr. Wegener was nearly blinded by blood that trickled from the cuts in his forehead , and this acted as a further handicap in his effort to guide the machine . Women Scream in . Terror . The auto swerveu to the left anti ran into a girder , bending the axle and breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming as the disabled car sped across the bridge , which they observed was swinging . ? Suddenly the wheels stopped grinding and the big structure came to a stop . Bridge-tender Haight had grasped the situation and averted what probably would have been the loss of lives . When the automobile reached the east end of the bridge the span was back in position . Mr. Wegener was making heroic efforts to guide the auto , but the steering apparatus would not respond . He clung to ' the wheel until the car smashed into a girder ten feet from the east end , throwing him out . Like a flash the auto shot across the bridge , knocking down the danger signal , and kept on until it was stopped by the stone curbing at the north side of the street . Brake Fails to Work . Policeman Lind called for two patrol wagons to remove the injured persona to the hospital . On the way Mr. Wegener told the wagonmen that something was wrong with , his brake as he approached the bridge .

Finding himself upon the swinging brldce he attempted to steer the car across , but on account of the broken axle had difficulty in keeping the machine in a straight course .
