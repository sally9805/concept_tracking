ACCURATE accounts of insect architecture , especially if written with vivacity , are and always have been interesting . Not only students of entomology , but the general public have taken rare pleasure in noting the structures reared by the more gifted and better-known representatives of the insect world . Doubtless this interest and this pleasure result largely from the contrast ' between the insignificant size and limited powers of these creatures and their comparatively vast and ingenious creations . The architecture of such social insects as ants , bees , and wasps is wrought by the adult , or imago . The immature individuals are helpless charges upon the community , and upon . them centre its chief concern , labor , and skill . In this respect they resemble human infants ; and the question arises whether to this fact may not be due the development of those striking suggestions of human communal methods which many observers note in their behavior ? Not until they have passed their pupal state and gained maturity do they enter upon an active career and begin to contribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that sense of communal responsibility which comes with the adult stage . There are , however , many families of insects with whom this quality is reversed . The architectural instinct is inborn with the ' arm and is wanting or quiescent in adults . While the former give some rare examples of skill in sheltering and caring for themselves , the latter Eve uninteresting lives ; except in the maternal act of perpetuating their species , which for a brief period excites the female to interesting activity ere the spark of life expires . As the larvae of these insects are solitary . and nature thrusts upon them responsibility for their own nurture and preservation , the possession of an adequate instinct is essential . It is the purpose of this article to give a record . with illustrations , of that instinct as shown in the life of a single example of one of these species ? the Net-making Caddis-worm . There arc few familiars of American and English fresh-water streams who do not know something of the case-making caddis-worm . It has the curious habit of covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute pebbles , or grains of sand and tiny shells , or bits of grass and leaves , and walking about with it on the bottom of running brooks and creeks , until ready to pass from the larval stage . Then it fixes its case to a convenient rock or pebble and shuts itself in to pupate . A score or more of such eases may be found upon a stone as big as one 's fist . To the oddity of its appearance is due its wide popularity ; and certainly it is a curious object as it slowly plods along beneath its mosaic-work armor of tiny stones , ever and anon thrusting its head and the upper part of its body out of its artificial shell . But one rarely hears of the net-weaving caddis . The writer confesses that until recently he knew it only from the books . While collecting a few specimens of the familiar armor-plated species from Brookcernp Run , a stream that passes through an open wood on his country place , he drew from the water many of the peculiar domiciles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in them grew , and led to prolonged studies , some of which he hopes the reader will be glad to share with him . Let us remove from this short stretch of riffle some of the stones that line the bottom . Our tray contains not only the compact pellet-covered tubular cases of the familiar caddis-fly just mentioned , but many others of a quite different structure . They are little piles of peh- Ides held loosely together by silken threads ; yet they adhere to one another and to their stone " host " firmly enough to resist the action of the current and the strain of removal . A number of specimens gathered three months ago show the little cairns unbroken . They are made up of pebbles from the bigness of a pea to that of a peanut . .  - -  Some lie upon the bottom in separate masses ; most are attached to small stones of various sizes . Some of the pebbles I are flat , and cover the others like a roof ; 11 indeed , one or more pieces of goodly size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in every group . All are so arranged as to form a rude sort of den or hut . in fact , they are the larval homes of the net-snaking caddis-worm ? an insect which belongs to the same order as the ease-making caddis ( Trichoptera ) , but to a different family ( llydropsychidie ) . Let us pull apart one of these stone domiciles . Here within the den , and commonly within a small tube , or a cavity , sometimes sparsely , sometimes thickly silk-lined , is the inhabitant . It is an active larva about three-fourths of an inch long , and one finds others of various shorter lengths , but few larger . The old name of " worm " clings to it , for in the Vor . CX11 , ? No. 569. -3 5 early usage of the English tongue the scientific difference between a true worm and an insect larva was not regarded , and the habit persists . The larva is not stout or " chunky , " but is rather elongated and narrow , and not uncomely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some specimens ( collected in April ) arc tawny yellow , the head and two succeeding joints being dark brown . Others and younger specimens ( taken July 27 ) have the middle and terminal joints pale green . The head is flat and snakelike in appearance , the eyes small but prominent . To the end of the body are attached two anal appendages , which terminate in bunches of flaring bristles . dust beneath each appendage is a tiny hook , by which the larva anchors itself to some point within its nest , or to any other object , and can thus swing free beyond its tube and cairn without being carried away by the current . When from any cause it is set adrift , or ventures out of its bounds , these anchor-hooks must be of great use in aiding it to control its course and destination . When it wishes to stop , it has simply to " cast anchor " and hold on with its grapnels . When it wants to move on , it " hoists anchor " and drifts away . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much freedom ; but in its native waters it probably keeps close to its own castle . Net-making caddis-worms are numerous in Brookcamp Run , as they doubtless are in most American streams . Nearly every stone within the riffles , or parts where the brook runs rapidly ? which are the favorite sites for caddis settlements , ? has one or more caddis-cairns upon it . As one looks down into the water he sees that many of the rocks , pebbles , sunken twigs , and other objects are covered with threadlike streamers , one end of which is free and - floats downward with the current . Most of these are hydropsychid threads , and are covered with fine sediment . When taken from the water they collapse into a mass of slime . Other objects , as the trailing leaves of water-grasses , are similarly covered . It is interesting to think bow this habit of the caddis to fasten its threads upon rocks , and the habit of the threads to pick up sediment , may have contributed to affect the course of nature . Surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse of soil , of leaves , of chippage and decaying matter . Germs of water-plants lodge therein ; a rock-garden is formed ; more and bulkier matter is assembled . The bed of the stream , the foot of the bank , and even the channel are affected . Little islets appear , and these slowly increase . Thus the changes go on , those minute and ceaseless changes by which , in the slow movement of ages , the face of nature is varied and renewed . One always must count upon the value of seemingly trifling forces and phenomena in the processes of world-building . As one looks at these rude dens , he naturally asks , how were the pebbles that compose them assembled ? Does the little cairn-builder collect , select , and arrange them ? Are they chance accumulations ? It may be that many of the pieces drift before the current when detached from the bed of the brook by the action of the stream , or by the movements of the multitude of water denizens , such as small fish , frogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become entangled in the sticky threads which caddises fasten to Their lodging-rock . Thus their great variety of form may he partly due to the chance action of the riffle . But the builders certainly have control over the position of the several pieces . This appears from the general design of the structures , which , with all their irregularity , are plainly intended for dwelling-places , and admirably serve their end . The pebbles are so adjusted that the silken tubes , above referred to as occupying the cavities formed within the heaps , have sufficient room , with free points of entrance and exit . However , one likes to bring personal observation to determine such a point . To lie or crouch for hours upon the ? sloping batik of e brook and watch the movements of water-larvw is not just now possible to the writer , although he has spent many pleasant hours in such studies in earlier years . Let us see what can be done by creating for our net-making caddis an artificial environment that may tempt it to show its methods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonce into a miniature brook , and in it were placed several stones with hydropsychid cairns built upon them . The collection was taken to the house and put under observation . Soon the larva , who easily knew that something out of the way had befallen them , crawled from their dens . Then the stones were removed , and over the bottom of the pan , which had been covered with sand , were strewn pebbles like those of which the cairns are composed , and the long watch for building operations began . Let us follow the behavior of one nearly full - grown larva , as typical of all others . It had found refuge , after much wandering , against one side of a waterlogged bit of wood , one end of which rested against a pebble as big as a filbert . The chip was so shaped that it sloped upward from the bottom , forming a projection like the eaves of a roof . A number of sand pellets as large as rice grains , and some as big as a pea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the sand in the angle formed by the chip where it rested against the pebble and made a snug corner that promised to be the nucleus of a den . It bored into the underlying sand until a small cavity was formed , almost large enough to contain its body . Then it turned to the pellets *in front . It moved its jaws ? the under part of its head ? many times over them , smearing them with a viscid secretion from its silk-glands . The pieces were thus glued together in a loose bunch , and ere one could make out exactly the process , were lifted and " butted " up against the pebble buttress . There they dangled , in the fashion of a bead necklace , and formed the beginning of a wall that was planned to enclose the angle made by the upward slant of the chip . When the wall was formed ( by the same method ) a circular space was cleared away near . its union with the pebble , apparently the beginning of a tubular case of which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts were the head and fore paws ; but undulatory movements of the body , kept up with almost rhythmic regularity , seemed to be effective in shaping the interior space and the general line of the wall . While thus engaged the little architect would now and then be lost to sight . But the agitation of the sand and the palpitation of the chip showed that it was at work underneath . At times it would reappear , to add to or strengthen its outer wall . Often it would thrust out the fore part of the body alone , and move it about , weaving threads to tie or cement together the sand grains with which it was building . Meanwhile it seemed to be anchored by its anal hooks to some point within . Having thus been permitted to uncover the secrets of its craft , I was loath to disturb the little mason and destroy its work . But hardening my heart " in the interest of science , " I lifted up the brown water-logged chip which had been ' the background of the larva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaded sand pellets ; the builder wriggled its protest and fled ; and , as expected , there appeared a tubular space which had been cleared away by pushing and packing the sand to either side . This was meant to be the refuge and home den , and in due time would have been hung and carpeted with silken tapestry , and so have become the tubular pupal case of a net-making caddis-fly . Later in the season the mode of building here described was confirmed by observations fortunately made upon a half-grown larva working in natural site within the run itself . Curiosity having been satisfied , the ingenious builder was replaced in favor able conditions , and left to restore its fallen house or erect a new one . The pan was covered with netting in the hope that the larva would pupate , and by and by emerge as an imago or perfect hydrupsychid fly , and thus be captured and identified . This hope was disappointed ; but within the pan was found , beneath a small cairn , a tough silken tubular case which held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of some larva to attain its perfect life . It was the remains of our little builder , or mayhap of one of its fellows . Another characteristic of hydropsychid cairns , and the most striking of all , is now to be told : they are fishing - lodges i This cairnmaking caddis is a fisher-worm , and earns its title of " net-making " or " net-building " by taking its prey in a woven net which is spread against some part of its cairn , or annex thereto , usually near the circular door of the tube . As the cairns are placed on the edge or facing the course of the current , such small-fry lame as it feeds upon drift into and are stopped by or entangled within the net , and thus are captured . While noting the structure and arrangement of several of these nets grouped upon a plate , my thoughts , by that strange power of association which puzzles philosophers , were carried back through half a century to boyhood fishing-days in eastern Ohio . I seemed to see a dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream at the point where the riffle is most marked . A square wooden frame , wedged tightly into an open space in the dam , holds the wide mouth of a funnel-shaped fishing-net which is stretched backward against the current , and is fastened to a stake at the tapering point . Midway , the net narrows to a small circular opening that leads into the meshed pouch at the net 's end which forms the trap . The fish , swimming up against the stream , as is their wont , enter the large square frame , and pass through the small inner circular door , and so are bagged . The farmer lads , who mostly practised this sort of fishing in those days , called the contrivance a " set-net . " How like the method of our Hydzopsychid larva ? ? only , it reverses the position of the net , and traps its prey as they move with the current , not against it . Is it strange that these structures should have suggested the set-net fishing of boyhood experience ? Here is one before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame whose bowed ribs are tiny sprays of grass bent and lashed together by silken ropelets . It is rarely human in its style I ? as though it might have been the work of veritable fairies . The nets are irregular in shape , the average of several measured being one-fourth to three-eighths of an inch long and wide . The minute meshes are as regularly shaped as those of our own hand-knitted fishing-nets , and are of the same form . One net numbered about SOO within the above space . Perhaps one may appreciate the delicacy of touch and the machinelike accuracy shown in weaving this dainty lacelike work if he will mark off a block a quarter of an inch square and draw within it twenty-six vertical lines crossed by thirty parallel ones , keeping the interspaces of equal size . He will thus have well-nigh copied the caddis-worm 's product . It is interesting to note that the same peculiarity marks the meshes of the inner section of an orb-weaving spider 's snare , and doubtless is produced in the same way . When a thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-line adheres to the radius ; and when it is passed to the next radius the pull upon the one just left draws it a little out of line . This gives the meshes the form of rectangles some of whose corners have been slightly trimmed off . The whole effect is that of a highly artificial and man - made implement . Doubtless the form of the meshes in our caddis-worm 's set-net is produced in the same way . It is suggestive of the unity of thought pervading nature that a contrivance of Man the Manufacturer and head of animate creation to capture water food and an implement wrought for the same purpose by a caddis-larva which holds so low a grade in the scale of being should be wrought upon the same general plan and in nearly the same form . And further , that a spider , another animal of low grade , should use to capture its insect food a tool of much the same style ; as man also uses his nets for snaring birds and small land beasts . The hydropsychid larva not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortress , but makes it the scene of its pupation and transformation . It seals itself within its silken case and awaits the great change , while the brook ripples above it . Sometimes its case proves to be its sarcophagus ; but if it survive the ordeal , in due time it awakens , and with the nature-given consciousness that a new life in a new element awaits it , cuts its way through the self-woven swathements , mounts to the surface of the water , and finding rest upon some water-plant or projecting rock , casts its pupal skin . This and the succeeding history have not yet been written , and are facts of reasonable inference . Perhaps it may break from the pupal skin at the surface itself ? a delicate and instantaneous act which one would think needs the deftest doing . For the water runs briskly , and the least untoward movement might lead to the wrecking of the dainty craft , or the wetting of the expanding wings , which would hinder escape from the turbulent element it is forsaking . This instantaneous expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatlet tossing upon the riffle is a scene that may well give play to poet 's fancy and romancer 's imagination . One readily sees bow men and women who have lived close to nature have caught from such scenes the inspiration which has peopled meadow and brookside and grove with fairy folk , and woven about them the spell of fairy lore . Once launched upon the air , the brief imago life begins . The perfect flies are often seen about the margins of streams . They love shady places . They are night-flying insects , and may be assembled by a bright light . Still forming our natural history from analogy of her near kindred , we may see the female hydropsychid ovipositing upon the foliage of some plant growing within or upon the margin of the stream . She may even crawl down a stem into the water to place her eggs . From these in due time come the larva ... whose form and industrial manner this paper aims to tell ; and thence the cycle of 1 ife recommences and runs endlessly on .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
