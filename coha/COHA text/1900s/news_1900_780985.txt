txt The Automobile Club of America held its first dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria last night , the especial object of the occasion being to . inaugurate the movement for the construction of a transccntinental road . The scheme developed in a set of resolutions , however , embraced a broader one  --  one that provided for a good road from St. Augustine , Fla. , to Portland , Me. , and from this , branching out from New York , the crosscountry main road taking in the principal cities en route to San Francisco . There were about a hundred persons present at the dinner , including Gen. Miles , head of the committee having in charge the agitation in favor of the movement ; Francis E. Stanley , Col. Peter Michie of the United States Military Academy , Col. R. L. Hoxie of the Engineer Corps , Col. S. E. Tillman of West Point , and Col. John Jacob Astor . George F. Chamberlin , Acting President of the club , presided , and among others present were ex-Mayor W. L. Strong , Julian Hawthorne , Issas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Col. A. A. Pope , M. Verdry of Georgia , A. R. Shattuck , Chairman of the club 's Committee on Good Roads ; Gen. G. M. Smith , J. M. Seligman , Amzi L. Barber , Whitney Lyon , Homer W. Hedge , Charles R. Flint , and E. E. Schwarzkopf . The purpose of the gathering was summed up in resolutions which , after setting forth the need of a National highway , gave as a feasible route one which would embrace Boston , with connections with Portland , and a southern branch taking In New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , Richmond , Charleston , Savannah , and St. Augustine , with the western main road passing through Syracuse . Rochester . Buffalo . Niagara Falls , Erie , Cleveland , Toledo , Adrian , Cold Water , Elkhart , South Bend . Chicago , Davenport , Des Moines , Council Bluffs , Omaha , Lincoln . Hastings , Denver , Sacramento , and San Francisco . A Pacific Coast branch would take in Los Angeles and Seattle . The resolutions proposed that the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Territories through which the road would pass , onethird , and the cities and , towns one-third . It was further suggested that the surveys should be carried on through three years , dividing the routes into thirds , one year being given to each third . The military importance of such highways were set forth , as well as the roads ' influence as an example of road building to the communities through which they would pass . in view of the rapidity of motion which science is substituting for slower forms of locomotion. two points were urged  --  that of width . and avoidance of curves . In the boulevard which has been built out of Boston , the width is 12. ' feet . It was suggested that at first the width of the proposed road might be half this , but that the right of way should be secured:for the full width . **27;30;TOOLONG , in his opening address , called attention to the fact that one of . the prime objects of the club 's organization was to foster an interest in good roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movements for Na-tional highways begun early in the century . but with the improvements now made in vehicles , it once more behooved all citizens that the Question should be revived . Gen. Miles was then introduced . He complimented the club on being the pioneer in this new movement on a large scale . He said that in the building of the transcontinental railroads which had been aided by the Government there had been something more than a commercial incentive . The co-meeting of the East and the West was of patriotic import . He reviewed the route suggested and advised that the question of military importance should be left out . There were other , ample reasons for good roads which must appeal not only to the automobilist and wheelman , but to the farnters of the country . Ex-Mayor Strong spoke next , first jestinglg scoring the automobile as the terror of the ladies who drove old and gentle horses . then reviewing the history of roads in this country , his own experience taking him back to the corduroy road . He said that this State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to Buffalo , adding that it was primarily of interest to the farmers , to whom it would be a saving of time . labor . and power . Julian I fawthorne. sneaking next , said that this century had been a machine which had been annihilating time , space . and labor . Curiously enough . however . he said . he bad found that he was compelled to work nine times as hard as his forefathers . but in this proposed road he saw emencipation from this condition . He then contrasted some early Indian messengers setting out to carry a message from their tribe to some other tribe in the Far West with the journey the new road presented with the modern vehicle . Col. Pope predicted that while there were only about 1.000 automobiles in New York to-dav , ten years from now there would be 100000 . It had been said that tney were expensive machines . but the business man was not going to consi er the 1. rst cost if in the long run there was to be saving . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succese , and added that New York . the richest State , had about the pnnrest roads . The resolutions were adopted after being seconded by Col. Astor . In his return trip from Ardsley on Sattirdec . S. T. Davis made the run from Ardsley Gate to Central Bridge in thirtysix minutes .
