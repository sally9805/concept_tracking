" Take a pound of fly-a-round , And mix it up with fat : A little purr , a little fur , And von have a pussy cat . " WHAT is there in the , line of pets more fascinating than a fluffy , saucy , little wide - eyed Persian kitten ? What I do n o t know about long-haired cats would fill a volume , but then , what I do know will more than fill the space allotted me , so I will try to answer a few of the questions so often asked concerning these most interesting animals . Your editor asks me to speak , first " with authority " as voicing the views of the best breeders of cats , and then to speak " as a woman " out of the fullness of my own heart and practical experiences . I have , for the past week , been dodging cats , cats , cats of all sizes and colors , on stairways and in darkened rooms . I see them wherever I turn , and am even awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat with huge , orange eyes which sits glaring at me from the foot of my bed . Welsh rabbit ? Oh dear no , only the effect of a constant attendance at the annual cat show at Madison Square Garden . Letme tell you something which may surprise you . No two " leading breeders ' will agree perfectly upon any two points about cats . I really sometimes think that they disagree on general principles . Just as the eating of too much beef will make you " beefy , " or too many nuts wilt make you " nutty , " even so a continued association with cats will surely make you " catty . " Of course the exception proves the rule ? but the " catty " disposition shows up in all its glory at a " show . " Unless you are an excellent loser , and .  | can smilingly listen while rival breeders openly criticise your pets until there is not a good point left , do not exhibit cats or join a cat club . At a recent show in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remarked to an elder breeder , " I do n't think much of that cat of yours ; I would n't take it as a gift . " As it happened , the cat in question was the winner of several blue ribbons and medals ; also it chanced that the owner was a man ? and a gentleman ? so he only answered quietly , " Oh , well , you might be able to sell it for two or three dollars . " Cats may be kept for pleasure or for profit , and sometimes the two are combined . You can be reasonably sure of the pleasure , particularly if you a r e careful t o choose an affectionate pussy , but when it comes to keeping cats for profit , I find a wide difference of opinions as to results . Undoubtedly the big breeders make money . One young woman who breeds for profit claims to clear from $1500 to $2000 a year , but she has to " eat , sleep , dream and talk cats " continuously , and has no vacations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both long and short-haired cats , who breeds " for pleasure and profit , " says she is going out of the business ; that it does not pay for the nervous energy used up . Still another , a professional woman , whose cat pictures illustrate this article , devotes every spare moment , night and day , to her twenty or thirty cats . She is very successful , seldom losing a cat through sickness , and never selling any cat for less than fifty dollars , but she admits it is a great strain to attend to both her profession and her cats . The best breeders are not lowering  | prices . A first-class , pedigreed cat of blue-ribbon stock will bring from $50 to $300 , the average price being $50 and $100 , according to age , sex and markings , or lack of markings . Of course , even higher prices are catalogued , but these are usually prohibitive prices , fixed by those who have no desire to sell , and who simply place a sentimental value upon their cats . Perhaps one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also true that fine cats may often be bought for less than these prices , and for this reason : many people buy cats for pets and with no intention of becoming breeders . When kittens are too valuable to give away , and the owner is not well enough known to demand a dealer 's price , and can not keep so many , particularly in an apartment house , the kittens are advertised for perhaps a third of their value , usually from $20 to $30 . An average price for a really good , long-haired kitten without a pedigree is from $10 to $20 , according to age , color and sex . The majority of customers want , and really expect to get , a $50 kitten for $S or $10 , and I had one customer who wrote that she " wanted a fine Persian kitten , price about $3 " ! People are constantly asking what is the difference between a Persian and an Angora cat . There is n't any . I amused myself at the show by asking this question of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeder said , " My cats are whatever the customer wants . If she asks for a Persian , then I have Persian kittens ; if she wants an Angora , why , they are Angoras . " Another said , " Persians . have better and finer coats ; an Angora 's coat is more woolly . " Another said , " Why , Angora is a country adjoining Persia , and they are all the same thing . " Geographically , she was a little out , but to all practical purposes she was right . Angora is the capital of a Turkish province , and about nine hundred miles from the Persian border . It was at one time under Persian rule . The first long-haired cats brought to this country came from Angora , and for this reason the name is more common than Persian . Then the expression , Persian cat , has , through usage , come to mean a cat a little more carefully bred than an Angora , and to add Maine to the Angora is to invite instant condemnation upon the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angoras have taken first prizes when the pedigree was not known . Breeders in New York claim that the Maine Angoras are bred with common cats . Maine people claim that they are bred with wild raccoons , producing what is commonly known as the coon cat . City breeders declare this impossible , but the Maine people insist that it is true . It is frequently asked if long-haired cats are hard to raise . Breeders are fairly unanimous on this point at least , and agree in saying that long-haired pussies do not have the proverbial nine lives credited to their short-haired relatives . There are several reasons for this , the chief being the fact that they are more  | closely confined ; then , too , the long hair they swallow while grooming themselves often causes their death . The long hair also renders the treatment of skin troubles more difficult . Only very general rules can be given for feeding and doctoring cats . People must experiment and find out what is best for their pets , just as they learn what foods best suit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine as possible , and do not overfeed . If you are ambitious to become a cat breeder , first answer these questions : Have you an enthusiastic love for cats ? Cat raising has its fascinations , but are you willing to sit up nights and put hot applications on a sick cat , or hold cracked ice on its head ? Are you willing to rush off to the veterinary before daylight on a wintry morning with a valuable puss , which must have an immediate operation to save its life ? Are you-willing to stay at home three hundred and sixty-five days in the year to brush , comb and dose cats ? Are you a good loser ? Can you afford , mentally and financially , to lose , one , two , three ? maybe all of your first litter , and even the mother cat ? If you can answer any or all of these questions cheerfully in the affirmative , you will make a successful breeder . Go ahead and try it . There is one crumb of comfort for you , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend with , and you may not have many of them even . If you decide to make a venture , choose one fine female , preferably of solid color . Look for small ears , large , well-set eyes of solid color , tail and legs not too long , short nose and good coat . Be willing to pay a good price for a cat of registered , prize-winning ancestry . Breed her to a known male of her own class color . This will be expensive to start on , but you can then demand a suitable price for the kittens . Stick to one female until you become used to the ups and downs of cat raising . Go slow . Do n't expect to make more than " ear fare " at first . You will then be all the more delighted when you get your first $50 for a kitten . My own experiences as a breeder ? Well , my first venture was a Maine kitten , just for a pet , but he died after only three days ' sickness . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being brought to the city . I have lost as many as ten kittens which I have had brought down for people who could only buy a cheap kitten . I shall bring down no more , as it does not pay . However , at that time I sent for another . He was a beautiful tiger with white underbody , and he developed a wonderful tail . I thought him everything to be desired until I went to my first cat show . Then I found he had a " long nose , " eyes " not solid color , " coat " much too short , " legs " too long , " and , oh , dear , I do n't remember what else . So I sold him , and in spite of all his  | defects he brought $25 from people who wanted a handsome cat , and were not critical as to points . Now , I wanted a fine cat , but like my $3 woman , I wanted a $100 cat for about $20 . Just here I saw advertised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reason for selling , lack of room : " I bought him , and as it was about time for the " kitten show , " decided to put him in , have him judged , and see whether I had secured a bargain or not . The man-of-the-house laughed at me and said the little black thing would stand no chance . Just before the show , Billy Boy , as we called him , suddenly developed a gray ruff , and when his coat was blown open the hair showed creamy white near the skin . I thought he had been dyed , and that it was wearing off . I telephoned the show manager and inquired what class he would go in , and he explained that , instead of being a " solid black , " my kitty was probably a " smoke , " and had better be entered as such . Show day arrived , and I hung anxiously about the cage , in the hope of getting a " V. H. C. " ? very highly commended . The judge pulled Billy Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put him back . My hopes vanished . I wandered disconsolately about , and then went back to the cage . They had him out again ! They pulled and mauled him , held him up to the light , conferred together and again went away , but a few moments later the blue ribbon was pinned on his cage . I flew to the public ' phone to crow joyfully over the man-of-the-house , and when I returned to the cage there was , oh , joy of joys , in addition to the blue ribbon a special silver medal for " best in his class . " A month later came the regular cat show at Madison Square Garden , and I entered him both in novice and open class . He won first prize in the novice and second prize in the open class . That settled it . A breeder I would be , and just here my troubles began . They were varied , and they were a continuous performance ; but , as Kipling says , " that is another story , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat went over the back fence and no amount of advertising brought him back . The cat fever was still upon me in spite of all . I had some of his children , and invested in another female . The rest is a story of profit and loss ? chiefly loss , the man-of-the-house insists ? of sickness and death , and of some sales . The history of the last litter of prize kittens is illustrative of all . There were three beautiful shaded silvers . A male and two females . The male I sold for $50 . The clay after he was delivered , while we were at dinner , the old-fashioned door window blew open and the finest of the two females walked out into the busy street and was seen no more . My vision of another $50 quickly vanished . A month later , the remaining female was taken suddenly ill , and on the second day was dead . Her death was followed by two other deaths of kittens ordered for Christmas gifts . I am no exception ; my fate is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these experiments I am rich in experiences , and about $200 ahead .  |
