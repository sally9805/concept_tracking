part of Santa Claus in time of peace . Never were children more delighted by the gray-bearded king of Christmas than were the helpless and hapless people of the South by the blessings that came to them from the fleecy staple , ? absolutely the only relief in sight . The cotton that had in war escaped Federal and Confederate torches , and that could elude the United States government agents , who were seizing it upon the plea , often groundless , that it had been subscribed to the Confederacy , brought high prices ; and the money thus received , though wholly insufficient , was invaluable . It passed rapidly from hand to hand ; for lessons of economy that are learned under compulsion are seldom taken to heart . Most of those who got money for cotton were in a mood for self-indulgence ; they must put away the memory of the bitter past , and reward themselves for the sacrifices they had made . Women who had woven and worn homespuns , those who had cut up and sent their carpets to soldiers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , substitutes for coffee , and other economic makeshifts were relegated as far as possible to the limbo of the unhappy past . These were the conditions that awaited the Confederate soldier at home . To appreciate his attitude , it must be recalled that as nine tenths of the Union army had enlisted to save the Union , and would have refused to join in a war having for its sole purpose the abolition of slavery , so five sixths of the Confederates were non-slaveholders , and had fought , not for slavery , but to maintain the old Constitution under an independent government . When it became apparent that independence was impossible , the war ended suddenly . There was no guerrilla warfare , prompted by hatred , as in South Africa or in the Philippines . The issue was decided , and the Confederate soldier turned his footsteps homeward , not ashamed of his defeat , but exulting in the thought that lee could callupon mankind to witness he had made a brave fight . His cause was lost and his country desolated , but " hope springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secession were out of the way , he hoped for peace and prosperity in the old Union . One of the most notable features of his home-coming was the strangely intermingled gayety and gloom that everywhere , for weeks and months , pervaded society . The comrade who was never to return had met a soldier 's fate ; for him the tear had fallen as he was buried . Why should not the survivor be happy at meeting again those whom he lead often thought he was nevermore to see ? Mother , sister , wife , or sweetheart greeted him with joy , and as a hero who had deserved , if Ile did not achieve , success ; and never were there gayer routs , dancing parties , and weddings than those which were everywhere witnessed throughout the late Confederacy in the times of which we write . Tables were often thinly spread , but youth and beauty and valor lead shaken hands , the long agony of war was over , and the white dove of peace had come again . The theory of Malthus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being illustrated afresh . Marriages were more frequent than ever . Around camp fires and in lonely prison cells , the soldier , often a bachelor who had never before thought to prove Benedict , had been dreaming of a peaceful home , made happy by the smiles of wife and the prattle of children ; and now , whatever else was in store for him , this dream must be realized . But if the sunshine was strangely bright for some , others were in deepest gloom . Always in sight of the merrymaking that was so common were homes that were wrecked forever , ? husbands , fathers , sons , brothers , and fortunes , gone ; and it was a matter of common remark that never had the mortality among persons who had passed middle age been so great in the late Confed- // orate states as within the decade following 1865 . Everywhere , men and women , brooding over the past , sank brokenhearted into their graves . Its terrible losses and stinging defeat had naturally caused throughout the South much bitterness toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Virginian whose wife told him , one bright morning , that every negro had left the place ; that he must cut the wood , and she must get breakfast . Vt is not recorded that the wife indulged in any expletives ; but the husband , with the first stroke of the axe , damned " old Abe Lincoln for freeing the negroes ; " with the next he went further back , and double-damned George Washington for setting up the United States government ; and with the third , going back to the first cause of all his woes , he doubledouble-damned Christopher Columbus for discovering America ! This feeling of vindictiveness , while it pervaded more or less all classes who had sympathized with the Confederacy , was far more intense among non-combatants than with the returned soldiers . These had learned to respect their foes . Courage had been demonstrated to be common to both armies ; kind offices to the wounded and the hungry had been mutual , and the dividing of rations by Grant 's veterans with Lee 's at Appomattox was just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the non-combatants at the South ( and so it must have been at the North , judging from subsequent events ) had none of the kindly feelings with which soldiers regarded their adversaries . It was quite common in 1865 to hear a soldier say that , for himself , he had had " enough of it ; but my neighbor , who has been hiding all the time at home behind a bombproof position , has just now begun to get mad . What a pity he could n't have gotten his courage up before the fighting was over ! " And now , thirty-five years afterwards , it may be affirmed without reserve that if the soldiers of the two armies had been allowed of themselves , uninfluenced by politicians , to dictate the terms of reconstruction , the history of the United States during the past three decades would have been widely different . An added cause of bitterness among ex-Confederates was the imprisonment of Jefferson Davis , and his treatment in a manner that to the South seemed cruel and without justification . This generation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble health , was doubly safe by reason of the strong casemate at Fortress Monroe and the guards that surrounded him , an officer was required to see him every fifteen minutes , day and night , thus breaking his rest ; and that the prisoner was for a long time forbidden books , except the Bible , and all correspondence , even with his wife . Irons were at one time placed on his legs ; but though these were soon removed , the condition of the captive , as reported by the post surgeon , caused in May , 1866 , a vigorous protest not only in the South , but in prominent Northern journals . Those were days of intense excitement , even in the North . Naturally , the ex-Confederates looked upon their President as suffering for them , and were much embittered by this incident . But the North was not always held responsible as the fons of origo of Southern misfortunes in those days , which were so full of gloom to all who took time to consider the conditions that surrounded them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the calamitous situation . Many Whigs retained their old-time prejudices against Democrats , and in every Southern state there had been Unionists . These were disposed to claim the benefit of their superior judgment , and many indeed were now " Union men " whose Union sentiments prior to secession their friends were by no means able to recall . The disposition to put down the secessionists had received a powerful impulse 148 The Conditions of the Reconstruction Problem . from an unfortunate and unwise law passed by the Confederate Congress , exempting from service in the army , under certain conditions , the owners of twenty negroes , on the ground that they were needed at home to raise food- stuffs . Even in the army it had been bruited about , " This is the rich man 's war , and the poor man 's fight . " In most of the states , the feeling of comradeship among Confederate soldiers would have rendered improbable any very equal division at the outset between secessionists and anti-secessionists ; but certain it is that here were lines of cleavage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile factions , had not the sempiternal negro question now appeared again , and this time in a form that was eventually to bring about a greater solidarity , even , than had come from the invasion of Northern armies , The shape it assumed was the suffrage involved in the reconstruction problem . If the condition of the Southern white in 1865-66 was such as to command , from the present standpoint , the sympathy of the generous-minded , still more strikingly pitiful and helpless was the condition of the freedman . Not in all the imaginings of the Arabian Nights is there any concept so startling as the sudden manumission of four millions of slaves , left unshackled to shift for themselves , ? without property , without resources excepting their labor , without mental training , and with no traditions save only such as connected them with bondage and barbarism . What was to become of tissue people ? Would their energies be properly directed , and would they , as other peoples had done , gradually build up with their strong arms a future for themselves ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on labor into fields where , by reason of their limitations , success was impossible ? This was not for the freedman to decide . It was a problem for the white man , the Caucasian , who makes and unmakes the laws and governments of the world ; who fashions civilizations , sometimes in comely shape , sometimes awry , but always in moulds of his own making . And it was still further a question as to what white man was to under . take the solution of this problem . Was it to be the white tnan whose lot was cast in the same land with the freedman , or was it to be the man who sympa. thized with him from afar . but . knew him not ? Rehabilitation of the states , therefore , involving as it did the future relations of both whites and blacks to the states and the federal government , marked a crisis in our history second in import only to that created by the attempt to secede . The task was delicate , and called for deliberation and wise statesmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hour were allowed to become only the handmaids of acrimony and political ardor , and if results have proven the policy adopted to have been fraught with evil , the commentator fails of his duty who does not set up a beacon light to warn his countrymen of the dangers that come to the ship of state free ; venturing , when full-freighted , into the stormy waters of partisanship ; for assuredly the perils of the future are not to be avoided by concealing or glossing over either the errors of the past or the reasoning upon which they proceeded . Mr. Lincoln , as early as December 8 , 1863 , had formulated a plan of reconstruction by the Executive , ? voters to be those who were qualified " by the election laws of the state , existing immediately before the so-called act of secession , and excluding all others ; " but Congress had afterwards passed a joint resolution asserting its own power over reconstruction . Mr. Lincoln , it is true , killed this resolution by a pocket veto ; but the great head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there stood the action of Congress , and the declare- // tion of Mr. Sumner , one of its foremost leaders , on the 25th of February , 1865 , that " the cause of human rights and of the Union needed the ballots as well as the muskets of colored men . " It was feared in the South that President Johnson , especially after he had said that traitors must be deprived of social position , and " treason made odious , " would share Mr. Sumner 's views . Mr. Sumner has claimed that for a time he did ; but if so , the President soon changed his mind , for on the 9th of May , 1865 , lie made an order recognizing Mr. Lincoln 's plan in Virginia , and on May 29 he issued his proclamation for the reconstruction of North Carolina , excluding negroes , and recognizing as voters only those qualified by the state law at the date of the attempt to secede . The continued presence of the military and the aggravating conduct of many of the officials of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this proclamation ; yet it was an immeasurable relief to feel that the seceded states were to be admitted without putting the ballot into the hands of the ex-slave . The repugnance of Southern white men to negro suffrage was extreme . Edmund Burke , in one of his speeches in the British Parliament , pointing out the difficulties in the way of the subjugation of the American colonies , explained that in all the slaveholding communities there was an aristocracy of color ; every white man felt himself to belong to a superior race , and this pride of race to an extent ennobled and elevated him . It was a true picture , and such a people were naturally prejudiced against meeting their inferior , the negro , as an equal at the ballot box . But their aversion had a better foundation than prejudice. ? The negro had nowhere shown himself capable of self-government . White manhood suffrage had obtained for years in all the seceded states , and never had the suffrage been purer or given better results . The population was largely of English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illiteracy was more prevalent than in the Northern states ; but joint discussions before the people by candidates for office were almost universal , while the code of honor regulating duels , then sanctioned by public opinion , exacted from every speaker rigid responsibility for his statements in debate ; and so it came about that even among those who were uneducated there were unusually correct ideas of the high duties discharged by freemen in casting their ballots . Their suffrages were not for sale , and in self-gorernment the morality and patriotism of voters count for almost everything ; without these , book-learning is a snare . It is easy enough to write that the success of universal manhood suffrage for whites , although in evidence both North and South , was not a sufficient ar-gument for giving the ballot to every male over twenty-one among four mil-lions of ex-slaves , and to add that a question like this ought to have been de-cided on its merits , amid without regard to its effects on political Panies . This is a truth that was recognized by Mr. Lincoln and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision rested upon him . Individual responsibility so-bers and lifts men up to meet great cri-ses . Divided authority , however , weak-ens the sense of responsibility , and leaves passion full play , especially in a nu-merous body like Congress ; and never was there so much bitterness between parties , or so much at stake upon the action of Congress . The Confederacy , after a bloody war against the Union , was prostrate . Should ex-Confederates come back with increased membership in Congress , representing all the negroes as freedmen , instead of , as previously , three fifths of the negroes as slaves ? Should the party claiming to be the party of the Union incur the danger 150 The Conditions of the Reconstruction Problem . of handing over the government to an alliance of ex-Confederates with the Democrats , who in their platform of 1864 had denounced the war for the Union as a failure ? Had not the North freed the slave ? Was not this freedman the ward of the nation ? Ought not the government to be keenly watchful of his interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him power to protect himself ? The ballot was clearly the remedy , provided theAreedman was competent to wield it . This was the question , ? competency , ? and it called for decision on its own merits ; but passion , prejudice , love of power , philanthropy , and a sense of justice to the negro , all combined to obscure the issue , and to make it , as it soon became in Congress , a party question . A few Republicans were to oppose their party in the House and Senate , and be soon driven out of public life . The party that elected Mr. Johnson was to oppose him , and the party that opposed him in the election was to sustain him unanimously in Congress . This President , who had come to his office on account of his services to the Union , was to become the best friend , the adviser , and the leader of the ex-Confederates in a political contest ; and occupying this peculiar attitude , he had uncommon need of tact , in which , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Southern whites looked upon negro suffrage as a crime against Republican government , ? a crime against which the people of the North , and if not they , then the President and the Supreme Court , would protect them . They had abandoned in good faith both slavery and secession , all that they thought were in issue , and now they were uncompromising in demanding what they denominated their " rights " as conceded by Lincoln and by Johnson . They never once thought of a compromise , but staked all upon the result of the fight between the President and Congress . From March 4 till December 4 , 1865 , Congress was not in session , and due . ing all this time Mr. Johnson was busy carrying out in the Southern states Mr. Lincoln 's plan of reconstruction . The result was that when Congress convened , in December , Representatives and Senators from most of the late Confederate states were applying for admission . The Thirteenth Amendment , abolishing slavery , had been ratified by these states , and new constitutions had been adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress would recognize reconstruction after the Lincoln-Johnson plan . The new constitutions set up under Johnson all confined suffrage to white men . It is strange that , inasmuch as the country was yet to pass upon the ques. tion , Mr. Johnson , in his message in Decembe ? , 1865 , and elsewhere in his many public utterances , should not have appealed earnestly for support to the memory of his great predecessor , the authcr of the plan he was pursuing . On the contrary , prompted probably by egotism , he always spoke of the policy as his own . It has been said that Mr. Lincoln 's Southern birth and association with Southern men naturally inclined him against negro suffrage . Johnson was not only born in the South , but had always lived there . The views of the two Presidents as to who ought to exercise the power to define suffrage , and as to the manner in which that power should be exerted by the Southern states , were almost identical . Mr. Lincoln wrote to Governor Hahn , when the convention he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assemble : " I barely suggest for your private consideration whether some of the colored people may not be let in , as , for instance , the very intelligent , and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks . " So Mr. Johnson , August 15 , 1865 , to Governor Sharkey , of Mississippi : " If you could extend // the elective franchise to all persons of color who can read and write , and who have a certain amount of property , etc. , you would completely disarm the adversary , and set an example that other states would follow . " It would have been wise for Mississippi and the other Southern states to follow the advice given Governor Sharkey . The few negroes qualified under these restrictions could have done no harm , and such a course might have had weight with voters in the North , to whom the general policy Congress was pursuing toward the South was to be submitted before the venture upon negro suffrage was made . The majority sentiment in Congress did not , at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progress in that direction was not rapid . In the spring of 1865 , the New York Tribune , while contending that the negro was entitled to the ballot , was urging the unwisdom of taking issue with a Republican President who had at hand all the patronage of the government . When , however , the 4th of July , the national anniversary , had come , orations were made by such leaders as Boutwell in Massachusetts , Garfield in Ohio , and Julian in Indiana , advocating broadly negro suffrage for the late Confederate states , ? and this before a single state convention had assembled under Johnson 's reconstruction proclamations . In forwarding the claim of the negro for the ballot no factor was more powerful than the Freedmen 's Bureau . The Bureau had been established by the act of March 3 , 1865 , to take care of the freedmen who were flocking into the Union lines ; and as those lines advanced the Bureau had been extended all over the South . Racked by the , bayonet , and exercising absolute power to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the officers of the Bureau had exceptional op portunities for good or for evil . Many performed their duties faithfully ; but many others were in search even then of the offices that were afterwards to come by the votes of their wards . To get these offices , the North must be made to believe that the ballot was a necessity for the negro ; and it was easy , especially for the subordinate officials who dealt directly with the freedman , to encourage discontent among their wards and strife between the races . The Southern white man was frequently impulsive , and , when vexed by negro " insolence " and by the stories that came to him of the injustice at Bureau headquarters , where often , in negro language , " the bottom rail was on top , " he took justice into his own hands , and sometimes it was injustice . Race prejudice was also here and there painfully apparent in superior courts and in juries .. Thus there was enough truth in some of the many stories of outrages that were circulated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . So it came about that the Freedmen 's Bureau , the real purpose of which was to make contracts for the freedmen , settle questions between them and their employers , and take care of its wards generally , was , through many dishonest and partisan officials who were attached to it proving to be a prime factor in the manufacture of political opinion during the whole period covered by this article . The reports of Bureau chiefs , where they spoke of quiet , passed unnoticed ; it was the reports of outrages that attracted attention . The dispensing of supplies without price to able-bodied persons must always tend to produce idleness : this tendency of its own work it was the especial duty of the Freedmen 's Bureau to correct . The greatest crisis that had ever occurred in the lives of four million people had arrived . Slavery had lifted the Southern negro to a plane of civilization never before attained by any large body of his race , ? had taught him to he law-abiding without permission . // of war . " Recollections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictions long ago made by Mr. Calhoun , and frequently by others during and preceding the Civil War , had inspired in the South a very general fear that , in favoring localities , the suddenly emancipated slaves might attempt to repeat the massacres of San Domingo . In two of the states thus forbidding or limiting the use of firearms the negro was in the majority ; in the other two there were " negro belts , " where the few whites would be helpless in case of an insurrection . The most indefensible provision anywhere found by the writer is a statute of Mississippi , enacting that , while freedmen might hold personal property , they should not be allowed to lease lands or tenements " except in towns or cities , where the corporate authorities shall control the same . " How much of this enactment was the result of pure prejudice , and how much of it came from the bogy of negro supremacy in a state in parts of which the negro was in numbers as overwhelming as he had been in San Domingo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be learned about the freedman by both Southerner and Northerner . The one was to find out how peaceful , the other how incapable as a voter , the freedman was . There was little chance for moderation in public sentiment or for deliberate action by Congress , when Southern people , in constant dread , were watching and guarding against insurrection , which they even feared might be prompted by agents of the Freedmen 's Bureau ; and when , at the same time , Northern people , with their hearts full of sympathy for the helpless and hapless freedmen , were daily watching the reports of that Bureau for stories of cruelty by the former masters . The friction , reasonably to be expected , between the master race on the one-hand , almost all of them with the domineering blood of the Anglo-Saxon in their veins , few of them saints and all the rest sinners , and the negro on the other , now dazed by the blinding light of sudden freedom , would nat ? ? rally be enough , even without official intermeddling , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward which either prejudice or philanthropy might incline him . Nevertheless , there were prominent Republicans who took no stock in the continued scrutiny by the North of the relations between whites and blacks in the South . Among these was the head of Lincoln 's and of Johnson 's Cabinet , Mr. Seward , who said in an interview in April , 1866 : " The North has nothing to do with the negroes . . . . They are not of our race . They will find their place . They must take their level . The laws of political economy will determine their position , and the relations of the two races . Congress can not contravene those . " But Mr. Seward and his views were then in a woeful minority . Only one of the late Confederate states had legislated in relation to the negro when Congress met , December 4 , 1865 , and yet the members of that body had already made up their minds against Mr. Johnson 's plan of reconstruction . The first step of this Congress was the passage , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concurrent Resolution " to inquire by a Committee of Fifteen into the condition of the late Confederate states ; the next was the passage in the House , December 14 , of a resolution referring to that Committee of Fifteen every question relating to conditions in the late Confederate states , and to admit no member from these states unfit the committee had reported ; then came the defeat of the Voorhees resolution , indorsing the presidential plan . The Republicans , in the votes on all these measures , presented practically a solid front , while the Democrats were unanimous in opposition . The action of the Senate 154 The Conditions of the Reconstruction Problem . was on like lines . In the language of Mr. Stevens , Congress was already determined " to take no account of the aggregation of whitewashed rebels who , without any legal authority , have assembled in the capitals of the late rebel states and simulated legislative bodies . " Reconstruction was already a party question . Mr. Stevens , the leader of the radicals , said , during these proceedings , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " According to my judgment , they the insurrectionary states ought never to be recognized as capable of acting in the Union , or of being recognized as valid states , until the Constitution shall have been so amended as to make it what its makers intended , and so as to secure perpetual ascendency to the party of ' the Union . " A sample of the arguments for the Concurrent Resolution is the following , by a prominent member , Mr. Shellabar-ger , in answer to Mr. Raymond : ( " They framed iniquity and universal murder into law . . . . Their pirates burned your unarmed commerce upon every sea . They carved the bones of your dead heroes into ornaments , and drank from goblets made out of their skulls . They poisoned your fountains , put mines under your soldiers ' prisons , organized bands whose leaders were concealed in your tomes ; and commissions ordered the torch and yellow fever to be carried to your citizens and to your women and children . They planned one universal bonfire of the North from Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of the question . A few conservative Republicans , who , like Mr. Raymond , of New York , stood out for Mr. Johnson 's policy , were trampled under the feet of the majority . Others , though halting now and then , kept in line with the party which was steadily marching forward to the view that was already held by the radicals , and afterward expressed by Mr. Sumner in debate upon the bill for suffrage in the District of Columbia : " Nothing is clearer than the absolute necessity for suffrage for all colored persons in the disorganized states . It will not be enough if you give it to those who read and write ; you will not in this way acquire the voting force which you need there for the iTrotection of Unionists , whether black or white . You will not secure the new allies who are essential to the national cause . " To reach this goal there were many obstacles to be overcome , and time was necessary . The plan of the radicals included legislation relating to freedmen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , and Southerners did not foresee how a square decision from that tribunal could be avoided ; it included constitutional amendments ; three fourths of the states only could amend the Constitution , and several of the Northern states were hostile to negro suffrage ; while , if the policy entered upon should fail , the failure would be disastrous . The Democrats in Congress had allied themselves with the cause of the Southern whites , and , as Mr. Stevens expressed it on the floor of the House , if negroes were not to have the ballot , the representatives from the Southern states , with the Democrats " that would be elected in the best of times at the Noxth , " would control the country . The radicals were looking hopefully to the investigation of the Committee of Fifteen , under the Concurrent Resolution , of which Mr. Seward said ( Bancroft 's Seward , p. 454 ) it " was not a plan for reconstruction , but a plan for indefinite delay . " The committee was composed of lilielve Republicans and three Democrats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vol. ii . p. 127 ) : " It was foreseen that in an especial degree the fortunes of the Republican party would be in the keeping of the fifteen men who might be chosen . " // This committee was appointed in December , 1865 , continued its investigations until June , 1866 , when , dividing on strictly party lines , the majority made its report June 18 , and the minority June 22 . The majority report discussed at length theories of reconstruction , and bitterly condemned the plan of the President . As to conditions in the South , it found that the Freedmen 's Bureau was " almost universally hated , " and that " the feeling in many portions towards the emancipated slaves , especially among the uneducated and ignorant , is one of vindictive and malicious hatred . This deep-seated prejudice against color is assiduously cultivated by the public journals , and leads to acts of cruelty , oppression , and murder , which the local authorities are at no pains to prevent or punish . " The committee went on to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation " without first providing such constitutional or other guaranties as will tend to secure the civil rights of all the citizens of the Republic , " the disfranchisement of a portion , etc . As to the nature of the guaranties to be required there was in this report nothing definite . The three minority members , in their report , vigorously combated the views of the majority . Mr. Stevens had reported , January 31 , 1866 , and the House had passed , a proposition for a constitutional amendment providing that , whenever suffrage seas denied on account of race or color , the persons no denied suffrage should be excluded from the basis of representation . But there was no promise that such amendment , if adopted , should be taken as a settlement . The amendment , however , was never to be submitted to the states , as Mr. Sumner and other radicals joined with the Democrats and conservative Republicans , and defeated it in the Senate . Both Democrats and Republicans were now treating all measures affecting the South as political , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of passing on constitutional amendments , while their governments were held as " revolutionary , null , and void " for all other purposes . Nothing could inure conclusively illustrate the intense partisanship of the hour . The fairest chance the Southern state governments , as set up by Johnson , had to stein the tide that was setting in against them ? but it is doubtful whether that could have succeeded ? was by unanimously ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment . Had this amendment been accepted by both sides as a settlement , it would have reduced the representation of the late slave states and left them in control of suffrage . But this article disfranchised nearly all Southerners of prominence and experience , and Southern people could not bring themselves to vote for the degradation of those whom they had honored and trusted . Johnson , too , now their friend and political leader , advised against it ; so did Northern Democrats . It was a political fight to a finish between the prostrate ex-Confederates , without representation in Congress and without an acknowledged vote anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , and an unknown number of sympathizers in the North , on the one side , and the Republicans party in unmistakable control of Congress on the other . The bill for the extension of the Freedmen 's Bureau , which failed to pass over Johnson 's veto , and the civil rights bill , which did pass over a veto , ? these , and the angry discussions over them in the spring of 1866 , only intensified , North and South , the bitterness of the struggle in progress . If Mr. Lincoln had lived , and had carried on , as the speech in answer to a serenade just before Isis death indicates 156 The Conditions of the Reconstruction Problem . he would have done , the policy embodied in the North Carolina proclamation , approved by him shortly before his death , ' and used by his successor as the basis of his policy , he would have had before him the same open field and the same nine months preceding the meeting of Congress that were before Johnson ; and though it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied with ex-Confederates , one can not avoid the conclusion that , tactful and at the same time great-hearted as he was , he would have been continually pointing out to Southerners the breakers that they did not , and he did , see ahead . His influence , too , with his own party , after the successful termination of the war , would have given him a measure of control over his party that Johnson did not possess . Mr. Johnson was much abused for having " deserted " the party that had honored him , and now that the fight was on , instead of the coolness and skill of a gladiator , he manifested only the qualities of an angry bull rushing at a red rag . In a public speech , alluding to some charge that he had played Judas , lie said : " If I have played the Judas , who has been my Christ that I have played the Judas with ? Was it Thad Stevens ' ? Was it Wendell Phillips ? Was it Charles Sumner ? " Numerous conventions , state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held , all devoted to the manufacture of public opinion for and against the Johnson plan of reconstruction . No two eras in our history differ more widely than the epoch- making years 1787 and 1866 . In the one , statesmen were sitting with closed doors to formu- 1 " The very same instrument for restoring the national authority over North Carolina , and placing her where she stood before her attempted secession , which bad been approved by Mr. Lincoln , was by Mr. Stanton presented at the first Cabinet meeting which was held late , uninfluenced by outside discussion , the Constitution which is the most perfect work of man . In the other , with doors wide open , members of both political parties uttering fiery declarations which were echoed and reechoed all over the land , the two houses of Congress as political bodies , with passion at white heat , shaped the policy according to which the chief corner stone of the old Constitution ? the suffrage on which it rested ? was to be remodeled ; and the trend of all the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranties demanded by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Sumner . That policy , when the session had closed , was submitted to the Northern voters in the congressional elections of 1866 . It was overwhelmingly approved ; and at the last session of that Congress the act of March 2 , 1867 , was passed , reconstructing the states on the basis of universal negro suffrage , to which the Fifteenth Amendment , intended to secure the rights thus granted , was but a corollary , ? both , as we have seen , begotten of partisanship out of philanthropy ; and this was not the first , nor has it been the last , of these liaisons . It is not making any new or startling assertion to say that negro suffrage was a failure . It did nob give Republican control at the South , except for a brief period , and it did not benefit , but injured , the freedman ; it made unavoidable in the South the color line , and impossible there two capable political parties , of which , all men , North and $outh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro had , when suddenly emancipated , one recourse : he was by training a good laborer .
