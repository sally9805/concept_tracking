txt A comprehensive report on the meat Industry of the United States , showing the existence of a trust and Its effect on prices , has been made to the British government , as a result of an exhaustive investigation directed by the British embassy in Washington . A. copy of the report has been furnished to the state department by Whitelaw Reid , the American ambassador in London . The report wasvaluable to the departmental committee of the English board of trade in training its conclusions that a beef , trust exists in the United States , with headquarters in Chicago , which is seeking to control the business of the world in this produot . The state department will refer the report to the department of justice , which will give it consideration In connection with the proposal to prosecute the National Packing company , of Chicago for violation of the Sherman antitrust law . The representative of the British embassy who conducted the inquiry was George Young , second secretary In charge of commercial affairs , who enjoys the distinction of being a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Young has this to say of the existence of a combination on the part of the packers : " Besides a joint interest in the stockyards , a striking indication of the possibility of a combination is found in the situation of the National Packing company . The report of the bureau of corporations , made In lin , mentioned the genesis of the National Packing company as being connected with the failure to form a general combination . There is no doubt that an amalgamation of the leading packing firms was contemplated in 1902 , but failed owing partly to the financial stringency at that time , and partly to the difficulties as regards the price at which the component firms valued their business . " A capitalization of 500.000,000 was mentioned , and the flotation was to have been financed by Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . Sch  --  arzschild &; Sulzberger were said to have contributed to the collapse of the enterprise by demanding too high a price . The National Packing company was the shift to which recourse was had in consequence of this failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practically all held by the directors and persons interested in the Armour , Swift , and Morris companies . Tells of National Company . " It tite object of the National Packing company was merely to effect operative economies it would have been better done by merging the subsidiary companies with the concerns controlling them than by forming a new controlling firm , such as this company is . But it its real object was to facilitate combinations it would effect this in three different ways : by facilitating the acquirement of outside concerns , which it has undoubtedly done ; by facilitating the elimination of competition between the leading firms , who are jointly interested in it , which It obviously must do , as competition by one of the jointly interested parties against another would prejudice its own interest in the joint concern ; and by affording a convenient opportunity for the principals to meet and arrange prices or other questions regarding the combination . " There Is reason to believe that the principal independent firm , Schwarzschild &; Sulzberger , continues to act independently In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust or that it wilt be shortly absorbed by It . Such a rumor was recently denied on the ground that the majority of the stockholders of the company had formed a voting trust to prevent rival interests from acquiring control of It , and that this trust lies held a large enough percentage of stock to prevent any change in the control through the buying up of scattered holdings . " Result of Long Inquiry . Mr. Young 's report constitutes the result of an exhaustive Inquiry of conditions which have developed since the bureau of , corporaBons published the report of its inquiry in 1006 . In examining the grounds for laying the responsibility of the present high prices on the organization of the meat Industry In the United States , he considered first what influence was exercised by the beet trust on the production or consumption of meat in the United States . He also looked into the question as to whether high prices could be attributable to a natural reduction of the supply of raw material . Incidentally , he says cattle can no longer be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding industry have become a manufacture of which the price Is dependent on the cost of fodder , more especially maize ; on the value of grazing land , on the cheapness of money , and on various other factors . Such supplementary evidence as Mr. Young collected subseouent to 1005 tends , he says , to confirm the view that there has been permanent , progressive appreciation of the meat prices due to economic causes connected with the increased population and decrease of the grazing capacity of land . Further evidence collected in connection with the abnormal appreciation of last fall tends to show this may be attributed to the scarcity of certain crops and to stringency at capital . Why Trade Is Concentrated . As to the " effect on meat prices of the trust , " to quote one of Mr. Young 's subheads , the report states that the concentration of the industry in certain towns of the middle west , notably Chicago , St. Louis , Kansas City , Omaha , and St. Joseph , can be sufficiently explained by the obvious economic advantages , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of by-products , and in the loss from the absence of a permanent market . The report of the bureau of corporations showed the annual return of the packing companies on the capital invested was not excessive . This report was received with much incredulity . but Mr. YOung observes be identified at the second market , and either boycotted or bid down . It is said that the object of this is to keep the cattle in the smaller markets , where there Is less competition than at Chicago . There seems to be evidence that the packers combine to work this system known as " spotting . " In reference to the apportionment of business . Mr .. Young suggests that the evidence collected as to an agreement of this character appears to render it probable . though hot positively certain , for the statistics of the ' bureau of animal industry showing the numbers slaughtered annually by the packers since 1898 , as well as the statistics of Armour &; Co .. in the possession of the bureau of corporations , and showing the numbers pur chased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement for a continuous division of business on a fixed basis . Business Is Distributed Equally . Especially marked is the uniformity in the distribution of business during 1901,1902 , and 1903 , as between Armour and Swift . Swift 's Proportion varied only from 60.9 per cent to 57.5 per cent during this period . Disturbances due to the great strike of 1904 seems to have upset this agreement . Morris obtained . an increase in 1003 , but the proportion in 1904 is the same as that for 1000- ' 02 . " It Is impossible . " Mr. Young observes , " that such uniformity of proportion of business done by each firm annually could an-pear year after year in all the branches  --  cattle , hogs , and sheep  --  without a systematic agreement . It seems evident there is an apportionment arrangement , not on a monthly basis , but on a system by which departures : rein the proper proportion in one season are corrected In the next . " The uniformity is more striking in view of the fact that Swift has seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Morris &; Co. , 3 ; and Cudahy , 3 . As the receipts of stock at these centers have changed in relation to each other , the normal result would have been to alter the whole business done by each company in relation to the localities in which its establishments were situated . That It has not done so , Is indicative of a readjustment by an agreement . Changes Made to Counterbalance . " Further , an examination of the changes in the business done at certain centers Indicates that they are intended to counterbalance the changes at other centers , due either to the erection of new plants or to changes in the trade conditions . Other changes seem to have been intended merely to conceal the system of apportionment and to have no other meaning . " No conclusion can be come to as to the Inclusion in such an arrangement of Schwarzschild &; Sulzberger . Their proportion of business has changed considerably during the period under observation and though this might he based on an understanding with the other firms there seems nc reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence as to the elimination of competition between the firms of the trust in the local markets . The method followed , known as " pricing out , " consists , he says , in the obligation Imposed on members of the combine torequtre prohibitive prices ' for their product from possible purchasers In the markets allotted to another member . There is , however , also F some evidence that this secret agreement still s more secretly violated by agents of the contracting parties . " Big Six " Control Stockyards. such evidence of combination as Mr. Young refers to would be much strengthened , he says , if a community of commercial Interest could be proved , such as would be sufficient to counteract the natural incentive to competition . D. is notorious that most of the stockyard companies at the leading western centers are largely or wholly controlled by the packers . Though no precise information is forthcoming as to the distribution of their stock , Mr. Young thinks it probable that the stockyards at South Omaha are controlled chiefly by Armour , those at Fort Worth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cudahy , those at St. Paul by Swift . At Kansas City the stockyards company 's officers assert that they are Independent , but Armour is interested in'the stock . The establishments of the Fowler Packing company . under control of the National Packing company , are said to be another attempt by Armour to control the Kansas City yard . Some time ago , by a secret contract , the packers got control of the Chicago Union stockyards under the threat of establishing their own in Indiana . As to the effect of the trust on the retail supply of meat , the report describes the growth of the business of the packing houses in this respect . It says that complaints of this competition are bitter , but nearly always on the ground that the packers undergell the local butcher . Lower prices and poorer quality are said to he the result of their intrylon into the retail business . Retail Prices Not Fixed . As to the effect of the trust on the retail prices , Mr. Young says it is practically imps-stifle for this to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . The reaction of the retail prices to the movement of wholesale prices is so slow and weak that to influence the former through the latter to any great extent seems to be out of the question . With regard to the appreciation of retail prices . In proportion twit/ants% It is Mr. Young 's view that much of the complaint in this connection is due to an excessive demand for particular cuts . His conclusions are in regard to retail market : That there is and can be no control of price either generally by packers or locally by the retailers . The former have their combinations and the latter also have associations ? but they are used for improving their interests otherwise than by attempting to affect the market prices . That rise in the price of meat for domestic use is to some extent due to exceptional appreciation of special cuts , such as steaks , due to 4 conventional demand ' out of proportion to the value of the meat . This will in time cure itself . That the intrusion of the packers into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to do so , if , at the same time , perhaps somewhat lowering quality . It is further Mr. Young 's opinion that the surplus animal products of the United States will not long continue to hold the position they now occupy in the markets of Great Britain , MANY FOR LATER INAUGURATION Forty-six Governors of States and Territories Favor the Proposed Change .
