SIR : Few poems have been more often reprinted than " The Burial of Sir John Moore , " but no two of the copies , even in the best anthologies , agree exactly in their reading . Concerning one of these variations , " sullenly , " or " suddenly , " in the seventh stanza , there has often been lively discussion among editors and critics ; some asserting that " suddenly " is the only authoritative reading , others saying that Wolfe wrote " sullenly " at first , but afterward " altered it at the suggestion of a literary friend . " This latter statement , based upon a note from " an early friend of the author " ( printed in the Londdn Morning Chronicle , October 29 , 1824 ) , is incorrect The " early friend , " commenting on the line , " That the foe was suddenly firing , " says that it " was originally written " thus : " Of the enemy sullenly firing . " But the Rev. John A. Russell , in the " Remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the line was at first written , " That the foe was sullenly firing " ? the reading in the text as he prints it . He adds : It was subsequently altered as he the writer in the Horning Chronicle gives it , at the suggestion of a literary friend ; but it seems proper to print it as it actually stands in the author 's own manuscript , from which I take it . There is no difference in sense , but perhaps some may think the rhythm better as it was originally written . This obviously refers , not to " sullenly " ( which is the same in both readings , and which would make a serious difference in the sense ) , but to the words that precede " sullenly . " I can not , however , agree with Archdeacon ' Russell , that the " rhythm " of " That the foe was " is possibly better than that of " Of the enemy , " which Wolfe adopted when it was suggested That " sullenly " was the original and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received more than ten years ago enclosing a careful copy of a letter from Wolfe , written immediately after he completed s ' ? e poem . I regret that I have lost or mislaid the letter accompanying this interesting manuscript , and can not recall the name of the sender . The original letter of Wolfe was somewhat worn and torn , and its imperfections are minutely indicated in the copy ; but luckily they do not obscure the text , the only lost nords being " rest " and " him , " in the last two lines of the third stanza , with the last latter of " him " in the preceding line and the first letter of " Few " at the beginning of the next stanza The letter is addressed ( on the same sheet containing the poem ) to John Taylor Esq at the Revd Mr. Armstrong 's Clononlly Cashel It begins ( or the portion copied does ) thus : I have completed the Burial of Sir John Moore , &; will here inflict it upon you ; you have no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I told you so much here there is something lost The text of the poem follows in the spelling and pointing of the original . The stanzas are numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . Not a drum was heard , not a funeral note , As Ms curse to the rampart we huirled ; Not a Soldier discharged his farewell shot O'er the grave where our Hero we burled . We buried him darkly , at dead of night , The sods with our bayonets turning , By the struggling moonbeam 's misty light , And the lantlaorn dimly burning . No useles , coffin enclosed his breast Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him , But hl lay like a Warrior taking Ins rest , With his martial cloak around him Flew and short were the prayeis we said And we spoke not a word of sorrow But we steadfastly gaz 'd on the face that was ' dead , And we bitteily thought of the morrow , We thought , as we hollow 'd his narrow bed , An1 smooth 'd down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tread o'er his head And we far away on the billow : Lightly they 'll talk of the Spurt that 's gone , And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him But little he 'll reek , if they let him sleep on ' In the grave where a Briton has laid him . But half of our heavy task was done , When the clock struck the note for retiring , And we heard the distant &; random gun That the Fee was sullenly firing Slowly &; sadly we laid him down From the field of his fame flesh and gory We call 'd not a line , and we rais 'd not a stone But we left him alone with his glory . The poet adds : - Pray write soon ? You may direct . as usual to College Trinity College , Dublin &; it will follow me to the Country Give nay love to Armstrong , &; Believe me My Dear John Ever Yours Charles Wolfe . The letter is not dated , but is postmarked ' Sept. 6 , 1816 . According to the " Remains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the author . " The editor adds : It was recited by a friend in presence of a gentleman travelling towards the north , of Ireland , who was so much struck with it that he requested and obtained a copy ; and . immediately after in 1817 , it appeared in the Newry Telegraph , with the initials of the author 's name From thence it was-copied into most of the London prints , and thence into the Dublin papers ; and subsequently it appeared , with some considerable errors , in the Edinburgh Annual ilegisier , which contained the narrative that first kindled the poet 's feelings on the subject . The biographer seems not to have known ( and I do not remember to have seen any reference to the fact , which I accidentally discovered in preparing for this present writing ) that the poem was printed in the first volume of Blacki000d 's Magazine ( June , 1817 , p. 277 ) , with " some considerable errors , " like " Nor in sheet nor " ; " the face of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing " ; and the omission of " and " in the-last line but one The initials of the author are omitted ( as probably in the newspaper reprints from the Newry , Telegraph ) , and the editor appends the following footnote : This little poem first appeared in some of the newspapers a few days ago . It is-too beautiful not to deserve preservation , in a safer repository ; and we have , accordingly , inserted it among our original poems . ? Ere In the " Remains " ( 1825 ) , the only variation from the text of the letter to John , Taylor is " hour " for " note " ; and the only other change made by the poet appears to have been " Of the enemy " for " That the foe was , " where the archdeacon , as we have seen , preferred to retain the original reading . These two authorities  --  the letter and the book  --  are the only trustsvortuy ones for the text as the poet left it at the time of his death , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Blackwood prove , as soon as the poem was printed ( probably in the Newry Telegraph. , where the author saw no " proof " of it ) , and have continued and multiplied ever since . I have examined many texts , English and American , but have found none that are absolutely correct . Ward 's " English Poets " ( Vol rv , p 323 ) is one of the most accurate , but it retains " That the foe was , " and in the third stanza has " nor " for " or " in the second line . In Linton and Stoddard 's " Lyrics of the Nineteenth Century " ( New York , 1883 ) , where the reading ( p. 102 ) is " suddenly , " a note says " Sullenly is generally misprinted for suddenly Wolfe 's manuscript has suddenly . " The corruptions in Blackwood have all been . copied in many reprints .

The volume also contains a few prose sketches and fifteen sermons , none of which , as the editor remarks , " were designed by their author for , publication , " all being , " with a single exception , composed for a plain but intelligent congregation " They are markedly simple in style , with not a single poetical quotation , or any other rhetorical embellishment A long and eulogistic review of the book appeared in Blackwood , for March , 1826 ( Vol XIX , p 323 ) , both verse and prose re-ceiving far more praise than they deserved .

Go forget me  --  why should sorrow O'er that brow a shadow fling ? Go , forget me  --  and to-monow Brightly smile and sweetly sing Smile  --  though I shall not be neat thee , Sing  --  though I shall never hem thee May thy soul with pleasine shone Lasting as the gloom of mine , Go , forget me , etc I remember hearing it sung by young sfriends some sixty or more years ago . Strangely enough , the reviewer is doubtful whether Wolfe wrote the poem that made him famous He asks How could Mr Russell publish the celebrated lines on the death of Sir John Moore as the production of Mr. Wolfe without giving any proof whatever that they are - so ? . . . Medwin knew no more of the matter than any coal-porter on Dublin Medwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted by Russell , had referred to Byron 's reading the poem to Shelley and other friends , and calling it " little inferior to - the best which the present prolific age has brought forth . " After reading it , he " repeated the third stanza , and said it was perfect , particularly the lines , ' But he lay - dike a - warrior taking his rest , etc " Shelley said that he should have taken the poem " for a rough sketch of Campbell 's , " but Byron replied ' " No ; Campbell would ' - have claimed it if it had been his " The review an Blackwood , it will be seen , was written almost two years after the history of the poem had appeared in the London Horning Chronicle , and nine years after Blackwood had printed and praised rt . It is amazing that the editor had not found out  --  or had forgotten  --  who wrote it . In the next number of the magazine p 489 ) he prints a letter from Rev. S D Sullivan , who- says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . . . and the first and last stanzas were actually composed in the same evening and recited by the author before he had committed ' them to naper " ; and the other stanzas were completed soon afterward . The poem which has immortalized both its author and his hero was at first ascribed to Byron , who regretfully disclaimed it , and was reprinted again and again in England before it was traced to its real source Meanwhile it was claimed by at least one impostor , who sent to Blackwood a poor " Address to Sleep , " purporting to be written by the same unknown hand . It was also disparaged by sundry critics who asserted that it was little more than a paraphrase of the report , of Moore 's death and burial printed in the Edinburgh Annual Register for 1808 , although the battle at Corunna , did not occur until the 19th of January , 1809 . The poem , moreover , varies from the report printed , in due season , in the Register , in representing the burial as taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been towards daybreak , as the " firing " which led to its being " hastened " for fear that it might be interrupted was " about eight in the morning " The full report is quoted in the " Remains . " It has been asserted again and again that the poem was a close translation of the French " Les Funerailles de Beaumanler , ' which may be found 171 Father Front 's " Reliques " ( Bohn 's ed. p 312 ) , being one of his sportive renderings of many poems by Moore and others , in French , Italian , Spanish , Greek , and Latin . It professes to be a tribute to a certain Col. de Beaumanior , killed in the defence of Pondicherry in 1640 . Prout adds that " no translation is necessary , the Rev. Mr Wolfe having reproduced it on the occasion of ' Sir John Moore 's fall at Corunna under similar circumstances .

XLIX , p. 52 ) In the number for September ( p. 195 ) the editors admit that they have been " hoaxed , " but express the hope that it was not intentionally done Certain alterations in Prout 's story , however , suggest that it was carefully planned to deceive . The " Remains " went through many editions abroad , the ninth of which ( London , 1847 ) brings out the very interesting fact that the Morning Chronicle writer was- " John Sidney Taylor , " who must have been the " John Taylor " to whom Wolfe sent the letter given above W.

He calls attention to the preponderance of teachers among those who attend summer schools , to the pedagogical aspect of summer school curricula , noting particularly their ineffectiveness in " the spread of higher education " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer school should be to continue the same kind of educational work in operation during the regular session . While I am in accord with much that Professor MacDonald says , there are a few points of dissent My attitude towards summer schools is based on experience as a public school teacher who formerly attended summer sessions , as a teacher in summer schools myself , and as a professor for several years in one of the smaller colleges This retrospect may account for our slightly different views . The record of about fifteen years in several of our summer schools shows that these sessions have been continued because of the sustained attendance of teachers . The attendance of regular college students during the summer session has not grown , and indeed has not been sufficient to warrant maintaining the summer school . It appears , therefore , that the summer school is kept up for those who are professionally engaged in teaching , and the majority of these are teaching in the public schools TO 7,111c1- nnnonrInr1 +11 , a a In e+-r ? , , n+inn given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by those who attend Consequently there is no occasion for concern over the fact that in summer sessions we do not continue the same nature of work that is given during the regular college ye'ar ; to do so would subvert what experience shows is the chief function of the summer school . - Of my ownclasses , while on the staff for four sessions in the Cornell Summer School , and one session ( 1909 ) in that of the University of Virginia , teachers constituted at least 90 per cent Nevertheless , I seldom noted any obtrusive pedagogical interest , certainly never at the expense of subject matter . Lessons assigned were prepared conscientiously ; laboratory and field ts.sks were eagerly completed I was usually satisfied with the progress made by these teacher-students , and rarely felt they had not accomplished at least as much as I should expect of regular college students . The number who had enjoyed an academic college training was very small . In mental alertness , however , the average woman who has taught several years in our public schools compares very favorably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in training so far as set courses are concerned , but their experience has brought them intellectual results of the same nature , if not of the same degree , as we attribute to the regulation college course The zeal of these teachers in their summer studies is generally conceded . If there were as much sustained interest in our college classes during the year , the laboratory and lecture room would be a pleasanter recollection to students when , later , they are men in business . I believe that most of us find summer teaching , foregoing the inconveniences of the season , less arduous than the work of the regular session , largely because the preponderance of teachers in our classes divides between the instructor and the student the question of enthusiasm , whereas during the regular session the professor generally has to supply it all . It is possible that many men who give instruction in our summer schools , lose sight of what seems to me the important privilege of the colleges and universities that maintain summer sessions The fact that every year several thousand teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction of the college or university professor gives the latter some opportunity to be of great service to these teachers and , therefore , to do a little , at least , towards making the schools below the college conform to his ideals I am glad to read a protest against " extension " work and the " listener " A summer school of the Chautauqua type is a menace , it affords slight recreation , and practically no education Progress comes only through serious work ; merely listening to lectures , and watching demonstrations , unless supplemented by thorough reading and study , is almost wasting one 's time .

Of the many American readers who have worked in the Bodleian Library , probably few have ever become familiar with the Staff-Kalendar , published by the Librarian annually for some years past , the 1909 edition of which has just come to my hand This extraordinary little book , measuring only two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation in what it shows  --  still more in what it implies  --  of the system that has grown up for centuries in connection with the administration of the venerable library whose name it bears Who that has labored drearaingly among the ancient tomes in Duke Humphrey 's room , occasionally pondering on the simplicity and quiet that reign there , in contrast with the noise and fussiness of the Bibliothe'que Nationale , has realized that every man and boy employed in the library carries a printed book in which it is recorded that on February 1 the east end of " the H " is to be swept , that on February 8 the Bodley clocks are to be wound and set , and that on February charming little boys that glide about the place has imagined that they are hedged about with an aggregation of rules seemingly utterly irrelevant to such gentle creatures ? ? as that " no bullying or assumption of authority will be tolerated , " and that " boys must not run violently on stairs " Their regulation-3 are also in part of a kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonishing that , " as boots often let in water unexpectedly , every boy is advised to keep at the library a dry pair of boots and a dry pair of socks " Boys are also warned against reading in a bad light  --  as though any other kind could be found during a good part of the Oxford winter ! " It is no answer to say that they can see perfectly , because the more short-sighted they were becoming the better they would see in a bad light . " This bit of refutation brings out the fact that , whatever objection or exception or occasion you may postulate , you will find that the Staff-Kalendar has foreseen the contingency . Here is a note suggestive of many troublesome letters , following an elaborate account of the fire-alarm system " Other libraries desiring information as to the details of this system are begged not to write to the Librarian , but to the Expansion Sprinkler Syndicate , " etc . Yet a moment later , in a mollified mood , the Librarian adds that he " might , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system had or had not given satisfaction . " The fire-alarm question runs through all the Kalendar , and one derives the impression that a kind of hysteria , or pyrophobia , pervades the place Undergraduate demonstrations are clearly one of the chief causes of alarm  --  perhaps on other grounds also , at any rate , the staff is warned on every day from May 21 to June 2 that " eights celebrations are to be watched for " Street bonfires are a matter of special concern , and if they are not extinguished , on request , by the policeman on duty ( " which has happened " ) appeal is at once to be taken to higher powers . Most impressive , however , in this connection , are the warnings against carrying any kind of light , or striking any match , in the Bodleian building ; these go back to a Latin statute of 1610 , and have been san tified further by various interpretations and enforcements " In 1901 a newly admitted foreign reader lighted a cigarette in going down the Bodleian stairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tragic occurred . " In 1909 a graduate of forty-five years ' standing struck a light on the same staircase , to examine a picture by , and was infoimed that he must never again enter the building . the picture itself was removed " This last clause , whose italics are ours , certainly gives a fitting final touch to the solemnity of the subject . Talk of hanging animals for crime , That was child 's play compared with punishing a picture , by forbidding it to hang , for inciting a venerable man to misconduct Enough of details One thing is certain : " who touches this book touches a man . " Not only the reverend past of Bodley 's Library , but the arresting personality of Bodley 's present librarian , make the Kalendar far more than the merely utilitarian production it professes to be LECIOR . Palo Alto , Cal , November 15 THE READING OF VERSE To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION . Sin : Professor Gummere 's plea in the Nation of November 11 for the reading of verse as verse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors in vogue , as well as the delicate-handed dilettanti of our most esoteric circles , but too many of our most advanced young gentlemen profess and practise the pernicious heresy of reading verse as prose , sternly denying time-values to poetic lines , and resolutely submerging the emotional and the aesthetic elements of measured speech in the logical and analytical elements . Whence comes this tendency ? Is it an outgrowth of the attempt of Whitman and those who came after him to loosen the shackles of regular rhythm ? Does it result from the disintegration of modern blank verse and its resolution into a bastard prose ? Or is it simply due to the subjection of our generation to the pervasive influence of the scientific habit 01 mind and all its implications ? Our contemporary poets  --  those of the widest influence , at any rate  --  are not chargeable with it , nor do they countenance it Rather , are not the new and pronounced rhythms of the schools of Kip-ling and of Swinburne protests against this tendency and landmarks in a new reaction against over-refinement and emasculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the tyro or the iconoclast cal hardly render such movements of speech as Thus saith the Lora in the vault above the cheru-bim , Calling , to the angels and the souls in their degree otherwise than with the rolling rhythm of chant or mean The sensuous effect of flowing measures , the glamour of verse and its spell , are still the things sought for . Herrick 's " holy incantation of this verse " is still felt today as the test and touchstone of poetry . Are our neoterics in their turn trying to start a reaction against even the newest school of poetry ? I fear that much of the blame rests with . those who profess to teach literature from , the chairs of learning How many of our college teachers can sincerely testify that they themselves have never subscribed to . this heresy , in practice if not in theory ?
