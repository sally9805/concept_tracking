txt // He could draw like any one else when he was not trying to be grand and effective . Of his prodigious ability and fecundity there is of course no doubt . He carried on a vast manufactory for the production of religious and decorative pictures , with the aid of an army of assistants and collaborators ; and the amount of work produced and its general excellence are amazing . If he had done nothing but design the canvases that bear his name , and never painted a stroke of them , their number would still be almost incredible ; but he is known to have worked more or less on almost all of them , and to have painted many ( and some of the largest ) entirely with his own hand and in an astonishingly short time . Such rapidity of production was possible only by virtue of the utmost systematisation . Each of his assistants was allotted a special task for which he was specially trained , and in the master 's own work there was no reliance on mood and no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , and every day 's tranquil and regulated labour brought the picture just so much nearer its predestined completion . If anything was bad , it was easier to paint a new picture than to change the old one . The very handling , with all its ease , certainty , and celerity , was always methodical and never hurried . Rubens was systematic in all things , and his lif2 was ordered like his pictures , and his pictures like . his life . In such works as the r // Medici series in the Louvre there is little personal feeling and little poetry , but the ideal of the time is embodied in a robust and rhetorical prose . If we no longer admire them greatly , it is because our ideals have changed . To have been the representative artist of an epoch is to leave a great name ; but if Rubens had produced nothing but such works as we have been discussing , one could understand the sneer that Mr. Whistler is said to have uttered , " Whether or not Rubens was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Rubens was more than the incarnation of the seventeenth century in art ? he was the precursor of the eighteenth , and even of the nineteenth century . Though a precocious artist , he yet ripened slowly , and his best and most personal work was done late in life . After his second marriage in 1630 , his travels over , rich , famous , and very much in love , he painted more often for himself alone . A series of canvases of moderate size , painted throughout by his own hand and for his own personal satisfaction , are scattered through the collections of Europe . Most of them are portraits of Helena Fourment , who , sixteen when he married her and only twenty-six when he died , lives for ever in her comely youth in these pictures . She is shown us in her habit as she lived , or masquerading in the characters of sundry saints and mythological persons , and she is shown us in next to no clothes at all , either coming from the bath in // a fur pelisse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , we find personal feeling , and we find painting the most masterly , colour the most delicious , character , beauty , and charm . In the nudes there are still mannerisms and faults of drawing , but there is a perfection of flesh painting that passes even Titian , while the draped portraits are as perfect as anything ever painted . Through Van Dyck , Rubens profoundly influenced the English portrait school of the eighteenth century ; in such pictures of this later period as " The Garden of Love " we see Watteau foreshadowed . The subject is a very Watteau ; and while there is more robustness , more solidity , a less ethereal sentiment , there is as much charm as with Watteau himself . Watteau not only founded his technique on that of Rubens , but discovered in such pictures as this his type of subject and treatment . He refined upon it and transported it from earth to ballet-land , but he lost in vitality as much as he gained in grace , and the " Embarkation for Cythera " yields no greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In his last years Rubens began to live a part of the time in the country , and landscape began first to occupy him seriously . The backgrounds of his earlier works , where landscape is introduced , were generally painted by others , but now he began to study nature for himself and to devote his prodigious skill and the knowledge of his art acquired in a life- // time of production to the rendering of natural effects . The result is a series of pictures of surprising modernity and truth ? far in advance of anything produced by the professional landscape painters of his time . They had a marked influence on the development of landscape art , and M. Emile Michel is quite within bounds when he says that " the best landscapes of Gainsborough , and even of Constable , owe as much to Rubens as to Nature . " FRANS HALS i I F we limit the meaning of the word strictly enough , there can be no doubt that Frans Hals of Haarlem was one of the greatest painters that ever lived . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no superior , and perhaps no equal but Velasquez ; yet his fame is singularly modern . He seems to have had a pretty high local reputation at one period of his career , but he died a pauper and was rapidly forgotten . In 1786 one of his pictures sold for five shillings , and , as late as 1852 , the lifesize , full length portrait of himself and his wife , now in the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam , fetched no more than ? 50 . Thirteen years afterward , " The Laughing Cavalier " was sold for ? 2,040 , and in 1902 a " Portrait of a Gentleman " reached the sum of ? 8,780 . What one of the great Doelen pictures , which in the eighteenth century were rolled up and stored in garret and cellar , would be worth to-day , if it came upon the market , it is difficult to guess . Of course it was the painters who rediscovered Hals . Reynolds seems to have owned one of his portraits , and Northcote , Reynolds 's pupil , speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About the middle of the nineteenth century Hals became a living influence among 1 // the painters , and upon his art and that of Velasquez the schools of Manet and Whistler with their divers issues were largely based . Then came Fromentin 's " Maitres d'Autrefois , " and another painter , in some pages of brilliant writing , revealed to the world what his fellows already knew . The long eclipse of a reputation was over , and the name of Frans Hals shone forth with a glory which is not likely again to be dimmed . To-day it is more necessary to distinguish than to praise ; more important to show what the painter of Haarlem was not , than to demonstrate what he was ; more difficult to guard against the possible evils of an overwhelming influence than to recognise the good it has accomplished . Unfortunately for us , during the long neglect of Hals and his works , most of the facts of his life and a great part of his production were allowed to disappear . There are great gaps in the chronology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled of late years , but which still remain puzzling in the extreme . His astonishing technical facility shows that his work was produced with great rapidity , while this same facility could have been maintained only by constant practice . There should be scores of canvases , big and little , for every year of his working life , yet there is more than one period of five or six years to which no known work can with probability be assigned . Above all , there is nothing known to exist that can with propriety be called an early work . He is now // supposed , on slender enough evidence , to have been born in 1580 , though the date long accepted , on no discoverable evidence at all , is 1584 . He was therefore either twenty-nine or thirty-three years old when his earliest known picture was painted , in 1613 , and three years older when the next extant work was produced , the first of the great series of Doelen pictures at Haarlem . That he should have been given such a commission at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation ; the picture itself shows even more clearly that mastery had been attained . He is to do better work , but technical difficulties have already ceased to exist for him , and he can draw and paint anything he chooses . How did he learn ? Who was his first master ? What sort of partial successes and full successes put him in a position to be chosen for important work ? We can only guess . Mr. Gerard B. Davies 's conjecture that , during his young days in Antwerp , where he was born , Hals is likely to have studied with Rubens 's master , Van Noort , seems plausible enough ; but we know so little of Van Noort that , even if accepted , the conjecture does not greatly help us . It is put forth tentatively , and it is to be hoped that it will not , with the curious facility of such conjectures , get itself taken for fact by the next writer on the subject . Whoever was his first teacher , Hals must have done a deal of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pity that some of it has not survived for the edifica-S // tion of the student of to-day , who is inclined to begin where the master left off . We have the early paintings of Velasquez , and know through what hard , precise , " tight " work he trained the eye and hand that are later so surprising in their sureness and facility . Mastery has never been otherwise attained , and it is a safe prediction that if any of the work of Hals during this first decade shall be recovered and identified , it will be found admirable , no doubt , but otherwise admirable than the things we know . The work that Frans Hals did between his thirtyfifth and fifty-fifth years ? the period of full maturity  --  is pretty well known to us . A good deal of it must , indeed , have disappeared , but what is left is so all of a piece ? the development is so normal and regular and the visible change so slight that it is not probable that the lost works would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such as he was at the beginning of this period , he was at the end of it . There is to be noted only a gradual increase of power , a slight broadening of vision , a growing looseness and lightness of touch . One of the notable things about this output is its limitation of subject . Mr. Davies gives a curious list of the things Hals did not paint ; what it comes to is just this : he painted nothing but portraits . He only occasionally introduced a landscape background , and then in a thoroughly conventional and perfunctory manner . He never painted a horse and hardly ever a dog . He painted no " sub108 FRANS HALS ject pictures . " We can think of no other painter in the whole history of art whose effort was so strictly limited in its direction , and this narrowness grew upon him and is even more marked after 1640 than before that date . In his later years his figures rarely have any visible surroundings of any sort . In artistic qualities , also , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only a rudimentary sense of composition ; light and shade is , for the most part , interesting to him only as a means of drawing . His colour is sometimes pleasing and surprisingly well harmonised , considering the parti-coloured costumes he painted and the directness of his method , but he was hardly a colourist . His growing tendency to the use of black shadows in flesh would , alone , show an indifference to colour . He was a painter of likenesses ? a portraitist pure and simple . But if Hals was only a portrait painter , was he not one of the greatest of portrait painters ? Yes and no . Northcote , in the passage already referred to , says : " For truth of character . . . he was the greatest painter that ever existed " ; and adds , " if I had wanted an exact likeness I should have preferred Frans Hals to Titian . " The exact likeness was what Hals was after . He had little sense of beauty . He was capable of some gravity and dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great student of expression , but , compared with Rembrandt 's intensity of life , his figures grimace . There is rarely anything subtle // about him , and never anything poetic ; he saw with admirable clearness and rendered with wonderful accuracy just what every one may see . He was , as nearly as possible , the absolute realist . No artist ever lived , however , who had not an ideal . With Hals , as with many a literary realist , that ideal is to be found in his style ? his personal manner of expression . What he says is obvious enough , but the way in which he says it is inimitable . He is an almost unapproachable master of the language of painting . Pure art is always an arrangement of something , notes or forms or colours or words ; what Hals arranged was brush-strokes , and his mere handling becomes a contribution to the trsthetic pleasures of the world . He was a master stylist , and the greatest virtues of style , in painting as in writing , are , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried away by his ease , his rapidity , his brilliancy and crispness of touch , and to imagine that these are his great qualities ; but any one can be rapid and easy ? what is truly amazing with Hals , in his prime , is his certainty . What astounds is not that the touch is instantaneous and slashing , but that each of these instantaneous slashes is infallibly in exactly the right place , and of exactly the right shape to express the form and texture of the thing he would render . What we call painting , in the narrower sense , is , after all , the expression of form with the brush , and Hals was an almost impeccable draughtsman . His sense of form // is not delicate , but , except for an occasional tendency to elongate the forearm , it is unerring . Whoever would imitate him must begin with acquiring his mastery of drawing . His characteristic combination of rather commonplace vision with extraordinary powers of execution finds , perhaps , its highest exemplification in the " St. Adrian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of it nearly as wonderful . Somewhere about 1635 a new element seems to enter into Hals 's work . His tone becomes graver , his colour somewhat warmer , his light and shade more suffused , his interest in the rendering of objects more subordinated to the study of atmosphere . In a word , his art becomes more Rembrandtesque , and it has long been thought that , during this period , he came under the influence of the master , more than twenty years his junior , who was painting , only thirteen miles away , at Amsterdam . Fromentin first called attention to the resemblance of Hals 's picture of " The Regents of St. Elisabeth 's Hospital " ( 1641 ) to Rembrandt 's " Syndics . " Mr. Davies points out that this resemblance is purely superficial , consisting mainly of the likeness in number of figures , arrangement , costume , etc. , and that , as Rembrandt 's picture was painted twenty years later than Hals 's , these things , if they prove anything , prove rather that the younger master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out , also , that during the years from 1635 to ( say ) // 1648 , during which the Rembrandt influence is supposed to have existed , Hals produced many pictures which show no trace of this influence . This is undeniably true , but is not surprising . Many of the accepted dates of Hals 's pictures are conjectural , but the " St. Joris 's Shooting Company " is certainly of 1639 , and shows no Rembrandtesque qualities . On the other hand , it is one of the poorest of the series of corporation pictures , and might be thought to show that Hals , even when not experimenting in his new manner , was losing interest in his old . Other work of this time , like " The Merry Toper , " is of the nature of brilliant sketching , and may be supposed to have been done as a relaxation ? a playing with that of which he was sure between serious efforts at that which was harder for him . Two portraits at Frankfort ( said to be of 1638 ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair tests . The " Maria Voogt " of 1639 he considers to be like Rembrandt mainly in externals of costume and so forth . The " Old Lady " of the Bridgewater Gallery ( 1640 ) , he admits to be very like Rembrandt , saying that , if it be indisputably genuine , " I can see no escape from the admission that we have here Hals experimenting in the style of Rembrandt , and carrying his experiment to the length of scarcely disguised imitation . " In all the other pictures he sees no more than a growth of Hals 's sense of atmosphere , which he thinks requires to be accounted for by no outside influence . He does // not mention at all a portrait of " Feyntj e van Steenkiste " in the Rijks Museum , which , judging from the reproduction alone , is one of the most Rembrandtesque things Hals ever painted . It is evident , from the dates alone , that we must leave Rembrandt 's later work out of the count in considering his possible influence upon Hals . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his own pupils . It is not the Rembrandt of the " Syndics , " but rather the Rembrandt of the " Anatomy Lesson " that must be reckoned with ; the relatively grayer , smoother painter , then at the height of popularity . Hals was , as a mere technician , the superior , and would not be likely to change his handling ; the influence that Rembrandt would have would be precisely in that " growth of the sense of atmosphere " which was his gift to the whole Dutch school . It is incredible that such a genius as Rembrandt should not have influenced any painter living within thirteen miles of him . The wonder is ? and it is a proof of Hals 's powerful individuality ? that the influence was not more marked and more dominant than it appears to have been . It seems to have begun about 1634 or 1635 , reached its height , perhaps , with the Bridgewater portrait , and was already declining when the " Regents " was painted in 1641 . In that picture there are sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rembrandt , and which become characteristic of Hals in his later works . // During this Rembrandtesque period , Hals produced his noblest pictures ? those which are nearest to being great works of art as well as great pieces of painting . After that period his technical powers begin to decline . He was more than sixty years old , and , if he had in reality been the drunkard he has been called , it is incredible that he should have held them so long . After 1641 his works become few and far between , but a picture here and there helps to bridge the gap that formerly existed between the great canvas of that year and the last efforts of his genius , the two Regent pictures of 1664 . In these rare works positive colour tends more and more to disappear , the palette is reduced to its lowest terms , blackness invades everything . The handling is still free , freer than ever ? but it gradually ceases to be precise . What we call tone is taking the place of colour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , the heads tend to grow larger than life ; from failure of hand , the touch becomes loose and fumbling . He is no longer capable of the marvels of rendering of his younger days , but the acquired knowledge of a lifetime is still there . The language stumbles , but it is a master who speaks . In the last pictures of all , painted by an old man dependent upon poor-rates , who was at least eighty and may have been eighty-four years of age , there is a certain largeness of vision , a certain way of seeing things by their great relations , which marks him , more than ever , the artist . In the male group , // especially , the drawing has gone all to wreck , and even the sense of resemblance is no longer convincing ; but the feeling of tone and of unity of effect has become so great that there are not wanting artists to proclaim it , everything considered , his finest work . Two years later he died in the " old man 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors . From all that has gone before , it is not difficult to divine where , in the hierarchy of painters , Frans Hals belongs . His range is too limited , his sense of beauty too restricted , his intellectual value too slight , to allow us to place him among the great ones of the earth . Not only can he not be placed , with Michelangelo and Rembrandt , among the poets , but his prose is far less various and elevated than that of Velasquez . For clearness and vigour of statement , for " truth of character " and " exact likeness , " he has no superior , and the language of painting , as applied to the enunciation of fairly obvious truths , has no greater master . Somewhere below the baker 's dozen of the very greatest , but on a pedestal of his own , he will stand for ever in the temple of fame . // OF all the great masters of painting none is more popular to-day than Rembrandt . No one is more admired by painters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics . The solitary old man whose fame was already so forgotten that his death was unnoticed by his contemporaries , and whose portraits , a few years later , could be bought for " sixpence apiece , " is now considered by many the greatest of all masters . Dozens of earnest searchers rummage in musty records to glean the slightest fact connected with his life , and books and articles without end are devoted to his memory . After three hundred years his strangely original genius is appreciated , if not understood , and long-neglected pictures are brought forth from garrets and given places of honour in great museums or sold for enormous sums to American millionaires . M. Emile Michel has written an elaborate life of the artist and Mr. Charles Knowles Bolton has devoted a volume entirely to Saskia because she was Rembrandt 's wife . A Life of Rembrandt reads much like a Life of Shakspere . Really next to nothing is known about it , and the elaborate investigations undertaken of 115 r // late years have served more to destroy legends formerly believed than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " perhaps " are the ever-recurring words , and we are more often told that he may , might , could , would , or should have done or felt this or that than that he really did so . The possibilities , too , have a strange knack of becoming probabilities , and the probabilities certainties in a few pages , and so lend themselves as bases of deduction for new possibilities , which go through the same transformation . Most of M. Michel 's guessing is plausible and seems to have some foundation in the only real record of Rembrandt 's life ? his work , which is generally dated . The system is burlesqued in Mr. Bolton 's little book on Saskia . Of Saskia nothing is known at all except her birth and parentage , the date of her marriage , the dates of the birth of her children and of her own death , and such an idea of her personal appearance as can be gathered from various portraits more or less plausibly assumed to be hers , and very different from each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life of her ? The task is easy . Bring in the Prince of Orange and Sir Philip Sidney , Alexandre Dumas and " La Tulipe Noire , " lions , monkeys , and Dr. Tulp ; assume that if Rembrandt scratches an etching of a woman in bed , Saskia is failing fast , and then introduce a most robust personage as a portrait of her a year later ; make her a good influence in his life , and tell how , // after her death , " his hand etched pictures unworthy " of him , in the face of the fact that the worst of the " free " subjects are of the year 1640 ? and the thing is done . On page 2 , " Rombertus van Ulenburgh , the father of Saskia , in the early autumn of the year 1578 was a student in some foreign university , perhaps at Paris or in England . " On page 3 , " he must have enjoyed his walk to the Thames to see the barge of Leicester pass , or to look upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister . " M. Michel is not so bad as this , but even M. Michel works his guesses rather hard . He objects , justly , to the " mania for identification " which has given various historic names to Rembrandt 's portraits and etchings , but he is not free from the malady himself . His identification of Rembrandt 's father is plausible , but he makes Saskias and Hendrickjes of female figures , nude or costumed , that have slight resemblances to each other , and , once having decided that Rembrandt worked much from members of his household , will have brothers and sisters and servants at every turn . Perhaps the strangest of all is his ' identification of the so-called Sobiesky with Rembrandt himself , in spite of a discrepancy of ten or fifteen years between the apparent age of the model and the date of the picture . Yet the master played such strange tricks with his own features that it is not impossible he played this one . Eliminating the conjectural in Rembrandt 's life , // what is left that is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes called himself Van Ryn , was born in Leyden of a respectable lower-middle-class family on the 15th day of July , 1606-7 or 8 ? for the date even is uncertain , and there seems about as much documentary evidence , for one of these years as for the others . No record ' of Rembrandt 's early youth has come down to us , but the may-have-beens bravely fill the gap . He was ' . enrolled in the university , but how much he studied there we can only guess . At " about " the age of fifteen he began the study of art with a bad painter , Jacob van Swanenburch , and " probably " stayed with him three years . In 1624 he went to Amsterdam to study with a painter of greater reputation , the Italianizer Pieter Lastman , but remained in his studio less than six months , when he returned to Leyden , determined " to study and practise painting alone , in his own fashion . " This was in 1624 , and his earliest known works , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Money Changer " in the Berlin Gallery , are dated 1627 , so that three years are unaccounted for . After this time he soon began to be celebrated , so much so that Gerard Dou became his pupil in 1628 and remained with him until 1631 . That Dou was his pupil seems strange until one finds that Rembrandt 's work at this time was much more like Dou 's than like his own later productions . In 1631 , when he went to settle 1 // definitely in Amsterdam , he was already a well-known painter , and was shortly the fashionable portrait painter of the day . The next year , when he was not more than twenty-six years old , he painted the ' " Anatomy Lesson , " which set the cap-sheaf on his glory and made him the most famous of Dutch artists . At this time he met Saskia van Uylenborch , a young woman of a much wealthier and better family than his own , and was welcomed as an aspirant by her relatives , and married her in 1634 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never paid for , and filled it with the collections that figured in his inventory eighteen years later . He was fond of his wife and his work , always busy , the master of many pupils , earning much money , and spending it lavishly on his wife and on his collections . He bought paintings , engravings , and brit-a-brat at extravagant prices , and seems to have been regularly fleeced by dealers and . money-lenders . Titus , the only child of his marriage that lived to maturity , was born in 1641 , and Saskia died in June of the next year . In that year also he painted " The Night Watch , " that puzzling picture which generations of critics have fought over , and which Capt . Cocq and his company , for whom it was painted , understood as little as the rest of the world . This was the beginning of the end . Rembrandt was becoming too original to be popular ; and as time went on , and his // " broad subjects " merely because they are " unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece . " " claaic " beauty is not his province . Life is what he the life that he knows and understands . " " Do the coats of the Syndics , or their conical hats . . . remind you of the harmonious draperies in the friezes of the Parthenon ? And if you admit that Rembrandt has been able to find and make you feel a new beauty . . . in the lines , colours , and reflections of his fellow-townsmen 's clothed bodies , why do you refuse to see the delicate tones , the palpitating flesh , the marvellous suppleness of line and modelling , the comprehension of certain harmonies of the human body shown by Rembrandt in his nudes ? Accustomed to see the representatives of an academic tradition exhibit their carefully cleaned , smoothed , and polished dolls , . . . the sight of something real shocks and disgusts you . . . . If any one of our contemporaries , worn out by the driving life of towns , or any townswoman of the twentieth century , deformed by stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in which little attention is given to eurythmy , ' should be tempted to reproach Rembrandt with a realism that seems at first sight excessive , they should reflect that Rembrandt is perhaps the only one of the old masters who would have been capable of feeling , expressing , and making us understand and love the living charm and grace hidden in these bodies of ours , bodies on which we heap our mendacious dresses , and I // of which we fear the nakedness because we do not know how to see the beauty . " All this is good and healthy criticism as far as it goes , but it does not quite satisfy . Let any painter who has spent thirty years studying the human body without its " mendacious dresses " say whether Rembrandt 's women are not vastly uglier than life . Let him who has seen how supremely lovely can be the body of a young girl , how much harmonious line and beauty of structure is to be found , by him who has eyes for it , in the forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism " adequately explains the hideousness of these " Dianas " and " Bathshebas . " Michelangelo did not make " smooth and polished dolls , " but he would have seen wonders of beautiful form and lime in any human body because form and line were what he was looking for . Rembrandt did not see them because he had no care for form and line . His one love was character , his one aim expression , his one means light and shade . When Rembrandt does show a sense of beauty , his worshippers cry aloud and call upon us to admire it ; why should they not admit that more often he does not show it ? Fromentin 's remark , that Rembrandt saw nothing in life " but physical ugliness and moral beauty , " still remains , as does so much else that he has written , the truest word of criticism upon that strange genius . Indeed , Fromentin 's analysis of Rembrandt 's genius remains the best yet written , and I need make no 1 ' 24 REMBRANDT apology for condensing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rembrandt was two men in one . On the one hand was the thoroughly trained Dutch painter of the time , the realist par excellence , the perfect technician , the observer , l'homme exterieur . Of this Rembrandt no better example could be cited than that known to all of us , " The Gilder . " Here is no poetry , no idealism , no style , but a piece of work so thorough , so wonderful , so truly seen and rendered , that it rightly ranks among the masterpieces of the world . This is the Rembrandt who was the idol of the Dutch public , the man whom the compatriots of Ter Borch adored . The other Rembrandt was an idealist , a dreamer of strange dreams , a worshipper of light . The " Supper at Emmaus " in the Louvre is his work . The mysterious charm and power of such work as this is indescribable and incommunicable . For once a result seems to have been produced in art without any visible or analysable means . Something supernatural seems before one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has really died and risen again . Yet in technical matters the picture is every way inferior to the portrait of " The Gilder . " It is not particularly well drawn , and it is entirely without colour . In its physical appearance the canvas is mean and insignificant ? and its handling is timid and almost fumbling . With something to say that had never been said , how should he say it with assurance and in the current language of art ? // As long as these two Rembrandts were separate , one was sure to please . But the dreamer insisted on having a hand in works where the observer only was needed , and the result was such an enigmatic picture as " The Night Watch . " It is a splendid failure , and Capt . Cocq can hardly be blamed for preferring the accomplished mediocrity of Van der Heist . Again the two Rembrandts take up their different tasks , but the public confidence is shaken , and public favour is deflected upon more reliable artists who can be trusted not to dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dreamer is strengthened and the technician weakened . Strange experiments are made , violences are resorted to , methods become more and more startling and original . Late in life , once or twice only , the master-painter and the great imaginer coincide , and pictures like " The Syndics " are produced ? pictures in which imagination and observation work together for the production of the perfect masterpiece ; but it is too late , and the technique , perfect as it is , is no longer the smooth accomplishment of earlier days . No one comprehends and no one cares , and the great painter drops into his neglected grave . A colourist , save once or twice , Rembrandt never was . Neither was he , properly speaking , a draughtsman . M. Breal has pointed out that Rembrandt never drew a single figure , there being always some suggestion , however slight , of the surroundings in which it is // placed . It may be as truly said that he never drew an outline . When he seems working in pure line it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass , suggests the direction of folds or the bagging of muscles , breaks , and continues again . The line itself is suggested ( or potential ) light and shade . Beauty of form , as such , was nothing to him , and he cared for form at all only as it gave surfaces for light to fall on and shadows to catch in . He drew a woman as he did a pig , from the picturesque point of view ; and the creased and flabby shapes of his ugly women were better , for his purposes , than would have been the rounded limbs of a Greek nymph . So lie expressed the soul of a poet through forms of an astounding vulgarity , and conveyed a depth of sentiment almost unique in art , though the figures he drew are often almost inconceivably grotesque . " ... Of chiaroscuro he is the supreme master . It is almost his only method of expression , and with it he says such strange things as were never , before or since , said by art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly original minds in the world 's history . Like all such minds , he had no artistic posterity , and worked almost pure harm to those who were influenced by him . Like Michelangelo , he was the ruin of his followers . The language of these solitary minds is fitted only for the expression of their own thoughts , and becomes empty verbiage in the mouths of imitators . WILLIAM BLAKE THERE is a great fascination in the incomplete , and a glory in understanding the misunderstood and admiring the unappreciated . When any man has fully and clearly expressed himself ? when what he had to do or say in the world is thoroughly done and unmistakably said ? why bother one 's self to explain the clear or interpret the known ? But the half articulate genius whose message the people have not heard or comprehended , the fire of whose inspiration is smothered in its own smoke ? the man of fitful force and unbalanced power he furnishes to the discerning critic his true opportunity . There is little credit to be had in praising what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read what is plainly written ; but it needs a penetrating mind to discern the beauties of what most of the world despises , and to find or invent a meaning in what men take for madness . So there is more written of William Blake than of Veronese , and almost as much as of Michelangelo . Whether or not Blake was actually mad is a question for the professional alienist to decide . Perfectly sane he certainly was not . He spoke constantly of his " visions " as having objective reality ; but whether 127 // this was hallucination or mystification , who can tell ? He was incoherent to the verge of raving , vainglorious to a degree that suggests the folie des grandeurs , and suspicious and unjust to an extent which reminds one of the mania of persecution . Whether he was or was not mad , his was assuredly a singularly ill-regulated , unbalanced , and untrained mind . In art his education was little enough , but it was , fortunately for him , of the right kind . In literature he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of what he had was of the wrong kind . The hard and dry style of engraving he learned from his master Basire was eminently salutary to Blake as an artist . In spite of his strange genius he was technically a convinced classicist . He was amusingly bigoted in his denunciation of the colourists and of " that infernal machine called Chiaroscuro , " and maintained that " the great and golden rule of art , as well as of life , is this : That the more distinct , sharp , and wiry the boundingline , the more perfect the work of art ; and the less keen and sharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation , plagiarism , and bungling . " Of course this is silly and one-sided , and largely the result of ignorance and prejudice ; but there is an element of truth in it . In the first place , it must be remembered that " nature put him out " ; that , as he said of himself , " natural objects always did . . weaken , deaden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we understand it since the Venetians , // requires for its perfection the direct study of nature , and , therefore , was not for him who found that the posed model " smelt of mortality , " and who was not strong enough ( as the truly great artists have been ) to make nature serve him rather than allow nature to master him . Michelangelo did not find even the " mortality " of the dissecting-room deadening to his imagination . Yet Blake felt that in art mere vagueness was death . The highest imagination is always the most definite , and " a : pirit and a vision are not , as the modern philosophy supposes , a cloudy vapour or a nothing ; they are organised and minutely articulated beyond all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce . . . . Spirits are organised men . " Debarred from great realisation he found safety in the very hardness and dryness of his method , which gives a sense of accuracy even when accuracy is absent , and makes even false drawing look marvellously sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been really observed , because his method of statement is so precise ; and they owe half their effect to that cause . His style " fitted him , " and gives the same reality to his apocalyptic visions which those of Darer possess . In literature , however , Blake had nothing answering to the training in clarity and precision which , as a draughtsman , he had gained from his long practice of engraving and of drawing Gothic monuments . He was altogether self-educated , and ignorant even of // grammar . He shared in the admiration for Ossian that was common in his time , and retained it after the rest of the world had outgrown it . He always maintained that both Ossian and Chatterton 's " Rowley " were genuine beings , and " owned himself an admirer of Ossian equally with any other poet whatever . " His early " Songs of Innocence and Experience , " in spite of grammatical and metrical stumbles , contain , as we all know , much lyrical power and true beauty ; but when he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theory of the universe and of good and evil , and to make myths which should convey his notions on these subjects , both his thinking and his style were those of an untrained and unbalanced mind . The so-called " prophetic books " are " full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . " They are written in what has been called " unrhymed verse , " but it is not really verse at all , and has no other vestige of versification than the arbitrary division into lines with a capital at the head of each . Here is a passage without the line divison . Blake is speaking of " Beulah " " Where every female delights to give her maiden to her husband : the female searches sea and land for gratification of the male genius , who in return clothes her in gems and gold , and feeds her with the food of Eden . " This has a certain rhythm , but it is distinctly the rhythm of what is known as poetical prose . It has no // line structure ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defied to divide it as Blake did . The thoughts conveyed in Blake 's prophetic books are as much the outcome of an untrained mind as is the poetry in which they are conveyed , but were they really valuable it would matter little . ) After all , what the world most loves is art , and thought has never long saved a work not plastically beautiful . To consider Blake as prophet and seer is much like considering Turner mainly as the author of " The Fallacies of Hope . " In his art he really attained to definite expression , thanks to his hard training , and though he never was a painter , in any just sense of the word , as an illustrator in black and white , whether of his own ideas or of the works of others , he displayed undoubted ability . His knowledge of the figure was far from complete and his anatomy is often impossible , while his taste was sometimes faulty and his ornamental flourishings are frequently mean and trivial . On the other hand , he had a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grandeur of style and an ability to suggest space and movement . Some of the " Inventions to the Book of Job " reach a very high level of dignity and beauty , and are more essentially large in their small dimensions than many a twenty-foot canvas or fresco . Due distance guarded and allowance made for their inferior completeness , they are almost worthy of comparison with Michelangelo , of whom they contain many reminiscences . // The engraving of the morning stars singing together is one of the grandest designs in all art . It should be remarked as bearing on the sanity of these works and Blake 's consciousness of rational adaptation of means to ends in their production , that he never attributed their authorship , as he did that of his later poems , to supernatural inspiration . The spirit of his brother suggested the methods of engraving some of his designs , and St. Joseph told him how to mix his colours , while " Flemish and Venetian demons " interfered with him ; but he never seems to have doubted that the drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they did not draw for him . PAINTING IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BESIDES the inherent difficulty of properly estimating contemporary work , there is an especial difficulty in dealing with the painting of the nineteenth century . Art in the past has been traditional , national , and homogeneous ; art in our day has been individual , international , and chaotic . At the beginning of the century the so-called " classical revival " destroyed what remained of the traditions of the Renaissance , and almost destroyed the art of painting as such . When men again began to wish to paint , each had to experiment for himself and to find what methods he could . Modern means of communication and modern methods of reproduction have brought the ends of the earth together , and placed the art of all times and countries at the disposal of every artist . The quantity of painting produced has been enormous ; the number of individual artists of some distinction has been remarkable ; and the succession of " movements " and revolutions , each rapidly extending its influence over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangled skein it may , however , be possible to pluck a few threads . Most of the characteristic tendencies of modern painting have had their origin or attained their high-135 // est development in France , and France has certainly held the primacy of art in the past century , as did England in the eighteenth , Holland and Flanders in the seventeenth , and Italy in the sixteenth . The history of modern painting is largely the history of painting in France . Yet in the first third of the century there is really only one name in France , or , for that matter , on the continent of Europe , that takes a very high rank . David was a man of force , but neither he nor his followers were painters , and still less were the cartoonists of Germany ; Prudhon alone was a really great artist . He was deeply influenced by Correggio , but he had an individuality of his own , and , in spite of the ruin wrought by bitumen , his best canvases are singularly lovely , and of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh painting of the old masters . Later the classical school produced another artist of high rank , however little of a painter , in Ingres . In him the classical tradition was profoundly modified by study of Raphael . He was not a great draughtsman in the sense of mastery of significant form , but he had rare feeling for beauty of line . His drawings are exquisite , and a few of his portraits will prove immortal . His contemporary , Delacroix , was the head of the romantic revolution . Delacroix was a man of great intellectual power , but hardly an altogether successful painter . What he did was to break down the classical tradition and make room for modern art rather than himself create it . He // and his contemporaries were greatly influenced by English painting , and in the first third of the century English painting was still the most vital in Europe . Affected as are the works of Sir Thomas Lawrence , he was still a continuer of the traditions of Reynolds and Gainsborough , and , through them , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reached by the Renaissance , and the country that longest retained the traditions of painting ; and in England the classical school had hardly existed . When painting began to revive , it was first to England and then to Rubens that it turned for its examples . The greatest achievement of painting in the past century is the creation of modern landscape ; and the most singular phenomenon , as Fromentin pointed out long ago , is the extension of the methods of the landscape painter to other branches of art . Now , the history of modern landscape begins in England . Turner can not be neglected ; he was indubitably a powerful and original genius . But he stands alone . It was Constable , the inheritor of the tradition of Gainsborough and of Rubens , who first stimulated the study of landscape in France . It was in France that under this stimulus grew up a school of painters of landscape , and of figures and animals in their relation to landscape , ? the so-called " Barbizon School , " ? which produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of the past . If any // painters of our day are to be ranked as indubitable masters , these painters are certainly Millet , Corot , Rousseau , and Troyon . The others commonly named with them are so inferior to them that they need not here be separately considered . Rousseau 's art is founded on Rubens and the Dutch , Corot 's on Claude . What they added was a profound study of nature , and particularly of natural light and what painters call " values . " Rousseau is naturalistic and rugged , while Corot is lyric . His best landscapes are perhaps the most delicately poetical and beautiful ever produced . In a landscape almost as fine as theirs Troyon placed cattle and Millet the rustic man . How wonderful as a pure landscapist Millet was is perhaps hardly understood . His peculiar distinction is that he was the first painter to study man in nature , and to give the relation of the figure to its surroundings . But besides this modern quality he had in large measure the qualities of all great art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a noble colourist , and the greatest master of drawing as expressive of the action of the human figure since Michelangelo . Perhaps no other master , certainly no other modern master , has shown such capacity to express the essential nature of a movement and to resume it in a permanent type ? to paint The Sower , not a sower . The successors of the Barbizon School were those who have been called the " Impressionists . " With them the study of light and the painting of everyNINETEENTH // thing as if it were landscape reached its extreme . Composition , drawing , even colour for its own sake , were more and more neglected , while the analysis of light became the one essential , and the relations of things seemed vastly more important than the things themselves . Mallet , who is generally considered the founder of this school , did not really carry its peculiar manner very far . He began with a rather unsuccessful attempt to paint like Velasquez ; in his last days he was influenced by younger men and attempted something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic work is blackish in colour , flat , and with heavy outlines . He had , however , a genius for the beautiful handling of oil paint as a material . More or less associated with the school was an original painter of considerable power , Degas , but its most influential exponent is Claude Monet . It is he who has carried farthest the experiment of dissecting and recombining the solar spectrum and of producing light by " ocular mixture " of colours . The permanent influence of the school will probably not be very great . It will have somewhat broadened the aims and enriched the palettes of other painters ; but its neglects were too many , and it was bound to be succeeded by an art that should again take up the study of beauty , of composition , of form , and of decorative colour . The great bulk of French painting has always been and still remains academic . The officially recognised // painters of France ? the medallists and members of the Institute ? are generally men of the schools , trained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them have attained great power and distinction , notably Gerome , Meissonier , Elie Delaunay in his wonderful portraits , and Baudry ( who , however , belongs rather with the decorators ) ; but they have added little that was new to art . Their output and that of their followers has been much modified by two influences : that of the great modern exhibitions and that of photography . The " exhibition " is distinctly modern ? a child of the nineteenth century . From putting into museums those things . of beauty which had outlived their original purpose we have come to make things especially for museums and to get together temporary museums each year for their exhibition . Hence the gallery picture and the machine du Salon . The Barbizon men were often kept out of the Salon and the Salon had not in their time reached its present proportions . The Impressionists have largely kept themselves out . For those who have regularly participated in the annual exhibitions , the desire to be seen in the crowd has resulted in a steady increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or decorative intention ; in constantly growing sensationalism of subject ; and , finally , in all sorts of fads and technical extremes . There have always been naturalists in painting , but photography has shown us , as nothing else ever could , // what nature is actually like . Almost with the invention of photography came the Preraphaelite movement in England , a short-lived attempt to abandon all artistic conventions and to substitute for them the painstaking and accurate portraiture of natural fact . A similar ideal attained more nearly its realisation in France at a much later date . With Bastien-Lepage , the tendency to consider man as a part of landscape and the tendency to minute naturalism were combined . The model was posed out of doors , and both the figure and its surroundings patiently studied and realised . All fleeting effects had to be abandoned in favour of the gray daylight that alone permits long study in the open air , and composition , style in drawing , and even beauty were sacrificed to fidelity . At his best the result was amazingly like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pictures are masterpieces in their own way , and before his death he did some beautiful landscapes . With the general mass of painters the influence of photography has been almost wholly for evil , and its result a dead level of commonplace . Outside of all the schools there have been , meanwhile , here and there , independent artists who have , each in his own way , kept alive this or that quality of more ancient art . Rossetti , more poet than painter , soon abandoned Preraphaelitism for a decorative formula and the study of colour and sentiment . His friend and pupil , Burne-Jones , modified while he // carried on the Rossettian tradition , and he and his numerous followers have been , in our day , the especial champions of the Florentine ideal of decorative line . Beside them but apart from them , and tracing his inspiration to the Venetians , was George Frederick Watts . In spite of uncertain draughtsmanship and a fumbling technique , his dignity of composition , elevation of feeling , and occasionally grave splendour of colour raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he more often reminds one of the great old masters than any other modern . Gustave Moreau was a sort of French Rossetti , enveloping a purely personal sentiment in a form unlike . any other , while in Germany the profoundly original and imaginative genius of Boecklin has kept up the protest against mere realism . In these men , and in others their contemporaries , the various elements of painting as.an art ? imagination of subject , beauty of drawing , intricacy of pattern , richness of colour , gravity and simplicity of tone , even brilliancy of handling and the manipulation of material ? have had their exponents . But perhaps the most characteristic phase of the art of the end of the century , in its reaction against naturalism , has been the revival of pure decoration . In England this has led to the arts-and-crafts movement , with its somewhat eccentric medievalism , and it has had its somewhat comic phase throughout the civilised world in the poster mania . Its more serious results have been // mainly confined to France and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , and it was revived in its fullest splendour by Paul Baudry in his paintings for the foyer of the Paris Opera House . As a master of significant form , Baudry was one of the greatest of the moderns , and he was a charming colourist also , but he was pre-eminently a master of decorative composition , and , as a vast scheme of ordered line and space for the decoration of a public building , his great work is perhaps the most notable achievement since the Renaissance . His reputation has suffered some eclipse in these later days , but it is safe to predict that it will , sooner or later , shine forth again ; and it will be seen that he was none the less a great artist for that academic training which it has been something too much the fashion to decry . Indisputably , however , the most influential master of decorative painting in the latter part of the nineteenth century has been Puvis de Chavannes . In him , to a noble simplicity and a great feeling for composition , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of landscape and a mastery of light and values , so that his work , while as " mural " as Giotto 's , is as modern as Monet 's . Originally a very fair academic draughtsman , he came more and more to sacrifice form and detail to monumental gravity and breadth of treatment , until his work , always austere , reached at last perilously near to the verge of empti144 NINETEENTH CENTURY PAINTING ness and lack of interest . It is always saved by decorative fitness and by great beauty of tone and quiet colour . In our day France has produced much bad decoration as well as some good , but in the Hemicycle of the Sorbonne it has left to future ages an undoubted masterpiece . America 's serious contribution to the art of the world has been made mainly in the last quarter of the century . Our earliest painters were entirely British in training , and some of them became British in nationality as well . Stuart , Copley , West , and Allston are merely second-rate painters of the English school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was a pupil of Couture and greatly influenced by Millet . He was a man of powerful personality , but what he has left behind him is extremely fragmentary . His contemporary , George Fuller , was a self-educated genius who , in spite of an insufficient training , and through a strange technique , gave glimpses of a valid talent . These are the names of greatest importance until the awakening caused by the Centennial Exposition of 1876 and the return to this country shortly thereafter of the American students from Paris and Munich studios . The work of these younger men was , for some time , reflective of that of their foreign masters , and American exhibitions showed in succession the latest fashions of foreign work . The International Exposition of 1900 for the first time triumphantly demonstrated to the // world that a real American school exists , and that it is certainly second only to the French . Yet of the artists whose work makes up this showing the two most distinguished are men to whom America can make but slight and doubtful claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . at large rather than to that of art in America . A contemporary of Manet and an exhibitor with him in the famous Salon des Refuses of 1863 , he never returned to America , but lived in Paris or London , surviving long enough to see work which was first laughed at finally accepted as among the most accomplished of the century . Always intensely individual , hardly a draughtsman or a colourist , and least of all a naturalist , he devoted his art to refinements of tone and delicate division of space . His work is now as indiscriminately praised as it was formerly attacked , bait his best things have an abiding charm , and he is to-day one of the most widely influential of modern painters . John Sargent is even less American than Whistler , for , though of American parentage , he was born abroad and his training was , as his art remains , wholly French . His sense of colour is , like that of most French painters , rather mediocre , and beauty of tone is not especially his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing , as expressed by planes rather than by lines , and a wonderful manual dexterity . These two qualities , in combination , have made him one of the most brilliant of modern tech146 NINETEENTH CENTURY PAINTING nicians , and , added to them , a strong sense of character has made him perhaps the first of living portrait painters . No other of the many able and clever Americans residing abroad has reached the degree of distinction attained by these two , nor has any of them , unless it be Mr. Vedder , given any distinctively national or personal note . It has been otherwise with painters who have either remained at home , or , once their apprenticeship finished , have returned to this country and have been forced to rely upon themselves . Two Americans , Inness and Wyant , will surely take high rank among the landscape painters of the century ; the first a master of passionate and powerful colour , the second a gentler and more delicate nature ; both were influenced by the men of Barbizon , yet each struck a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as personal to add to the art of the world . With the landscape painters also may most conveniently be classed one more intensely American than either of these , Winslow Homer . Possessing no foreign training , showing no foreign influence , always himself , Homer has steadily pursued his way , attaining year by year more nearly to his own ideal . His drawing is not always sure , his colouring is rather neutral , his handling is never brilliant , but a strong personality marks everything he does , and figure or landscape is seen with a true artist 's vision . No marines ever painted give a greater sense of the // weight and power of water than do his , and he has painted some figure-pieces of marvellous vigour . After these came a whole school of younger men who have absorbed the training of Europe and have felt all contemporary influences , but whose work in accent , as in subject , remains American , and who are to-day the most vital landscape painters in the world . Among them may be specially mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by French methods , the second by Dutch , but each an individual artist of great force . That America has something to say in figure painting as well as in landscape is evident when one thinks of the exquisite sentiment of Thayer , the scholarly and clean-cut drawing of Brush , the delicate charm of Dewing , and the brilliant craftsmanship of Chase . In the work of these men and their fellows there is a sincerity , a scorn of sensationalism , a true pursuit of art for its own sake , that are rare in the painting of to-day . Finally , America has done and is doing something interesting and valuable in pure decoration . Years ago John La Farge , whose work in stained glass is as new in kind as it is supreme in merit , so that he may almost be called the inventor of a new art , did some admirable painting in Trinity Church , Boston , as he has since done in other places . After that , little was attempted until the Chicago World 's Fair of 1893 gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could do in that line . // Since then one public building after another has been decorated with paintings , and the results are familiar to us all . Such men as Simmons , Blashfield , Mowbray , and H. O. Walker have each developed a decorative style of his own , while they have managed to work together and to preserve the general harmony of a great decorative scheme in a way which contrasts most favourably with the decoration of such foreign buildings as the Paris hotel de ville or the Pantheon . If we have produced no single work of the value of some of those by Baudry or Puvis de Chavannes , yet our mural painting has been marked by reticence , dignity , and true decorative spirit . Since the wave of the Renaissance first started from Italy , the country last reached by it has been the country that at any time has produced the best art . The wave has barely reached us , and it is not impossible that it is to America we must look for the best art of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of that artistic movement known as Preraphaelitism comes to be written , a very large place in it will be given to a never very celebrated or very successful artist who died , almost in obscurity , on October 6 , 1893 . Whether or not Ford Madox Brown may properly be considered the true founder of Preraphaelitism , his grandson , Ford Madox IIueffer , is amply justified by the facts in calling him its precursor . An older man than any of the " brothers , " the chosen master of Rossetti , and the adviser ( if not strictly the master ) of Hunt , his influence upon these young men must have been great . He never joined the Brotherhood himself , and several reasons have been given for it . There is even a contradiction of memory as to whether he was ever asked to do so . A comparison of the statements of Brown himself , of Holman Hunt , and of others would seem to show that if he was not formally asked , it was because he did not care to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience , which rendered him somewhat less enthusiastic than his young friends , and gave him a 149 // distrust of brotherhoods and formal associations as leading to " cliquishness . " In his art he was for many years more Preraphaelite than almost any of the Brotherhood , and he remained a Preraphaelite longer than any of them , except Holman Hunt , who has never changed . Ford Madox Brown was born in Calais in the year 1821 , the son of a retired purser of the British Navy , who resided abroad for reasons of economy . He early showed artistic tastes , and began the formal study of painting as a pupil of Gregorius of Bruges at the age of fourteen . In 1838 he became a pupil of Wappers at Antwerp , and it was the knowledge then acquired that gave him prestige , when he went to England , as a technician and as one who " was up in the Belgian School . " On just how much technical achievement this reputation was based it is difficult for one to say who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionised afterwards that his early training in painting went for nothing . Such of his drawings as have been reproduced are almost incredibly feeble in handling . How he learned to paint may be well understood from his own words : " Those were the days , " he says , " when my respected master , the late Baron Wappers , having been commissioned by his Government to paint the Belgian Revolution , ' had , for speed 's sake , two of his pupils , whose duty it was to smear in with their hands , early in the morning , as much asphalturn as // he could afterwards cover in with revolutionary heroes during the remainder of the long summer day . . . . These were the days when Wilkie 's best works were coated with asphaltum , which has since made fissures all over them ; when Hilton 's Sabrina was so flooded with it that it now has to be hung alternately right side and wrong side upwards to prevent the figures from entirely running to the top or bottom of the picture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years there . He went into no school , but worked for and by himself . At this time Delaroche was the recognised head of the French school , and his style seems to have influenced the young Englishman in the choice of subject and general manner of treatment of such pictures as the " Mary Queen of Scots going to Execution , " which was painted at this time . There seems to be no evidence that he was influenced by Delacroix and the colourists , or that he ever heard of the great landscape school that was then growing up in France under the influence of his countryman , Constable . It seems to have been entirely of his own motion , and without knowing anything of parallel attempts , that he then made his first efforts at realistic lighting , and tried , in his " Manfred , " to paint figures in the open air as they would really look . He was not successful and soon began to " study Rembrandt " and went back to his bitumen . In 1840 he paid his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady who became his first wife and who died in 1845 . In 1844 there was another short visit to England , and the exhibition at Westminster Hall of his cartoons of " Harold , " " Adam and Eve , " and the " Spirit of Justice , " which seem to have impressed no one but Haydon , who , if a bad artist , was sometimes a good critic . It was the failing health of his wife which led to the voyage to Italy that was the turningpoint in Madox Brown 's career . Three important things happened during this voyage . First , he saw the Holbeins at Basle , and was deeply impressed by their unshrinking and absolute realism ; second , he met in Rome the " Nazarenes , " Cornelius and Overbeck , and his attention was drawn to their medi:evalising theories and their use of the term Preraphaclite ; third , he saw the work of the early Italian painters . The results of these influences were shown almost immediately on his return to England , where , his wife having died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1845 . W. Bell Scott has given us a picture of the state of art in England shortly before Brown 's arrival . When , in the spring of 1837 , at the age of twentyfive , he broke away from his father 's engraving business in Edinburgh and went up to London , " a shy youth with poetry in his pocket and little knowledge of the world and himself , " the younger men who were kept out of the Academy and were constantly attempting to start an opposition exhibition were such as // Frith , and others whose names are less known . Eastlake was President of the Royal Academy . Turner was " the joke of the public , " Constable " near his end and never a favourite , " and Etty and Maclise were about the best of the artists . There was little chance to exhibit , little patronage , and less interest in art . Landscape-painting was " below zero , " and figure-painting was largely confined to the illustration in paint of popular novels , such as " lion Quixote " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Annuals , and the Book of Beauty style of work was all that was wanted . Kenny Meadows had done two drawings for Heath 's Annual , representing Anne Page and her mother , and Heath insisted that Mrs. Page should be as young as her daughter : " I do n't care about her maternity , or Shakspere , or anything else . You must not make her more than twenty , or nobody will buy ! If you wo n't , I must get Frank Stone to do her instead . All Frank Stone 's beauties are nineteen exactly , and that 's the age for Inc . ' , It was to such artistic surroundings that Brown came , and among them that he began to develop his new ideas . The " Chaucer at the Court of Edward III. , " begun in Rome , was not finished until 1851 , but in 1846 he painted his " Portrait of Mr. Bamford " and in 1847 his " Wycliffe Reading his Translation of the Bible to John of Gaunt . " His own account of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than could anything else the temper in which it was undertaken . The italics would seem to be the artist 's own : " It is , " he says , " the first evidence of an entirely new direction of thought and feeling on my part . . . . To those who value facile completeness and handling above painstaking research into nature , the change must appear inexplicable and provoking . Even to myself , at this distance of time , this instinctive turning back to get around by another road seems remarkable . But in reality it was only the inevitable result of the want of principle , or rather confliction of many jarring principles , under which the student had to begin in those days . Wishing to substitute simple imitation for scenic effectiveness , and purity of natural colour for scholastic depth of tone , I found no better way of doing so than to paint what I called a Holbein of the nineteenth century . I might perhaps have done so more effectively , but stepping backwards is stumbling work at best . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Preraphaelitism than is here done . " Simple imitation " and " purity of natural colour " ( i. e. , crudeness and brightness ) were its great aims , and were first formulated by a man who was , to all intents and purposes , a foreigner , newly landed in London , and who knew not Ruskin . The other great mark of the movement , its mediaevalising // tendency and the worship of the early Italian painters , is shown with equal clearness in the " Wycliffe . " Here we have a composition arranged under a pointed arch , the principal figure bolt upright and squarely facing the spectator in the exact middle of the canvas , and supported by subordinate groups to right and left ; a diffused light with no dark shadow anywhere , the figures being relieved against a distant landscape and pale clear sky ; closely studied medieval costume ; and heads evidently copied directly from nature . If this is not a Preraphaelite picture , it is certainly very near it , and it was the exhibition of this picture which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madox Brown 's pupil . It is worth noting in passing that the letter was signed " Gabriel C. Rossetti , " Rossetti not having as yet adopted the Dante which afterwards figured in his signature . It was in Madox Brown 's studio that Rossetti was set at the accurate copying of still life , which he did not at all like , and it was to Madox Brown that he came , in 1848 , " laughing , or at least more or less joking , about some discovery of Hunt 's . It turned out that they were the reproductions of Orcagna 's frescoes at Pisa . " . . . I told him it was all nonsense to laugh at them ? they were the finest things in the world , and he 'd far better go and look at them again ; and , of course , he said just what I did after he 'd thought about it . // " As to the name Preraphaelite , when they began talking about the early Italian masters , I naturally told them of the German P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know , but they took it . " So was the Brotherhood founded , and the only reason given by Hunt for Brown 's never having been formally invited to become a member , besides his age and the unpopularity of his works 0 ) , ) , is " that his works had none of the minute rendering of natural objects that the P. R. 's , as young men , had determined should distinguish their works . " Scott tells us how he met Rossetti and Hunt about this time . It was in Holman Hunt 's first studio in Cleveland Street , where these two were working at their first Preraphaelite pictures ? those which , with Millais 's " Supper at the House of Isabella , " were to make known the new doctrine , and familiarise the public with the three mystic letters . The scene is most characteristic . Rossetti 's picture was " The Girlhood of Mary Virgin , " and he was painting it " in oils with water-colour brushes , as thinly as in water-colour , on canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as smooth as cardboard , and every tint remained transparent . " Hunt was working at his " Rienzi , " and Scott " was made to observe that the chain mail in his picture was articulated perfectly , and as an armourer would construct it , every ring holding four other rings in its grasp ? a miracle of elaboration . " He had even " introAND // duced a fly , as we see done in some early Flemish portraits , to show how minute the artist 's hand could go " From this one glimpse into the Cleveland Street studio almost the whole history of the Brotherhood may be divined . The intellectual influence of Millais , the third of the original trio , seems to have been nil , and his role was that of the clever executant and populariser of the movement . Rossetti plus Hunt is the formula of Preraphaelitism . The four other " brothers " may be neglected altogether . The only one of them who ever did anything in art was Woolner the sculptor , and it is difficult to see que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the real originators of the movement ever had any such clearly formulated body of doctrine as Ruskin afterwards attributed to them ; but the tendencies of their work are clearly attributable to the two personalities of Rossetti and Hunt influenced by Brown and working upon each other and upon Millais . Three men more fundamentally unlike it would be difficult to imagine . Hunt was the man of iron will and indomitable perseverance , with little natural talent , making his way against all sorts of difficulties by dint of determination and unremitting labour ; religious and somewhat sombre of temper , a realist by nature , and too narrow of vision and limited of education to find realisation in anything but the minute pursuit of actual fact without regard to visual // truth of aspect . Rossetti was the brilliant , flighty , poetic nature , utterly intolerant of continuous effort , unable to acquire any serious training , and to the end an amateur of genius ; thoroughly egotistic , but possessed of great personal fascination and influence over others , a spoiled child ; without deep religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic " from the purely picturesque and aesthetic point of view . Millais was the brilliant executant , the " crack student " of the Royal Academy , handsome , easy , good-natured , destined from the beginning to worldly success , only temporarily influenced by the other two and sure to break away from that influence very soon . From Hunt 's uncompromising realism , added to Rossetti 's choice of subject , sprang Preraphaelitism as we know it . It is not by accident that , in illustrating the doctrine , it is to Hunt 's pictures that Ruskin constantly recurs , for he was the real exemplar of the doctrine , and remains to-day the one true Preraphaelite painter . Absolute fidelity to fact , plain literalness of conception , scorn of prettiness and composition , endless painstaking and thorough realisation of detail ? these things , which constituted Preraphaelitism as Ruskin understood it , were Hunt 's natural language . For a year or two Rossetti niggled and stippled , but with him his stippling was sheer inability to paint otherwise , and he felt it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Found , " // and succumbed in despair : the picture was never finished . Then he gave up exhibiting , gave up painting in oil , gave up painting from nature , and did little water-colour drawings , mediaeval in subject , brightly coloured like illuminations , and done entirely out of his head and without models . By 1859 wo find him taking up oils again and painting life-size , with the distinct purpose of avoiding " the niggling process " and of " learning to paint . " He never did quite learn to paint , and his work always remained amateurish and feeble ; but it is no longer Preraphaelite in anything but name . Such a picture as the " Lady Lilith " differs from any other painting only by virtue of the personal and temperamental characteristics of its author and by the feeblenesses and mannerisms of imperfect training . It shows the influence of Titian much more than that of any primitive painter , in its technical aim . As for Millais , his Preraphaelitism was a temporary phase of his development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which most painters have passed . He was the only one of the three possessed of talent , and the pictures painted under the influence of the other two were those which gave the school its eclat and what popularity it had . Though Hunt was the true Preraphaelite , he has had little influence and has raised up no followers . It is not difficult to see now that the movement was a false one , and based on the denial of art . In trying // to " go back to nature " from the false and feeble art of that time , Hunt went so far that no art was left at all . His hardness , rigidity , ungainliness , painful elaboration , shocking crudity of colour , can have an attraction for few mortals ; and Preraphaelitism as he and Ruskin understood it was predestined to sterility . The pseudo-mediaevalism of Rossetti had a different fate . He , at least , was an artist if not a painter , and his personal fascination and a certain charm in his mannered and faulty work exercised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so it happens that the only school founded by the brotherhood of painters who preached absolute fidelity to nature as their cardinal doctrine , is precisely the most artificial and antinatural school of art to-day existing , and that the Neo-Preraphaelites , sprung directly from the only genius in the old Brotherhood , practise the very reverse of what that Brotherhood preached . Their art is languorously affected , determinedly archaistic , wonderfully elaborated , but never true to fact . If in the one particular of minuteness of detail Madox Brown was not yet a Preraphaelite when the Brotherhood was founded , he soon became one to the fullest extent ; and no more thoroughly Preraphaelite paintings exist than " The Last of England " and " Work . " Neither can any clearer insight into Preraphaelite methods be gained than from the perusal of some passages of Madox Brown 's diary . His // phrase of " stepping backwards " describes Preraphaelite practice perfectly . Preraphaelitism , as practised by its founders and as advocated by Ruskin , was essentially an appeal to the boy or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition , and of art , and the attempt to produce a literal imitation of nature by exact analysis and by a return to the most primitive of technical methods . Their practice was more important than their theory , and this was to paint each object separately , direct from nature , on a pure white ground , proceeding thus until the last object was finished and the last bit of canvas covered , when the picture was complete . Justness of effect and beauty of tone are impossible by such a manner of working , but a certain glaring brightness of colour and a hard glitter of detail are gained . The savage love of bright colour and the savage desire for clearly recognisable facts are both satisfied . At the very time when the men of Barbizon were producing their splendidly synthetic and essentially artistic work , the most serious artists of England were struggling with the impossible task of reforming art by reforming it altogether . On Thursday , the 19th of June , 1856 , Madox Brown " came home and debated what I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . " One of these was afterwards called " Stages of Cruelty , " but is generally referred to by the artist , for obvious reasons , as " the Lilac Leaves . " He had // decided upon the picture on Friday night , and this is the account of the first day 's work : " Saturday , 21st ? After some bother and delays , began by three and worked till eight at the garden one ; painted eight bricks and some leaves . " Observe that , in this case , there can not have been even an outline on the canvas . The " eight bricks " were painted all by themselves . A month later ( July 19 ) he has " A great deal of trouble in arranging the leaves at the side of the head , pinning on fresh ones where they are blighted . " It is only on the next day that he begins " designing the two lovers . " The picture was finally laid aside and not finished till 1891 . " The Last of England " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the flesh was being painted , on cold days , " " to ensure the blue appearance that flesh assumes under such circumstances . " The result on the painter 's health was disastrous ; that upon the pictures is best given in his grandson 's own words : " When one stands before the picture " Work " , it is difficult for the eye to find a point on which to settle . The colour , too , is not colourist 's colour , ' at least as I understand the words ; it is wanting in harmoniousness , disturbing , and what not . One might almost say that both pictures " Work " and " The Last of England " had been painted with the then newly discovered aniline dyes . " Such was the true Preraphaelitism of the early fifties , and of its exemplars Holman Hunt is the only r // survivor , as he was the only one who continued to work in that manner . With the founding of the " Firm " ( Morris , Marshall , Falkner &; Co. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic movement instead of a realistic one . Madox Brown was here also something of a " precursor , " having been in the habit for some years of designing furniture for himself and his friends . He was one of the founders of the " Firm , " and furnished it with many cartoons for stained glass . As a result , after 1865 , " his pictures became rather essentially decorative than essentially realist . " As a member of the English aesthetic school he is best known , and in that capacity he has been a good deal overshadowed by the greater artistic and poetic feeling of Rossetti and the vastly greater ability of Burne-Jones . It may be doubted whether , in the words of his biographer , " this stage of his art was nearly as much his own as was the realistic one . " Yet in this later vein he produced such works as " Cordelia 's Portion " and " Elijah and the Widow 's Son , " to name but two , which have great and serious qualities , if also grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine dramatic feeling and emotional expression . His colour is also said to have attained great splendour and depth . His drawing was always tentative and uncertain , and in his effort for dramatic expression he was tolerant of strange awkwardnesses and ungainly attitudes . Another fault was an inexplicable // fondness for great bundles of crinkled drapery that destroy all simplicity of mass and dignity of line . His last years were devoted to a series of decorative paintings for the Manchester town hall , which show in their composition all the merits and all the faults of his later manner . Of their effectiveness as decoration one who has not seen them in place has no right to judge . To quote his grandson and biographer , in conclusion : " His work was never suave , never quite complete ; but it was vigorous and honest to the end , always instinct with a noble feeling for style , and , within its wide but well-defined limit , as thorough as possible . " MILLAIS JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS , beginning as a rebel , ended as the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of savage criticism to become the most popular painter ever known and the darling of the great British public . From " Johnny " Millais , P. R. B. , to Sir John Millais , P. R. A. , was a vast stride ; and from the painter of " Ophelia " and " The Huguenot " to the painter of " Bubbles " seems , at first sight , an even longer one , though critics have differed as to its direction . To us , however , looking back from the vantage ground of the present , it seems certain that Millais was essentially the same from beginning to end , that his ultimate triumph was always assured , and that the only wonder in the matter is , that it should have taken the British public so long to discover that he wits the man for its money . As a matter of fact , it did not take the public as long to find this out as it did the critics , and the engraving of " The Huguenot " was selling like hot cakes while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Everett Millais was born at Southampton , June 8 , 1829 , of a family of poor gentlefolk from the Island of Jersey , where much of his childhood was 165 // passed . He exhibited a remarkably precocious talent for drawing , and was taken to London at the age of eight to begin the serious study of art , entered the schools of the Royal Academy at ten , and had taken every prize that that institution offered to students before he was twenty . It was this pet of the schools , this predestined Academician , who in 1848 joined with the earnest but obscure Hunt and the flighty and untrained Rossetti to found the Preraphaelite Brotherhood , and unfurled the banner of revolt against accepted methods of painting . Preraphaelitism was a complex movement , compounded of Rossetti 's poetic medievalism and Hunt 's religious mysticism and naturalism , and it was only with this last element of it that Millais had any real sympathy . His " Isabella " was influenced by Rossetti , and his " Carpenter 's Shop " by Hunt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and became merely a manner of painting . He was much the most brilliant executant of the set and a splendid fighter , and therefore naturally bore the brunt of the opposition aroused by the movement . There are , however , not wanting signs that the opposition was less serious than has been thought . The fact is lightly passed by , in his son 's life of the painter , that in 1850 , the year of " The Carpenter 's Shop , " when the " storm of execration " was at its loudest , Millais was elected an Associate of the Academy , and the election annulled only because it was // discovered that he was not yet of the requisite age . In 1852 came " The Huguenot , " the first picture definitely his own ; and in 1853 , when " The Proscribed Royalist " and " The Order of Release " appeared , the Academy capitulated . It had taken only five years to force its doors , and Millais was an A. R. A. at twenty-four . Meanwhile it is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for what still seem very fair prices . The " bullying " of the press really did him no harm , and brought out Ruskin in his defence . He was the most discussed and therefore the most famous artist of the day . In his letters he grumbles much and talks of efforts to " put him down , " and seems to dream of a conspiracy against him . The fact is , rather , that few young artists have had so easy and rapid a road to success . How soon he began to outgrow the primitive methods of his school is shown by W. Bell Scott 's record of a conversation with him , " a year , or perhaps two , " after the first visit to Hunt 's studio in 1847-8 : " I was in Millais 's studio , " says Scott , " when I observed a print hanging there framed . It was an Italian engraving , inscribed From Nature , ' by Agostino Lauro at Turin , dated 1845 , and called ' Meditacione , ' representing a girl seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nay , the two halves of every leaf , radiating from the // centre fibre even of those in shade , were elaborated , and the pattern on the dress of the girl was in every part exactly made out . I was arrested by this print when Millais quitted his easel and approached . Ha ! you 've observed that , have you ? that 's P. R. B. enough , is it not ? We have n't come up to that yet . But , ' he went on , I for one wo n't try ; it 's all nonsense ; of course nature 's nature , and art 's art , is n't it ? One could not live doing that ! ' " About the same time he said to Mrs. Combe : " People had better buy my pictures now , when I am working for fame , than a few years later , when I shall be married and working for a wife and children . " How far the fact that one " could n't live doing that " influenced the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was within two years of his marriage that his break with Preraphaelitism began to show itself in " Sir Isumbras , " and it was more clearly accented by " The Vale of Rest " and " Apple Blossoms " in 1859 . For a time the fight was on again in all its fury , with Ruskin now at the head of the enemy . These pictures were still too Preraphaelite for his old opponents , while they had ceased to be Preraphaelite enough for his old friends , and nobody was pleased . The " Apple Blossoms , " perhaps one of his most artistic productions , was one of the most unpopular pictures he ever painted . This time , however , the opposition collapsed even more quickly ; " The Black Brunswicker " of the next year becoming // vastly popular . In 1863 appeared " My First Sermon , " the earliest of his pictures in what may be called his " Christmas Graphic " style , and he was made a full Academician at once . Madox Brown lived and died an unsuccessful man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aesthetic cult . Holman Hunt , by dint of dogged persistence and by his appeal to the religious sentiment , worked his way through long neglect to a partial popularity . Millais was , almost from first to last , a favourite of the British Philistine , because he saw with the eyes , thought with the brain , and felt with the soul of the average Briton . Mr. A. L. Baldry says , speaking of " Chill October " and its successors : " The unquestionable popularity that Millais gained by his excursions into landscape was certainly due to the fact that his observation was of t h e ordinary and everyday kind " ; and a little later : " Ile never could be ranked among the inspired painters of the open air , nor could he ever be said t o have dealt exhaustively with the problems presented by natural phenomena . He remained untouched by 1 he subtleties of atmospheric effect , by the varieties of momentary illumination , or by the fleeting glories of aerial colour , which provide the student of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is very acute criticism , and it is surprising that the author of it did not see that , in everything else , as in landscape painting , Millais 's " observation // was of the ordinary and everyday kind , " and that his phenomenal success was due as much to the fact that he never puzzled his public by seeing what it could not see , as to the fact that he saw and rendered ' what it did see with wonderful accuracy . In the " Life and Letters , " by John Guille Millais , we are given many illuminating glimpses of Preraphaelite methods of study and production . The formula was something like this . One took a canvas into the country and found something that interested him as a background . Often the subject of the picture was still undetermined , and always the figures were , at most , lightly outlined on a white ground . Leaving a space for the figures , the background was painted " inch by inch , " as Ruskin used to say . It might take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as changes of light , and the painter who could work eleven hours a day " under an umbrella throwing a shadow scarcely larger than a halfpenny " without noticing that the sun had changed its position , was not likely to be bothered by the succession of blossoms . When the picture was " done , all but the figures , " it was taken to London , and there , in a studio , the figures were painted with equal minuteness from life . And this was supposed to be truth to nature . It is not until " The Proscribed Royalist " that we hear of any effort to paint the figure in the same light as the landscape , the effort consisting in letting in the sun through a window . In this case // Millais also rigged up a lay-figure on the spot to get the draperies right with their surroundings . He does not seem to have done the like very often . Brown 's conscientiousness in painting out of doors in cold weather to get the purple colour of the flesh was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millais gradually abandoned . The painter who had said , in 1851 , " Great success blunts enthusiasm , and little by little men get into carelessness , which is construed by idiotic critics into a nobler handling , " could say of Ruskin in 1859 , " He does not understand my work , which is now too broad for him to appreciate , and I think his eye is only fit to judge the portraits of insects " ; but the change was in reality only a superficial one , and the " breadth " was that of brush-stroke only , not of point of view . The truth is that Millais was , all his life , equally insensible to truth of values and beauty of tone ; to the larger truths of nature as to the greater qualities of art . The lack of minute finish in his later work only renders more evident the limitation of view that was always there . It is not more essentially ? only more visibly ? artificial than his early work . But if Millais never had any sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for drawing as such . He drew fairly well as regards accuracy to fact , but there is nothing in his work to show that he ever cared for line or form as a means of artistic expression . In fact , he never cared for any purely artistic quality be- // cause it was artistic . He was a typical Englishman , with the Englishman 's love of sport , of out-of-doors , of the family , and of sentiment . He loved a landscape because it was a good spot for fishing or shoot- ' ing , an incident because it was heroic or sentimental , a woman because she was handsome , and a child because it was a pretty child ; he never cared for or ' thought of what he could make of it in a work of art ? the grace of an outline , the intricacy of a pattern , the dignity of a silhouette , or the harmony of tone and colour . He looked at landscape like a game-keeper , and it has been said that he saw children " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutiae of realisation , and in later days he revelled in the sleight-of-hand of suggestion , but it was always representation that he cared for , never art ; and representation of mere fact , never of effect . He has been much blamed for the falling off of imagination and invention in his later work ? it seems to me , unjustly . He had never had much , and what little he had was illustrative , not pictorial , imagination . His tendency to produce his result with as little trouble as possible showed itself at least as early as " The Huguenot . " He had meant merely to paint two lovers , but Hunt persuaded him that the motive was not sufficiently dignified , and that some historical episode must be suggested . The white scarf did the business and a picture resulted that took the public taste . As Mr. Monkhouse says , in " British Contem- // porary Artists " : " The picture touched the dearest sentiments of the English , it appealed to their sense of beauty , to their affections , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions . If Millais had thought it all out beforehand . . . he could not have chosen a subject more attractive to the visitors of the Royal Academy . " The type of picture once established was adhered to , and " The Huguenot " was followed by " The Proscribed Royalist , " " The Order of Release , " and " The Black Brunswicker . " Gradually it dawned upon Millais that even this much of invention was wore than was necessary , and that one figure and a title ( if the figure were that of a pretty woman ) would answer the purpose ; and he painted " The Gambler 's Wife " and " Yes or No . " What did it matter ? All he cared for himself was the model and the sleight-ofhand . " If I were a rich man , " he said , " I would pay Nome one to paint pictures for me , and spend my time in putting high lights in the boots . " His executive talent nearly reached the level of high art at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Bischoffskim " are so brilliantly executed as to be nearly great . At worst it degenerated into a wormy , stringy bundling that is distressing . On the other hand , his Inter attempts at grand art , such as " Jephthah " and N Victory , 0 Lord ! " are lamentable failures . Better One " Cherry Ripe " than a hundred such historical pictures . After all , there is subject enough in // " Cherry Ripe " for a Sir Joshua , or even for a Velasquez , if only there were the artist eye to see it . But if Millais was very little of an artist and only half a painter , he was an illustrator pur sang . Trollope said that " Orley Farm " was the best illustrated of any novel ever published , and probably he was right . Millais 's merits and faults equally helped to make him a good illustrator , and in Trollope he found the man he was best fitted to illustrate . The author gave the ideas , and the artist found the forms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less he bothered about composition , the better . All Millais 's illustrative work shows his remarkable fitness to become eye and hand to another man 's brain . He did not have persistent visions of his own which came between himself and the page , to lead him , as they led Rossetti , into fantastic embroideries upon the text . What Millais saw in his reading was just what the average Englishman sees there , and that he put down quite clearly and comprehensively . In Trollope he found a man of his own type ? an average Briton like himself ? and we have Trollope 's own word for it that Millais 's drawings are an exact transcript of what the author meant . There was one other field in which Millais 's preoccupation with representation rather than art , and with fact rather than with aspect , was of service to him ? that of portraiture . The very greatest portraits are works of art also , but there is a level at which artistic // preoccupation hinders veracity . Millais will not rank with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style or line or tone to stand between him and a clear perception of the sitter . In his portraits of women and children he did , indeed , allow the desire of prettiness to master him ; but in his best portraits of men he is earnest and veracious , and some of England 's greatest men will probably be remembered as he has represented them . The late President of the Royal Academy always knew what his public liked , and always gave it them , while he had sufficient skill as a technician to merit and to retain the respect of his professional rivals . He was far from a great artist , but he was a most industrious and-honourable man , and probably deserved ail that ham- received . If there were , perchance , truer artists who were neglected while he succeeded , they had their reward in the doing of their work and the hope of a posthumous immortality , even if their portraits do not hang in the Uffizi . BURNE-JONES WHEN an original artist has at last mastered his public and compelled recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or malice that has delayed the recognition ; but we are usually wrong . The world is not so unready to recognise good work when it is once done , but it is natural and necessary that it should require some definite proof that the work is good . Certainly Burne-Jones had little to complain of . If he was ridiculed for some of his mannerisms and peculiarities , he found patrons from the first and was the object of as much enthusiastic admiration as ridicule . Much of the criticism on his earlier work was entirely deserved , and even in his best and most mature productions there are weaknesses and mannerisms which it is perfectly right and natural to point out . Nay , a critic is not necessarily either foolish or malicious because he finds these peculiarities so offensive to his taste as to overbalance his enjoyment of the merits which few would deny . He simply occupies one of the two positions one or other of which every one instinctively takes towards every novelty . Burne-Jones 's earliest pictures were painted under the influence of Rossetti and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of any sort ; and they show all the imitative tendency and technical weakness that might be expected from such a beginning . The drawing is often childish in the extreme , the execution laboured and painful , and the imitation of Rossetti 's I ypes and manner very marked . Gradually the imitation becomes less noticeable , and the artist 's own style disengages itself ; while , by dint of long and serious study , the drawing becomes elegant and refined and the workmanship , though remaining elaborate and detailed in the extreme , becomes broader and more assured . With the " Chant d'Amour , " the " Wine of Circe , " and other pictures painted in the sixties , he becomes definitely the artist as we know him . Thence he grew steadily more accomplished , and also accented wore and more that tendency to archaism which is so strongly marked in him and which has given offence to his critics . Ile had not publicly exhibited for many years when the Grosvenor Gallery was opened in 1877 and the " Angels of Creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beguiling of Merlin , " and several minor or unfinbed works were shown . Works of so much power d so different from the general run of painting naturally excited much discussion , and it is impossito deny that there were faults enough to justify e scoffers . Punch 's description of the figure of Vivien as " at least twelve heads high " is somewhat no exaggeration , but she certainly is preternatur- // ally tall , and both her figure and that of Merlin are , or appear , impossibly posed and curiously drawn . Neither could a woman well get her gown into such folds as Vivien 's , or walk in it if she did . From the ' naturalistic , which is the natural , point of view , the picture is absurd enough . Yet there were merits in these works of a high and rare kind . There was a great power in the arrangement of lines and great feeling for the beauty and quality of the line in itself , endless invention in intricate and charming detail , a strange mastery of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of head , constantly recurring , with the same wistful , wide-eyed , melancholy look , reminds one of the " waters wan " that appear at such brief intervals in the verse of Burne-Jones 's great friend , William Morris . The " Angels of Creation " shows the painter , perhaps , at his very best . The mastery of composition revealed in the constantly varying treatment of the same simple motive , the gradual crowding of the narrow panel as figure after figure is added without the harmony of line or mass ever being disturbed for a moment , the curious invention of plaited fold and woven wings that make his angels seem like strange feathered creatures to whom flying is more natural than walking ? all this is wonderful and inimitable . True , the graceful hands and feet are unnaturally long and slender and somewhat boneless ; true , that . light and shade are absent and the figures are im- // mersed in water rather than in air , so clear and unatmospheric is the effect ; true , the sentiment is somewhat lackadaisical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is art of a highly artificial kind , unrobust and stifling , and that one feels in it as i n a hothouse filled with flowers , and longs for a breath of " cellar air " ; but it is art , and art of singular power and perfection within its limits , and its qualities are precisely those ordinarily lacking in the naturalistic and wholly picturesque art of to-day . No wonder that the French , with their legion of good painters who seem not to know what to do with the marvellous realistic power acquired through generations of research , felt that here was something new and different , and worthy of study and of all respect . If Burne-Jones had stopped here , there would be little but . praise to give him ; but in later works his archatic tendencies have carried him much farther , with grettable results . Mr. Malcolm Bell has undertaken the task of defending the artist against his critics , but he seems to have missed the point of the criticism . His defence mainly concerned with charges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also with the charge that Burne-Jones is a " literary painter . " On this last count of the indictment he may be acquitted at once . Burne-Jones is always pictorial . He is fond of elaborate allegory and a certain mysticism of thought and under-intention , but artistic expression is always // his main aim . As Leigh Hunt ( or was it Hazlitt ? ) said of " The Faery Queen , " " The allegory will not bite you , " and if the work of art is beautiful , we can perhaps forgive the artist for having a meaning . But for the other charges there seems to be more foundation . An unnamed critic has said of " The Annunciation , " " The Angel Gabriel . . . is clad in insincere draperies , copied from we know not what quaint mediaeval work , " and repeats in various forms the charge of imitation . Mr. Bell 's defence is that Burne-Jones 's draperies are not copied directly from any original , and that if any one says so he should point out the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his works , and that many of these have been exhibited , and that they show that his work is done from nature and not copied from any other artist . All of which is true , but does not in the least affect the point at issue . Burne-Jones is not accused of plagiarism , but of pastiche , which is a very different thing . One may work from nature with the intention of imitating the style of another artist , and it is this which Burne-Jones seems to have done very often . Nor is it very difficult to name the sources of some of his mannerisms . At first the style of his draperies is only vaguely Italian and fifteenthcentury . Then there is a very pronounced imitation of Mantegna . The draperies of the Vivien and others of that type show most distinctly the influence of the Mantuan master . Later , more particularly in // his designs for stained glass and in the figure of the Angel Gabriel in the picture under discussion , the I treatment is inspired by Gothic sculpture . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the mosaics which he did for the Church of the Holy Trinity at Rome , and , partly , in the " Sponsa di Libano , " he has gone back to the Byzantines for his inspiration . Now all this may be justifiable enough , but it certainly gives some cause , if not reason , for criticism . In the case of the mosaics it is certainly largely justifiable , though one may think that the imitation is pushed unnecessarily far , and that the archaic little angels , with their pointed toes , hanging down from the centre of the dome , are rather ridiculous , while the Christ : night be as severely decorative and impressive with'tit his curiously ruffled-looking gown . In the " Dies Domini , " again , the peculiar pose of the feet , with the nkles drawn together and the toes turned out , and to bad foreshortening , seems to us little less than liberate affectation without any gain whatever . In is figure , as in the " Sponsa di Libano , " the drapery , , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fold and lack of modelling . The Ration of Byzantine stiffness is pushed to an extinct in the figures of angels in the window in St. eter 's Church , Vere Street , London , where the whole figure is stretched out into impossible length and straightness , the draperies are subdivided into innumable rigid lines , and the wings are not only unnatural 18 ' 2 BURNE-JONES in form , but positively ugly and undecorative as well . The drawing of the legs of Mars in one of the designs representing the Seasons is equally meaninglessly archaic . But when all is said ? when one has fully admitted that he is imitative and mannered , that his figures are wonderfully long and thin , that his heads habitually lean forward at nearly a right angle with the spine , that his lack of early training makes his drawing of the nude feebly round and unaccented , that his repetitions of hungry eyes and hollow cheeks and prominent chins are somewhat wearisome , that his types , both of men and women , are epicene ? Burne-Jones remains one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a man of great and undoubted power and originality of design . MEISSONIER BY the average person who possesses some knowledge of modern painting , extreme minuteness of detail is probably considered as the most pronounced characteristic and the greatest merit of ' Meissonier 's art . " Finished like a Meissonier , " is a proverbial phrase with such persons , and they are apt to imagine that the qualities of eye and hand which rendered such minuteness possible , and the vast industry which achieved it , are the principal elements in Meissonier 's fame and the cause of the phenomenal price his works attained . That minuteness and laborious finish are a part of the commercial value of these works it would be absurd to deny , but it may be revived that they have practically nothing to do with the painter 's artistic reputation . Mere minutes and the evidence of labour will always have their effect on prices , but they will never make a man ember of the Institute , Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour , or President of the Societe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meissonier 's work is in reality mainly the outcome of a physical uliarity or defect ? extreme shortness of sight . In 183 // his essay on Bonnat in Van Dyke 's " Modern French Masters , " Mr. Blashfield relates how that master , sitting next to M. Maspero at a great dinner one night , said to him : " Maspero , you who are so near-sighted , tell me how does M , away down there at the foot of the table , appear to you ? ' " Well , ' replied M. Maspero , ' I see a white spot , which I know is his shirt-front , and a flesh-colored spot , which I know is his face . ' " Ah , ' cried Bonnat , how I wish my pupils could see things in that way ! ' " Now it is noticeable that the near-sighted men who really " see things in that way " never paint them so , and the reason is not far to seek . Their manner of painting is conditioned less on what they see in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " broad " work in painting ? all free and large handling ? is intended only for distant effect , and becomes unintelligible when seen near by . The near-sighted painter can not see his picture at all at the distance for which such painting is intended , and all his work is therefore calculated for close inspection , and is consequently clean , smooth , and detailed in the extreme . If the painter is exceptionally near-sighted , it may even happen that he paints pictures calculated for a nearer vision than is possible to the average human eye , and which can be seen properly only by the aid of a glass . So we have the paradox that those who // the scale , the more it must be softened and diminished . This is an absolutely indispensable rule . A life-size figure treated like one of my small ones would be unendurable . " He does not attempt to give any reason for this rule , and the effort to find one would take us too far afield . The reader must be content , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its acceptance will help in the understanding of Meissonier 's work , and of the way in which the accident of scale cooperated with the temperament of the painter to produce the style we know so well . This style was formed in all its essentials singularly early . From the very first the great little pictures seem as masterly as anything their author afterwards produced . His life was a long one , and was filled with untiring study and industry , yet he never did things better than he did at first ; he only did other things as well . How this quite prodigious mastery was attained so early is a mystery . It would almost seem as if this artist had never had to learn , had had no period of uncertainty and struggle ? had almost been born a master . His subjects change , but not his manner . From the beginning of his career to the end the conception of art is identical , the methods are the same , the achievement is almost uniform . It may even be doubted if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has left , merely because the subjects and the scale of that work are // admirably fitted for the display of his qualities and the minimising of his limitations . It is the admirable series of " Smokers " and " Readers , " " Painters " and " ' Connoisseurs , " which give the fullest measure of his powers and the least hint of his shortcomings ; which made his reputation and perhaps are likeliest to maintain it . These pictures are in the purest vein of genre painting , and immediately suggest comparison with the wonderful little masters of Holland . At first Mcissonicr was considered as a reviver of Dutch art , and that he was a great admirer of that art there can be no doubt . Upon examination , however , it soon becomes evident that the differences between him and his models are as great as the resemblances . First of these differences is a fundamental one of point of view . The Dutch masters were pure painters , and their subjects were strictly contemporary . They contented themselves with looking about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meissonier only two or three times treated contemporary subjects , and then when something intensely dramatic or historically important attracted him . You would look in vain in his work for any such record of the ordinary life of the nineteenth century as the Dutchmen have given us of that of the seventeenth . Meissonier was such a master of the antiquarianism he practised ? he managed to enter so thoroughly within the skin of his two or three favourite epochs ? that he almost deceives us at times ; but he was nevertheless // essentially an antiquarian , and therefore , his art . never has the spontaneity of the old work . Another difference is in the quality of drawing . Meissonicr was a wonderfully accurate draughtsman . His drawing is composed of equal parts of remarkably clear and accurate vision and of deep scientific acquirement . It is not the drawing of the great stylists , the masters of beautiful and significant line , but it is marvellously forceful and just . The drawing of Ter Borch is equally accurate , but seems to have no formula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems unconscious and naive in a way which that of Meissonier never approaches . Finally , in colour and in the management of light , Meissonicr can not be compared to any one of half-a-dozen Dutch painters . His tone is almost always a little hot and reddish or , as the painters say , " foxy " ; his handling a little dry . Sometimes in interiors with only one or two figures his realistic force of imitation of that which was before him almost carried him to a fine rendering even of light and colour . He had built his picture before he painted it , putting every object that was to appear upon the canvas in its proper place , and had only to copy what was directly under his eye , and he did this so well as almost to become a colourist and a luminist . It is only when he tries to paint open-air subjects and larger compositions that his defects become very apparent . His merits are all to be included in the two great // ones of thoroughness hnd accuracy . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formless or undecided or vague . His knowledge of costume and furniture was only less wonderful than his grasp of character and his perfect rendering of form . Ile was a thorough realist , with little imagination and less sense of beauty , but with an insatiable appetite for and a marvellous digestion of concrete fact . His work is amazing in its industry , but his industry never becomes mere routine . His detail is never mere finikin particularity of touch , but is patient investigation of frith . At his best he is hardly sufficiently to be admired ; but he awakens only admiration , never emotion . His drawing is absolute , his relief startling , he almost gives the illusion of nature ; but he never evokes a vision of beauty or charms one into a dream . Meissonier 's qualities are fully sufficient to account for the admiration of the public and the universal respect of his brother artists ; and as long as he was content to be a genre painter they were sufficient to make him easily the first genre painter of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " greatest genre painter of any age . " In his later work they are less sufficient . He became ambitious , he wanted to be a great historical painter , to paint a " Napoleonic ycle , " to decorate the walls of the Pantheon . He ansferred his personages to the open air , he enlarged is canvases and multiplied his figures , he attempted // violent movement . His methods , which had been admirably suited to the production of almost perfect , little pictures of tranquil indoor life , were not so adequate to the rendering of his new themes . His prodigious industry , his exhaustive accuracy , his vigour , and his conscientiousness were as great as ever , but the most exact study of nature in detail would not give the effect of open air , the most rigorous scientific analysis of the movements of the horse would not make him move , the accumulation of small figures would not look like an army . It was in vain that he built a railway to follow the action of a galloping horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what it would be like when a squadron had charged through it . What he produced may possibly be demonstrably true , but it does not look true . The best of these more ambitious works is perhaps the " 1814 . " The worst is certainly the " 1807 , " which has found a home in the Metropolitan Museum . This picture is almost an entire failure , and yet it possesses every one of the qualities which made Meissonier 's greatness in as high a degree as any earlier work . The industry , the strenuous exactness , the thoroughness , the impeccable draughtsmanship , the sharpness of relief , are all here at their greatest . The amount of labour that the picture represents is simply appalling , and it is almost all wasted because it is not the kind of labour that was wanted . On all these figures not a gaiter-button is wanting , and the total result of
