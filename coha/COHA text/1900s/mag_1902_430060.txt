 | Christian citizenship may be defined as that type of citizenship set forth in the civic teachings of Christ . He was a teacher of civics and had the soundest and most perfect doctrines and ideals of civics . The interpretation of Him into the cloister , away from the problems of our practical life , may be reckoned one of the sorest calamities inflicted upon men by superstition and fanaticism . The emancipation of His teachings from the tyranny of such folly marks a new era in the history of men . To regard Him in His relation to society as seriously as the world regards Plato and Blackstone will be the birth of a new faith and a new source of social philosophy . Nothing is more desirable than an emancipation of Christianity . It is the purpose of this paper to set in some sort of order some of the cardinal doctrines of the civic teachings of Christ . He regarded government and law as divine in their origin , and discarded the idea that they are mere evolutions of social convenience . This did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . It is the thing , not the form of it , that is divine . Government is authority and all genuine authority has a divine foundation . The outward forms and methods of this authority are matters of human choice and expedience . Viewed in this light reverence is a dominant virtue in Christian citizenship . It accords a peculiar sanctity to the functions of government , and to its claims responds with a conscientious loyalty . " Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , " is not an approval of Caesar ; but it is a sacred esteem for the thing he represented . The sentiment that withholds from the sovereign a sacred regard is the breeder of anarchy . Yet such a sentiment must in the future , as it has in the past , be joined with the idea of the secularity of government . Civic coarseness and vulgarity are as unhallowed as the covetousness that made the temple of worship a place of trade . In the civic teachings of Christ law is not a human creation but a divine order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | deliverance upon this subject , yet at all times He made prominent the idea that the will of God is the supreme and final will in universal movements . Men do not , and men can not , make law . Law is a process involved by the original will in the nature of things , and is an essential part of creation . The will that created things decided the order and limits of their actions . Civics is the last philosophy to learn this evident truth . The sciences long since learned that laws are general processes to be discovered , not processes to be created . Newton did not make gravitation , he found it : Franklin did not create electricity , he discovered it : and Morse was no more the creator of telegraphic laws than Herschel was the maker of Saturn 's rings . These were discoveries . Men may find law and apply it ; they can not originate it . But there is an assumption that society , values , and property rights are matters of human creation , and do not belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not dream of committing the folly of making a new order for the revolutions of the earth or the operations of gravity , has no hesitancy in trying to vote extra values into a metal or to create an original kingdom of commerce . There is no part of the universe without law . There is no relation of any sort that does not have its processes and issues . God as truly fixed the laws of society , of values , of trade and property rights , as He fixed the laws of the winds and the seas . It is ours to find them and obey , not to amend or repeal them . Righteousness is obedience to law , and there is a righteousness of business , of property , and of banking , as well as a righteousness of moral conduct . There is such a thing as " a government for the people , " but it is a fatal mistake to proclaim " a government of the people and by the people . " " Be it enacted " should have no fuller meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long existed . The law-maker should be a genius for discovering truth and for correctly formulating it . The supreme difficulty of the task can scarcely be estimated . To work one 's way through the complexity of relations and trace a principle through ten thousand intricacies of history and operations till the certainty of its application is assured , is a hundred-fold more difficult than to follow with a telescope a planet in the heavens till all of its movements may be reduced to mathematical calculations . The  | legislature is no place for ignorance , and the time must come when a high civilization will be as much opposed to novices and untrained legislators as it is to a street negro practicing surgery . If there may be malpractice in medicine , may there not be malpractice in law-making ? But the day of professional preparation for law makers has not yet appeared in the South . The tendency seems to show a preference for those least competent for such intricate work . Legislation is a science in which unscientific men are exercising themselves . The example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his marvellous endowments to the study of legislation as his life 's task is a worthy emphasis of the dignity of law-making and a call for a sincere faith in it . A sound system of civics must set forth the true ends of law , and these Christ taught were not restraints upon virtue , but hindrances to vice . Men should never be hindered in right action ; they should never be free in evil doing . Christian citizenship regards government as the instrument of righteousness , and can never appeal to it as an instrument of spite and revenge . A citizen 's right to appeal to , or to use , law is limited solely by the purposes of his appeal , and these purposes never transcend the purest morality . He who conceives hatreds and jealousies and uses the rights and powers of the state to pass laws or uses the judiciary to interpret them to the injury of the victims of his spite is an anarchist so bold and foul as to legalize crime and destroy righteousness from the earth . There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baser distortion , of government than this , and the state that nurses to manhood such unnatural depravity is the mother of its own destruction . When government forms an unholy alliance with the vicious elements of the state to extort tribute from virtue for the support of vice , when it taxes thrift to coddle iniquitous indolence ; when it demands that enterprise shall bring rich gifts to thriftlessness , when it forces intelligence and culture to serve a coarse ignorance ; then law is a name for anarchy and order is a name for chaos . It was this misuse of law that convicted Christ of high crimes and misdemeanors , and the same spirit of misuse that made life and property the greatest uncertainty in Rome and filled France with blood . There is , in the whole catalogue of crimes , no other so dangerous as the dis- tortion of law from the high function of conserving virtue and industry to that of protecting vice and benefiting indolence . The Christian citizen is bound by the ethics of his faith to shield the state from such unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This trend in political ideas finds nothing to warrant it in the teachings of Jesus ; and those passages from His teachings upon which the socialists rely , do riot support their creed . Socialism conceives the individual to be subordinate to the community , while the teachings of Jesus give emphasis to the individual . In socialism the community is the end : in the teachings of Jesus the individual is the end . In Christian civics the community exists for the individual , not the individual for the community . This is the only fair interpretation of His doctrine of social service which He stated thus : " If any man would save his life , let him lose it , " and " He who would be greatest , let him serve . " This is individualism , not socialism . Bishop Brooks gives this terse interpretation to these words : " He who would find himself must search for himself in the multitude . " The end is self ; the means is society . Society exists for the man as the mightiest source of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mastery . over life , but for their power to produce life . Heat , light , soil , and moisture are great , not in themselves , but in the fields of golden wheat , in the grass of the meadow , in the flower of the lawn , and in the giants of the forest . The community is not great in itself , but in the individual that springs out of it by the force of its purity and in its power to beget a great individual . Jesus never forgot that . the man is the social unit , and that he is the standard of social measurement . Society was not the thing He sought to save ; but the individual in society . To this end He interpreted all laws , all organizations , and all forces . The supreme product of the travail of the universe is an individual life . The state is not a thing to be worshipped , a thing to be served , a burden to be borne . It is a power to help , a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not calculate universal service into its ethics is in the interest of an indolent class . It is benevolence exhausting itself to produce a helpless and thriftless class , and it thwarts every worthy aim of sincere and wise benefactions ; for the only worthy aim of benevo- lence is the elevation of the beneficiary to the productive class . He who makes a man able to care for himself , is a wise benefactor ; he who trains a man to depend on charities , is a breeder of vice . All forms of socialism are out , of harmony with this cardinal idea of Christian civics . Whatever of strength , of purity , of progress , and of vigor may be in a state must come through the character and energy of the individual . Limitations fixed upon the individual 's just efforts to develop are a direct hurt to the state . You can not cripple the strongest men , weaken the wisest leaders , and impede the largest enterprises ; and still strengthen the weaker classes by the process . The strength of the strongest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that power is a crime , and weakness a virtue . He claimed universal power for Himself , but certainly this did not make Him wicked , or even dangerous to the degree of being undesirable . The scheme of modern civics which conceives the idea of distributing power so as to make it a general affair of the community makes the fundamental error of regarding power as an abstraction This is one of the ludicrous propositions of street corner civics . Power must have formal existence , and the individual is the form of all social power . This can not be changed , and its change is not a thing to be desired . In civic ethics , as well as in all other social ethics , Jesus taught that the strong should serve the weak . About this there may be no dispute ; but He did not outline the methods and forms of such service . It was no thought of His that the strong should take the products of their strength and give them as charities to the weak . If such were His meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is His meaning : He who is learned shall use his knowledge that others may know ; he who knows diseases and their cures , shall use his knowledge to cure ; he who can make fabrics shall manufacture them ; he who can invest money to profit shall invest and manage it ; he who can sing a better song , write a better book , increase the speed of a locomotive , or multiply the productive organizations of the world shall do these things ; and when such persons have thus wrought those who can not do them shall be served by those who can . Is this not being done ? Are not the strong serving the weak ? Teachers are teaching ; doctors are healing ; manufacturers are manufac- turing ; bankers are using capital ; and capitalists are putting their money together to organize banks , build railways , develop mines , and open wider business operations . Do not these things serve ? Do not these men serve ? Widows , clerks , farmers , orphans , and others invest their small holdings in bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business corporation , and the presidents of these institutions , who are the strongest of business men , become the servants of all investors , bearing their care , and burdens , and bringing returns to men who have given these labors and trials no thought . Is this not the strong serving the weak ? Is not the social order of Jesus coming to pass ? Doubtless the chief objection to all this is that the weak must pay the teacher , the doctor , the banker , the singer , the railway official , and the manufacturer for their labor . So they must , but remuneration does not change service into robbery . Should the governor of a commonwealth serve for nought in order to rank as a patriot ? There are some who think so , but he who takes into the chair of the Chief Executive of a state large learning , wise statesmanship , pure character , and a vigorous soul and gives them to the welfare of the commonwealth bears the burdens of the weak and serves them , and for his services should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak to begrudge his reward to the strong as it is for the strong to withdraw his service from the weak . All may serve in the realm of gratitude . A wise and righteous gratitude is no less a virtue than is a wise and righteous benevolence ; and to be a noble beneficiary is not less desirable than to be a noble benefactor . Christian citizenship must regard civic duties as matters of a well trained Christian conscience . These duties are not matters of convenience , of optional policies , of commercial values ; they are duties that rise out of relations to God and have in them all the force of obligations that rest upon such a holy and immovable foundation . Such duties with such motives are greater than state pride , party loyalty , or personal reputation . They carry in them the eternal necessities of righteousness toward God . They must be performed , and they must be performed in accordance with the ideals of a Christian conscience . In a government like ours , where the selection of officials is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The right to vote must always mean tremendous responsibility for the individual voter . It forces the weight of the government upon the single citizen , and separates him from the community in the exercise of a sacred function . Universal suffrage can mean nothing without an emphatic sense of personal duty . Unthinking obedience to the dictates of a community is the supreme danger of such a policy of government , for the amount of individual consciousness in a people is the measure of security to such a government as ours . Where all have the right to vote , none have a right not to vote . An election means a choice ? a government , and he who does not vote is more responsible for a bad administration than the man who voted for it . Indifference to good is more to be dreaded than active concern for evil . No man can lose a vote , it it be a conscientious expression of interest in good government . No single voter is expected to carry an election , but he is expected to be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship . It is the height of political trickery to exhort a man to vote with the winning side in order to save a ballot . A ballot behind which does not stand an honest , brave , conscientious voter is already lost ; and it should never be forgotten that a lost freeman can never cast a saving ballot . Saving citizenship is far better than saving ballots . No election can be worth the price of an outraged civic conscience . That individual freedom must exist with universal suffrage can not be overlooked . These words of Bishop Haygood clearly and forcefully express the true idea of such freedom : " I do not mean so obvious a thing as freedom from mere force ; I mean his mind as well as his body must be free . Suppose a voter at the polls , ready to cast his ballot . How is that vote determined ? By avarice , by terror , by appetite , by hatred , by any influence that determines the decision against his judgment as to what is wise , and against his conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , has unfitted him for the office and duty of a voter . " Is this not the most effective way of taking the ballot from a citizen ? Do not some who talk of saving a universal suffrage strive to destroy it by dictating its direction ? What should be the attitude of the Christian citizen to political parties ? That will depend upon the character , methods and aims  | of the parties . One thing is forever true , he can not be a partisan in the ordinary sense of the term . The Christian faith does not allow such a spirit . Intolerance , arrogance and assumption are not only non-Christian , but anti-Christian . Political parties will exist in a government like ours , but they are not greater than , nor equal to , the government . Taking care of a party is never the same thing as taking care of the government . What may be deemed wise party policies may be , and frequently are , dangerous civics . No sincere citizen can ally himself with a party that fails to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government . The Christian citizen may support a party upon the sole conditions that it is sincere in its character , wise in its policies of government , and puts forward worthy candidates for the people 's suffrage . A lack of either condition will require a repudiation of the Christian citizen 's belief as to the origin and aim of government , and his ideals of truth and honor . The danger of political parties lies in their ability to exercise a tyrannical domination over the voter . Party purity never has existed , and never will exist , where it can calculate on voting a majority on the sole ground of partisanship . " I know he is a rascal , a dangerous man , a vile man , but I will support him because my party has put him forward , " is a loyalty which no citizen , much less the Christian citizen , should dare to entertain . It is not patriotism , but partyism ; it is not freedom , but party slavery ; it is not bravery , but intolerant passion ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not noble action , but blind subserviency . No Christian citizen can trade his civic conscience , his social conscience , his domestic conscience , or his business conscience to an executive committee or to a board of directors to be used in any sort of transaction . Such a'deed is treason against God , against manhood , against purity , against everything that a man should deem holy . Where is freedom in such a serfdom ? It is a hollow sound , a base dream , a false pretense , a shameless vagabondage . Parties may exist , they may be necessary , but they should never be allowed to exist one day after they design the usurpation of a man 's freedom to love his state and show his love in the terms of his own conscientious ballot . But civic duties refer to the ordinary tasks of the state and obedience to its laws . In these things the Christian citizen is  | instructed to set an example of fidelity . In material support , in loyal regard , in matters of progress , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sentiment held by some people that no moral evil attaches to cheating the government ; and to escape taxation by undervaluing a farm , a horse , a vehicle , or any other property is deemed by some a trick to be commended for its business sagacity . The moral turpitude of such conduct admits of no doubt , and the disrepute arising from it should be commensurate with its iniquity . Obedience to law is a matter of personal character , and not a matter of much legislation . The highest sanction of law is the moral integrity of the citizen . So in the last analysis civic purity is a matter of personal purity . There is something essentially wrong in a civilization that fails to keep moral purity and integrity advancing with every other fact and element of its growth . If the citizen becomes less trustworthy as social culture and material prosperity advance , and the demand is for more legislation and stronger execution of laws , it is an infallible symptom of a fatal disease . A perfect civilization must be the product and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , but capable of being , a law unto itself . Every tendency toward such a civilization must lessen , not increase , the necessity for legislation . The disposition of men to do evil is the social necessity for laws , and there must be something contradictory between such a necessity and a high civilization . The supreme product of Christian civics is an ethical conscience that makes justice a surety and righteousness a pleasure . If there be any superior value in the Christian doctrines , it lies in the fact that they build all hopes upon a regenerated individual whose moral qualities secure the integrity of society , not by outward restraints , but by inward dispositions . Such a philosophy must furnish the true theory of the final civilization . It will be constructed upon character and not upon force ; it will be permeated by a spirit of life , not by the strength of arms ; it will grow by virtue of an inward vigor , not by reason of an outward multiplication of things , and it will have its stability in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its strength , its growth , its faith , its hopes , and its final products in these resources .  | In his inaugural address President Hadley , of Yale , said : " The Yale of the future must count for even more than the Yale of the past in the work of city , state , and nation . " These are words of genuine patriotism . Any college which fulfils its mission must take a more positive and aggressive stand for the progress of civic righteousness and vindicate its rights to live and grow in the things it can do rather than in the things it may know . The times call for a new kind of leader . There are among us the movements of that subterranean swell of silent outrage and conscientious impulse which has ever been the premonition of reformation and progress . It can not be stopped . Dissolution of old orders and forms has set it , and no amount of tyranny , of intimidation , and of binding together can arrest it . Old things are passing away , and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must interpret and organize these impulses and faiths into a strong life . Never did a genuine man have a grander opportunity to do lasting things in the South than is now offered ; never was the shrewd calculator of dark schemes and traditional hatreds at a greater discount among us than now . The intelligence of the South is waking . It is waking to a new life . Ignorance can not always rule , and he who commits his destiny to the passions of ignorance is short-lived . He goes to a death from which there is no resurrection . The ignorant are the first to distrust their schemes and forsake their plans , and their desertion is generally final . They usually are wise enough to know a failure , quite learned enough to discover a trickster , and have a genius for deciding when they have enough of both . The love of one 's country is an old and holy passion , but a dramatized mimicry of it is a base play . Patriotism should be founded in truth , not in myths ; it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should find employment in sincere devotion to righteous progress , not in wild laudation for popular applause ; it should be of clear vision , detecting the false , not blind with the madness of state pride , too sensitive to confess a real lack ; it should be conscientious in duty at all times , never a barterer of honor for present gains .
