SCENE .  --  Gardens of the Palace , beautifully laid out ; fountains , flowers , vases , statues , &amp;c . Enter ST . VALLERY and FLORIMOND , R. BARON ST . VALLERY Am I to understand that your highness really wishes me to remain here ? PRINCE FLORIMOND Yes ; for are you not , my dear baron , my best friend and counsellor ! BARON ST . VALLERY I certainly have the honour of being consulted occasionally . PRINCE FLORIMOND I know what you would say ; I consult you , but seldom follow your advice . BARON ST . VALLERY I can not accuse your highness of having often done so . PRINCE FLORIMOND Oh , you must not be vexed ; remember that times and opinions have changed since you were young . BARON ST . VALLERY They have indeed ! you need not remind me of it , Prince . PRINCE FLORIMOND We should be supremely ridiculous if we introduced the obsolete customs and manners of those good old times . Do you not think so ? BARON ST . VALLERY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being , as you term it , supremely ridiculous , without having recourse to what you term obsolete customs and manners . p. 3 PRINCE FLORIMOND We shall never agree , my dear lord , therefore let us not dispute . But why have you taken such a violent dislike to my companions , those three young noblemen , who have followed me hither ? BARON ST . VALLERY Possibly because I think them the very three whom you should not have selected . Listen patiently , Prince Florimond , to your old tutor . You are very young , inexperienced , guileless , rather vain of your knowledge of human nature , of which you know very little , and of men in general , of whom you know less  --   --  PRINCE FLORIMOND You are not very complimentary . BARON ST . VALLERY I hope not , truth-tellers seldom are ; that is if they really respect those whom they profess and wish to serve . Young as you are , the king , your august father , wishes by degrees to initiate you into the secrets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viceroy of this distant province which has recently become annexed to his rich and vast domains . He trusts that your kindly nature , your pleasing manners , and frank , generous disposition will reconcile his new subjects to their new monarch ; you have had absolute power here for a month . May I ask what good you have already done ? PRINCE FLORIMOND I have scarcely had time to do much . On my first arrival , you must agree , that I was so overwhelmed with ftes , balls , and grand receptions , that I had very little time left for business . p. 4 BARON ST . VALLERY Oh , I am well aware that such trifles as affairs of state , the happiness and prosperity of some millions of inhabitants , must give way to the more important claims of masked balls , banquets , illuminations , hunting parties , and pastoral ballets , where lords and ladies are so beautifully and correctly dressed , that one might imagine the wand of an enchanter had animated a collection of rare chinaware figures , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever existed in the poet 's imagination , or were fashioned in a porcelain manufactory . PRINCE FLORIMOND You are very severe on modern amusements , my dear tutor , at the same time I feel you are right ; it is a foolish waste of time , and from this very day I will reform . No more lavish expenditure , no more ftes , of which to tell you the truth , I am becoming rather weary . I will follow your advice  --  attend to my duties . I will call a cabinet council this morning . BARON ST . VALLERY The Duke de Beauchateau , whom you appointed president may not be at liberty , to attend to it , I heard that he was arranging , and superintending the concert for to-night ; at which some of the compositions of your royal highness are to be played for the first time . PRINCE FLORIMOND True , I had forgotten that . I must not disappoint Beauchateau , my best friend , a young man of such merit and accomplishments. p. 5 BARON ST . VALLERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I think nature intended him . Whether he can preside with equal ability at a council of state I am not yet competent to judge . PRINCE FLORIMOND ( pettishly ) He at least will conciliate , for Beauchateau is never contradictory or peremptory ; at least to me . Well then to-morrow be it , as early as you like to assemble . BARON ST . VALLERY The young Count de Clarifort , your master of the horse and grand huntsman , has issued a notice that a royal stag hunt will take place to-morrow , at which all the court , the ladies included , will be present in the new uniform ; in the choice of which you have shewn so much good taste . PRINCE FLORIMOND I can not disappoint two or three hundred people , but I promise you the day after . Oh ! I had forgotten  --  Montclair had arranged for a private rehearsal of the allegorical masque I wrote . BARON ST . VALLERY Which you wrote , with the assistance of your poet laureate . I will no longer intrude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear baron , only I  --   --  BARON ST . VALLERY You are so used to the flattery and fine speeches of these young men , that my plain-spoken truths are unpalatable . But I perceive that one of your principal ministers is coming : I take my leave for the present . Bows , and exit , R. 1 E. p. 6 PRINCE FLORIMOND How provoking to be compelled to listen to him , and to feel too that he is right , for something tells me that I am not following the path I ought to tread ; a life of mere pleasure , and amusement , innocent though it may be , it is not the one for which my sire destined me ; And yet there can be no great wrong in it after all . Every one tells me so : and what every one says must be true . Enter BEAUCHATEAU , laughing , L. U. E. BEAUCHATEAU My dear prince  --  pardon my hilarity  --  but I can not help laughing . PRINCE FLORIMOND What occasions your mirth ? BEAUCHATEAU Imagine your highness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal of the battle piece of your composition , ( which is really a master-piece ) , that remarkably grave person , the private secretary of the prime minister , had the impertinence to request that we would be quiet ; as it was impossible either for him , or any of the gentlemen in his office to attend to business while so much noise was going on . The concert room , you know , is close to the secretary 's suite of apartments . PRINCE FLORIMOND But of course you complied  --   --  BEAUCHATEAU I desired the orchestra to repeat the finale con strepito , and with all the force they could command . Does your highness imagine that I would allow such a covert insult to yourself to pass unnoticed ? No , indeed ! I was honoured with your ceommands and was determined they should be obeyed . p. 7 PRINCE FLORIMOND Still , my dear Beauchateau , if the secretary should be in the right . BEAUCHATEAU Which he was not : I can prove that he was decidedly in the wrong . Recollect that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if once your ministers find that they rule you , instead of you ruling them , adieu to your authority : you had better abdicate at once . No , your highness must shew them you are not the puppet they take you for . PRINCE FLORIMOND Oh as to that , I can be firm , as you well know . BEAUCHATEAU I know you can , and I trust that you approve of my zeal . Ha ! here come Clarifort and Montclair . PRINCE FLORIMOND Just in time . I wish to consult them about the new masque , and the grand stag hunt ; for after those two fetes have been given , I must really attend a little more to business ; St. Vallery is right . Enter CLARIFORT and MONTCLAIR , L.Good morning , my dear friends . CLARIFORT Your highness , I have been seeking for you everywhere ; there is business of the greatest importance which can not be settled till we have had your opinion . PRINCE FLORIMOND Indeed ! what is this very important business ? MONTCLAIR One in which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal hunt , and the colour of the dresses for the masque and ballet . Imagine that there are barbarians who object to the quality of the material we had selected . p. 8 PRINCE FLORIMOND Had we not decided on a rich green and gold for the huntsmen , and scarlet and silver for the court . CLARIFORT But that miserly old marquis , who has hitherto been lord treasurer , objects to the green and gold ; and suggests that plain brown minus the gold would be more serviceable . He even refused to pay the tailor 's bills , that I ordered to be sent to him , unless your highness commanded him to do so . PRINCE FLORIMOND But I understood , Clarifort , that the new liveries were to be made at my own expense . The king gave me a large sum when I took leave of him . It was intended to defray the expenses of my civil list for some time . MONTCLAIR Your royal highness has been so very profuse in your bounty that I fear there is little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will tell you how much remains . CLARIFORT A couple of thousand crowns . PRINCE FLORIMOND I have spent then , nearly half a million of crowns in four weeks , and on what ? CLARIFORT They will be easily accounted for ; you have given largely to artists of all descriptions , then ftes , and balls , and banquets cost something . PRINCE FLORIMOND Those follies I hope are paid for ! p. 9 CLARIFORT All except the grand concert and the masque , but the expense will be trifling . A word from you , prince , will compel this closefisted treasurer to unlock the coffers of the state and furnish you with money . Oh ! apropos , I must not forget to say that the ladies who act in the masque have selected pink as the most becoming colour , in preference to pale yellow ; and the gentlemen will appear in white and blue . But really , my dear prince , you have a most dejected air ! PRINCE FLORIMOND Clarifort , I am thinking that this lavish expense has been uncalled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor , if I continue at this rate ! MONTCLAIR Oh , we shall find means . A young viceroy must be generous ! But will not your highness come and inspect the preparations for the masque ? CLARIFORT And above all we must try on our new dresses . BEAUCHATEAU Do not forget , prince , that you promised to go over that battle piece with me . PRINCE FLORIMOND I will be with you immediately  --  at present I really must be left to myself a little . I will join you in a few minutes . ( BEAUCHATEAU , CLARIFORT and MONTCLAIR bow , and exeunt , L. ) Is it possible that I have already erred and have involved myself . I relied too implicitly on the assertions of my young friends , and consequently I am already deeply in debt . I , who promised my excellent father that nothing should induce me to launch out into extravagance . Would that it were possible for princes always to know the truth ; I have been terribly misled . ( music ) The SPIRIT OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPIRITS OF THE WOODS Prince Florimond , the wish you have uttered with such sincerity , I shall be delighted to gratify . PRINCE FLORIMOND Who are you , fair child ? I never remember having seen you before . SPIRITS OF THE WOODS You have not . I prefer the seclusion of these leafy woods and blooming gardens to all the glitter of a court . We have not met before , and I fear that many of the fine ladies and gentlemen who surround you , would gladly dispense with my company ; but although personally I am unknown to you , I am not unacquainted with you . PRINCE FLORIMOND You surprise me , how can that be ? SPIRITS OF THE WOODS To me it is quite possible ; I have often watched you , when engaged in the pursuit of pleasure here , or when amused with the witticisms of your youthful ministers ; besides , I overheard your conversation with your former tutor , and also that with which your three officers of state regaled you ; I must own the latter was not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have concealed yourself ? SPIRITS OF THE WOODS What matters it that you should know ? perhaps I was concealed in the cup of yonder lily , or hidden beneath that modest violet , or else I nestled within the leaves of the moss rose . I will not puzzle you any longer ; will you obey my directions , and act as I shall bid you , if I promise that you for once shall hear the truth from all ? Are you prepared to accept this offer ? p. 11 PRINCE FLORIMOND I am , and I place implicit faith in your words . SPIRITS OF THE WOODS You will have no reason to regret the confidence you repose in me . Prince , if you would learn the truth , I can present you with a talisman , which has the power of obliging those on whom you bestow it , to speak of you as unreservedly as though you were not present , and at the same time to be unconscious of what they are saying . Here is a rose  --  here a carnation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with discretion , and when we next meet , perhaps you may thank me for the lesson you have received . Adieu , Florimond , for the present . Exit , R. PRINCE FLORIMOND That surely must be some benign fairy : I shall not be afraid to make use of my talisman . But on whom shall I try its effects ?  --  on St. Vallery ?  --  no , it would be useless : he speaks the truth always , and sometimes rather harshly . I am certain of the affection of Beauchateau , Clarifort , and Montclair , my three favourites , as they are called . We were boys together , they are sincerely attached to me , and I feel certain they will stand the test . Ah ! who comes here ? A peasant lad , whom I have seen working occasionally in the gardens . He appears to be in trouble ; I 'll stand aside , and watch him . Exit , R. U. E. Enter ANDRE with a watering pot and rake , L. p. 12 ANDRE Heigho ! what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! work ! and at the year 's end , I am just as poor as ever . Now , I put it to any reasonable being , what is the use of toiling like a slave ? I have made up my mind not to bear it any longer : I 'll run away ; and then perhaps the great folks here will find out what a capital gardener they have lost . Ah ! they told us such fine stories about our new king ; and how happy we should be  --  plenty of work , good wages , and cheap food . I am afraid they have not kept their word , these great folks ; except in respect to our hard work : there indeed I 'll say that for them , they do give us plenty of hard work , and hard words as well . As to the wages , and cheap food , I 'm thinking they have clean forgotten them altogether . ( begins to water the flowers , and rake the beds ) Re-enter FLORIMOND , R ; he wears a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . PRINCE FLORIMOND Good morning , friend ; you seem very busy at work . ANDRE Very busy ! Oh ! you are a stranger here , I suppose , or you might guess that I had been very busy here for the last seven hours . PRINCE FLORIMOND Indeed ! it is scarcely noonday yet ! Have you been working since five in the morning ? ANDRE I was here shortly after sunrise ; and I shall be at work here , till sunset . p. 13 PRINCE FLORIMOND What is your employment here , friend ? ANDRE I am under-gardener to one of the deputy under-gardeners , so please you , sir . PRINCE FLORIMOND Have you lived here long ? ANDRE I have worked here ever since I could handle a spade , and knew a rose from a cauliflower . PRINCE FLORIMOND You are most likely a good florist . I have just met with a new specimen of pansy : I think it rather curious , for I have never seen one like it . ( gives ANDRE the pansy ) ANDRE ( examines pansy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask if you gathered it here , sir ? PRINCE FLORIMOND I did not : but pray keep it ; perhaps you have a love for rare flowers . ANDRE Thank ye , sir  --  I will keep it . ( sticks it in his button-hole ) I am sure if there is anything I can do for you  --   --  PRINCE FLORIMOND You can tell me something respecting the young viceroy , whom your new king has sent to govern here . ANDRE Then , it is little I know of him , except by hearsay . Bless you , I have never seen him . p. 14 PRINCE FLORIMOND I thought , that when the prince made his public entry into the city , that every one saw him ? ANDRE Yes ; every one who was well dressed , and had the courage to push themselves forward . As to me , I only saw the tip of his royal highness 's cocked-hat , and the tail of his horse : and , though I hurrahed as loud as I could , I was thrust back by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no opportunity of seeing the prince , I hope that you are satisfied with his government ? ANDRE Aye , if a poor man could live on sight-seeing , and reviews , and hearing about fetes , and fine doings that are going on . But , instead of all these balls , and feasts , and tomfoolery , I wish the prince would order our wages to be paid us regularly . PRINCE FLORIMOND Is it possible that a poor peasant , like yourself , can be kept without the pittance he earns ? ANDRE You see , sir , we are paid by our masters , the head gardeners , if they do not get money , how can we expect they will give it us ? ( ST . VALLERY appears at back , and listens ) PRINCE FLORIMOND The prince can not know anything of this ! ANDRE How should he ? He never troubles himself about the people , the poor , and the hard-working fellows like me . If he did , do you think , sir , he would do nothing but amuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nonsense , and let us starve or nigh it ? p. 15 PRINCE FLORIMOND I do not think he would . Has no one the courage to speak to him to tell him the truth ? ANDRE Tell him the truth ! Pshaw ! I should like to see the man who would dare to do it . Ah , if our young prince  --  Ah , bless him ! I say , and make him as good a man as his father !  --  if he knew but the half they say of him now , he would soon turn over a new leaf . Why look ye , sir , he has only been here a month , and I 'll be hanged if everything is not topsy-turvey . I expect every day to be turned out , because I ca n't make the pinks and boxes grow fast enough to please the ladies and gentlemen of the court . There 's our poor cottage , the roof wants mending , I have no money to pay the thatcher ; I just get bread for my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prince 's hounds are better cared for than we are . They talk of laying on a new tax ; a fine thing for those who can scarcely make both ends meet . But of course we may starve in order that great men may be amused . PRINCE FLORIMOND I hope not ; what ! shall the honest and industrious pay for the follies of the heartless and idle ? Why do you not complain to the prince himself ? Go boldly to him ; it is his duty to listen to the poor as well as to the rich , to repair a wrong done to the lowliest , as promptly as he would resent an injury to himself . ANDRE ( laughing ) You 'll excuse the liberty I take , sir , but you must be very simple indeed , if you think that any of the fine dressed out fellows about the prince , would let me speak to him , much less tell him the truth , as I have told it to you . I wonder how long my head would keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpleton that young fellow must be ! I must be going to my work yonder ; good day , sir . p. 16 PRINCE FLORIMOND Stop for one moment . What is your name ? ANDRE Andre , so please you , sir . PRINCE FLORIMOND Andre  --  what do you wish for most ? ANDRE What do I wish for most ? Why , that our young prince might just learn how to make good use of his seven senses . But I sometimes think between you and me , sir , that he wants the two best senses of the seven . PRINCE FLORIMOND And what are they ? He is neither blind nor deaf , so it can not be sight nor hearing . ANDRE It is as bad though  --  he wants common sense and good sense ; and our good king might as well have sent us his wig-block by way of a viceroy . PRINCE FLORIMOND Indeed , Andre , I am very much of your opinion as to the prince : he ought to be ashamed of himself for his neglect . ANDRE Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so bad after all ; it is only because no one tells him the truth . He believes too easily what other folks say . PRINCE FLORIMOND A prince should see and judge for himself . Well , Andre , what do you most wish for , for yourself ? You seem to me a good , honest lad , and I should like to serve you . I have not been here long  --  but I have some little influence at court . p. 17 ANDRE Have you , sir ? Then how I do wish that the prince would be pleased to make me one of his upper gardeners for life , and let me have a good warm house to live in , and wages regularly paid . Who knows but that in time I should be able to buy a cow , and keep pigs and poultry ! It would take a long time though to do that ! I should say it would take years before I could scrape together sixty crowns . PRINCE FLORIMOND Who knows but what Prince Florimond may grant your wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you now going to your work ? PRINCE FLORIMOND Yes , sir  --  in the rose-walk yonder . I shall be at work there till evening . PRINCE FLORIMOND I will send a friend for you ;  --  will you come with him ?  --  and I can safely promise that the prince shall befriend you . ANDRE The prince , say you ? What , you know him very well ? PRINCE FLORIMOND Perhaps not much better than you do ; but sufficiently so , to feel assured that if I speak to him , he will do something for you . ANDRE I 'll come , sir  --  never fear ! Who knows but that I shall be a lucky fellow , after all ? Exit , L. U. E. PRINCE FLORIMOND Poor fellow ! can such a trifle make him happy ?  --  work , a life of labour , and sixty crowns . Alas ! I ordered two hundred to be given to a poet , who wrote a complimentary ode on me ; the verses were execrable , but I was told that princes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vallery , are you here ? I thought that you were engaged with my ministers at this hour . p. 18 BARON ST . VALLERY With your father 's ministers , I suppose you mean ? No ; your highness having postponed the meeting of the council , I had no business to transact with them to-day . But you appear dejected  --  what has occurred to dispirit you ? PRINCE FLORIMOND I have been seriously thinking over what you told me this morning . BARON ST . VALLERY I am glad to hear it . A serious thought must have become a great novelty to you lately . A young peasant left you just now . Have you been conversing with him ? PRINCE FLORIMOND Yes ; but I must first tell you of a pleasant adventure that has happened to me . Do you , my dear baron , believe in good and bad spirits ? BARON ST . VALLERY I confess that I am rather sceptical on the subject . Why do you ask me ? PRINCE FLORIMOND Because , not long since , a beautiful boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , as if in answer to my wish . BARON ST . VALLERY May I ask , prince , what was your wish ? PRINCE FLORIMOND You may , for it was one to which you would not have objected . I wished that I might hear the truth from all who surround me . Scarcely were the words uttered , than this good genius appeared to me , and presented me with four flowers  --  assuring me that on whomever I bestowed them , those persons would be compelled to speak the truth , and that too without being aware of it . I have already tried the effect of one flower , and I am convinced of its virtue . p. 19 BARON ST . VALLERY And on whom did you make the experiment ? PRINCE FLORIMOND Truly , on the peasant with whom I spoke . He was not aware of my rank ; and he told me so many truths , that it will be long ere I can pardon the want of thought I have shewn , or my careless and cold indifference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes ' conversation with an uneducated country lad has really worked a change in your sentiments . PRINCE FLORIMOND He spoke the words of truth , and I felt the force of all he said . Oh , my dear St. Vallery ! how unfit am I to rule others when I can not even govern my own caprices . Could you believe it !  --  I have squandered half a million of crowns in little more than a month . BARON ST . VALLERY I am sorry to say that I can believe it ; and what is still worse , you have given the enemies and opponents of Government reason for spreading all sorts of unfavourable reports . They foretel increased taxes , a ruinous price for provisions , misery and starvation , if this expenditure increases or even continues . PRINCE FLORIMOND It shall not  --  I feel that I am on the edge of an abyss  --  my friends are not aware of it . BARON ST . VALLERY You mean the three young gentlemen against whom I took the liberty of warning your highness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florimond , you shall try the effect of these flowers on your so-called friends . p. 20 PRINCE FLORIMOND Oh , no ! I can not doubt their truth . Beauchateau , for instance , is the soul of candour  --  you have often heard him contradict me . BARON ST . VALLERY When you have condemned a folly of your own , in which he had been a participator , then he has been very energetic in proving that you were perfectly in the right . Prince  --  I ask it as a favour  --  put these young men to the proof . I do not wish you to subject them to the same trial you did that rude-spoken peasant . Give me these magic flowers  --  these floral talismans  --  I will present one to each of the three . They are coming here ; conceal yourself among those trees and thick flowering shrubs , and perhaps you may hear some more truths from the lips of the young duke and his companions . PRINCE FLORIMOND Is that not very like playing the spy upon them ? besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear any good of themselves . Granted ; but you need fear no unpleasant disclosures , secure as you are of the esteem and friendship of your young companions . Besides it will be less humiliating both to you and to them , that the truth should be spoken behind your back , as they will imagine . Come , you must consent ;  --  indulge this whim of mine . PRINCE FLORIMOND It shall be as you please , St. Vallery , here are the precious flowers . ( gives flowers ) p. 21 BARON ST . VALLERY And I assure you they shall not long be useless . Now to your hiding place , for here comes one of the two . ( FLORIMOND conceals himself behind a clump of flowering shrubs , R. ) I foretel that much good may arise from the rencontre with the Spirit of the Wood . Enter BEAUCHATEAU , singing , L. 1 E.Good morning , duke ! you appear very gay . Are state affairs such amusing things ? BEAUCHATEAU State affairs ! Upon my werd I have not thought much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintending the arrangements for the concert of this evening . Do you know , Baron St. Vallery , where I can find the prince ? He was here just now . BARON ST . VALLERY He was , and he commissioned me to present you with this rose , and to request that you would do him the favour of wearing it . ( gives the rose to BEAUCHATEAU , who places it in his button hole ) I have business to transact for his highness . So now , duke , I must leave you . Exit , L. BEAUCHATEAU What a tiresome old twaddler he is ! and I strongly suspect him of poisoning the mind of the prince . However , I shall be on my guard against all his machinations . Enter CLARIFORT and MONTCLAIR , L. U. E.Ah ! Clarifort  --  Montclair , so you are there ! Can you tell me where the prince has hidden himself ? p. 22 CLARIFORT Not I , truly ! I have had enough of his company for this morning . Ah ! how weary I am ! Apropos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mignionette which Florimond insists on my wearing . MONTCLAIR And I have a carnation , which I presume is to be my emblem flower for a time , Well , how are we to get through the day , eh , Beauchateau ? Why you look as tired and blas , as though you had already been presiding at a council of state . BEAUCHATEAU Worse than that , Montclair ; I have been endeavouring to put something like music and harmony into that unfortunate battlepiece which we are to inflict this evening on the court . I would strongly recommend all the company to provide themselves with night caps , for they will certainly fall asleep in the middle of it . MONTCLAIR I always heard you pronounce it to be a masterpiece of composition . BEAUCHATEAU Of stupidity , you mean ; it has neither melody , science , nor harmony  --  in fact it is merely noise set to music . Of course it would never do to tell the prince point blank that he knows nothing of composition ; the court will pronounce the battle piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite , and who knows , perhaps in time I may be even prime minister . CLARIFORT A pretty pair prince and minister would be ; and if your protocols are no better than his poetry , I wish you joy of your office . p. 23 BEAUCHATEAU Poetry ! oh , you mean the new masque ; I have not even heard it read , it has been kept a profound secret from all except the author and the actors . CLARIFORT Montclair can tell you more about it ; he happens to be one of the principal performers . MONTCLAIR And I shall have the misfortune of repeating some of the most tiresome platitudes that were ever penned . Had not the poet laureate touched up the verses a little , I know not how we should ever have been able to commit such doggrel to memory . BEAUCHATEAU Doggrel ! why , Montclair , did you not assure the prince that the masque was capitally written ? MONTCLAIR Do princes ever hear the truth ? I can only say with the great French writer , there certainly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but unfortunately for the young author , what is original is not good , and what is good is not original . Ha , ha , ha ! CLARIFORT How severe you are upon the future Augustus of the age . BEAUCHATEAU And to whom you aspire to become the Maeenas . MONTCLAIR I  --  well , I could contrive to be respectable in that office ; but poor Clarifort , who is commanded to order such hideous costumes , he who should have been court tailor , for that I am sure is his vocation ! p. 24 CLARIFORT Yes , Beauchateau , judge if I have not reason to complain : I had imagined some of the most becoming dresses , when the prince with his usual taste , or rather his usual want of taste , would suggest such alterations and additions , that on my honour our corps dramatique will resemble an ill-made rainbow , a crazy kaleidoscope , or a badly assorted piece of patchwork . BEAUCHATEAU Upon my word , Clarifort , you are becoming witty . But if we are to credit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wit , nor invention ; for what then is he calculated ? CLARIFORT Humph ! He may make a decent sort of king , nothing more , believe me . MONTCLAIR And perhaps not a bad legislator . BEAUCHATEAU Whilst I am of opinion that he may reign with tolerable credit to himself , though he is an execrable musician . ( FLORIMOND comes forward , stands behind BEAUCHATEAU ) But he would be dreadfully offended if we were bold enough to tell him so . PRINCE FLORIMOND ( c. , tapping BEAUCUATEAU 'S shoulder ) Indeed , he would not , I can answer for it . ( they all three start back amazed ) BEAUCHATEAU ( R. , aside ) The Prince , by all that 's unlucky ! p. 25 CLARIFORT ( L. , aside ) I am ruined for ever ! He has heard every word ! MONTCLAIR ( L.C. , aside ) The Prince !  --  Then I may as well ask for my passport , and permission to travel to the Antipodes . PRINCE FLORIMOND You all appear dreadfully alarmed at my sudden appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; I think you were perfectly right , and I coincide with you in opinion . BEAUCHATEAU Your highness heard then ?  --   --  PRINCE FLORIMOND Something rather novel  --  the truth . But do not for one moment imagine that I am vexed . I only wish you had been equally candid long ago , and you would have spared me many regrets for the past . Enter ST . VALLERY , L.Ah , baron , you come in time to assure these gentlemen that I bear them no malice for the truths they have unwittingly said of me in my hearing . BARON ST . VALLERY What ! have you really heard the truth ? I fear , prince , that it has not been very palatable to you ? PRINCE FLORIMOND ( laughs ) Well , not at first ; for it appears that I am an execrable musician  --  am devoid of wit or taste . But they do me the favour to say that I may possibly become a good king and an upright legislator . Was it not so ? ( to BEAUCHATEAU ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our presence here can be neither agreeable nor desirable . We will take our departure , with your permission . ( crosses , L. ) PRINCE FLORIMOND No , stay  --  be still my friends ; only speak always to me as fearlessly as you have spoken of me . BARON ST . VALLERY Prince , why should they not ? It only requires honesty of purpose to do so .
