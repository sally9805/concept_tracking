THE railroad dominates . It spreads a web across the land and holds men and cities in its meshes . Its smoke blots every sky . Armies of men toil for it ? trainmen ; trackmen ; signalmen ; expressmen staggering under baggage ; station-agents ; crews of ferries laden with commuters , or of tugs towing rafts of freights ; clerks , old and young , perched on ink-stained stools , their thumbs cramped , their eyes wandering ever toward the windows and glimpses of cloud-capped buildings . For it steamships pour hordes of immigrants upon the docks . Miners delve for it , and empty the black storehouses of the earth into its hungry cars . Men grow gray in its employ . Some live with hand en throttle , eyes fixed on signals and blinking lights . Some sweat among the cylinders in hissing steam . Some ride on rushing freights , ducking bridges , running on swaying roofs , bathed in smoke and cinders . Across the country the railroad stretches its embankments . It cleaves the mountain and throws trestles above the gorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations tower among sky-scrapers , and through its gates the multitude pours . It is monarch of the age . It is dusk ; but in the west , beyond the railroad-yard , the sky is glowing . The light strikes upon the rails and they gleam like burnished brass . In the fading light all else is growing dark , but against the orange sky the semaphores and Iean poles of the telegraph stand black , and at the crossing , farther on , a trestle arches its iron network . The air is full of cinders and swirling steam . Engines vomit inky smoke , which spreads into billows of black vapor and throws dark shadows upon the yard . The switch - lights begin to twinkle . The grimy figures of the lampmen go stumping among the tracks with flickering dropper is tugging at it and yelling ; then , as the distance lessens , he flings his arms out wide and jumps . The next instant the cars crash . A giant truck goes smashing through the forward empty , leaps across the second , and buries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flour-ear is scattered . A thick white cloud arises and settles down upon the wreckage . The ground grows white with meal . The dropper crawls out of the debris , his clothes in shreds , his face streaked with blood and flour . Men come running . The yard resounds with shouts , and from the shop beyond the roundhouse the wrecking-train bears down . It is almost dark , but in a headlight 's glare the crew attack the wreck . They swarm over the ruins . The mighty crane , towering against the last light of the sky , swings ponderously ; the great hook drops ; there is a creaking and straining ; sparks fly ; the crowd pushes back , and a mass of twisted steel arises ? of brakes , of wheels , of shattered ears . It hovers above the ground with trailing tentacles of iron , then slowly swings , and drops crashing upon the waiting flat car . The wreck shrinks rapidly . Soon there remain only the ploughed roadbed and splintered ties . The crane departs . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow lights arc twinkling , and through the darkness the freight-cars rush . The dagoes swarm on the embankment , their bodies bent double as they stoop to work . Patches of color flare in. the sunlight ? blue jeans , red bandannas , and shirts of vivid checks . The sun heats down upon the track , and the hot air quivers as it rises from the rails . You can hear the hissing intake of the breaths as the workmen swing their picks . Their shirts are open at the throat , their dark skins are streaked with sweat , their black hair is matted on their temples . Some wear fluttering handkerchiefs beneath their hats . There is a glitter of earrings , and over all you hear the click of picks and jabbering of Italian . As you watch the toiling men a train comes rushing down upon them . They work on stolidly , and do not seemto hear the long-drawn , piercing whistle . You gasp for breath . Then slowly the laborers stand aside , the express goes thundering by . and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cars . You hear a hammering on the rails . Cinders fly , and your eyes are filled with smoke . As you look about once more , you see the dagoes working on the track . The water-boy comes struggling up the steep embankment , his brimming bucket firmly set upon his head . The soft clay gives beneath his feet , he slips among the cinders , and he stretches his arms wide to keep himself from falling . You can see the tendons of his sturdy neck as he balances the pail . It rests securely on his head , and when he finally gains the top he has not spilled a drop . The Italians stop working for a while as the bucket goes among them . They drain the rusty dipper with noisy gulps , then pause to relight their pipes before taking up their tools . All at once work ceases . Picks and rakes are thrown aside , and the laborers rush for the dinner-buckets that are spotted along the track . You pull out your watch . The hands are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor have you seen a signal , yet work has stopped upon the minute . The foreman vanishes . The dagoes scatter . They stretch out on the cinders or sit cross-legged on the ties . Soon they are munching hunks of bread . Some have spread them thick with a sort of greenish mixture which smells of vinegar and mustard . Others chew bologna streaked with green and yellow . You can see black finger-marks upon the bread . The jabbering grows louder . Six o'clock . The red sun sinks behind the hills . Long shadows stretch across the country and . on the hot embankment . Upon the track a row of handcars waits . The dagoes crowd about them ; they heap them high with tools and coats and dinner - buckets , then scramble on , as the cars begin to move . You see them going down the track , their stumpy figures bobbing as they work upon the levers . They grow smaller , melt into the dusky twilight , and disappear into the cut . The sky grows dark behind the hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkling . The day 's work is over . The operator is on duty in the signal-tower . The telegraph clicks steadily , and on the jangling telephones stream orders from headquarters . The tower-man goes quickly back and forth along the bristling rows of levers ? red , green , and black ? pushing on the switches , pulling on the signals , his eyes fixed on the row of indicators , his ears open to the clickings of the instruments . He answers abruptly when you speak to him , and gazes at you with abstracted eyes . He thinks not of your question . His mind is on the track . Through the wide-open windows you can see the railroad spread below . The rails interlace intricately . The switches are in a seeming jumble . The trusses of the signal-bridges stretch high across the tracks , and through the smoke you see the countless semaphores . A mile down the track the express comes round the bend . You watch it as it grows rapidly larger , then in a moment it thunders by . The tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his clock , then leans out and shakes two fingers at the engineer , who nods and pulls his throttle in a bit . He is two minutes ahead of time . As the express vanishes in a blue haze of steam and dust , a heavy freight comes lumbering down the south-bound track , the big black engine shaking and belching smoke and cinders . The operator turns and tugs upon his levers . Out upon the track there is a clanging among the switches , and upon the signal-bridge the green and yellow semaphores rise and fall . The panting locomotive halts . The signal is against him . Far back at the caboose a brakeman drops off , and you can see him running up the track , waving a spot of red . The engineer , in greasy overalls , swings down from his cab and hurries to the tower . The operator shouts to him that there is a freight wreck at Upland Crossing , and after the Southshore Limited has passed he is to proceed on the passenger track . When the Limited comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the towerman espy a smoking axle-boxunder the forward coach . In an instant he has seized the cord of the great brass tower-whistle , and the country echoes with its blast . With an answering shriek the engineer of the flier throws on the emergency brakes , and the train grinds to a jarring stop . Windows are flung up , and passengers thrust out curious heads . The box is very hot . Smoke pours out thickly and there is a smell of burning grease . The train crew , with sleeves rolled up , plunge elbow-deep in grimy axle stuffings , and sweat streams down their faces . Meanwhile the towerman has tugged again upon his levers . Four blasts from the whistle of the waiting freight rise white into the air , and it swings slowly across to the passenger track ahead of the express . Beyond Upland Crossing , it passes over to its track once more , and the Limited , when it starts on again , is an hour late . When the levers get out of order and the signals refuse to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his kit of tools and scarlet flag . Sometimes in summer , when thunder . storms are raging , the lightning strikes the semaphores , and greenish flame leaps from the signal-boxes . The repair-men climb out upon the framework of the bridge , and you can see them , through the driving rain , and smoke from the rushing trains beneath , beating with their coats at the electric fire . The railroad men stop now and then for a minute 's chat us they pass the signal-tower . The red-faced stationmaster , from two miles up the road , climbs the stairs and settles himself on the window-sill for a comfortable pipe . The foreman of the track conies up as he passes on his rounds . " There ai n't much muscle in this yer job , " he remarks as he watches the busy fingers of the operator , " hut there 's a ? lot of headwork ! " The operator grunts , and as you hear the rumble of an approaching train , he grasps a crimson lever . A roar and a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crowded human life , and the express has passed , The yellow is up out on the bridge . The operator has pulled the lever . He is lord of the track .
