txt Announcement of Alton B. Parker 's resolution of tribute to the memory of ex-President Grover Cleveland has stirred up a great deal of feeling in the camp of the Bryan men . They see in it a clever move on the part of the Nebraskan 's enemies to attempt to discredit him , and so interject a factional fight into the convention . They have already formed a plan to offset the effect of his action . Through their control of the temporary organization they will bring to the attention of the delegates a resolution along similar lines , but with ne criticism of Bryan , expressed or implied . 11 will be presented immediately after the speech of the temporary Chairman by some delegate who will be recognized even if Mr. Parker demands the floor . In this way the Bryan resolution , of a character not designed to raise factional issues , will be put before the convention first , and the Parker resolution , if offered , will be in the nature of a substitute . The Bryan men declare that the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the guise of eulogizing a great party leader , to create strife and dissension and to make harmony impossible , a position they would not wish to hold . Applaud Idea of Tribute . All Democrats , without regard to facttional affiliations , applaud the suggestion coming from New York , that the National Convention should embrace the first opportunity of honoring the memory of Mr. Cleveland . but most of those who have expressed themselves on the subject are of the opinion that the resolutions adopted should not contain anything ovet which there could be the slightest differ . ence of opinion . The . New York resolution , which was made public last night , is denounced oy such Bryan leaders as Mayor James C. Dahlman of Omaha and Judge M. E. Wade of Iowa , the member of the National Committee from that State . They declare that its adoption would ' be a direct slap at Bryan , and insist that in giving it out for publication the New York delegation intended to disparage the Nebraskan candidate . The portions of the resolution which particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Cleveland 's record on the question of maintaining the integrity of the courts and finances , the paragraphs being as follows : He respected the Integrity of our courts and so insisted upon wilet enforcement of the law that every honest man or interest might be protected and all offenders punished , without fear or favor . He maintained the public credit and honor , stood firm as a rock in defense of sound Principles of finance , and resisted dangerous economic doctrines and practices left by the Republican Party as a heritage of our people . It was said to-day by Mayor Dahlman that these expressions are thinly veiled attacks upon Mr. Bryan and his wellknown attitude on the question of adopto ing an anti-injunction plank , and his post . tion in 1896 and 1900 on the money question . " ? These questions have no proper place , " said Mr. Dahlman , " in resolutions intended only to honor the name of the late Mr. Cleveland . Mr. Bryan 's personal tribute to the memory of the late exPresident was of a character proving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further in giving him credit for advancing the interests of the Democratic Party . It is true that Mr. Bryan and Mr , Cleveland had different views on many questions of party policy , and Mr. Bryan refrained from any allusions that might provoke strife in the party . " Predicts a Row . R. M. Johnson , the Texas member of the Committee on Convention Arrangements , said to-day : " If that Parker resolution is Introduced In the convention , it will raise all sorts of a row . The friends of Mr. Bryan do not propose that , under the guise of a resolution honoring Grover Cleveland , Mr. Bryan shall be attacked and his policies for the last twelve years held up to rebuke . " A less serious view was taken of the Parker resolution by Frank M. Day , Secretary to Gov . Johnson , and one of the managers of his campaign . Mr. Day said : " I certainly think that the convention should adopt a resolution in honor of Mr. Cleveland , and the one prepared by Judge Parker seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At the Gray Headquarters Josiah Marvel said that Mr. Cleveland was a world character and that his memory should receive the highest possible tribute . After reading the Parker resolution with Great care , Mr. Marvel said he thought it open to criticism , and that a resolution which did not rake up issues over which there had been , or was likely to be , bitterness , would answer the purpose far better , and be eminently more just to the record of Mr. Cleveland . More emphatic than all these men was Judge Wade of Iowa . He said that every proposition in the Cleveland resolution which might give rise to controversy should be " pulled out by the roots . " ! Continuing , he said : " If the friends and the enemies of Mr. Bryan threaten to dispute over this question , then the friends of Mr. Cleveland will insist that there shall be no party quarrels In paying to his memory the respect which his honorable servi " e to the party deserves .
