 | " WHEN I started out in politics , " said William Jennings Bryan a few days ago , " I used to think all good was condensed in my party and all evil in the other ; but as I have become better acquainted I have found so many bad Democrats and so many good Republicans that I have become more charitable . " This was at a Sunday afternoon meeting under the auspices of the Young Men 's Christian Association , where he was introduced by a Republican Governo , . and where nearly every minister of the city was in the audience of five thousand men . It was a meeting typical of scores addressed by Mr. Bryan in recent months ? the hearers drawn partly , perhaps , by the fame of the speaker , but all enlisted in an uplifting movement . A prediction in 1896 , when the whirlwind of campaign comment was wildest , that the leader of the Free Silver hosts would in little more than a decade be so greeted and would so introduce his sermon-lecture , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected and what has come to pass , it furnishes an interesting study of the growth of Mr. Bryan 's mind and art ? if calling such as his may be termed an art . To Mr. Bryan the promulgation of his political faith is unquestionably an art . It absorbs his waking moments ; it Belights him for its own sake , as well as for its rewards . It is inevitable that a man like the notedNebraskan should be variously judged ? depending on the point of view . In this case the verdict has ranged from " the great commoner of this generation " to " political charlatan . " This praise or condemnation has , for the most part , been directed toward his political views . Of late , because he has addressed on religious themes so many meetings , a new element has modified the public 's estimation . The view partisans take is incidental ; the real nature of the man is fundamental . At the age of forty-eight , after four years in Congress and twelve years of almost daily appearance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting with kings and viewing the round world 's wonders , Mr. Bryan is established as a National figure . Most men grow mellower with passing years , kindlier toward their neighbors ; and if they do not always feel that way , they feel , as a relentless fighting editor of the West used to put it , that that is the way they ought to feel . He is no exception to this experience . In Mr. Bryan 's character there never was the steel that impales an enemy merely because one has power . He fought the first campaign as a militant debater ; he waged the second with a broader smile and more frequent humor ; he took cheerful part in the 1904 battle , knowing it to be a forlorn hope ; he comes to the border of another contest with his good nature , in recent years grown yet more generous , still turned toward the public . Because he has manifested large interest and takes more direct part in religious effort , shrewd observers have professed to foresee a time when he will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Bible ; they point to his eloquent tributes to great moral agencies , and they term him a preacher rather than a politician . Is there really a variation of Mr. Bryan 's aim and ambition , or do they merely fail to take account of a phase of his character before kept in the background ? Perhaps there is something of both in this . Maturer years have doubtless given importance in his mind to things formerly deemed less essential , and unconsciously he responds to the influence . Also , present-day conditions in public affairs demand new treatment . Yet a  | deeper reason exists ? his own inclination toward religious things . " I am interested in the science of government , " Mr. Bryan declares . " I have devoted a large part of my active life to its study ? but I am more interested in religion . I enjoy making political speeches , but I enjoy making religious speeches more ; and I shall be making addresses in the church after I have retired from the stump . Among those interested in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ; but all are interested in religious life . " This sounds a note far from that of campaigns and nominating conventions . The speaker 's religious heritage and training have led to this end ? and running through his life has been a trend toward the inculcation of moral precepts , frequently overlooked because of the great prominence of his political career . Mr. Bryan is a Presbyterian . His father was judge of the local court . Three times a day he prayed ; if court were in session at the noon hour , he bent his head where he sat on the bench and offered his supplication . A family tradition says that when six years old the son was planning to be a Baptist preacher , but his real ambition was always to be a lawyer . He joined the church at the age of fourteen , and maintained his faith throughout his college career , and on to maturity . Once when he was in college a maiden aunt determined to make of Mr. Bryan a minister , and he searched the Scripture for text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " To do justice .. . is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice . " He argued that sacrifice is the emblem of the priest 's function ; that to do justice is the lawyer 's ? and he silenced , if he did not convince , his aunt . He addressed religious meetings before going to Congress , but when an unexpected turn of the election made him a Representative from Nebraska , he gave up this form of public speaking because he thought its object might be misunderstood . Not until after the 1900 campaign , two defeats for the Presidency having intervened , did he resume that work . He felt free to follow his own way , for it seemed unlikely that he again would lead his party in a National contest . But the public had forgotten ? or had never known ? of earlier efforts , and saw in the action a change of heart and of character , when to him it was only the outgrowth of an accession of independence . Another thing : His reversion to Bible texts is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frequent quotation of Scripture . So far back as 1892 the text of his tariff speech was , " ? Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right . " His trust speech of 1900 was based on " Is the young man Absalom safe ? " His New York speech in that campaign was built on " Remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set , " and his latest New York speech on " Thou shalt not steal . " " The Republicans were always questioning my authority , " explained Mr. Bryan , referring to this , " and it kept me so busy defending authorities that it was impossible to accomplish anything . Now illustrations from the Bible are chosen ; if the opposition find fault , the matter can be settled with the Scriptures , instead of with inc . ' ' One of the strongest passages of his present speeches is the story of " Joseph the Dreamer , " which he makes dramatic and thrilling . " Behold , this dreamer cometh , " he applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and develops the idea that " The dreamer lives forever , While the toiler dies in a day , " through comparison of the fame of the cathedral architect with that of the laborer on the walls . " All discourses should go back to some great moral principle , " is the theory he frequently elaborates in his speeches . " This is my theology , " he remarked in the midst of a political argument : " if a man looking at the life of Christ , beholding its freedom from sin , is inspired to approximate his own life to it ? is sorry when he sins , not wishing to sin again ? he is a Christian . So , " for the application , " is he who wants to do right , who is sorry when he does wrong , and who  | wishes to serve his country well , a patriot , regardless of his party . " It is a helpful thing when to a listening throng , hanging on the resonant voice of one they have journeyed many miles to hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or truth so well expressed ? as the Bible ; in it is the world 's best wisdom . " Whatever one may think of the speaker 's ideas on government , respect is due this sort of influence ? and it is seldom that a political orator exerts it . Probably he does not realize how often he turns to the Book , and the preacher-like quality of his method when he does so may well cause discussion whither it will eventually lead . Mr. Bryan once remarked that the late D. L. Moody preached as a lawyer presents his case to a jury . Mr. Moody 's comment was that , if preachers would preach as Mr. Bryan talks politics , they would make more converts . As is the case with most of us , his work has to a degree shaped itself . The law gaveway to politics because he was elected to Congress ; lecturing and the newspaper grew out of politics . It is evident that he enjoys each part of the combination ? he earns his living by following the lines for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brings those whom he can reach , better perhaps than the minister , a message of Christian faith and hope . Altogether , it is a personal field , not one that can be chosen deliberately , but one that might grow ? as this has grown ? out of events and conditions . With it all , even to those who differ with him on political methods , Mr. Bryan 's personality gives the impression of strength and earnestness . He is big and broad physically ; he is powerful politically and mentally ; he is in the prime of life , and must be reckoned with as one of America 's foremost citizens . Probably no one thing has added so much to the public 's impression that Mr. Bryan is in the end to become a preacher as his lecture entitled " The Prince of Peace . " It is so uncommon for a political leader to enter the pulpit with an earnest exposition of the truths of the Christian religion that it seems to many that he must have experienced a change of heart . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , about Christmas time , Mr. Bryan was thinking of Christmas and the reason for the celebration of that festival . Naturally , he thought of the message " Peace on earth " and the prophecy of Isaiah concerning the coming of Christ . " More out of curiosity than otherwise . " explained Mr. Bryan to me . I looked up the prophecy to see exactly what it said . Reading on , I found following it this verse , which before had escaped my attention : " Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end , upon the throne of David , and upon his kingdom , to order it , and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever . " Somehow it appealed to me particularly because of its relation to government . It is a popular opinion that all governments must have their rise , decay , and fall ; but this seemed to teach that a perpetual growth in government , with no possibility of retrogression , might be secured if justice were the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It does not impress one as an ambitious or a powerfully eloquent address . It is a simple , plain , straightforward argument sustaining the reality , the helpfulness , and the promise of the Christian religion and its teachings . It was , at first , frankly a defense of the Christian faith . As it was delivered it expanded and developed , until it has become , in the form in which it is to-day , a presentation of the evidences that support Christ 's title of the " Prince of Peace . " Scarcely a Sunday goes by that Mr. Bryan does not give this lecture before a vast audience of men . It is his most popular Chautauqua number , and is presented year after year at the same assemblies . He prefers to give it at men 's meetings , because he reaches there exactly the class of hearers he most desires to convince . On his tour of the world he delivered it at Tokyo , Manila , Bombay , Cairo , Jerusalem , Montreal , Toronto , and it has been heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the attraction before Catholic and Protestant assem-  | blies , before Presbyterian synods and Methodist conferences . A college professor who listened to the address a short time ago made this criticism : " Yes , there were four thousand men to hear Mr. Bryan 's lecture , but it was a very old-fashioned talk . He devoted too much time to argument against outgrown attacks on Christianity . " The average hearer , however , as does the average church attendant , rather likes old-fashioned doctrines ; he has not yet reached the point where the old attacks on Christianity do not need refutation ; and Mr. Bryan talks here , as he does in every political address , for the average citizen . He takes especial pride in the fact that frequently men come to him and tell him that they have been strengthened in their religious faith by his words . Nor does he confine his defense and exposition of Christianity to platform effort . The other day , on a railway train , he gave two hours of earnest argument to answering the questions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptural truths . The fact that he goes back year after year to the same audience with the same lecture , and receives each time the same earnest attention , proves that there is something inherently helpful in his religious work . After the address he visits with the ministers , notes their comments , gathers new ideas , new illustrations , and the lecture-sermon is broadened thereby . It is not precisely the same address now that it was last year , nor will it be the same next year as now . It will never grow old , for its subject is ever new ; it will develop and expand and change as the speaker and the times change . But even this does not mean that Mr. Bryan has any idea of entering the ministry . He is emphatic in his denial of such ambition . " My work , " said he a few days ago , " is the layman 's work , which is different from the minister 's work . It is a larger and , for me , a better field . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of my life ; to the minister it is his all . As a working citizen , interested in many things , I can appeal to a class of men and women whom the preacher can not reach . I can instill some truths of Christianity into minds that are not within the circle of the minister 's power . It seems to me that here is the direction in which I can accomplish most good . " It is most interesting to note that , in contrast to the procedure of most lecturers , Mr. Bryan has published his " Prince of Peace " lecture in pamphlet form , and added to it a note stating that it is not copyrighted , and any one who cares to do so may republish it . Naturally , he receives some sharp criticism , of which this from a talented Western editor is perhaps typical : " Mr. Bryan is fond of mixing fine moral reflections with his discourse . In a speech the other day he said , There are higher things than holding office . ' It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher things than running for office , even though he who is running leaves a trail of precepts behind him . " It goes on to state that Mr. Bryan has given nothing practical to the world in exchange for the honors and financial rewards that have come to him ? but a difference in political views may account for much of this opinion . However , Mr. Bryan is not easily ruffled . He smiles a broad smile when he reads these criticisms and when he sees the cartoons that picture him so grotesquely . He worries little over the attacks made upon him ? except that he does resent being called a demagogue . The burden of his speech this year is a claim of " vindication " of what he predicted and advocated a dozen years ago . He goes back much farther than that to show that his political history has been consistent . He does not expect everybody to agree with him ; he even calls for a showing of hands in his audience , asking how many voters present have voted against him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire that he be given credit for advocating early in his political career certain things which he yet believes . He points to the fact that he advocated tariff reform in Nebraska when that State was twenty-eight thousand Republican ; that he took up bimetallism when the administration of his own party was against it ; that he opposed imperialism , speaking against it publicly before any  | expression of public sentiment in his own party had been manifested ; that he was the opponent of trusts and the advocate of railway regulation before the public generally was aroused to the influence of great corporations on legislation . He notes that he advocated the guaranty of bank deposits fourteen years ago when the subject was so unpopular that he could not get a favorable report from a committee in Congress ; that he favored in his speeches the election of United States Senators by the people before it was ever acted upon favorably in Congress , and that since that time the lower house has five times passed a resolution for an amendment so to elect , and nearly two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the income tax four years before it was taken up by his party in Congress and thirteen years before it was indorsed by a President . To be sure , some of these theories in government have for a long time received the approval of other public men as well as of Mr. Bryan ? but he is speaking only for himself . In discussing his political preferment Mr. Bryan does not pose as having sought things . He recalls that he took the nomination for Congress in Nebraska when the odds were overwhelmingly against him ; that his election was a surprise to himself and to the district ; that the nomination in 1896 was scarcely to be predicted ; that in 1900 he was nominated without opposition ? so he holds that political honors have come to him naturally rather than that they have been the result of much scheming . Mr. Bryan 's capacity for hard work is marvelous . Here is a sample day : In at 7:30 A.M. from a three-hundred-mile night ride , with a car change after midnight ; introductions ; breakfast ; 8:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9:30 , talk to a party central committee ; 10:15. address in a crowded auditoriurn to four thousand persons ; 12:15 P.M. , talk to overflow meeting outside ; 1 P.M. , lunch ; a special-train trip of one hundred miles with five stops , at each of which he made three-minute rear-platform talks ; 3:40 , another twohour speech from an open-air stand , with a high wind blowing ; a fifty-mile railway journey , eating dinner on the way ; 7:30 , a reception and twenty minutes ' dictation to a reporter ; 8:15 , an address to four thousand persons in a badly lighted , poorly arranged warehouse auditorium ; midnight , aboard a train for a **26;221;TOOLONG ride , with two formal addresses scheduled for the next day and six for the succeeding one . Along with this is the constant procession in train , street , or hotel lobby , of the eager introducer , ' Mr. Bryan , I want you to shake hands with my friend Mr. Blank ? he 's a good fellow . " No matter what is happening , Mr. Blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " This goes on day after day , and has been a nearly continuous performance since his return from Europe , increasing in strenuousness as the Presidential campaign approached . Between the Democratic communities that think they have a claim to an address because they supported him , the Republican communities where his party needs help , and the close communities where it is hoped that he can turn the scales by a speech , he is kept busy . Nor do all in his audiences have their anticipations fully met . " It was not as thrilling as I expected , " said a Western ranchman who had driven seventy-five miles to attend the meeting . He had pondered the " cross of gold " climax and looked for its dramatic repetition . But close attention and frequent applause mark every meeting ; Mr. Bryan is a masterful speaker , and maintains complete control of his audience without seeking superficial aids therefor . He desires to convince ? not to amuse , which should be the province of the pleader . In fact , Mr. Bryan 's political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and an occasional side remark that brings a laugh . His face is a determined one ? sterner and with more tightly pressed lips than in his first campaign . Perhaps he feels that he has before him a larger task than then . He takes up , one after another , the great planks of his platform and declares : " Time has proved we were right . " The quantitative theory of money , trust regulation , revision of the tariff ? in the history of the past twelve years he sees  | an indorsement of his party 's position on each . Then he devotes some attention to Republican leaders and their records . " But we must present a more aggressive idea than that , " said one of his own party members , " when we get into the campaign . You 've got to talk about the future to bring cheers ? and we want cheers 1 " The campaign is young yet . Cheers ? on both sides ? will be more plentiful later on . Mr. Bryan is most heartily at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies , where , by a certain rough and ready heartiness , he has won an enthusiastic admiration less freely manifested by city audiences . " Hello , Billy 1 " prairie dwellers call from the audience , and he smiles a recognition . He tells his Western stories , certain that they will be appreciated ; he thoroughly enjoys the country town 's effusive welcome . " And yet , " he remarked , as the train pulled away from a group of Western settlers to whom he had spoken , " the farmer is the great conservative of this Nation ? the hardest to change , the most tenacious of his political belief . " He is asked to appear , not only on the political rostrum , but before all kinds of companies . He probably has been more frequently before colleges and universities than any other individual in America . Contrary to some assertions , only a small part of his speeches consists of paid lectures ; the larger portion is delivered by invitation before assemblies , or is political , and , of course , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms are always the same ? half the receipts to the lecturer , half to the local management . He can not fill half the requests that come to him . Sometimes when he delivers his " Prince of Peace " lecture on Sunday an admission fee is charged , but the total receipts are given to charity or to some religious organization . Another thing Mr. Bryan resents is the charge that his only object in life is being a candidate for political office . Conditions of public life to-day have made it possible for a man to carry on at one time a group of three lines of effort ? journalism , lectures , and politics . No other trio so well works together The newspaper helps the lecturer and aids in politics ; the Iectures help then newspaper ; politics is an adjunct that increases the audience for the lectures and adds subscribers to the newspaper . The editor may travel , speak , and write without one duty infringing upon the other . Looked at purely as a business proposition , it is a most enjoyable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why it should come to an end . Whether the individual win or lose in his political ambition makes little difference , on the whole , to the three lines of endeavor in which he is engaged . " Of course , " says Mr. Bryan , " my prominence in politics is working capital for my lectures and for my newspaper work ? but where would it not be the same ? I could start a clothing store and get custom because of my name . Cleveland , Reed , Harrison , and scores of others have found greater reward in business because of their political prominence . It is a condition that can not be avoided . " Mr. Bryan believes that he has demoonstrated during the past decade two facts : First , that a man may become influential in politics without departing from high moral standards ; second , that a man may maintain his position in politics without power to reward , money to buy influence , or patronage to dispense . He asserts that his place in politics is not due to marvelous ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public speaker , but to the strength of the principles he advocates . " You can not kill a man , " he frequently says , " until you kill the thing for which he stands . " The other day I asked him the secret of his success . He gazed thoughtfully over the wide prairies for a moment before replying . " It is , " he replied , " because I have had faith in the wisdom of doing right , and have preferred to be defeated in the fight for the truth , rather than to win by a surrender of it . " He added : " I deserve no credit for this , however , because no man can win so much by the surrender of the truth as he can by adherence to it . It is expe- dient as well as right for a man to contend for that which he believes is right . If he be in fact right , he will grow as his cause grows ; and if he errs in judgment , he will still have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents . " This , to be sure , is not a new discovery , but there is a great deal in Mr. Bryan 's history that indicates his sincerity in speaking as he did . Mr. Bryan doubtless expects to be then nominee of his party for President ; more than that , he probably does not imagine that he will have hard work to secure that nomination . Doubtless he will write the platform on which we will run ; and his recent speeches , as he has gone to the sections where he hopes to get a majority of the votes , indicate that this platform will be a composite of the three that have gone before , with possibly less of 1904 and more of 1900 and 1896 therein . Then , until election , will be fewer sermons and more political pleas . After that ? well , if defeated , why can not the old programme be resumed : lectures , religious addresses , politics , journalism ? If there come victory ? that is another matter . In either event , Mr. Bryan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that he himself uses the term ? " a preacher of ideas . "
