IT is a pleasant thing to sit here , this rainy afternoon , with the books and the " collection " close at hand . I have certainly been arranging that collection for ten years , and it is not arranged yet . If these things continue to increase in numbers I shall have to resort to the methods of that old opium-swiller , De Quincey ? lock the door , abandon the accumulations , and seek a new lodging where I may begin all over again . I believe there is a tribe of Indians somewhere in Alaska who have the pleasing custom of burning their wigwams when they find that their goods and chattels are becoming oppressively overcrowded , and starting life afresh , unburdened by personal property . I think I will go to Alaska and collect totem-poles . A distinguished Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , now deceased , used to collect almanacs , even those of Ayer and Josh Billings . Why he did it . I can not imagine , for he never made a joke in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Annals of Congress , or of my own Dictionary of American Political Biography . But one must collect something , even postage-stamps and hook-plates . Who said that " man is an animal which collects " 1 It must have been Andrew Lang , for he says most things nowadays . Doubtless the " profane vulgar " consider me , and all other individuals of my autograph-hunting species , as members of the common horde of semi-lunatics who gather birds ' eggs , butterflies , hotel paper , teacups , and Japanese swordguards . They think that I carry about with me a gilt-edged volume and ask luckless magnates to write their names in it I have always had a notion that the books which the Sibyl brought to Tarquinius Priscus were what are known as " autograph-hooks , " such as are thrust in these days under the noses of sena- some of these meditations were printed in The Literary Collector , tors and generals . They suppose that I send letters to statesmen and authors , requesting the favor , etc. , etc. , and in-closing stamp for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tear the signature from some letter or document of an eminent person and present it to me . To use a familiar , contemporaneous locution , it jars me to reflect that , in the minds of the multitude , the schoolgirl with her scrap-book and the fiend with his awful album are all of a piece with me ! It is exasperating , but one must exercise patience and self-control even when friends give sympathizing looks , and smile , as who should say , " It is an amiable folly . " There is , however , one evil thing about the otherwise harmless habit of autograph - collecting . It fosters envy , hatred , malice , and all uncharitableness . When I glance over the other man 's collection and find that he has so much better specimens than mine , and even several which I have sought for in vain through those interminable Philadelphia catalogues and the long lists of Burns and Benjamin and the other busy B 's of the trade , I proceed to break that commandment recently appended to the decalogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet when I go home and think over it , I reflect that perhaps I may excite that neighbor 's ire if I choose , but I will be magnanimous and gloat secretly over my possessions . How very inconsiderate some of our great people have been in the matter of epistolary composition ! If Thomas Lynch , Jr. , and Button Gwinnett , and John Morton , had only understood the feelings of a collector , they would surely have favored their friends more frequently with an A. L. S. ( autograph letters signed ) , or even an A. N. S. ( autograph note signed ) . When they were ? signing the Declaration on that warm July afternoon , and committing themselves to the famous fallacy that " all men are created equal , " they might have foreseen the day when every American collector would begin his colligending career by gathering " Signers . " On reflection , I recall the fact that , historically , they did not sign in July , but dribbled along through the summer and autumn of 1776 , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign , and others failed to sign who ought to have signed ; but that is a detail . We must all cling loyally to the belief that they flocked about that table , one pleasant summer day , as they are represented by the accurate and artistic Trumbull , their shins very much in evidence , and John Hancock , clad in black and several times bigger than any of his fellow-Congressmen , sitting cross-legged , with a melancholy expression of countenance , in the chair of state . I give the most implicit credence to that picture , as I do to all those wonderful representations of General George Washington which make the life of the extra-illustrator a burden . All that the younger Lynch did after his single effort in the signing way was to write one letter for Dr. Emmet , and to scribble his name on the fly-leaves of divers books . As for Gwinnett , I have always thought that old Lachlan McIntosh , whose autograph is dear at two dollars , did perfectly right to kill him . Verily , the paths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . I remember well that in the callow days of youth I was mightily beset by the desire to acquire as my own the sign-manual of one Simon Boerum , who enjoyed the distinction of being such an obscure Continental Congressman that he became valuable by reason of his unimportance . There is an eminence of smallness as well as of greatness , and Tom Thumb attained fame while many contemporary persons of much greater stature disappeared from life unhonored and unsung . Think of the glory of being absolutely the most insignificant human being on earth ! Simon ? perhaps we may call him Simple Simon ? was just that ; and when I re . joiced in owning an innocuous deed of conveyance whereon Simon had written and subscribed his harmless certificate of record , far back in 1769 , when he was the Clerk of our County of Kings , I thought I was the happy possessor of a gem of great price ; for the price was great , as a certain well-known Nassau Street expert can testify . But not many years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who successfully combines politics and the pursuit of autographs , raked Long Island with a fine comb , and now every child who gathers pebbles on the beach may have his Simon Boerum if he cares for such a thing . A plague , I say , on those mousers who go about finding new and hitherto unsuspected Continental Congressmen ! Just when I think that I have finished my set , some new man turns up who never served , of course , and never showed his classic countenance in Philadelphia ; but somebody once said that he might possibly be chosen to represent his State , and that is enough . His name goes thundering down the ages , and there is a blank in my catalogue , to be filled only after long , tedious , and prayerful waiting . This sort of person generally turns up as a D. S. ( document signed ) . He could not write a letter , and if he did , die man who received it burned it promptly . He usually hails from North Carolina or New Jersey . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her energies during the Revolution to choosing Congressmen who were unwilling to write . I am seriously contemplating besieging Congress for legislation to prevent further additions to the roll . We collectors sometimes get a glimpse of the interior of characters not vouchsafed to the rest of mankind . I wonder what Queen Victoria would have thought if I had shown her a letter snugly buried in one of my most choice volumes , which she addressed to her gay and gallant premier , Melbourne , before she espoused Prince Albert ? Here it is : If Lord Melbourne is n't very tired , c 'd he come here ? Fie need n't , dress , but can come just as he ' is . The Queen would see him upstairs in her own room . I have heard much wh. enrages me , &; it w 'd be such a thing if you e 'd come here for a minute , unless you are eery tired ; it w 'd quiet me . Just say yes , or no . If you c'd n't get your carriage quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully . The Duke must be in his dotage . Is it not delightful to feel the humanity of this artless utterance of the young girl who had just assumed the crown which she wore so nobly for more than sixty years ? We may wonder whether , when the snows of eighty-one winters were on her brow , she could recall distinctly the time of her dashing , showy prime minister . It , is difficult for me to tear my-self away from the English - literature 0 cases . " I have just unearthed this odd bit of Charles Lamb , written , as are so many of my letters , to Oilier , the authorpublisher : DEAR OLLIER , ? I have received one or two presents of books from authors , which I Can only return in kind . Can you let me have 3 or 4 copies of my works for that purpose . Yours &e; C. LAMB . I have been in France . I have eaten frogs . Poor Percy Bishe ! ! Have you done with my old copy of Don Quixote ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in 1822 . In that year Lamb went to France for the first time , and visited his friend Kenney at Versailles . Shelley died in July , 1822 . Lamb 's lament is certainly not elaborate . The thick quarto volume which is always kept in the best bookcase , which corresponds to the " spare room " in our old country houses ? that quarto volume , I say , with its hundreds of closely written and much-corrected pages , is the manuscript of " Barry Cornwall 's " Memoir of Lamb . In it is inserted a characteristic little note : Pray let Matilda keep my newspapers till you hear from me , as we are meditating a town residence . C. LAME . Let her keep them as the apple of her eye . So much has been said and written about Lamb and the Lambs ? so many Lives and Memorials have been published , so many editions printed , that the VOL .

To most men of the day Lamb is more interesting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring forth from the ponderous presses of the present , has swept away in its flood those productions of the early nineteenth century , and cast them into the peaceful " coves " or alcoves of the quiet libraries , where they rest undisturbed upon the shelves , until by chance some curious student dislodges them , or some reminiscent gentleman of middle age desires to recall the memories of " Elia . " Whenever I feel anxious about my precious health , as we old fellows are apt to do , and am complaining of the incompetency of my physicians , I burrow in the mass of English Literary over there in the corner , ? just under the Romney sketch and the portrait of Henry Clay , in order to pull out John Ruskin 's screed , which always consoles me . Thus writes the master of English prose , under date of July 24 , 1871 : MY DEAREST Tom , ? Really your simplicity about naughty me is the most comic thing I know , among all my old friends . Me docile to doctors ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew of the matter ; did what they advised , for two days ; found they were utterly ignorant of the illness and were killing me . I had inflammation of the bowels , and they gave me ice ! and tried to nourish me with milk ! Another twelve hours and I should have been past hope . I stopped in the middle of a draught of ice-water , burning with insatiable thirst ? thought over the illness myself steadily ? and ordered the doctors out of the house . Everybody was in an agony , but I swore and raged till they bad to give in ? ordered hot toast and water in quantities , and mustard poultices to the bowels . One doctor had ordered fomentation ; that I persevered in , adding mustard to give outside pain . I used brandy and water as bot as I could drink it , for stimulant ? kept myself up with it ? washed myself out with floods of toast and water ? and ate nothing and refused all medicine . In twenty - four hours I had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite for meat , and was safe ? but the agony of poor Joanna ! forced to give me meat , for I ordered roast chicken instantly ? when the doctors , unable to get al . me , were imploring her to prevail on me not to kill myself , as they said I should . The poor thing stood it nobly , of course ; none of them could move me one whit . I forced them to give me cold roast beef and mustard at two o'clock in the morning ! And here I am , thank God , to all intent and purpose quite well again ? but 1 was within an ace of the grave ? and I know now something of doctors that ? well , I thought Moliere hard enough on them ? but he 's complimentary to what I shall be after this . Thanks for all your good love ? but do try to understand me a little better ? indoeilest , when I choose , of human creatures ? hut yours , most affectionately , JOHN RUSKIN . Mr. Ruskin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are all of us vain , but not quite as vain as that . This fable teaches , as our boyhood friend Aesop used to say , that the habit of intellectual domination will sometimes array a man even against his physician . Charles O'Conor was quite unlike John Ruskin , yet they resembled each other in their possession of an indomitable will . Everybody knows the story of Mr. O'Conor 's miraculous rally after the doctors had given him up . lie simply willed that he should live . I have a vivid recollection of the great lawyer . He was a " character . " He had a melancholy , subservient slave in his office , named Effingham . Really that was not his name , but it will do . Poor old Effingham would sometimes greet his master of a morning with fawning politeness , hand-rubbing , genuflecting , saying , " It 's a fine day , Mr. O'Conor . " Whereupon the jurist , fixing a cold and glittering eye upon his affable clerk , would reply : " Effingham ! I am in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that it is a fine day , and I do not need to have you remind me of it . " Perhaps both O'Conor and Ruskin might have enjoyed more affection had they been less hard and severe . Readers of American political history will recall the fact that the enemies of Andrew Jackson were accustomed to ridicule him for his alleged illiteracy and his shortcomings in the spelling department of the language . The general habitually made his " a 's " like " o 's , " and hence it was charged against him that he did not know how to spell hisown name . I have carefully examined a great many letters of the hero of New Orleans , and have failed to discover any evidence of ignorance on his part . It is true that his spelling was old-fashioned , and , curiously enough , his mistakes are almost all made in the matter of doubling letters . I have one letter before me as I write , in which I find these words : " allways , " " Allabama , " " until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " g " in " bantling . " A venerable friend who knew the old general tells me that he used to write " boosom " for " bosom . " Yet he never seems to have had any " dificulty " with the long , hard words . But , after all , what does it profit us to find fault with the spelling of the stanch patriot who said , " The Federal Union , it must be Preserved ! " and preserved it ? One of my jaekson letters is a fair example of his official style : GEORGETOWN , 18 Nov. 1815 . SIR , ? The resolution of the legislature of New York , which you were charged to trnnsmit to me , expressive of their grail ' . tude to myself and my brave associates in arms for the preservation of New Orleans , was received in due time ; but a multiplicity of business prevented me from acknowledging its receipt sooner . For myself &; my associates I beg to return the most sincere thanks for the kind manner in which that respectable body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these exertions were attended with very extraordinary success ? but no more , I think , than we may always look for when our reuse is just and Heaven is on our side . No people in the world are more capable than ours of the " highest military results " when they fight for the dear inheritance of their independanee , if a fair opportunity be afforded them of displaying the qualities which really belong to them . I have the honor to be With great respect Yr mo . obt. et . ANDREW JACKSON , Major Genl comdg D of the South . Excellency DANL D. TOMPKINS , New York . There is about this epistle that semigrandiloquence of the period in which it was written , and the usual appropriation of Heaven as an ally of the side which won . But it is dignified and suitable , and quite unexceptionable , although the general had a slight accident when he encountered the word " independence . " Any mention of Jackson naturally recalls his successor in the Presidency , the much-maligned Martin Van Buren , whose memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be written for us so largely by New England Whigs and Abolitionists . I am rejoiced that , in these later days , some justice has been done to the great lawyer and conscientious statesman in the admirable biography which Edward M. Shepard has given us in the " American Statesmen Series . " - Mr . Van Buren , in the latter part of his life , began the preparation of an Autobiography , and brought it down to a time shortly before his Vice-Presidency . It was never finished , and has never been published . I had the privilege of examining the manuscript some years ago , and it is to be regretted that circumstances have prevented the present possessor from giving it . to the public . The style is somewhat diffuse , and there are many long discussions of obsolete matters of controversy which a judicious editor might easily condense ; but there is a great deal of historical value in the record . T ventured to transcribe a page relating to John Quincy Adams , which affords a fair example of the contents of the Autobiography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . He was equally bold &; fearless in the avowal and maintenance of his opinions , &; in his feelings &; habits more Democratic . In respect to the unaffected simplicity of his manners &; the slight value he placed upon the pride &; pomp of office , he did not fall behind any of our Democratic Presidents , not excepting Mr. Jefferson , who , it will be remembered by a few , so outraged the sensibilities of the sticklers for official dignity by wearing red breeches &; tying his horse to a peg , when he had occasion to visit the Capitol . Brought up , as was at that day the universal custom . &; is still too much the case , in the belief that there could be nothing good in our opponents , I entered public life with strong prejudices against Mr. Adams . Although I had not the good fortune to be in favor with the administration , or to be partially regarded by himself whilst he was the head of Mr. Monroe 's cabinet , and was ranked among opponents of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his character as a straight-forward , well - meaning man lasted from my first acquaintance with him in my Senatorial capacity till the close of his life . His personal demeanor towards inc was invariably respectful , &; as cordial as I could desire . There can be no doubt that Mr. Van Buren deliberately sacrificed any chances he had for the Presidential nomination in 1844 by his letter against the annexation of Texas , " one of the finest and bravest pieces of political courage , " and one which " deserves from Americans a long admiration . " * It will be remembered that in 1852 a good deal of fun was showered upon that stalwart veteran , General Winfield Scott , then Whig candidate for the Presidency , because in some letter of denial which became public he referred to himself as writing it " after a hasty plate of soup . " It may be of interest to note that the expression was a common one with the general , and that it was employed semifacetiously . Here is a letter of his written in 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? Having just made the acquisition of a fine green turtle , 1 , on a sudden thought , beg you to join me in " a hasty plate of soup " to-day , at 5 o'clock . Very truly yours , WirtrtELD SCOTT . GEN'L TOTTEN . Certainly there is something laughable about " a hasty plate of soup , " suggestive of a stout military gentleman , with napkin under chin , ladling the hot compound down his throat in a tearing hurry , and perhaps spilling it upon his gorgeous uniform . The American people will not endure heroes who expose themselves to ridicule , as we have seen of late in the case of an honored admiral . The general was a fine old gastronomic expert . He was inordinately fond of terrapin , and one of his favorite speeches was as follows : " This little , ugly , blacklegged animal , that carries his house with him , is obliged to seek his living in the * Shepard 's Vans . Buren , 407. swamps and solitary coves , among the rushes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after with painful diligence , and the dish prepared from his flesh is honored at the feasts of the rich and the brave . " * The same friend who recorded this eloquent tribute to the pride of Maryland also says that he once offered to bet a dinner that if the general should be invited to dine with the party at any time within a month , and have terrapin prepared by his favorite cook , he ? the general ? " would during the dinner say and do the following things in manner following : He would , while leaning his left elbow on the table , having some of the terrapin on his fork , held raised about six inches above his plate , exclaim : This is the best food vouchsafed by Providence to man , ' and then carry it immediately to his mouth . The other thing he would do was , that leaning on the table in manner aforesaid , he would pour wine from one glass into another . " Nobody took the bet . A distinguished New York lawyer tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , where the general was a guest , and that he saw the famous soldier drink more claret than he ever supposed a mortal man could absorb . But a giant six feet four inches in height and bulky in proportion requires more sustenance than an individual of ordinary dimensions , and as the general lived to within a fortnight of his eightieth birthday , neither terrapin nor wine could have injured him very much . The general , besides being a royal gourmand and a person of unusual size , was probably as vain a man as may be discovered outside of the realm of literature . If one should adopt George Derby 's numerical system of comparison , and should say that the vanity of the most self-conceited author in the world ? he still lives , but I dare not give his name ? might be represented by 65 , Scott 's selfappreciation must be at least 97 . General Keyes was reading to him an article on Henry Clay , in which the size of Clay 's mouth was referred to , and the General E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that Burke , Mirabeau , and Patrick Henry all had mouths of extraordinary size , concluding with the remark , " All great men have large mouths . " " All great men have large mouths ! " exclaimed the general ; " why , my mouth is not above three-fourths the size it should he for my bulk ! " It is not to be wondered at that the general gave to mankind what is perhaps the most frankly egotistical autobiography ever known . He usually refers to himself as " Scott . " I have just found a long letter of the general 's which gives a fair view of his method of judging those who declined to bow down and worship him . It was written to Hon. James Monroe ? not the President , but a member of Congress from New York : AUGUSTA , MAINE , March 12 , 1839 . Twelve o'clock at night . MY DEAR SIR , ? I have received three letters here from you , written at Washington , and am infinitely hurt on the subject of the claim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to have inserted by way of amendment in some appropriation bill which had passed the House of Representatives . So much for my strict attention to public duties ; for if I could have come by Washington instead of proceeding from one important service to another ? from the Cherokee country to the Canada border , direct , the account , instead of being placed in the hands of that ass , Mr. Attorney General Grundy , would have been allowed as a matter of course , without dissent or hesitation . But he who devotes himself to the public need not hope to find anybody , in office , willing to attend to his private interests . I am truly disgusted with the illiberality and injustice I have experienced in this small matter ? small to the public ; but so great to me as almost to cripple my capacity to be useful to that public . . . . Your friend , WINFIELn SCOTT . It is certainly indicative of a lack of sense of proportion , this idea that a matter of $19.52 should cripple the usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand why he should have been about the worst-defeated of the unsuccessful candidates for the Presidency . ?
