 |p1204  HOW is it that the sanitariums have escaped the muckrakers ? They have been thru every department of the financial , industrial and social world . They have overhauled and outraged the sensibilities of that simplehearted , sincere but unobservant old lady , the Church . And they have occasionally unearthed a scandal in a city hospital . But even the muckraker is shrewd enough to fight shy of a sanitarium . He knows that if he slipt in for the purposes of investigation he would probably fall under the conviction for his own symptoms and remain for treatment ! Besides , we must not confound the hospital , which is more or less a public institution , with the sanitarium . One difference is that the sanitarium is always private . Another is that the hospital patient recovers and is dismissed , or , does not recover and is dismissed for that reason . But one is rarely discharged in any such final manner from a certain class of sanitariums . If it is a woman ? and all sanitariums are largely female institutions ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of an exhilarating massage , but it is very unusual for one in good enough financial circumstances to afford the extravagance ever to get so well of her ailment that she does not return again and again to have it " treated . " Now we have no reference to those institutions conducted honestly by efficient physicians and for the help of a very large class of genuine sufferers who may never recover and who need constant attention . But there are in the neighborhood or in the midst of every city numbers of so-called " sanitariums " conducted very quietly and profitably by ignorant charlatans in the medical profession . The physician or physicians in charge are usually not in good standing with the better class of doctors in the community . There is on the outskirts of a certain city a large sign in front of a very sedate looking private residence which designates it as a sanitarium . Nervous patients are taken here , and the physician in charge is a " corn doctor ! " There is another where the physician in charge does not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that State , and where a case of walking typhoid was recently diagnosed as " tuberculosis " and the patient made to " take the fresh air , " walking till he dropt . But " nervous " patients are a specialty with these institutions . This is the same class of men and women who formerly effected periodic cures for themselves with " patent medicines , " and whose photos and testimonials graced so many bottle labels . Now they are equally enthusiastic in recommending their sanitariums and their doctors . Let one such institution secure but half a dozen thoroly developed cases of neurasthenia and its future is assured . For these patients will not only return from time to time , but they will bring and send others . Many of these so-called sanitariums have become opulent and respectable upon the business of confirming the temporary invalidism of their patients . And now we have a regular sanitarium class of humanity just as distinct in their aims and thinking from normal people as idiots are from sane ones . Here is the temptation that makes them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a nurse , the attention of a physician , and the sanitarium atmosphere in which it is so easy to realize and develop the consciousness of disease , for from fifteen to thirty dollars per week , why should she remain at home with her healthy , hard-hearted family , who never " rub " her , nor pet her , nor show the slightest interest in her most harrowing symptoms ? She is never taught in sanitariums of the kind under discussion that her most dangerous symptom is a craving for sympathy rather than for health . She has made a medical romance of her pains , and learns to sit in quivering an/ ticipation of another pang . And she develops pangs as a story - writer would discover new and thrilling sensations in his tale . Also , she is in a hurry to impart it to the nurse and the doctor , whose business it is to listen . That is really what she pays them for , altho she is deluded into thinking that it is to make her well . Upon examination it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that converse with splendid pathological intelligence upon their diseases , but who are stupid and indifferent almost to the point of idiocy upon every other subject . And the sanitarium physician only mildly warns and teasingly reproaches them about this injurious use of their minds , because he knows if he peremptorily rebukes one of them for the weakness , he will " hurt her feelings " and lose a patient . Such women pride themselves upon the exceeding delicacy of their sensibilities , and they reap the reward of a selfish selfconsciousness in that they really do suffer out of all reason . from a noise , or a jar , or a " brutal " word , when they are not otherwise seriously ill . What they need , however , is an allopathic dose of " brutal words " three times a clay till they come to their senses . And it would not be so bad if they remained perpetually incarcerated in their sanitariums , but it is a part of the romantic movement in their diseased minds to reach , now and then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a vacation from cultivating their physical weaknesses with " treatments , " and enter society , and on a divan if it can be so arranged . For the regular sanitarium woman just will not remain alone , she has so many thrillingly interesting experiences to tell , you know . and she must tell them ? or " relapse . " This accounts for the spread of that  |p1241  innocuous form of insanity so prevalent now in feminine social circles . It is to be recognized by the victim 's persistent references to her " operation , " or her " digestion , " or her " spine " ? a sanitarium woman never mentions her back . That durable piece of human anatomy may do for a crude well one , but the professional invalid never has anything but a spine , which she invariably mentions with an air of pathos , as if it were a broken lute-string ! In this interesting social way she effects an exchange of symptoms , recognizes the condition of her numerous female friends as being similar to her own ? before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and easily persuades them to go for " treatment " if they can afford it , and sometimes if they can not . The curious thing is that they will be persuaded , in spite of the obvious condition of the sanitarium woman 's darkened mind ! No one who lives in the full pressure of modern life can possibly be in perfect physical health . The sooner we realize this and lessen the pressure the better . Meanwhile the only decent thing to do is to grin and bear it . Do not add the " drug habit , " or , what is very nearly as bad , the sanitarium habit , to your disabilities . If you must go to such a place , go with fear and trembling , get out at the earliest possible moment , and shake the sick dust of it from your feet . The thing to bear in mind with proper courage is that we all have our deadly disorder , closed up and folded away somewhere in the tissues of the body or in life . We can not miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we can win tolerably close to the latter in a fairly decent manner , and need not be trundled into it by a trained nurse and a doctor , disgustingly pale before our time .
