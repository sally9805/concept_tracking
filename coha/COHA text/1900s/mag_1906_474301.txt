MY recovery of impressions , after a short interval , yet with their flush a little faded , may have been judged to involve itself with excursions of memory -- memory directed to the antecedent time ? reckless almost to extravagance . But I recall them to-day , none the less , for that value in them which ministered , - at happy moments , to an artful evasion of the actual . There was no escape from the ubiquitous alien into the future , or even into the present ; there was an escape but into the past . I count as quite a triumph in this interest an unbroken ease of frequentation of that ancient end of Fifth Avenue to the - whole neighborhood of which one 's earlier vibrations , a very far-away matter now , were attuned . The precious stretch of space between Washington Square and Fourteenth Street had a value , had even a charm , for the revisiting spirit ? a mild and melancholy glamour which I am conscious of the difficulty of " rendering " for new and heedless generations . Here again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean , the number of hares started , before the pursuing imagination , the quickened memory , by this fact of the felt moral and social value of this comparatively unimpaired morsel of the Fifth Avenue heritage . Its reference to a pleasanter , easier , hazier past is absolutely comparative , just as the past in question itself enjoys as such the merest courtesy-title . It is all recent history enough , by the measure of the whole , and there are flaws and defacements enough , surely , even in its appearance of decency of duration . The tall building , grossly tall and grossly ugly , has failed of an admirable chance of distinguished consideration for it , and the dignity of many of its peaceful fronts has succumbed to the presence of those industries whose foremost need is to make " a good thing " of them . The good thing is doubtless being made , and yetthis lower end of the once agreeable street still just escapes being a wholly bad thing . What held the fancy in thrall , however , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts- , that values of this romantic order are at best , anywhere , strangely relative . It was an extraordinary statement on the subject of New York that the space between Fourteenth Street and Washington Square should count for " tone , " figure as the old ivory of an overscored tablet . True wisdom , I found , was to let it , to make it , so count and figure as much as it would , and charming assistance came for this , I also found , from the young good-nature of May and June . There had been neither assistance nor goodnature during the grim weeks of midwinter ; there had been but the meagre fact of a discomfort and an ugliness less formidable here than elsewhere . When , toward the top of the town , circulation , alimentation , recreation , every art of existence , gave way before the full onset of winter , when the upper avenues bad become as so many congested bottle-necks , through which the wine of life simply refused to be decanted , getting back to these latitudes resembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone : it was as if the wine of life had been poured for you , in advance , into some pleasant old punch-bowl that would support you through the temporary stress . Your condition was not reduced to the endless vista of a clogged tube , of a thoroughfare occupied as to the narrow central ridge with trolley-ears stuffed to suffocation , and as to the mere margin , on either side , with snow-banks resulting from the cleared rails and offering themselves as a field for all remaining action . Free existence and good manners , in New York , are too much brought down to a bare rigor of marginal relation to the endless electric coil , the monstrous chain that winds round the general - neck and body , the general middle and legs , very much as the boa-constrictor winds round the group of the Laocoon . It struck me that when these folds are tightened in the terrible stricture of the snowsmothered months of the year , the New York predicament leaves far behind the anguish represented in the Vatican figures . To come and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kind short arms was at least to keep clear of the awful hug of the serpent . And this was a grace that grew large , as I have hinted , with the approach of summer and that made in the afternoons of May and of the first half of June , above all , an insidious appeal . There , I repeat , was the delicacy , there the mystery , there the wonder , in especial , of the unquenchable intensity of the impressions received in childhood . They are made then once for all , be their intrinsic beauty , interest , importance , small or great ; the stamp is indelible and never wholly fades . This in fact gives it an importance , when a lifetime has intervened . I found myself intimately recognizing every house my officious tenth year had , in the way of imagined adventure , introduced to me ? incomparable master of ceremonies after all ; the privilege had been offered , since , to millions of other objects that had made nothing of it , that had gone as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one 's connection was fairly exquisite . The lowered light of the days ' ends of early summer became them , moreover , exceedingly , and they fell , for the quiet northward perspective , into a dozen delicacies of composition and tone . One could talk of " quietness " now , for the shrinkage of life so marked , in the higher latitudes of the town , after Easter , the visible early flight of that " society " which , by the old custom , used never to budge before June or July , had almost the effect of clearing some of the streets , and indeed of suggesting that a truly clear New York might have an unsuspected charm or two to put forth . An approach to peace and harmony might have been , in a manner , promised , and the sense of other days took advantage of it to steal abroad with a ghostly tread . It kept meeting , half the time , to itsdiscomfiture , the lamentable little Arch of Triumph which bestrides these beginnings of Washington Square ? Iamentable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this melancholy monument it could make no terms at all , but turned its back to the strange sight as often as possible , helping itself thereby , moreover , to do a little of the pretending required , no doubt , by the fond theory that nothing hereabouts was changed . Nothing was , it could occasionally appear to me ? there was no new note in the picture , not one , for instance , when I paused before a low house in a small row on the south side of Waverley Place and lived again into the queer medieval costume ( preserved by the daguerreotypist 's art ) of the very little boy for whom the scene bad once embodied the pangs and pleasures of a Dame 's small school . The Dame must have been Irish , by her name , and the Irish tradition , only intensified and coarsened , seemed still to possess the place , the fact of the survival , the sturdy sameness , of which arrested me , again and again , to fascination . The shabby red house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " its dislocated ironwork of the forties , the early fifties , the record , in its face , of blistering summers and of the long stages of the loss of self-respect , made it as consummate a morsel of the old liquorscented , heated-looking city , the city of no pavements , but of such a plenty of polities , as I could have desired . And neighboring Sixth Avenue . overstraddled though it might be with feats of engineering unknown to the primitive age that otherwise so persisted , wanted only , to carry off the illusion , the warm smell of the bakery on the corner of Eighth Street , a blessed repository of doughnuts , cookies , cream-cakes and pies , the slow passing by which , on returns from school , must have had much in common with the experience of the shipmen of old who came , in long voyages , while they tacked and hung back , upon those belts of ocean that are haunted with the balm and spice of tropic islands . These were the felicities of the backward reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snubs ; nowhere quite so sharp as in presence , so to speak , of the rudely , the ruthlessly suppressed birth-house on the other side of the Square . That was where the pretence that nearly nothing was changed had most to come in ; for a high , square impersonal structure , proclaiming its lack of interest with a crudity all its own , so blocks , at the right moment for its own success , the view of the past , that the effect for me , in Washington Place , was of having been amputated of half ' my history . The gray and more or less " hallowed " University building ? was n't it somehow , with a desperate bravery , both castellated and gabled ? ? has vanished from the earth , and vanished with it the two or three adjacent houses , of which the birthplace was one . This was the snub , for the complacency of retrospect , that , whereas the inner sense had posi-tively erected there for its private contemplation a commemorative mural tablet , the very well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration that tablets , in New York , are unthinkable . And I have had indeed to permit myself this free fantasy of the hypothetic rescued identity of a given house ? taking the vanished number in Washington Place as most pertinent ? in order to invite the reader to gasp properly with me before the fact that we not only fail to remember , in the whole length of the city , one of these frontal records of birth , sojourn or death , under a celebrated name , but that we have only to reflect an instant to see any such form of civic piety inevitably and forever absent . The form is cultivated , to the greatly quickened interest of streetscenery , in many of the cities of Europe ; and is it not verily bitter , for those who feel a poetry in the noted passage , longer or shorter , here and there , of great lost spirits , that the institution , the profit , i the glory of any such association is denied in advance to communities tending , as the phrase is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , is the point of inserting a mural tablet , at any legible height , in a building certain to be destroyed to make room for a sky-scraper ? And from where , on the other hand , in a facade of fifty floors , does one " see " the pious plate recording the honor attached to one of the apartments look down on a responsive People ? We have but to ask the question to recognize our necessary failure to answer it as a supremely characteristic local note ? a note in the light of which the great city is projected into its future as , practically , a huge continuous fiftyfloored conspiracy against the very idea of the ancient graces , those that strike us as having flourished just in proportion as the parts of life and the signs of character have nal been lumped iogether , not been indistinguishably sunk in the common fund of mere economic convenience . So interesting , as objeetlessons , may the developments of the American gregarious ideal become ; so traceable , at every turn , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the finer texture of life , of a great commercial democracy seeking to abound supremely in its own sense and having none to gainsay it . Let me not , however , forget , amid such contemplations , what may serve here as a much more relevant instance of the operation of values , the price of the as yet undiminished dignity of the two most southward of the Fifth Avenue churches . Half the charm of the prospect , at that extremity , is in their still being there , and being as they are ; this charm , this serenity of escape and survival positively works as a blind on the side of the question of their architectural importance . The last shade of pedantry or priggishness drops from your view of that element ; they illustrate again supremely your grasped truth of the comparative character , in such conditions , of beauty and of interest . The special standard they may or may not square with signifies , you feel , not a jot : all you know , and want to know , is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has murmured it ? and that with them will go , if fate overtakes them , the last cases worth mentioning ( with a single exception , ) of the modest felicity that sometimes used to be . Remarkable certainly the state of things in which mere exemption from the " squashed " condition can shed such a glamour ; but we may accept the state of things if only we can keep the glamour undispelled . It reached its maximum for me , I hasten to add , on my penetrating into the Ascension , at chosen noon , and " standing for the first time in presence of that noble work of John La Barge , the representation , on the west wall , in the grand manner , of the theological event from which the church takes its title . Wonderful enough , in New York , to find oneself , in a charming and considerably dim " old " church , hushed to admiration before a great religious picture ; the sensation , for the moment , upset so all the facts . The hot light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the cool shade , within , with the important work of art shining through it , seemed part of some other-world pilgrimage ? all the more that the important work of art itself , a thing of the highest distinction , spoke , as soon as one had taken it in , with that authority which makes the difference , ever afterwards , between the remembered and the forgotten quest . A rich note of interference came , I admit , through the splendid window-glass , the finest of which , unsurpassably fine , to my sense , is the work of the same artist ; so that the church , as it stands , is very nearly as commemorative a monument as a great reputation need wish . The deeply pictorial windows , in which clearness of picture and fulness of expression consort so successfully with a tone as of magnified gems , did not strike one as looking into a yellow little square of the south ? they put forth a different implication ; but the flaw in the harmony was , more than anything else , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact that one could stand there , vibrating to such impressions , only to remember the suspended danger , the possibility of the doom . Here was the loveliest cluster of images , begotten on the spot , that the preoccupied city had ever taken thought to offer itself ; and here , to match them , like some black shadow they had been condemned to cast , was this particular prepared honor of " removal " that appeared to hover about them . One 's fear , I repeat , was perhaps misplaced ? but what an air to live in , the shuddering pilgrim mused , the air in which such fears are not misplaced only when we are conscious of very special reassurances ! The vision of the doom that does descend , that had descended all round , was at all events , for the halfhour , all that was wanted to charge with the last tenderness one 's memory of the transfigured interior . Afterwards , outside , again and again , the powers of removal struck me , as looming , awfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point . They , ranged in this terrible recent erection , were going to bring in money ? and was not money the only thing a self-respecting structure could be thought of as bringing in ? Had n't one heard , just before , in Boston , that the security , that the sweet serenity of the Park Street Church , charmingest , there , of aboriginal notes , the very light , with its perfect position and its dear old delightful Wren-like spire , of the starved city 's eyes , had been artfully practised against , and that the question of saving it might become , in the near future , acute ? Nothing , fortunately , I think , is so much the " making " of New York , at its central . point , for the visual , almost for the romantic , sense , as the Park Street Church is the making , by its happy coming-in , of Boston ; and , therefore , if it were thinkable that the peculiar rectitude of Boston might be laid in the dust , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience of New York ? Once such questions had obtained lodgment , to take one 's walks was verily to look at almost everything in their light ; and to commune with the sky-scraper under this influence was really to feel worsted , more and more , in any magnanimous attempt to adopt the emsthetic view of it . I may appear to make too much of these invidious presences , but it must be remembered that they represent , for our time , the only claim to any consideration other than merely statistical established by the resounding growth of New York . The attempt to take the ; esthetic view is invariably blighted sooner or later by their most salient characteristic , the feature that speaks loudest for the economic idea . Window upon window , at any cost , is a condition never to be reconciled with any grace , , of building , and the logic of the matter ; here happens to put on a particularly fatal front . If quiet interspaces , always t half the architectural battle , exist no more in such a structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blest breathing-spaces , occur , for the most part , in New York conversation , so the reason is , demonstrably , that the building ca n't afford them , ( It is by very much the same law , one supposes , that New York conversation can not afford stops . ) The building can only afford lights , each light having a superlative value as an aid to the transaction of business and the conclusion of sharp bargains . Does n't it take in fact acres of window-glass to help even an expert New-Yorker to get the better of another expert one , or to see that the other expert one does n't get the better of lam ? It is easy to conceive that , after all , with this origin and nature stamped upon q their foreheads , the last word of the ' mercenary monsters should not be their address to our sense of formal beauty . Still , as I have already hinted , there was always the case of the one other rescued identity and preserved felicity , the happy accident of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ungrudged , indeed , I seem to remember how I had heard that the divine little City Hall had been grudged , at II critical moment , to within an inch of its life ; had but just escaped , in the event , the extremity of grudging . It lives on securely , by the mercy of fate ? lives on in the delicacy of its beauty , speaking volumes again ( more volumes distinctly , than are anywhere else spoken ) for the exquisite truth of the conferred value of interesting objects , the value derived from the social , the civilizing function fur which they have happened to find their opportunity . It is the opportunity that gives them their price , and the luck of there being , round about them , nothing greater than themselves to steal it away from them . They strike thus , practically , the supreme note , and ? such is the mysterious play of our finer sensibility ! ? one takes this note , one is glad to work it , as the phrase goes , for all it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall , no doubt , in speaking of the spectacle there constituted as " divine " ; but I do it precisely by reason of the spectacle taken with the delightful small facts of the building : largely by reason , in other words , of the elegant , the gallant little structure 's situation and history , the way it has played , artistically , ornamentally , its part , has held out for the good cause , through the long years , alone and unprotected . The fact is it has been the very centre of that assault of vulgarity of which the innumerable mementos rise within view of it and tower , at a certain distance , over it ; and yet it has never parted with a square inch of its character , it has forced them , in a manner , to stand off . I hasten to add that in expressing thus its unconipromised state I speak of its outward , its aesthetic character only . So , at all events , it has discharged the civilizing function I just named as inherent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed of it , all the Style the community is likely to get , and of making itself responsible for the same . The consistency of this effort , under difficulties , has been the story that brings tears to the eyes of the hovering kindly critic , and it is through his tears , no doubt , that such a personage reads the best passages of the tale and makes out the proportions of the object . Mine , I recognize , did n't prevent my seeing that the pale yellow marble ( or whatever it may he ) of the City Hall has lost , by some late excoriation , the remembered charm of its old surface , the pleasant promiscuous patina of time ; but the perfect taste and finish , the reduced yet ample scale , the harmony of parts , the just proportions , the modest classic grace , the living look of the type aimed at , these things , with gayety of detail undiminished and " quaintness " of effect augmented , are all there ; and I see them , as I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a fine June morning , that I should somehow pay the whole place my respects . The simplest , in fact the only way , was , obviously , to pass under the charming portico and brave the consequences : this impunity of such audacities being , in America , one of the last of the lessons the repatriated absentee finds himself learning . The crushed spirit he brings back from European discipline never quite rises to the height of the native argument , the brave sense that the public , the civic building is his very own , for any honest use , so that he may tread even its most expensive pavements and staircases ( and very expensive , for the American citizen , these have lately become , ) without a question asked . This further and further unchallenged penetration begets in the perverted person I speak of a really romantic thrill : it is like some assault of the dim seraglio , with the guards bribed , the eunuchs drugged and one 's life carried in one 's hand . The only drawback to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail a little of a due impressiveness , and that if stationed sentinels are bad for the temper of the freeman they are good for the " prestige " of the building . Never , in any case , it seemed to me , had any freeman made so free with the majesty of things as I was to make on this occasion with the mysteries of the City Hall ? even to the point of coming out into the presence of the Representative of the highest office with which City Halls are associated , and whose thoroughly gracious condonation of my act set the seal of success upon the whole adventure , Its dizziest intensity , in fact , sprang precisely from the unexpected view opened into the old official , the old so thick-peopled local , municipal world : upper chambers of council and state , delightfully of their nineteenth-century time , as to design and ornament , in spite of rank restoration ; but replete , above all , with portraits of past worthies , past celebrities and city fathers , Mayors , Bosses , Presidents , Governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florid ghosts , looking so unsophisticated now , of years not remarkable , municipally , for the absence of sophistication . Here were types , running mainly to ugliness and all bristling with the taste of their day and the quite touching provincialism of their conditions , as to many of which nothing would be more interesting than a study of New York annals in the light of their personal look , their very noses and mouths and complexions and heads of hair ? to say nothing of their waistcoats and neckties ; with such color , such sound and movement would the thick stream of local history then be interfused . Would n't its thickness fairly become transparent i since to walk through the collection was not only to see.and feel so muclis that had happened , but to understand , with the truth again and again inimitably pointed , why nothing could have happened otherwise ; the whole array thus presenting itself as an unsurpassed demonstration of the real reasons of things . The florid ghosts look out from their exceedingly gilded frames ? all that Mai can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything ; their collective presence becomes a kind of copious telltale document signed with a hundred names . There are few of these that at this hour , I think , we particularly desire to repeat ; but the place where they may be read is , all the way from river to river and from the Battery to Harlem , the place in which there is most of the terrible town .
