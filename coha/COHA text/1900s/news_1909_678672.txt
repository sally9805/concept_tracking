txt STAMPS AND CONTAGION . Criticises Practice of Postal Clerks In Handing Them Out . In practically every Post Office in this city there is a practice that can spread contagion . When one buys stamps he nearly always has them passed out face upward . The other side , the gummed surface , is rubbed over the counter where fingers carrying every degree of dirt and probably carrying every germ In ' existence have rubbed at other times , pushing in money and pulling out stamps , and It is impossible that the mucilage does not catch up contagion , which Is carried straight to the tongue of many a person , Stamps are passed out this way now probably because the danger has not been brdught to the attention of the clerks , for I am sure every one of them would be willing to pass out the stamps the other side up . ( a habit that would take no more time. ) in order to do as much as he can to stop the spread of disease . A LICKER OF POSTAGE STAMPS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
