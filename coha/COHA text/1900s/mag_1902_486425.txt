Illuminating , but less personally significant essays upon Southey 's Letters , " New Lights on Milton , " and Anthony Trollope , need not detain us . The final paper in the series is an undercutting comment upon M. Joseph Texte 's recently translated Rousseau and the Cosmopolitan Spirit in Literature . ' Neither M. Texte nor Mr. Stephen is much concerned with that comprehensive view which considers all Christendom as a single federation working out in an age-long travail a world literature Rather , the point at issue involves that literary cosmopolitanism which , about the middle of the eighteenth century , appeared in the intellectual commerce of England and France . Without going to the lengths of that stout old Tory gentleman who held that " foreigners were fools , " Mr Stephen is inclined to discredit M. Texte 's elaborate theory of the growing interimfluence of the North and the South : he is disposed to take refuge behind his bulwark of narrow seas , and assert the integrity of national literatures . He would not deny to them many cosmopolitan affiliations  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Richardson met with in the hearts of three generations of Frenchmen  --  but he would consider this the result rather of the apt expression of an international mood than of any blending or decay of racial types It is , of course , quite impossible now , in mid-movement , to pr , i , dict infallibly the direction and end of our literary progress Mr. Stephen wisely leaves open the question of the effect of democracy upon letters . He recognizes that democratic literature " may represent wider sympathies and more genuine enthusiasms " ; yet he also has a fear that will not down lest democracy may , in the end , come to mean a society in which the individual is lost in the mass , occupied with a petty round of interests , and " incapable of appreciating refinement or high intellectual powers . " If such is to be the case , he thinks " there can be no doubt that literature also will become commonplace and vulgar , and so far alike throughout the world . " The history of past republics scarcely tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the past and the probable future of democracy is so vast that debate upon this point is beside the mark . Whatever the end , no one Is likely to dispute that in its present literary manifestations " the cosmopolitan spirit " is a source more often of weakness than of strength . It is this state of affairs that gives importance to Mr. Stephen 's sturdy reassertion of the impenetrability of the inner spirit of a national literature . Sundials and Roses of Yesterday By Alice Morse Earle . The Macmillan Co. 1902 ivo , pp. 461 . Mrs Earle gives reproductions of a selection numbering well over two hundred of her photographs of sundials , with a smaller number of those of roses , which , by the way , do not take so well . She has joined to the pictures first-hand information about the originals , has touched upon the subject of dialling , and glanced at sundry other topics d propos de bottes . The attractive element of the volume is the **31;187;TOOLONG perfume that lingers about the dials . A charm there certainly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector 's mania must be added to the ordinary interest in sundials before a person can read Mrs Earle 's volume right straight through without flagging She seems herself to feel that this is so , and endeavors to lend variety to the subject by chapters about roses , about Rosicrucians , about rural saints and prophets , with desultory passages not a few . But it is not the question whether a book has some dull pages or not , but how enjoyable it is at its best . As somebody says of a poet , it is not how many of his arrows go astray that counts , but whether any of them has struck the Dordonian oak , and sent a resounding shiver through all its limbs and branches . On the contrary principle , how many of the most delightful books  --  including all the old ones  --  would have to be condemned ! It is always the reader 's privilege to skip . Sundials and Roses of Yesterday ' is much of it very interesting reading to anybody , and all of it to somebody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety and still have described as many individual dials ' as she has done , without which the devotees of dials would have been dissatisfied . To our thinking she has been unduly afraid of being heavy and dry . As long , for example , as she deemed a chapter on dialling called for , why would it not have been better to procure its preparation from some adept in descriptive geomea try ? If Miss Charlotte Angus Scott or Mrs. Christine Ladfi Franklin could have been persuaded to lend this help , the elegance of their exposition of a problem  --  after all , not so rebarbative as it may be supposed before being fairly scanned  --  would haVe added a new grace to the book . To be sure , as it is , two rules are given for constructing a horizontal dial , of which the first is neat , were the rationale of it only made plain But there are no directions for any other form of dial than that least interesting , least beautiful  --  and we should add least useful one , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in the book is intended to bring the art of dialling to the level of the comprehension of Southern plantation negroes , and is a deplorable failure . It not only requires the poor fellow to know what latitude is , but also to lay off an angle equal to that latitude Neither requirement was necessary ; and after all he wo n't get a good dial Mrs Earle tells of simple dials that give the time without danger of more than four minutes ' error , as experience shows . But does she remember that the penumbra always causes the reading of the time to be about a minute too near to noon , an effect that diffraction considerably increases , while refraction always acts in the same direction and may add two minutes more to the error , that the equation of time sometimes exceeds sixteen minutes , and that the difference between local and standard time may be half an hour ' ? Let all these act in the same way , as they sometimes will , and they foot up to more than four minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nowadays , when there are railway trains to catch and dentists to pay for any unpunctuality on our part in keeping our appointments with them , and the fashion originally set by time and tide of waiting for no man has been generally followed , the sundial has been degraded to an educational device . It is true that if , instead of observing a shadow , one observes an image formed by a lens , and observes it with a microscope , and , in place of the sun , uses a number of stars , high and low , correcting for level , azimuth , and collimation , then indeed our dial becomes a modern astronomical transit , and is the most precise possible instrument for correcting a clock or chronometer , though not exactly handy for direct use in catching a train . For that purpose , a good watch that has recently been compared at noon at any telegraph office is preferable . Very tolerable clocks had for centuries been in common use when Galileo first watched the swinging lamp in Pisa Cathedral . Yet it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradistinction to every variety of sun time ) came to be universally employed ; and no mechanical clock or watch could keep pace with the inequalities of the sun in any satisfactory manner . Consequently , when we see an old wall dial , though its age be but two centuries , we may be reasonably sure that it had , in its day , an honest utility . It is an individual to be respected . But what , pray , is a horizontal dial in the garden of a modern gentleman of business but a despicable lump of affectation ? Does he permit any member of his household , if he can help it , to esteem time of so little worth as to be measured out in hours ? The author 's extreme dread of being dry or heavy is illustrated in the chapter on Rosicrucians , concerning whom , she informs us , she has read very much , and concerning whom so little that is really solid has ever been written  --  enough , however , to make it the business- of any chapter on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin to a lie concocted about A. D. 1600 by Johann Valentinus Andrea , alias Basilicas Valentinus , alias Florentinus de Valentia , etc. , and Johann Tholde of Frankenhausen . With all her learning on the subject , Mrs. Earle should have known that something like this was the case ; but the glamour of mystery has been sweeter to her than the plain truth . From something said in the preface , we were led to hope that this chapter would be ushered in by a reproduction of the rare and fine bookplate of the " liebliche Bruderschaft des himmlichen Rosenkreutz " of Andrea and Tholde , with its view of heaven and hell . But we found only a decorative rose . Two on their Travels . By Ethel Colquhoun With eight colored plates , sixteen full-page and numerous text illustrations by the Authoress . A S Barnes &; Co 1902 8vo , pp. xvi. , 212 . The motive of this bride in describing her wedding journey is " to add . a tiny bit of mirth and enjoyment from my own superabundant store to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the full tide of that new happiness which - invests even familiar scenes with an unwonted charm , she would have been successful if she had not left her native shores ; but when it is " the golden window of the East " which she opens to her " shut-in " readers , their enjoyment is assured She has other qualifications for her task , however , than that of an unselfish motive . Possessing both literary and artistic skill in an unusual degree , her bright , vivacious word-pictures are accompanied by numerous sketches , some of which in color are exceedingly attractive . Naturally she leaves the discussion of the serious topics which a journey in the East inevitably suggests , to her husband , the well-knOwn traveller and ' author , Archibald Colquhoun , and dwells upon the trivial , every-day sights which , after all , constitute the chief enjoyment of a visit to foreign lands . Digressions , grave and gay , are numerous , but even when they take the formed severe criticism , as of American manners , an underlying mirthfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tra.vels ? has that indefinable charm which the companionship of an entertaining woman who has seen much of the world always gives . After a somewhat startlingly familiar introduction of herself and " Andrew " to her readers , her narrative takes them from Singapore to Java , " the garden of the East , " and from thence to Borneo , the Philippines , " the land of sunsets , " and Japan , " the playground . " She is mostly occupied with amusing descriptions of scenery , costumes , her fellow-travellers , life in inns and on the sea , and several adventurous experiences . Now and then there is a remark of , a more serious nature , as that the Dutch in Borneo , " a country rich in oil , coal , diamonds , gold , timber , gutta , and many other valuables , " seemed a great failure . " There is a sleepy , decadent , stagnant , rotting air everywhere " In the Philippines she is surprised at the size of the towns " and the number of good houses they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large churches , two colleges for boys and girls ( all well built of stone ) , a theatre , made of wood but one place we saw one of the saints from the church , which , in honor of the Americans , had been rudely dressed to represent the statue of Liberty in New York harbor . Spikes of gilded paper were round its head , and one absurd wooden arm was raised , holding a baton . " A more encouragmg sight was a village school with its rows of little girls with small brown faces and twinkling dark eyes , with clean- and freshly starched clothes , and the American soldier teacher , who - " called on one damiel after another to translate alternately in Spanish and English the stereotyped remarks about uncles , nephews , gardens , wives , pens and ink . " Mrs. Colquhoun 's general impression is apparently summed up in the statement that " the United States is leavening the whole lump with the spirit of utilitarianism and progress . " Two American girls were her companions during this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass through the islands after the American occupation , and as many of the young officers at distant stations had seen no women-kind for eighteen months or more , they fell easy victims to the charms of the sisters , who left a track of bleeding hearts behind them Usually , on returning froin a visit to the shore , they were followed by detachments of orderlies bearing curios of all kinds , of which the young fellows stripped their quarters to present to the belles . On one occasion Sadie returned almost empty-handed , and , in reply to my question as to ' loot , ' said scornfully : ' These men are not the giving sort ; they 're only the promising sort . Still , ' she added pensively , ' I left my address ' " Her enjoyment is at its height in the " quaint , beautiful , picturesque country " of Japan ; and the descriptions of its life , and particularly of the women , their dress and occupations , are among the most interesting in the book .

' " The homeward journey was by the Siberian Railway , and if Mrs Colquhoun is to be trusted , eastern Siberia is not prosperous The harbor of Vladivostok , " which used to be dotted thickly with vessels , was almost devoid of them and trade was being driven to Talienwan . " In the interior were some isolated towns , and " here and there a few log huts , twenty or thirty people , and a few cattle , and then for miles silence and emptiness . . . .

" Many brown wooden towns  --  better built than any we had seen before , with little flower-gardens and plots of vegetables  --  are scattered over this country , " and the two days ' journey in European Russia to Moscow was through one enormous cornfield . Mrs Colquhoun takes her readers back with her to London , and closes her genial chronicle with a kindly wish to her friends , " known and unknown , " that they may have " voyages as fortunate as ours , and hearts as light to enjoy . " China and the Chinese . By Herbert Allen Giles . Macmillan Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foremost - living English scholar in Chinese to inaugurate the foundation , by Gen Horace W. ? arpentier , of the Dean Lung chair of Chinese . Without pretence of advancing Chinese scholarship , but rather to arouse interest in a subject of increasing importance , the English professor of Chinese at Cambridge sends forth this volume at the request of the authorities of Columbia University . The study of the oldest and most populous empire on earth suffers from the same disadvantage as does the earlier history of New York as treated by Diedrich Knickerbocker . The ludicrous side of China and her civilization was the one which first attracted the attention of foreigners , and to a great extent it does so still . The study of similarities and identities with the facts of ancient European life and with the modern Occident not only shoWs more and more the common humanity of the peoples East and West , but demonstrates that , from similar circumstances and forces , similar results will issue . On this principle Dr. Giles has proceeded throughout . Happily , he is thoroughly familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handles every one of Ins chosen subjects with such consummate ease that we imagine some of his readers will suspect the depth of his scholarship ; yet many a writer might envy his absolute mastery of his themes . This book makes easy reading , even for a boy or girl As for the ludierous situations , they often occur in China because Chinese customs are violated by ignorant foreigners . ' For example , the invariable cup of tea served to a visitor on arrival is not intended for ordinary drinking Purposes , for which ' wine is usually provided . To drink this tea is to give the signal for departure . Hence Chinese servants , unless previously warned of the funny ways of the alien , will at once give- a shout to the bearers to be ready with the sedan chair . Indeed , when the time is up and the host has engagements elsewhere , he may , without breach of good manners , be the first to drink , thus delicately dropping a hint to his guest that time is valuable even in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China to read in the delightful chapter on Chinese manners and customs . With masterly ease and scholarly thoroughness , are discussed in the six chapters , the Chinese language , the national body of literature , democratic China , and Taoism , which last , take it all in all , is , in critical acumen , historic , and especially chronological accuracy , proof of critical acquaintance and power of interpretation , and freedom from prejudice , one of the best discussions of the subject that we know of The fourth lecture is a suggestive and illuminating comparison between China and ancient Greece . The author gives us a good index , and closes his very readable work with a plea for a serious and systematic examination of the modes of thought and manners and customs of the Chinese people , in place of the silly stuff of which we have a plethora in the works even of visitors to the ' country itself . On one point , those who love the beautiful ideograms of China will grieve . Despite good print , paper , and binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's pen strokes ( and Dr Giles is very far from being a calligraphist in Chinese ) , there should not be in the wealthy city of New York a font of Chinese type with intelligent workmen to use it . When shall our boastful country have a tithe of the resources of Leipzig or Leyden in this respect ? Masterpieces of Greek Literature . Boston : Houghton , Mifflin &; Co . Such is the title of a book of selections from well-Imown translations of eighteen Greek writers , from Homer to Lucian . It is under the " supervising editorship " of Prof J. H Wright of Harvard , whose name appears alone on the back and title-page of the volume Professor Wright contributes an " Introduction " of eight pages , which is , we need hardly say , scholarly and suggestive , and very unlike the usual perfunctory " foreword . " With it Professor Wright 's responsibility ends The selections were made , and the biographical and other notes were written , by Miss Clara Seymour , " with the counsel of her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work , which is an evidence of Bryn Mawr scholarship , appears , therefore , under the of both Harvard and Yale . This is not the place in which to raise the question of the possibility of a satisfactory translation of a Greek masterpiece . For the student of history and philosophy , such a translation as Jo vett 's Plato or Jebb 's Thucydides serves . all the purposes of the original . For the student of literature it does not A translation , then , can reproduce statements of fact , and , in the hands of a master of English prose , can rise to the level of the classic  --  an English , classic The cases in which this has occurred can be counted on the fingers of one hand For the translation of Greek poetry is needed a scholar who has the instinct of a poet , but when the rare combination arises , when the scholar has the poetic imagination , like Matthew Arnold , or the poet is scholarly , as in the case of Mr Swinburne , his feeling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Swinburne 's paraphrases , if anywhere , that the ashes of Sappho burn again But even Swinburne despaired of an adequate translation of the Odes . " Immortal Venus , throned above , " - begins Merivale 's version of the first ode , " To Aphrodite , " reproduced by Miss Seymour . " My feeble pulse forgot to play " is a line from Phillips 's rendering of the ode of which Longinus said that it was a " congress of the passions . " The Sapphic metre is not even attempted , and the language and the emotions it inspires are equally frigid . Yet , since Swinburne carefully wove his paraphrases into his own verse so that they can not be used for quotation , Miss Seymour has offered the general reader the best at her disposal . We can only assure him that these versions express Sappho about as nearly as Pope expresses Homer . The case of Homer is notorious . The benefit of a verse translation of Homer rests with the translator . Miss Seymour reproduces portions of Bryant 's Iliad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , is all that one can say of Bryant and Worsley . Miss Seymour includes the whole of Mrs. Browning 's " Prometheus Bound " and Plumptre 's " Antigone , " with nearly the whole of the " Alcestis " in Browning 's transcript . These versions are at least alive , and are nearly always scholarly . The selections have been well made , and the biographical and other notes are clearly written and sufficient for the general reader , to whom we heartily recommend the volume . Siories in Stone from the Roman Forum . By Isabel Lovell . Illustrated . The Macmillan Co " This book , " said a girlish critic to whom it was submitted , " is written in words of one syllable " The title might suggest to the general reader a learned treatise on dusty archmology , but if he takes it up reluctantly he will not willingly lay it down ; and if he has ever tried for himself to investigate , under a pitiless Italian sky , the intricate ruins of the Forum , he will breathe a sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . The style of the book is clear and readable , but so elementary as to make one feel that it was written for children . It has withal something of that rhetorical manner which people needlessly employ for such readers . Sometimes ( as on page 141 ) the description bursts into the form of rather declamatory dialogue , with such appeals as " Ldok once more , I pray thee . Doth no one come ? " The first chapter explains the uses of the Forum , with helpful bits of history woven in , and the reader who has left the classics behind with his school days will gladly have his memory so ' easily and pleasantly refreshed The last chapter de-scribes the Forum 's streets , and the gorgeous processions which once passed through them , while the intervening chapters are chiefly devoted to the temples formerly erected there Our author has a little unconscious trick of sometimes relating miracles , and the old legends of the interference of gods in earthly affairs , as if they were purely historic . Truly poetry and history are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disentangle them , yet the seeming statement of tradition as fact might well puzzle a child reader . But the book is , at any rate , the history of Rome in a nutshell , giving vivid pictures of the heroic days , tinted with the entrancing colors of the old mythology . The illustrations give a good idea of the present ruins , but the plates showing " restorations " of buildings may . perhaps , be a little confusing to young leaders who do not understand that these restorations are imaginary only  --  a fact which even the preface does not state in so many words One would like to know , also , whether the very imposing list of " authorities " which opens the book represents writers consulted in the original or only at second-hand . The Soul of a People By H. Fielding Hall . Macmillan . 1902 . Neither the popularity of the subject nor the scholarship of the author can account for the welcome accorded to this book , which in four years is already in its fourth edition It is rather the remoteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the chief factor is the author 's spirit He does not know much about Buddhism as a system , but he is familiar with Burmese Buddhism as a working religion , and , seeing its influence upon a light-hearted population , he is fascinated by it and joys in it , till , out of the fulness of his joy and wonder , he tells us about it , simply , affectionately , and so effectively This is the charm of the book ; its naive ignorance and idealization are ' almost childish , but the unaffected earnestness of the writer makes good the ignorance , for it calls attention to facts of Buddhism that are often neglected . Thus the net result is rather a gain , even to the scholar who marvels to hear any man say of Buddhism that " it stands alone here amongst all religions , pure from the tinsel of miracle , " while the learned are still discussing whether the miracles of Buddhism were loaned to Christianity Again , our author says that a Buddhist monk enters a monastery " to prepare his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heaven , and that to the Buddhist " the great God lives far behind his laws , " whereas Buddhism knows no law save Karma , and has no God at all . And if Mr. Hall chooses to call Buddhism an optimism , not a pessimism , lie does so by changing the meaning of these terms . To him , the Buddhist lives " in a real world , and knows it is good , " but Buddha himself knew that it was evil . When Mr. Hall goes further afield and cites ( on page 190 ) from the " laws of Mann " verses which are not found in Menu , we are not surprised , but only wonder why this apocrypha is deemed necessary to the discussion . Yet this false citation is typical of the historical inaccuracy that obtains throughout the book . The reason is not far to seek . Mr. Hall 's Buddhism is not Buddhism , it is the gentle Burmese caricature of Buddhism . Even our author admits this , saying finally of the Burmese villager that " he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to all Buddhism in this matter " ( of life after death ) . So at last we have the secret : the " Soul of a People " is the soul of Burma , and this is of great interest . But it is an error on the part of the author to exploit as Buddhism throughout the book what at the end even he confesses is not Buddhism at all . Take away pessimism and the hope of eternal extinction , and what Buddhism have we left ? A belief in Both , heaven , meeting with loved ones hereafter , a great and good God ? it is no wonder that such a belief touches a sympathetic chord . This is " Buddhism " in Burma . But this is the belief that Buddha thought he had demolished forever The Story of Verona By Alethea Wiel London ? J M Dent &; Co. ; New York : Macmillan . Pp viii , 314 . It is good to be reminded once in a while how superlatively interesting is such a city as Verona  --  a " city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marble in the Middle-Ages , ' " perhaps more than any other in northern Italy charms the cultivated traveller by the beauty , interest , and grandeur of its buildings . " When one considers that Mr. Street , was utterly blind to all beauty in architecture that did not date from a certain limited epoch , and that his estimate ignores a full half of what delights the " cultivated traveller " of to-day , when one recalls , moreover , that Verona was the seat of an important school of painting , and that its history is , like that of Siena , Perugia , and many another of the minor cities of Italy , brimful of picturesque and thrilling incident  --  one is only too thankful for the handy volume that marshals these riches conveniently for review - It forms one of the " Mediaeval Town Series , " and , without being either the best or the worst of that series , it is still a very creditable performance . Without any pretence of original research , and for the most part relying upon books that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to art ? Mrs. oriel has given a resume of the story of Verona , an account of its treasures of architecture and painting , that constitute an agreeable supplement to the ordinary vade-mecum Those who are fortunate enough to linger a few days in the fair city on the Adige may find their advantage in the use of her careful and conscientious compilation . The volume is very prettily illustrated from drawings by Melly Erichsen and Helen M James , as well as by halftone reproductions of pictures of the Veronese school , and its value is considerably enhanced by a good index . At the same time , it should be acknowledged that Mrs. Wiel 's work has the defects incident to its qualities , as well as some others less respectably connected Conscientious people are rather given to " sitting on the fence , " and our author is one of those not above this weakness . She is continually admitting that there are two opinions as to this or that bit of history , archaeology , art or tradition , without ever trying to establish which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defect of a quality than the shady side of a shining virtue ' we sometimes wish it remained with her on the occasions when she " knows her own mind . " The woman in her perhaps aiding , she can be quite certain about one of her own sex . No doubt Samaritana da Polenta , wife of Antonio della Scala , had her share of human frailty : she was of the family whence came Francesca da Rimini , but , perhaps too much influenced by that consideration , we hesitate to condemn her altogether , although we have Mrs. Wiel 's word for it that her taste in jewelry was " ridiculous  --  not to say vulgar , " and that , though she was alone among the wives of Veronese rulers to encourage literature and the arts , " she was in reality too vain and frivolous to care for learning for its own sake . " This case of downrightness is , however , almost unique . Of another sort is a statement that amused us more than was perhaps intended The writer is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she puts it into the index , and in one place says of it : " This tufo ' must be cut from the quarries in summer , when it hardens into such solidarity the italics are ours as to make it well-nigh everlasting " in general , we have not to reproach her with either excessive severity or undue liberties with her vocabulary . Her careful compilation is fairly correct , is , moreover , readable , and the author 's want of decision about disputed points is , we repeat , commendable in a work that makes no pretence to original research . Its chief failing is amateurishness , and its second , the liberal crop of misprints that disfigures its pages . The latter may be mended in a succeeding edition , the former must be left to the discipline of future work . The tendency to the repetition of pet turns of expression , to the occasional brief bursts of fine writing , to a gentle inanity of commentary , and to the use of certain inelegancies of speech , will disappear under the correcting influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Builders and Later Indians . By Gerard Fowkes Published by the Ohio State Archnological and Historical Society . Columbus , 1902. 8vo , pp xvi , 760 . In Ohio are found the most remarkable of the works attributed to those ancient Americans called the Mound Builders , and here , too , is the field of much that is important and interesting in our later aboriginal history . Probably more nonsense has been written about the Mound Builders than about any other people that ever existed , the " Ten Lost Tribes of Israel " not excepted Fables of " a lost civilization , " " geometrical instruments , " " a compact civil organization , " " myriads of people , " " magnificent cities , " " an extensive empire , " have been rolled from writer to writer , increasing like a snowball as they progressed , until there are many intelligent persons who believe that there dwelt in the Ohio Valley an intellectual and civilized race vastly superior to and totally different from our Red Indians . Hence it is gratifying in the highest degree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present work the facts as they exist , and the conclusion to which they inevitably lead : " Nothing yet discovered proves for any of the Mound Builders a higher intellectual capacity than is , or was , possessed by more than one well-known tribe of American Indians . " To the demonstration of this thesis Mr Fowkes gives two-thirds of his book , analyzing , ridiculing , and demolishing the reckless statements of many a romancing predecessor , and establishing beyond cavil such points as these : To erect the works required neither great skill , large numbers , nor long time . The artifects found in the mounds do not in any particular surpass those picked up on the surface and known to be the work of the recent Indians . In no particular were the Mound Builders in advance of many known tribes The " math ematical fig except those at Newark , are of the rudest character .

It is distinctly refreshing to find a book so accurate and sane in treatment of this mania-producing subject Here is , however , no history of the Mound Builders , for this author is no more able than his predecessors to tell us who or when they were , nor why they constructed such extraordinary works . The Indian history of the State where was , as now seems probable , the early home of the Siouans , and perhaps also of the Iroquoians , as ignored , and we pass from the Mound Builders to a brief account of the recent Indians and a long account of their stone implements , including a good description of the famous Flint Ridge , the chief armory of the Indian . Excellent as this book is , the author 's zeal in demolishing venerable fables leads him by mere momentum to overrun his objective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , both the sensible and the foolish To those early and industrious workers , Squier and Davis , Mr Fowkes does try , not always with success , to be just ; but in exploiting his rather neat vein of sarcasm he treats Messrs Shaler and Putnam with no more respect than if they were the " silly " Larkin or Hosea of the mighty imagination When Mr. Fowkes reads his own book critically he will discover that hens not infallible himself . Yet , all in all , his is a valuable book , and , if properly circulated , will do much to substitute in the popular mind fact for romance concerning our Mound Builders and later Indians . It is a great pity that such excellent matter is not presented in better print and binding We do not know who prepared the Bibliography found in an appendix .

But the minute homesteads whose boundaries cover France with infinitesimal reticulations , constitute a record of struggles of another kind prolonged for almost twenty centuries : struggles to subdue the earth , to win bread , to maintain the family , to secure a , refuge against adversity . One of these little heritages is an epitome of man 's life ; one can not think without emotion of the many generations that have come and gone upon it , that have bathed it with the sweat of their brows and enriched it with infinite toil , that have loved it with consuming devotion and parted from it with bitter tears To trace its history , to asses Less. - the forces that affect it , to predict its future , are pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most engaging qualities of that amiable people .

Hence it is no slight task to select what is valuable from the confused mass ; but whoever has patience will be rewarded . The author has analyzed with care a great number of statistical returns bearing upon the size of properties , the number of proprietors , the causes and effects of subdivision , the influences which favor the acquisition of land , and those which are adverse . We can not even enumerate his conclusions , and must content ourselves with referring to some of the most important of them . Two things are especially impressive : the intense desire of the French to possess land and to maintain the family , and the frightful obstacles which their oppressive Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of the invaluable political training which local government gives , and they are altogether incapable of resisting their centralized administration . There are local councils , it is true , but they have few powers , and their action is regulated from Paris It is only natural that the ambition to be connected with this all-powerful central Government should displace that generous passion which we call public spirit It is indeed surprising that where the Government assumes control of so great a part of human activity , there should be so much of private benevolence as is displayed It is not surprising that where the exactions of Government are so severe , most Frenchmen concentrate their energies on providing what they can for their families . The processes by which the more than fourteen million rural properties in France are constantly uniting and dividing resemble the processes of nutrition and waste in a living organism The system of entail provided by the Code compels incessant partition ; there are 10,500,000 properties of less than two hectares , and 2,175,000 over two and under six . The number of proprietors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rural property through death. - The number of small properties does not increase , because the Government confiscates much of their value by taxation , and the owners are forced to sell them . The expense of partition under the Code is estimated by this author at from one-fifth to two-fifths of the value of the properties . When there are minor heirs , judicial partition or sale is compulsory . From 8 to 10 per cent . of the heritages are estimated at less than 500 francs , and the expenses of administration exceed this sum . The cost of ordinary sales is almost prohibitive . There are other deplorable features in the situation , but we need not specify them The declining birth-rate and the drift of population to the cities are the inevitable results of the fiscal policy here described . As to those who suffer from it , we heartily agree with the author when he exclaims : " N'est-elle pas admirable , cette race de travailleurs qui , en depit des obstacles , des deceptions , persiste , giandit , se perp  --  tue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meilleur du miel et qui ne se lassent pas de produire pour autrui . " Elementary Studies tie Insect Life . By Samuel J Hunter , A. M , Associate Professor of Comparative Zoology and Entomology , University of Kansas . Topeka , Kansas : Crane &; Co. 1902. - In this book the author has abandoned traditional lines , and , instead of telling first about the characters that distinguish the Insecta , he plunges at once into the life cycle , devoting to it one of the longest chapters in the hook , so far as number of pages is concerned ; but ten of these pages consist of a series of figures illustrating the complete life cycle of one insect The special senses are lightly touched , protective devices receive a somewhat fuller consideration , while solitary and social life ( chiefly among the bees , wasps , and other Hymenoptera ) are given two chapters Instinct and reason are very briefly treated , but the author credits ' bees and wasps , at least , with reasoning powers . The mutual relations of plants and insects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Class are grouped according to the character of the affected crops . Methods and apparatus for collecting and studying , and structure and classification of insects , are condensed into less than eighty pages , of which seventeen give in tabular form the distinctive characters of the larger groups of insects . An appendix of thirty-one pages treats very briefly of injurious insects and modes of dealing with them Altogether , the book is interesting and informing , covering just the ground expressed by the author in the title . It will be useful for those who want a general knosiledge of the peculiarities of insect life and development , and the author has an easy style that makes reading pleasant . The pictures are mostly half-tones , and a large number of them are distinctly poor Some that are made from drawings ( 103 , 115 , 119 ) are inaccurate in outline or detail , and others are obscure and much inferior to published pictures of the same species . Why the unsymmetrical , vaguely outlined representation of the buffalo moth beetle on p. 149 was preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Department of Agriculture , passes understanding . The type is clear and the print fair , but not good enough for the numerous half-tones that are scattered through the text .
