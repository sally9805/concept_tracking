txt Bradstreet 's index of staple prices reveals the same sort of moderation under a boom as does the security market . It will be remembered that now as on previous occasions tli$ seourity market has reflected something like a horror of a maximum average range of prices , and has recoiled from it whenever approached . No excellence of intrinsic conditions  --  which never were higher than they seem tcylay  --  has sufficed to tempt overtrading and a riot of speculation . Not once has the average of prices passed the average of values . The market has repeatedly reflected or discounted all sorts of sentimental things which have occurred , and more which have not , but it has conspicuously failed either to reflect or discount such an undeniable and persistent factor of values as intrinsic conditions of undiminished excellence through years . Since this is not the characteristic course of stook markets there are only two things to which it can be attributed  --  benevolent control by conservative forces , or less altruistic pressure by advocates of lower prices . Now come the figures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing appears . They reached their recent maximum on New Year 's and receded , although conditions of trade would have warranted an advance . They turned upward again and approached the new year level in June , and now they open the closing semester with a downward dip And yet so moderate is the price boom under unprecedented conditions of activity of trade that the highest level in ** with a previous maximum of 8.2307 so long ago as February , 1900 . The minimum since then has been 7.4181 . In other words , for six years there has been nothing worthy the name reaction , nor anything like a runaway market . The safety and sanity of the commodity market during the recent period best appears by comparison with the record of earlier years and by contrast with the vagaries of the stock market taken from The Wall Street Journal : Commodity Index .

It would be hard to ask better proof of an elevated plateau of prosperity . This necessarily has been reflected in intrinsic conditions , suitable to affect the security market . The prices above are selected so that each period includes one of the recent semi-panics corresponding to nothing fundamental . It is true that throughout the years runs a trend upward . So far the Wall Street barometer has been useful . But it must be admitted that it has been more nervous than truthful . It has responded more to squalls of no significance to seaworthy craft than to settled trade winds . The commodity index has been truer to basic facts and prospects .

Looking at the combined record the inference seems warranted that in these later days the security market has been alternately a plaything and a big stick , forfeiting something of its prestige as either a reflector or discounter of realities . Wall Street has been rather a battlefield than a market , more a place for manoeuvres , stratagems , and spoils than for registering honest differences of opinion or the probable development of facts .
