txt Japan 's peace terms were presented today by Baron Komura to the Russian envoys , who had them turned into cl-. pher and cabled to St. Petersburg . The conference adjourned to await the ' Czar 's answer . It is Said to-night that there is nothing about the demands which shcrsys.the uselessness of further consideration . " They are terms which can be die -- cussed , " was the way one of the Bus ; 5151:1$ put it . A feature of the demands which . agreeably surprised the Russians was the matter of indemnity . That . it . had been feared , would prove the chief , stumbling block , for Russia is not willing even to consider a punitive indemnity . Japan , while insisting on a Money . indemnity as a matter of principle , left , the amount blank . The expected . ' demand of from $750,000,000 to *1,000. - 000,000 did not some . The Japanese simply asked that Russia should assent to the principle that a money indemnity should be paid and that , this : point being conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject for discusgion between the en ! voys . No one here is willing to bazard , a , guess whether the Czar 's Goverzunetit will accept the terms or not . Should they be refused , the coiiterextc &-; probably come to an immediate end , for the Japanese are not willing to take as a basis for negotiation anything less than their original demands . Financiers May Urge Peace . The impression is strong here that the money markets of the world will exert pressure on Russia to prevent her from breaking off the negotiations . Financial interests are watching the conference closely . According to Mr. Sato , the conference will not be resumed before Monday . Mr. Korostovetz is not so sure of that , and thinks it possible that it will be resumed on Saturday . The Czar 's reply will not necessarily be sent immediately on his receipt of the demands . He is in possession of the opinions of two eminently qualified experts , M. de Martens , who is a great authority on international law , and M. Pokotiloff , the Russian Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the express purpose of advising the Russian Commissioners on just such matters , were summoned to the Navy Yard by M. Witte as soon as he had received the Japanese demands , and their opinions , as well as 2M . Witte 's , were cabled to the Czar . The note containing the Japanese demands was short and the points were stated tersely . The Russians went to the conference in the full conviction that they were to receive a long document containing demands of such a nature that the prolongation of the conference would be seen at once to be useless . While they expect to contest the demands , they are pleased that their first supposition proved to be unfounded . There is unquestionably a better feel- , lag on both sides as the result of the day 's developments . The Japanese , who were quite prepared to have any I demand they might make dismissed as impossible by the Russians , are some , . what better disposed toward their adversaries since they have learned the contrary . Japanese Admire Russians . A statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Russia , was made to-day by Mr. Matsumoto , a member of the Japanese Parliament . He said that he accompanied Marquis Ito to Russia five years ago for the purpose of forming an alliance between his country and Russia . The Russians did not have the respect for Japan which they have lately acquired , and Marquis Ito 's proposition was declined . The Japanese subsequently made their alliance with ; Great Britain . " The Russians are a fine people , " he added . " They are hospitable and , generous , and we like them . " Eijiro Takasugi , Professor of Eng- ! lish at the Imperial University of To-1 kio , who has just concluded a postgraduate course at Harvard , and is to return to Japan this month , had a lengthy conference last night with Mr. Sato and afterward expressed most optimistic views as to the outcome of the negotiations . " The Portsmouth conference will end in a treaty of peace , " he said . " The conference may be long drawn cut , but Russia must in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do otherwise . Russia has fought until she can fight no longer . Japan has gained an impregnable position and can dictate terms . There is no escape for the Muscovite . " Of course , I do not know absolutely what Japan 's terms will be , but I think I can tell very nearly what my country 's representatives are likely to ask . One condition will be the immediate evacuation of Manchuria . Another will be the cession of Sakhalin . Vladivostok will also be demanded . Certainly an indemnity will be asked . A defeated nation is always forced to pay an indemnity at the end of a war . " It is to be expected that the Russian envoys will protest against such terms . They may almost refuse to continue negotiations , but Baron Komura and Mr. Takahira will not be deceived by such tactics . They will be immovable , and An the end Russia 's representatives will give what is Asked . " The Russian people will undoubtedly look upon the terms of peace as dishonorable and there will be much dissatisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative Assembly . This will be simply a travesty on representative government and after two or three years even this solace will be taken away from the people . It will , however , have served its purpose .
