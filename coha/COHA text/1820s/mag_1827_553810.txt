Wells &amp; Lilly* AMONG the results , which have already grown out of the revolutions in South America , the mining speculations and enterprises hold a place not the least conspicuous . The thirst for gold , and the glowing visions of treasures buried in the mountains of the New World , which impelled the Spaniards to their original conquests and discoveries , are again revived , and made the efficient springs of hazard and adventure . New regions are explored , and new El Dorados sought after . By a happy issue of events , however , there has been a great change in the motives and means of searching for mineral treasures . The first acts of the Spaniards were bloody and cruel ; their subsequent oppressions were an outrage equally upon humanity , justice , and freedom . Gold was coveted to pamper the pride and luxury of a few , to giv.e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a haughty nobility . The world has profited little by the gains of Spain from her colonies , and the nation itself has been ruined by the excess of its ill gotten treasure . Gold has done for degraded Spain what the arms of the foe could never do , and from the influence of this cause more than all others , she now finds herself at the bottom of the scale of nations , dragged along at the very heels of the improvements of the present age , the derision of enlightened men , and the pity of those , in all parts of Europe , who are still struggling to smother the lights of liberty and intelligence , and to support the falling fabric of legitimacy . But very different ends are now proposed , and different means pursued , in disinterring the precious metals . The chains of slavery are broken , free governments established , and the mining operations thrown open to individual enterprise , and protected as an important branch of national industry . With these encouragements , companies have been formed , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern republics . Various success will attend their efforts , but the results on the whole can not fail to be exceedingly beneficial , not only to these republics themselves , but to the whole world . The metals thus hrou*ht to light will be immediately put into direct and speedy channels of commerce , and // will give an impulse to trade , and secure a confidence , which could only be derived from a substantial currency . In this respect it is of no consequence whose capital , or whose labor , is employed , in digging up and coining the precious metals ; the great purpose is attained when these are actually put in circulation . Hence the general advantage will be the same , whether the mines are wrought by foreign companies , individuals , or the governments in whose territories they are found . It should be the policy of these governments , indeed , to put the mines into such hands , or , which is the same thing , to afford encouragements that will naturnlly bring them into such hands , as can apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus far this policy has been in the main adhered to by the larger portion of the republics , although some symptoms of jealousy and ignorance have occasionally been manifested . A party in the Mexican congress had a project for imposing a heavy tax on the exportation of silver , but a majority was opposed to it . Such a scheme would be extremely unwise , inasmuch as the tax would fall on those engaged in working the mines , and in many cases increase the expense so much , as to render it impossible to carry on the work without loss . It is plainly the interest of all the new republics to give every facility to this branch of industry , for it is one which in the shortest time will communicate life , energy , and effect to all the other branches . That there will be many dreams and wild speculations , disappointed hopes , and ruinous undertakings in this business of mining , is to be expected . There is sufficient uncertainty connected with the subject , and yet sufflci*nt promise of bright things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination captive . Many will be amused with the beautiful castles they build in the air , and be led away by the delusions of their own fancy . This has always been the case in mining operations , and among those who have followed this profession , it is probable that ten have been ruined , to one who has been made rich . In this pursuit , however , as in every other , there is security in caution ; failure has commonly sprung from desperate hazard , or has followed unwarranted expectation . Companies are as likely to be misled in this way as individuals , and it may be safely calculated , that some of those , which have engaged with eagerness recently in the mining schemes of South America , will have their anticipations but imperfectly realized . // It was as the agent of a mining company that Captain Head made his tour in La Plata and Chile , and in his Introduction he draws rather a discouraging picture of the South American mining associations in England . Great mistakes have been committed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking measures for carrying their objects into effect , without any knowledge of the country in which the mine was situated , or of local circumstances . Ignorance , and a rage for speculation , two very blind guides at all times , have been the causes of much mischief in forming these companies , by raising false hopes , and deluding people into the folly of becoming share holders . Determined to guard against the rock on which many had been wrecked , an association for working the gold and silver mines in the provinces of La Plata , despatched Captain Head to that country with instructions to examine the mines , and gain all the requisite know .. ledge for commencing operations upon them to advantage . His Rough JVbtes were drawn up during this tour . They consist of a broken narrative of events , loose hints , remarks , and observations , thrown together without regard to method , or settled design . They are written in a hurried , unpolished style , but with a good deal of animation , and occasionally with a graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practised order of writers . He pretends to nothing more than he accomplishes , and every reader may draw entertainment and instruction from his book . Its chief fault is a tinge of exaggeration , arising not so much from any purpose of the author , as apparently from the natural tendency of his mind to perceive new objects through a magnifying medium . He is not one of your querulous , grumbling travellers , meeting with shocking accidents and perilous adventures every post , starving at every meal , and bit or stung to death by ravenous , unmannerly vermin every night ; he experiences enough of these calamities to give due interest to his narrative , but he bears them patiently , and talks of them like a man of courage and sober resolution . As to the success of his expedition , we are left somewhat in the dark . He visited mines without number , both of gold and silver , in the plains of La Plata , among the Andes , and in Chile , and , as he says , went to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he reported favorably of any to his employers . He has devoted a chapter to the enumeration of vor*. xxlv. - No. 55. 38 // difficulties to be encountered by an English association , in working mines in the provinces of Rio de La Plata , and he arranges them under the three formidable divisions of physical , moral , political . The ardor of speculation must be unusually great , that w'mld not be damped by the list of obstacles under each of these divisions . The author assures us , moreover , that there are all sorts of English speculations in South America , ' and that mining companies are not the only ones that fail . Besides many brother companies , ' he says , which I met with at Buenos Aires , I found a sister association of milkmaids . ' Some acute observer of the manners of nations , it seems had made the discovery , that the inhabitants of Buenos Aires and the neighboring provinces had no butter , notwithstanding the vast number of excellent cows , and the abundance of pasturage . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our author terms it , a churning company , to manufacture and supply an article of so necessary use , would be an admirable enterprise . The company was formed without delay , and in a few months a cargo of Scotch milkmaids was landed at Buenos Aires , in complete readiness to commence operations . But here they were met with serious and unexpected obstacles at the very threshold . The difficulties which they experienced were very great ; instead of leaning their heads against patient domestic animals , they were introduced to a set of lawless wild creatures , which looked so fierce that no young woman , who ever sat upon a three legged stool , would dare to approach , much less to milk them . But the Gauchos attacked the cows , tied their legs with strips of hide , and as soon as they became quiet , the shops of Buenos Aires were literally full of butter . ' This was only a prelude to the disasters that followed . After all the difficulties of milking and churning had been conquered , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and secondly , that somehow or other , the Gauchos and natives of Buenos Aires liked oil better ! ' Thus vanished the bright hopes of the company , and the milkmaids were glad to return to their native Caledonian hills . Captain Head 's journey extended from Buenos Aires across the great plains called the Pampas , to Mendoza , and thence over the Andes to Santiago in Chile . The distance from Buenos Aires to Mendoza , at the foot of the Andes , is about nine hundred miles , and the whole distance to Santiago is // thirteen hundred and sixtyfive . This route may be travelled by a courier in twelve days , being more than a hundred miles a day on an average . There are post houses throughout the whole line , and relays of horses across the Pampas . The Andes are commonly passed on mules . In our further remarks we shall consult , in addition to Captain Head 's book , the manuscript Journal of Colonel William G. D. Worthington , who travelled over the same ground nine years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Buenos Aires , Chile , and Peru , and with the perusal of whose papers we have been favored . We shall also select some interesting particulars from a paper now before us , being the manuscript of a gentleman who has resided several years in Chile , and to whose pen the public has already been indebted for valuable and curious information respecting that country . We are happy to acknowledge our obligations to these authentic and highly respectable sources . It is not our purpose , however , to preSent our readers with anything more , on the present occasion , than a few desultory remarks , communicating general facts in some degree illustrative of the habits , manners , and character of the people . We have heretofore promised more than we have been able to perform , in regard to the South American republics . We hoped to have it in our power to draw up , from time to time , - something like a connected history of the revolutions and recent changes in those countries , but we have hitherto found this impossible . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in collecting them , yet they are for the most part unsatisfactory , and very imperfectly suited to historical purposes . There are as yet almost no books written in South America ; the newspapers are meagre , referring rarely to the events of history ; and the reports of the public officers to the congresses , which are important documents in themselves , are confined to the passing incidents and circumstances of the year . There was so little printing in the Spanish provinces during the first years of the revolution , that very few facts were recorded , and a full and accurate history must depend for many of its details on the recollection of living witnesses . Such a history of the revolution in Colombia has been written by Mr Restrepo , and it is hoped will shortly come before the public . When the same shall be done in the other republics , by men of equal eminence and qualifications , we // shall have all that is desired , and not before . Meantime , we think the concerns of South America so important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to give them the full share of attention which they may justly claim in a work like ours , designed for various ends , and for none more , than the advancement of our national honor and dignity , and the defence of liberty and free institutions in whatever clime they may appear . The great plain of the Pampas , over which Captain Head travelled , reaches from Buenos Aires to the Andes , covering a space of about nine hundred miles . This plain is intersected with rivers and streams , which have their sources among the perpetual snows of the Andes , and empty themselves into lakes in the interior , or find their way into the ocean through the great rivers Paran* and Rio de La Plata . The regions of the Pampas are inhabited by a scattered population of wild and warlike Indians in the south , and of Gauchos , a people of Spanisn descent , in the middle and north . These plains are fertile , and , under good agricultural management , might support a dense population . They afford luxuriant pasturage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which afford the natives their principal food , and the latter they ride on all occasions . Our author divides the Pampas into what he calls the regions of clover and thistles , long grass , and low trees and shrubs . The clover and thistles commence at Buenos Aires and extend one hundred and eighty miles ; then succeeds the long grass , which prevails four hundred and fifty miles further ; and last of all the trees and shrubs , which reach to the base of the Andes . As these shrubs are evergreens , their appearance is hardly changed with the seasons , and the long grass only turns its color from green to brown ; but the clover and thistle country puts on a new aspect several times in a year , as crops of each spring up successively from a rich soil , grow to maturity , wither , and decay . There are two modes of travelling across the Pampas , one in carriages of a strong heavy construction , and the other on horseback . A carriage is taken at Buenos Aires for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way at post houses kept for the purpose by the Gauchos . These horses are commonly wild and restiff , but six or eight of them are attached to the carriage , and each one is ridden by a peon with enormous spurs , goading the sides of the poor animal . They // are thus all hurried forward at a quick gallop , and the traveller carried rapidly along from Buenos Aires to Mendoza . The post houses are usually at a suitable distance for exchanging , but in some instances they are thirty , and even fifty miles apart . In these cases , the Gauchos accompany the carriage with a drove of horses , which are often changed on the way . Captain Head considers the mode of travelling on horseback much the more independent and expeditious , where the traveller has strength to endure the fatigue . Horses are obtained at the post houses in the same way as for carriages , and a Gaucho goes from one post house to another as a guide . The Gauchos have some peculiar traits of character . T*y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their native soil , seldom wandering far from the hut in which they were born , and in which their fathers had been born ; hospitable and highminded , possessing few wants , cheerful , and contented , their food is of the simplest kind , consisting chiefly of beef and water , and their habitations are little better than such as are seen in the first stages of civilization . They are huts built of mud , and thatched with long yellow grass . The following description , from the pen of the author , will let the reader a little into the internal economy of one of these tenements . In winter the people sleep in the hut , and the scene is a very singular one . As soon as the traveller 's supper is ready , the great iron spit on which the beef has been roasted , is brought into the hut , and the point is stuck into the ground . The Gaucho then offers his guest the skeleton of a horse 's head , and he and several of the family on similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long knives , they cut very large mouthfuls . The hut is lighted by a feeble lamp made of bullock 's tallow , and it is warmed by a fire of charcoal . On the walls of the hut are hung upon bones two or three bridles and spurs , and several lasos and balls . On the ground are several dark looking heaps , which one can never clearly distinguish ; on sitting down upon these when tired , I have often heard a child scream underneath me , and have occasionally been mildly asked by a young woman what I wanted . At other times up has jumped an immense dog . While 1 was once warming my hands at the fire of charcoal , seated on a horse 's head , looking at the black roof in a reverie , and fancying I was quite by myself , I felt something touch me , and saw two naked black children leaning over the charcoal in the attitude of two toads ; they had crept out from under some of the ponchos ; and // J02 April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as some hens sitting upon eggs , were also in the hut . In sleeping in these huts the cock has often hopped upon my back to crow in the morning ; however , as soon as it is daylight everybody gets up.3 p. 26 . Notwithstanding their isolated , independent , half civilized condition , the Gauchos are beginning to be politicians . Captain Head held a conversation on political subjects with one of his guides , who was very curious in his inquiries about the government of Mendoza , and the troops that had been raised in that proviiice to reinstate the governor of San Juan , in which province the guide lived , and where the people had lately deposed the governor . The Gaucho was very indignant , that the Mendozans should interfere in the business , and said the inhabitants of San Juan could manage their own affairs , and elect their own governor . The , principal towns between Buenos Aires and Santiago are San Luis in the Pampas , and Mendoza near the foot of the Andes , each containing from eight to twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political influence will emanate and gradually extend itself over the neighboring regions . San Luis was the place where the royalist prisoners were sent from Buenos Aires and Chile in the first years of the revolution , and reports are current of tragic scenes witnessed there , which reflect no credit on the humanity or honor of the party engaged in them . The regions of the Pampas are uncommonly salubrious , particularly the parts towards Mendoza . The soil is here strongly impregnated with saltpetre , and a crystalline clearness prevails in the atmosphere unknown in almost every other part of the world . Animal putrefaction seldom takes place , and the dead bodies of horses and cattle are often seen dried up , and very little changed from their appearance when alive . So extremely transparent is the atmosphere , that from the Sierra del Moro at sunrise Colonel Worthington saw the Tupungato , a high peak of the Andes , at the distance of three hundred and twelve miles . He saw the same again at San Luis about sunset , at the distance of two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the evening blue . We may here mention a funeral ceremony , which came under Colonel Worthington 's observation in the Pampas . A child one or two years old had died , and the people gathered around it in the // evening to perform its funeral rites . The body was laid on a table very gaudily dressed ; the palms of the bands were brought together on the breast , with the fingers pointing upwards , and the thumbs tied with a pink ribbon . Four candles were placed on the table , one at each corner . The company assembled with laughing , and talking , and much good humor , till at length one of the party struck up a tune on the guitar . They all fell to dancing , which they continued till daylight , when they dispersed . Captain Head visited the gold mines of La Carolina in the Pampas , where he was astonished to find , that the people would not take gold as a currency . He wished to purchase gold dust , and offered gold coins , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , and said they were good for nothing . They would take silver only , and the landlord with whom the travellers lodged demanded payment in this metal . Offering gold at La Carolina was literally verifying the proverb of carrying coals to Newcastle . The Indians , whp offer skins and ostrich feathers in the market of Mendoza , will not sell them for money , which they say is of no value , and can do them no good ; they will barter their articles for knives , spurs , sugar , or whatever else they want . Nor will they purchase by weight ; they must have ocular demonstration of quantity , and when they bargain for sugar , they mark on a hide the space which they expect to be covered . If our North American Indians had a little more of this wisdom of their Pampas brethren , they would be less frequently cheated than they have been by those , who boast of being illumined by the lights of civilization . At Mendoza our author prepared for a passage across the Andes . Carriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged to take himself and party over the mountains . On his way up the Cordillera he visited the warm baths of Villa Vicencia , and the mines of Uspallata . In ascending the Andes very little occurred worthy of observation , except in passing the laderas , of which all travellers speak so much . The road is along the north bank of the river Mendoza , which flows with great rapidity down a deep valley , almost from the top of the mountain . For the most part there is a sufficient width of level ground between the margin of the river and the base of the steep acclivities for a convenient road , but in some instances spurs of the mountain project so abruptly upon the stream , as to leave no room for a passage . It is then // necessary to wind along the side of the precipice , which thus intervenes , hy a very narrow path , sometimes less than two feet in width , affording barely room for a mule to pass with its burden . On the left the Mendoza is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain ascends almost perpendicularly till it is lost in the clouds . The path is sometimes five hundred feet , and in one instance seven hundred , above the river , and the slightest accident would precipitate the mule and its rider to the bottom . So steep is the slope , and so near does the hill approach on the right , that the traveller can touch it with his hand and frequently with his shoulder . So cautious is the mule in passing these laderas , so deliberate in feeling his way over loose stones , and so entirely free from any sensation of giddiness or embarrassment , arising from the great elevation and the sight of the yawning abyss beneath , that any accident to a traveller , who sits quietly on his mule , is a very rare thing . He is much more safe than he would be on foot . But baggage mules are often precipitated from the path , by reason of their load striking against the side of the mountain , and thus pushing them from their narrow foothold . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cause , by walking on the very verge of the pathway . Travellers are apt to be alarmed at this propensity of the mole , and at finding themselves hanging on the brink of the precipice ; but there is no danger if the mule is allowed to pursue his course , and trust to his own discretion . The following description by Captain Head , of his passage of the Ladera de las Vacas , presents a vivid picture of the scenes he witnessed . As soon as we crossed the pass , which is only seventy yards long , the capataz told me , that it was a very bad place for baggage mules , that four hundred had been lost there , and that we should also very probably lose one . He said that he would get down to the water at a place about a hundred yards off , and wait there with his laso to catch any mule that might fall into the torrent , und he requested me to lead on his mule . However , I was resolved to see the tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took away my mule and his own , and while I stood on a projecting rock at the end of the pass ; he scrambled down on foot , till he at last got to the level of the water . The drove of mules now came in sight , one following another ; a few were carrying no burdens , but the rest were either mounted or heavily laden , and as they wound along the crooked path the difference of color in the animals , the different colors and shapes // of the baggage they were carrying , with the picturesque dress of the peons , who were vociferating the wild song by which they drive on the mules , and the sight of the dangerous path they had to cross , formed altogether a very interesting scene . As soon as the leading mule came to the commencement of the pass he stopped , evidently unwilling to proceed , and of course all the rest stopped also . He was the finest mule we had , and on that account had twice as much to carry as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it consisted of four portmanteaus , two of which belonged to me , and which contained not only a very heavy bag of dollars , but also papers which were of such consequence , that I could hardly have continued my journey without them . The peons now redoubled their cries , and leaning over the sides of their mules , and picking up stones , they threw them at the leading mule , who now commenced his journey over the path . XVith his nose to the ground , literally smelling the way , he walked gently on , often changing the position of his feet , if he found the ground would not bear , until he came to the bad part of the pass , where he again stopped , and I then certainly began to look with great anxiety at my portmanteaus ; but the peons again threw stones at him , and he continued his path , and reached me in safety ; several others followed . At last a young mule , carrying a portmanteau with two large sacks of provisions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck his load against the rock , which knocked his two hind legs over the precipice , and the loose stones immediately began to roll away from under them ; however his fore legs were still upon the narrow path ; lie had no room to put his head there , but he placed his nose on the path on his left , and appeared to hold on by his mouth . I-us perilous fate was soon decided by a loose mule which came , and in walking along after him knocked his comrade 's nose off the path , destroyed his balance , and head over heels the poor creature instantly commenced a fall , which was really quite terrific . With all his baggage firmly lashed to him , he rolled dewn the steep slope , until he came to the part which was perpendicular , and then he seemed to bound off , and turning round in the air , fell into the deep torrent oim his back , and upon his baggage , and instantly disappeared . I thought of course that he was killed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately endeavored to stem the torrent which was foaming about him . It was a noble effort , and for a moment he seemed to succeed , hut the eddy suddenly caught the great load on his back , and turned him completely over ; down went his head with all the baggage , and as he was carried down the stream all I saw were his hind quarters , and his long , thin , wet // Traveb in La Plata and Gkile . April , tail , lashing the water . As suddenly , however , up his head came again ; but he was now weak and went down the stream , turned round and round by the eddy , until passing the corner of the rock , I lost sight of him . 1 saw , however , the peons with their lasos in their hands run down the side of the torrent for some little distance ; hut they soon stopped , and after looking towards the poor mule for some seconds , their earnest attitude gradually relaxed , and when they walked towards me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peons , and was just going to speak to them , when I saw at a distance a solitary mule walking towards us . We instantly perceived that he was the Phaeton , whose fall we had just witnessed , and in a few moments he came up to us to join his comrades . ' pp. 136-140 . These laderas vary in length from sixty to a hundred and fifty yards . Captain Riley , in the romance of his capture in Africa , mentions a similar pass , but more terrific if possible , on the sea shore between Mogadore and the great desert . Our author encountered few other difficulties , till he found himself in the spacious city of Santiago . He soon ascended to the region of snow , although it was only two days since he had escaped the burning heats of Mendoza ; and h , e relates some affecting anecdotes of the fate of travellers , who have attempted to cross the Andes in the winter . A furious wind , like a hurricane , frequently comes up of a sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to suffocate the traveller , and bury him alive . Small huts of brick have been built in the snowy region , on the summit of the Andes , to afford travellers a temporary shelter , but persons have been shut up in them by the snow , and died there of cold and hunger , as no fuel nor food could be obtained . In the summer season there is no danger from this source , although the travelling across the snow is not represented as the most agreeable . The time taken up in crossing the mountains with good success is from four to six days . Colonel Worthington passed from Mendoza to Villa de los Andes , a village in Chile at the foot of the Andes , in a little more than four days , and returned through the same distance in four days and a half . Arrived in Santiago our author is in great haste to be among the mines of Chile . Many of these he visited , but we shall accompany him to one only , and that is the silver mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andes , about seventyfive miles southwest of Santiago . After giving an account of his perilous journey to this spot , he speaks of the situation , and the mine itself . // Although it was midsummer , ' he says , the snow where we stood was , according to the statement made to me by the agent of the mine , from twenty to a hundred and twenty feet deep , but blown by the wind into the most irregular forms , while in some places the black rock was visible . Beneath was the river and valley of Maypo , fed by a number of tributary streams , which we could see descending like small silver threads down the different ravines . We appeared to have a bird's-eye view of the great chain of the Andes , and we looked down upon a series of pinnacles of indescribable shapes and forms , all covered with eternal snow . The whole scene around us in every direction was devoid of vegetation , and was a picture of desolation , on a scale of magnificence which made it peculiarly awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so cheerless in appearance , was created for the use , and comfort , and happiness , and even luxury of man , that it was the inexhaustible reservoir from which the plains were supplied with water , made us feel that there is no spot in creation , which man should term barren , though there are many which nature never intended for his residence . A large cloud of smoke was issuing from one of the pinnacles , which is the great volcano of San Francisco ; and the silver lode , which was before us , seemed to run into the centre of the crater . As it was in the middle of the summer , I could not help reflecting what a dreadful abode this must be in the winter , and I inquired of our guide and the miners concerning its climate in that season . 1'hey at first silently pointed to the crosses , which , in groups of three and two and four , were to be seen in every direction ; and they then told me , that although the mine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners used to he kept there all the year . They said that the cold was intense* hut that what the miners most dreaded were the merciless temporales , or storms of snow , which came on so suddenly that many miners had been overtaken by them , and had perished when not a hundred and fifty yards from the hut . With these monuments before my eyes , it was really painful to consider what the feelings of those wretched creatures must have been , when , gropiQg about for their habitation , they found the violence of the storm unabating and irresistible . It was really melancholy to trace , or fancy I could trace , by the different groups of crosses , the fate of the different individuals . Friends had huddled together and had thus died on the road ; others had strayed from the path , and from the scattered crosses* , they had apparently died in searching for it . One group was really in a very singular situation . During a winter particularly severe , the miners ' provisions , which consist of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party // volunteered , to save themselves and the rest , that they would endeavor to get over the snow into the valley of Maypo , and return if possible with food . They had scarcely left the hut , when a storm came on and they perished . The crosses are exactly where the bodies were found ; they were all off the road ; two had died close together ; one was about ten yards off ; and one had climbed to the top of a large loose fragment of rock , evidently to look for the hut on the road . The view from San Pedro Nolasco , taken altogether , is certainly the most dreadful scene , which in my life I have ever witnessed ; and it appeared so little adapted or intended for a human residence , that when I commenced my inpection of the lode , and of the several mines , I could not help feeling , that I was going against nature , and that no sentiment but that of avarice could approve of establishing a number of fellow creatures in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it was ever discovered . As the snow was in many places fifty feet deep on the lode , I could only walk on the surface from one boccamina to another ; but when I had done this I took off my clothes and went down the mine , which it was my pnrticular object to inspect . All Ehe rest had long ago been deserted , but in this one there were a few miners lately sent there , who were carrying on the works on the old system which had been exercised by the Spaniards , and to which these men have all their lives been accustomed . At first we descended by an inclined gallery or level , and then clambered down the notched sticks , which are used in all the mines in South America as ladders . After descending about two hundred and fifty feet , walking occasionally along levels , where the snow and mud were above our andes , we came to the place where the men were working . It was astonishing to see the strength with which they plied their *veighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , strange as it may appear , we all agreed that we had never seen English* men possess such strength and work so hard . While the barreteros , or miners , were working the lode , the apires were carrying the ore upon their backs ; and after we had made the necessary observations , and collected proper specimens , we ascended with several of these apires above and below us . We were quite exhausted when we came to the mouth of the mine ; one of my party almost fainted , and as the sun had long ago set , the air was so bleak and freezing , we were so heated , and the scene was so cheerless , that we were glad to hurry into the hut , and to sit upon the ground round a dish of meat , which had long been ready for us . ' While we were at one end of the hut , drinking brandy and water , seated upon our saddles , and lighted // Santiago . *3O9 by a brown tallow candle , which was stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hide filled with gun-powder , the few miners we had seen at work were relieved by others , who were to work through the night . They came into the hut , and without taking the least notice of us , prepared their supper , which was a very simple operation . The men took their candles out of the cloven sticks , and in the cleft they put a piece of dried beef ; this they warmed for a few seconds over the embers , which were burning on the ground , and they then eat it , and afterwards drank some melted snow water out of a cow 's horn . Their meal being over , they then enjoyed the only blessing fortune had allotted to them , which was rest from their labor . They said nothing to each other , but as they sat upon the sheepskin , which was the only bed they had , some fixed their eyes upon the embers , while some seemed to ruminate upon other objects . I gave them what brandy I had , and asked them if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual answer , that miners are never allowed to have spirits , and with this law they seemed to be perfectly satisfied . ' pp. 190-196 . Santiago is the capital of Chile , and is ranked among the first cities in South America . It is ninety miles interior from Valparaiso , the principal port of Chile , and thirty miles from the Andes , although so lofty and imposing are these mountains , that they seem at this distance to overhang the town . As you approach Santiago , you see none of those elevated domes and turrets , nor indeed any of the striking objects , which give notice that you are about to enter a great city . The castle , upon a moderate height within the town , is the only object conspicuous from afar . The houses and streets on the skirts of the town are mean and dirty , and the same may be said of two thirds of the city itself . The whole city is divided into squares , measuring one hundred and fifty yards on each side . Four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great square ; on one side of this are the cathedral and the bishop 's house ; on another , the palace , prison , and offices of the ministers of state ; and on the other two , shops and private dwelhugs . For about four squares from the Plaza each way , the streets and houses are beautiful , displaying taste in the style of architecture . There is nothing remarkable in the external appearance of the palace ; the sala , or reception room within is simply beautiful , perhaps elegant , but not magnificent . The cathedral is a large pile , well constructed of granite , and is still unfinished . It conveys the idea of grandeur , but confused , // and when lighted in the midnight services , this very confusion seems to heighten the impressions of sublimity , which it is calculated to raise . There are five nuaneries in Santiago , all richly endowed . The turbulent scenes of the revolution were by no means calculated to diminish this species of religious zeal . It is not easy to ascertain the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently absent on missions . From the best information that can be collected , it may be presumed there are more than a thousand , and about six hundred nuns . Durin* the power of the Careras , attempts were made to reduce thc number of the ecelesiastics , and likewise establish annual salaries , in lieu of primici as , diermas , and discretionary fees for all marriages and interments . But these innovations were not acceptable even to the people , who , it would almost seem , would hardly regard a marriage valid , or a death a happy one , unless they were obliged to pay the accustomed fees . The value and effect of a dispensation to quiet scruples of conscience for the omission of any known duty , or the commission of an act forbidden , are still weighed in golden scales . Hence , the absence of the bishop during the troubles of the revolution , has been productive of very serious inconvenience to many conscientious christians in Chile . On some important occasions , several persons have been obliged to have recourse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . The buildings occupy a whole square , and their disposition and general appearance are nearly the same as those of the convents , with a chapel in place of a church . The univer*ity has been sadly neglected during the revolution , and has now but very few students , and very imperfect government . It has recently attracted notice , however , and the state has made provisions for its reorganization . All the apartments intended for students and fellows within its walls are dark and gloomy , - and little better than the cells of the monks . Whatever other lights they may have to guide them to knowledge , they surely have very little of the light of heaven , for there are not ten windows in all the buildings pertaining to the university . The hours of study are passed in walking round the piazzas , reading aloud , or under the trees in the centre of the square , in the true style of Peripatetics ; and , indeed , what of philosophy and metaphysics is taught there savors very much of the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek or Hebrew , hut there have been professorships of Latin , Theology , the lower branches of the Mathematics , and Philosophy , which last , as far as its explanation can be understood , means nothing but Logic . Neither astronomy , chemistry , nor any other branch of physical or natural philosophy has ever been introduced . There are no such things as globes , telescopes , mathematical instruments , nor , in fact , any sort of philosophical or chemical apparatus whatsoever . Considering this state of the university , it is tho more remarkable , that there should be an extensive and highly valuable library . A great proportion of the books are of course upon theological subjects , and many of these in Latin , and bound in parchment . There is , moreover , a good number of manuscripts , and a large collection of Spanish and French authors . The whole number of volumes may perhaps be estimated at eight or ten thousand . With such a library , and the Jesuits for teachers , one would hardly suppose , that the sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sensible men too , till lately might have been heard to discuss , with great formality and gravity , questions concerning the Seven Heavens , the Primum Mobile , and the Ccelun* Empyreum ; and in this venerable seat of the muses , the doctrine of the motion of the earth , and the stationary position of the sun , would have been as ill received as it was in the days of Pythagoras , Copernicus , or Galileo . The mint at Santiago is a noble building of the Doric order ; its proportions are well preserved . Its front occupies the entire side of a square . Another public work of importance is the Tacarnar , an embankment constructed for the purpose of confining the waters of the river which passes through the city . This river rises suddenly during the winter rains to such a degree as to overflow the streets adjoining it , and threaten to inundate the city . rro remedy this inconveiiience , a solid and finely finished wall of stone and bricks has been raised , and continued through nearly the whole length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thus been formed ; at the same time the others , which were formerly exposed , have been secured and improved . In the centre of this street is a fine water fountain , and here and there groves of trees , which form pleasant little shady walks . On the inner side of the wall , throu*bout its whole extent . is a raised foot walk , about five // feet high and four broad , beautifully paved with small stones , like mosaic work , and affording a dry passage at all seasons , from one end of the city to the other . Of this work , as well as the mint , Ambrosio O'Higgins , father of the late Supreme Director of Chile , was the projector . This bold Irish adventurer , indeed , has left behind him many noble monuments of an exalted and comprehensive genius , in every part of the continent to which his singular fortunes guided him . The great road from Santiago to Valparaiso was the fruit of his enterprise and public spirit , and the post houses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The celebrated road from Lima to Callao was constructed by him , after he had risen by his talents alone to the elevated station of Viceroy of Peru . His projects were all on a grai*d scale , and they all aimed at public good . It may be doubted whether the history of any individual , connected with the Spanish South American provinces , during the colonial servitude , would appear to better advantage , or be contemplated with more satisfaction , than that of the deeds and character of Ambrosio O'Higgins . As nothing approaching an accurate census of the capital of Chile has been taken , it is impossible to tell how many inhabitants it contains . The common answer to the question in the city itself is , bastantes miles , many thousands . Some travellers represent the city to be nearly as large in compass as Philadelphia , and although its houses are incomparably inferior in every other respect , they are better stocked with inhabitants . No estimate of the actual number can be made , however , from this comparison , because the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy more space , than in colder regions . It is believed by recent observers , that the population of the state of Chile has been put too low . It was supposed at the beginning of the revolution to be under two millions . It has lately been thought to contain more than three . But everything on this subject is conjecture . No census has been taken , or can be taken for the present . Such has been the influence of the old government , that an attempt of this sort would be suspected at once , and fail of its ends . The common people would fear an impressment for the army , and fly into the mountains ; and the better orders would think of nothing but some scheme on the part of the government to levy a new tax , arid they would practise deception and evasion . A census taken under these circumstances wouJd tell no truth , and be of no value . // The revolution in Chile began in July , 1810 , when the captain general , Carrasco , was compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Count de la Conquista was appointed to take his place . Shortly after a ' plan of a new government was formed by an assembly , which voluntarily collected for the purpose . The supreme power was invested in a junta , of which the Count de la Conquista was president . This junta issued a summons for deputies to be sent from all parts of Chile to a general congress , and at the same time prescribed the method of election . Some disturbances occurred in prosecuting the election at Santiago , but delegates were at length chosen throughout the country , and a congress was convened . Here new seeds of discord began to germinate , by reason of the great number of members attending the congress , their disproportion in different districts , and the alleged illegality of the manner in which many of them had been chosen . A strong discontented party sprang up , at the head of which were three brothers , by the name of Carrera , sons of a rich landholder in Santiago . At this period Mr Poinsett , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took an active and responsible part with the Carreras , and is understood to have reiidered them much assistance by his counsels and personal services . The military adhered to this party , and the cry for reform became every day more loud and imperious . This point was partially carried in September , 1811 , and the congress proceeded to institute and recommend a plan of government . The Carreras were not satisfied , their party gained strength , and in November , they compelled the congress to appoint a new junta consisting of three members , one of whom was the eldest brother , Don Jos6 Miguel Carrera . By this junta an additional regiment of cavalry was raised , and Carrera was made colonel . His two brothers , Juan Jos* Carrera , and Luis Carrera , were also officers in the army , the one major of grenadiers , and the other captain of artillery . Having thus the military on their side , the Carreras may be said to have been at the head of the government at this time ; and through various commotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . They had many enemies , of course , and when the royalists were reinforced from Peru , and began to press heavily upon the country , the torrent of disapprobation was too strong for them to withstand . Jose Miguel Carrera was superseded in the command of the // army by Bernardo O'Iliggins . This change lighted the torch of civil war , but the necessity of union to resist the common enemy , prevented any very serious consequences . Two of the Carreras were taken prisoners by the royalists , and carried to Chillan , but they found means to escape . At length came on the decisive battle of Rancagna , in October , 1814 , where the patriots were defeated , and the royalists gained entire possession of Chile . The Carreras fled across the Andes to Mendoza with several hundred troops . More than two thousand patriots sought refuge in the same quarter , others were persecuted and punished in various ways , and a large number was exiled to the island of Juan Fernandez . The government of Buenos Aires took a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shortly devised for dispos*. sessing the royalists of their acquisitions . The safety of Buenos Aires itself demanded this step . Troops were therefore gradually sent to Mendoza to unite with those from Chile , and the whole were put under the command of General San Martin . They amounted at last to four thousand , and with this army San Martin crossed the Andes in January , 1817 . The army was formed in two divisions , one of which was commanded by O'Higgins . This passage of the Andes with such an army , and all its military accompaniments , has justly been con* sidered a great enterprise , proving the resources , zeal , and energy of the general . The combined army met the royalists , and gained a brilliant victory at Chacabuco , fifty miles from Santiago , to which city San Martin advanced without further opposition . A congress of the principal inhabitants was immediately convened , and San Martin was chosen Supreme Director of Chile . He declined the appointment , and by his influence Bernardo O'Higgins was raised to that office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south of Chile , where they were reinforced from Peru , till their numbers became again formidable to the patriots . The cause of liberty remained in suspense till the 5th of April , 1818 , when the great battle of Maypu was fought , the Spanish army completely routed , and the independence of Chile established . O'Higgins continued to be Supreme Director , although San Martin was commander in chief of the army , till his expedition to Peru , which took place in 1820 . O'Higgins was afterwards removed , and he retired to Lima . By the last intelligence cQncerning his movements , he had found means to take pos // session of the Isles of Chloe , with the view , it was supposed , of regaining his lost power in Chile . His successor was Freyr* , who is still at the head of the government . The fate of the Carreras was a melancholy one . The two younger brothers were barbarously executed in Men .. doza , after having been condemned for the part they took in endeavoring to reestablish themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revenge this injury . lie retired to Buenos Aires , and afterwards came to the United States , seeking supplies of money and men . On his return we find him in the neighborhood of Buenos Aires , at the head of a small body of forces , natives and foreigners , Gauchos of the plains , and a few English , French , and American sailors and soldiers . His progress was viewed with some uneasiness by the government of Buenos Aires , and not less so by that of Chile , where he was known to possess many powerful partisans . The lower orders , and the soldiery , still cherished the remembrance of his rule , and were devoted to him , for , during his power , he had proved himself a good politician and an accomplished courtier . He had always asked as a favor , what he might have demanded as a right , and the people delighted to recount the instances of his condescension , affability , and munificence . In his march across the Pampas he had several skirmishes with the garrisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond with his friends in Santiago , and no doubt received supplies from that place . It was at this period of his career , that a conspiracy in his favor was detected on the eve of its successful execution . The Director , O'Higgins , displayed at this moment his characteristic intrepidity . He entered alone at midnight a room , filled with conspirators against his government and life ; he commanded them instantly to disperse , and owe their lives to his clemency . They did not wait for a repetition of the command , but fled precipitately , leaving some of their papers behind them . Carrera passed the Pampas with no other difficulty , than such as arose from the nature of the country . He took and pillaged San Luis , and advanced leisurely towards Mendoza . At this time he is said to have been deceived in regard to the state of public feeling respecting him in that quarter , and indeed we can in no other way account for the fatal rashness of his measures . The goveminent of Chile had watched his progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reception . He thus found himself in the vicinity of Mendoza , in January , 1822 , with about a thousand troops . Leaving the greater part of them at Retano , nearly forty miles from the town , he advanced with about three hundred horse . Meantime all the regular troops and militia of Mendoza bad marched out to meet him . He first encountered a body of horse , not equal to his own , which he attacked . They opened , and displayed a large body of infantry , which had been concealed from his observation . Flight was now his only resort , and he arrived at Retano , pursued by the enemy . Here he resolved to make a stand , and at least to sell his life dearly . When attacked , however , he discovered that he had been betrayed by the officer left in command , who in his absence had held a correspondence with the enemy , and now went over to them with most of his men . Still Carrera fought , and seemed determined to defend himself though with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he fell exhausted into their hands . He was immediately conducted to Mendoza , where , after a brief form of trial , he was executed on the very spot , that had hardly ceased smoking with the blood of his brotbers . Among the most interesting persons , who have appeared in the revolution of Chile , may be reckoned Manuel Rodriguez , the friend , adviser , and coadjutor of the Carreras . As far as a man 's purposes can ibe understood from his professions and acts , it may be truly said of Rodriguez , that he had the liberty and equal rights of his countrymen , as well as their independence , really at heart . As far , at least , as the refusal of office and compensation for inestimable services in his country 's cause , will go as an argument in his favor , we may believe him to have been governed by disinterested patriotism . Till recently , his fate has been involved in the deepest mystery ; no one has pronounced his name but with the utmost caution , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rank to his friends the Carreras , but he was destined to different pursuits in life , having devoted himself to the study of the law , in which profession lie was rising to eminence . At the commencement of the revolution he joined the patriot party , and adhered to it without wavering to the last . He was the Mentor of time Carreras , and when their fortunes declined , he accompanied them across the Andes . His spirit and exertiotis did not flag with their ill success ; be enlisted in the cause // 1827 . Revolution in Chile . of his country with the same zeal , when its interests were entrusted to San Martin as when they were in the hands of his friends . XVhen Buenos Aires undertook the emancipation of Chile , Rodriguez was one of the most forward in council and in action . His chivalrous spirit induced him to choose the most perilous and important office , that fell to the lot of any one engaged in the enterprise , that of personally conveying information to the friends of insurrection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large in Chile . In the execution of this trust he proved himself another Proteus . Though cautious and prudent , where the interest of his cause was in jeopardy , yet there was no personal hazard or adventure that had not a charm for him . He engaged to cross the Andes and enter Chile for purposes of secret observation at a time , when the government could not hut have been y*alous and wary , as well of the Carrera party , as of the people of Buenos Aires . During the period between the battles of Rancagua and of Chacabuco , while the royalists retained undisturbed possession of the kingdom , he passed the mountains and entered Chile in various disguises , three different times , travelling generally on foot . He appeared sometimes in the dress of a miner , sometimes of a friar begging alms for his convent , and sometimes of a pedlar . In this manner he went as far south ns Talca , eighty leagues from Santiago , and about the same distance towards Coquimbo , frequently making himself known , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time in Santiago , whan he thought himself pursued , he was concealed for a day , and part of a night , in the house of one of his friends , in a tenctca , or large earthen wine jar ; at another time , when returning from Chile to Mendoza , he was impressed by an officer , who , with a guard of soldiers , had been posted in a pass of the Cordilleras , for the very purpose of interrupting the correspondence , and preventing communication with the other side , and whose men were then employed in repairing the road . Rodriguez was immediately set to work , and showed that he could handle the spade and axe , as skilfully as he had formerly done his pen . He was detained two days , and all the time had concealed about his person important letters and papers , the discovery of any one of which would inevitably have cost him his head . He frequently went at noonday to the houses of some of the first men in the city , in tatters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while bargaining for the fruit made himself known , and received important communications . Rodriguez accompanied the army of San Martin into Chile , and after the battle of Chacabuco he returned to the city , and set himself quietly down in his study . He mingled no further in public affairs , than any other decided private patriot , till the dispersion of San Martin 's army at Canchariada . When the news of this disastrous event reached the city , all eyes were instantly turned on Rodriguez . To him was owing in a great measure the success of exertions , which have too often been attributed exclusively to San Martin . For the moment , he assumed the office of Director , and executed its duties . He harangued the people , exposed to them the folly of despair , the rashness of flight , and the absolute necessity of a last struggle , although it should be the struggle of death . He succeeded in calming their fears and inspiring hope . The soldiers , who were all on the wing for the Cordilleras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and before the arrival of San Martin and the Director was announced in the capital , he had quelled the first impulse of terror in the inhabitants , and put affairs into the train , that led to the glorious results which ensued . In the space of three days he raised and organized a corps of six hundred horsemen ; and in as many more had them disciplined and ready for the field . This would be incredible , did we not know that a Chileno 's home is on horseback , and that the youth of the better sort are universally accustomed to the exercise of the broadsword . This corps received the appellation of La Batallon de la buena Jlluerte . In the hard fought battle of Maypu , an important post was assigned to it , and Rodriguez proved himself on that occasion as well fitted for the field as for the cabinet . Unfortunately , however , it soon appeared , that more of the credit of this victory , and the events preparatory to it , were by popular opinion attributed to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after the battle and in the midst of the festivities consequent upon it , he suddenly disappeared , and no man dared to ask , Where is Rodriguez ? He has never since been seen . Thus was this remarkable man cut off prematurely , before he had attained his thirtyfirst year . There can no longer he any doubt , if there ever was any , that he was secretly murdered by order of those in high authority , who feared the influence of his name and his talents with the people . // The early history of the press in Chile is curious , as will he seen by the following facts , for which we are indebted to Colonel Worthington 's memoranda . The first printing press arrived at Valparaiso on the 21st of November , 1 Si 1 . It was sent from New York , and cost six hundred and fifty dollars . The Carreras paid for it eight thousand in Chile . in January following the press was put in motion , and the first paper was issued which ever appeared in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was conducted by Johnson , Garrison , and Berliridge , all citizens of the United States , who went out with the press from New York . The editor was Henriques Camilla . The Aurora continued about two years , during which time Iresarri , a native of Mexico , published a weekly paper . When the royalists retook the country the press expired ; but after the battle of Chacabuco it was revived , and a paper called the Gazette of C/tile was set up , and was continued under that name till the battle of Maypu . It then took the name of the . M*nisterial Gazette , and for a most frivolous pretext it was put under the control of the Secretary of State , Iresarri . Then followed the drgus of Chile , and two papers of little significance , the Fatry and the Sun . Since that time many other papers have successively risen up and expired , and there are now several published in the country , containing intelligence and free political discussions . The sudden influx of merchants and adventurers into Chile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of tumult and confusion rarely witnessed among civilized people . Neither the language of those who came to traffic , nor the value or use of the articles of merchandise they brought , was under .. stood . It was nOt a state of things that had grown out of the genius and habits of the people ; every thing was forced and unnatural . A few of the first adventurers , as is always the case in political and commercial revolutions , met with success , and realized their hopes ; but others that followed their steps , and adventured largely , found disappointment and ruin . The people at large in Chile , more perhaps than in any other part of South America , are obstinately attached to ancient habits , and have a distrustftil aversion to changes of any sort . They have the pride and prejudice of old Spaniards , with minds much less enlightened , and , of course , less susceptible of the improvements of commerce . Their habits and modes of life have , in a good measure , grown out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // On entering a Bogeda in Valparaiso , designed at first as a storehouse for eighty or a hundred thousand bushels of wheat , you might , during the period we have alluded to , almost have imagined yourself in a London or Manchester warehouse ; and the Plaza of Santiago resembled a Leipsic fair . In preparing articles for that market , regard must be had not only to their general fabric , and the materials of which they are made , but even the most skilful must learn anew how to manufacture them . You would find it difficult to induce a Chileno to mount his horse in an English riding cloak , when the poncho , which his Indian neighbors have tau 6ht him to weave , will answer his purpose much better ; and the fair of Chile will furnish but poor customers for pins and bodkins , while there is not one in a hundred among them , that ever saw a pin , or felt the need of one . The owner of a hacienda , who , before sowing season , has fifty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded to pay ten pounds for an English plough , while those that cost him ten rials are quite as advantageous to him or to supply his hundreds of peons with iron spades and shovels , when those of wood , which each one makes for himself , will serve their turn as well ; besides , ploughs and shovels like these were used by his father before him . Nor would the Seiioras of the land patiently submit to the uncertainty and fluctuations of commerce , and live in dependence for supplies of China tea upon voyages across the Pacific , when they find in the herba of a neighboring province , a beverage quite as fine flavored and refreshing , and which has the further powerful recommendation , that it is the same which their mothers were accustomed to sip . It may moreover be added , that the eagerness with which this new channel of commerce was followed up by foreigners , not only misled the adventurers themselves , but blinded the eyes of the Chilian government to their own commercial interests . A new , and rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened to them , and committed to the direction of men grossly ignorant , or , to say the least , extremely inexperienced in the great fundamental and reciprocal principles of commerce . Hence , duties on foreign merchandise were imposed , with nearly the same regulations as were used in other and very different times , and in levying internal taxes , the scheme of the tariff , indeed , seemed to have regard to hardly any other considerations , than the immediate exigen* // cies of the government , and the ability of the merchant . Salutary changes are gradually and slowly taking place ; yet there is abundant room for improvement , not more in the commercial regulations , than in the political and civil institutions of Chile .
