txt ART . II. - *I Treatise on the Law of Insurance . By WILLARD PHILLIPs . fivo. pp. 550 . Boston . 1823 . THE progress of commerce in modern times will appear more surprising the more minutely it is examined , it steadily advanced among the nations of Europe during the whole of the eighteenth century , and in the latter half , notwithstanding occasional interruptions by war , it was probably double in extent and value , what it had ever attained in any other equal period . Holland had indeed lost her maritime superiority by the destruction of her carrying trade . But the Northern powers , and particularly Russia , assumed a highly commercial character . Italy was compelled to mourn the departure of . the times , when Venice , and Genoa , and Leghorn , covered , // the Mediterranean with their wealth . But France felt the invigorating influence of trade , and began to court with respect , what she had previously cherished only as a source of revenue . Above all , British commerce , during this period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were familiar with the whole Globe , with the Baltic and the Levant , the Black and the White Sea , the Atlantic and the Pacific , with the Americas and the Indies , with the fisheries of Newfoundland and Greenland , the fur trade of the Indians , the timber , hemp , and manufactures of the North , the cottons , spices , and teas of the East , and with the gums , drugs , ivory , and flesh , of Africa . It is probably short of the real state of the case to assert , that the commercial capital of Great Britain was quadrupled during the reign of George the Third . Of the causes of this vast increase it is beside our present purpose to enter i'nto an examination . But there can be no doubt , that her navigation has been essentially aided by the improved state of her manufactures , arising as well from superior skill and workmanship , as from her wonderful inventions in cotton machinery . She now exports to the East Indies and t*hina cotton goods of her own manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those countries . And the unrivalled beauty and excellence of her fabrics , have not only suspended the use of those of foreign origin within her own dominions , but have enabled her in a great measure to command all the open markets of the world . Under such circumstances it would be a natural inference , that there had been a correspondent advancement of her commercial law . The conclusion would seem natural , if not irresistible , that a people , distinguished for centuries by their commercial activity and enterprise , must have been under the protection of a well settled system of commercial jurisprudence . Philosophers and practical jurists would ask , how it would be possible for the infinite variety of business growing out of an extensive foreign trade to be adjusted , without resort to some well known rules and general principles ? Strange , however , as it may seem , it is undeniable , that England had made very little progress in commercial law , at so late a period as the commencement of the reign of George the Third . Yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the reign of Elisabeth ; and // for more than a century had possessed plantations and colonies , whose population and trade perpetually invigorated her navigation . A slight historical review will put this matter beyond any reasonable controversy . One of the earliest English works on maritime law is Malynes ' Lex Mercatoria , published in .1622 , in the reign of James the First . Welwood had a few years before printed his Abridgment of the Sea Laws ; but it is principally a collection of the rules and ordinances of foreign countries . It is remarkable , that Malynes refers to no antecedent English writer on the subject of his treatise , and except in a very few unimportant instances , to no English adjudications . His work is principally , a compendium of commercial usages , not confined to England , but supposed by him to be common to all the maritime states of Europe . It is quite a meagre and loose performance , and contains few principles , that are now of any practical importance . He has two or three short chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines upon that subject , then familiar on the Continent , were not much known in England , except as usages among merchants . He laments , that negotiable promissory notes , which then circulated among all the commercial cities of the neighboring nations , were strangers to the jurisprudence of England . In fact , they were not introduced into general use until near the close of the reign of Charles the Second . Lord Holt , in the case of Buller v. Crisp , ( 6 . Mod . Rep. 29 , ) decided in the second year of Queen Anne 's reign , said , I remember when actions upon inland bills did first begin ; and there , they laid a particular custom between London and Bristol , and it was an action against the acceptor . The defendant 's counsel would put them to prove the custom , at which Hale , chief justice , laughed , and said , they had a hopeful case of it . ' Lord Holt himself stubbornly denied the negotiability of promissory notes ; and in this very case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes had then been used for a matter of thirty years . ' It is familiar to the profession , that an act of Parl*ment was found necessary to put promissory notes upon the same footing as inland bills of exchange , although this laudable custom , ' as Malynes calls it , had been long established on the Continent . // Malynes devoted five chapters , containing in all about fifteen folio pages , to the subject of insurance . We do not recollect that , in the whole of the discussion , a single reference is made to any English adjudication . It is indeed sufficiently apparent , that the author drew almost all his materials from foreign sources . The earliest case indeed , that is to be found on a policy of insurance , is cited by Lord Coke in Dowdale 's case , 6 . Co. 47. 6. as having been decided in 30th and 31st Elisabeth ; and from the manner in which he refers to it , as well as from the point in judgment , it is manifest , that the action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notary public , published his book entitled , Advice concerning Bills of Exchange , ' which went through several editions , and was the only work of much reputation , that appeared on this subject in England until after the lapse of a century . It is altogether a practical treatise , referring for authority to the common usages of merchants , and pretending to no aid from any acknowledged doctrines of the English law . At the distance of fifty years after Malynes , Mr Molloy , a barrister at law , published his work , De Jure Maritimo et Navali . The subject of Insurance is despatched in one short chapter ; and though here and there a few short notes of English cases are interspersed , the substance is essentially what is found in Malynes , so that it may be fairly inferred , that , during the intermediate period , little progress had been made in the true understanding of this branch of the law . Indeed its real importance was so imperfectly estimated by the common lawyers , that Molloy triumphantly observes , the policies now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious questions , that former ages and the civilians according to the law marine , nay , and the common lawyers too have controverted , are now out of debate ; scarce any misfortune , that can happen , or provision to be made , but the same is taken care for in the policies , that are now used , for they insure against heaven and earth , stress of weather , storms , enemies , pirates , rovers , &amp;c. or whatever detriment shall happen or come to the thing insured , &amp;c. is provided for . ' This would be strong l*guage to use even in our days , when the legal construction of the terms and the risks of policies has been settled after very numerous and expensive litigations . But for that day , and from a lawyer too , the language // is most extraordinary ; and could arise only from gross ignorance of the vast extent and variety of the subject . In respect to navigation and shipping , which now form so large heads of commercial law , the information given by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four chapters containing little more than abstracts from the laws of Oleron , and from the short maritime titles in the civil law and its commentators . And yet these treatises , for we need hardly advert to Mr Magens ' Essay on Insurances , published so late as 1755 , contain the substance of all English elementary collections of maritime jurisprudence down to the period , when Lord Mansfield succeeded Sir Dudley Ryder as Chief Justice of the King 's Bench . Nor was this deficiency owing to the want of talents or industry on the part of the compilers . They accumulated most of the valuable English materials within their reach . The Reports furnished very few principles , and still fewer illustrations of general application . It is true , that Lord Holt in his famous decision in the case of Coggs v. Barnard , in which per saltum he incorporated the whole civil law of bailments into the common law , led the way to a more exact understanding of the law of shipping ; but the actual application of his principles belong to a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the uncertainty and defects of the English law , on maritime subjects , will be still more fully evinced by reference to some of her best authors . Mr Justice Blackstone in his very elegant and classical commentaries , a work professing to contain a summary of the principles of English law , treats the subject of insurance in a single paragraph , and after defining the contract , and shewing it not to be usurious , briefly adds , The learning relating to these insurances hath of late years been greatly improved by a series of judicial decisions , which have now established the law in such a variety of cases , that if well and judiciously collected , they would form a very complete title in a code of commercial jurisprudence . But being founded on equitable principles , which chiefly result from the special circumstances of the case , it is not easy to reduce them to any general heads in mere elementary treatises . ' Such was the view of a very competent judge on the state of the law in the year 1765 . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverting to the history of the establishment of the Court of Policies of Assurance in the reign of Queen // Elisabeth , and its having subsequently fallen into disuse , and probably into disrepute , observes , But though the Court of Policies of Assurance has been long disused , though it is near a century since questions of this nature became chiefly the subject of common law jurisdiction , yet I am sure I rather go beyond bounds , if I assert , that in all our reporters from the reign of Queen Elisabeth to the year 1756 , when Lord Mansfield became Chief Justice of the King 's Bench , there are sixty cases upon matters of insurance . Even those cases , which are reported , are such loose notes , mostly of trials at Nisi Prius , containing a short opinion of a single judge , and very often no opinion at all , but merely a general verdict . From hence it must necessarily follow , that as there have been but few positive regulations upon insurances , the principles , on which they were founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally known . ' Mr Marshall in general terms confirms these observations . After referring to the establishment of the two great English Insurance Companies by the statute of 6th . George I. ch. 18 , he proceeds to say , From this time it may be reasonably supposed , that all suits on policies of insurance were brought in the courts of common law , and yet but few questions on this subject appear to have been determined in the courts of Westminster , before the middle of the last ( eighteenth ) century . Whether this arose from the number of insurances in England being inconsiderable , compared to what it has since become , or from the parties being still in the habit of settling their differences by arbitration , or from both these causes united , it is not now easy to determine . ' Mr Miller gives a similar view of the English law , and in marked terms attributes its great improvement to Lord Mansfield ; and then speaking of his own country in 1787 , adds the following remarks . In Scotland the improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , as might be expected from the slower growth of its commerce . Although the decisions of the principal courts of justice have been pretty regularly collected for more than a century , yet the first decisions , which strictly speaking relate to insurance , are all , except one , within the course of the last ten years . During this period , however , the trade of insuring has risen to a very great height , and the decisions of the Court of Sessions upon that subject have become proportionably comprehensive and systematic . ' // What renders this state of the English law the more extraordinary is the fact , that almost all the important general principles of con*inercial jurisprudence had , for more than three quarters of a century , been reduced to a very clear and practical code in France . The very early treatise on insurance , called Le Guidon , was republished by Cleirac , in his Us et Coutumes de Ia Mer , in 1671 . In 1673 Louis the Fourteenth published his Ordinance upon Commerce , which among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promissory notes and orders . This was followed by the truly admirable Ordinance of 1681 , in which the whole law of navigation , shipping , insurance and bottomry is collected in a most systematic.and masterly manner . It would he a very narrow and unjust view of these ordinances to consider them as mere collections of the municipal i'egulations of France . They are more properly collections of those commercial principles and usages , which the experience of merchants had found most wise and convenient in their intercourse , and which the habits of business , and the necessities of trade had gradually introduced into favor among all modern maritime nations . Yet the English common lawyers , if not profoundly ignorant of the value of this code , then passed it by with obstinate indifference , and contented themselves with a proud reliance on the old doctrines of Westminster Hall , as adequate to all the exigencies of modern society . It seems to have been thought somewhat difficult to account , in a satisfactory manner , for this state of things , especially as Mr Magens , referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be allowed that the business of insurance is carried to a much greater extent in London , than in any other country in Europe . Insurances are daily made here on adventures by foreign ships , as well as others , whose risks are wholly determinable in foreign dominions . ' Mr Park and Mr Marshall obviously consider the subject as involved in much obscurity , and prudently , if not warily , abandon it to the conjectures of the reader . To us it appears to admit of a very simple solution , although one , which the pride of the profession might not choose to point out without confessing the fallibility of the system . It is , that the common law was an utter stranger to // the principles of commercial jurisprudence , and slowly and reluctantly admitted them into its bosom ; so that the age was always greatly in advance of the doctrines of the judicial tribunals . The ancient law dealt altogether in feudal tenures and doctrines , abounding in scholastical subtleties and refinements , and nice and curious distinctions , much better fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the manhood of commerce . It had a narrow and technical mode of expounding contracts , and a still more narrow and unsatisfactory mode of enforcing them . Instead of widening its channels to accommodate the active business of life , the whole was compelled to pass , as it might , along the ancient boundaries . The subtleties of pleadin* the difficulty of enforcing various defences , and the inconveniencies of screwing down general merits into established forms , embarrassed every remedy upon contracts of a special nature , and drove the parties to seek redress in the then infant , and of course very imperfect , administration of equity . When the spirit of English commerce had embarked vast interests in trade , it found itself without any encouragement from the law , and endeavored to work its way to its rights and its duties by the aid of lights reflected from other countries . English merchants became familiar with foreign usages , and soon adopted them into the habits of their business , for want of a more certain guide . These usages soon became general ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then as a customary law , they fastened themselves upon all the transactions of trade . But it was very gradually , that the common law recognised them in any shape , and always with a cold , hesitating , and jealous caution . Slade 's Case , in 4th Coke 's Reports , shows how unwilling the courts of common law were to entertain the action of assumpsit in the plainest cases . They clung with obstinate reverence to the old forms of the action of debt , and found the Benchers of the Inns of Court always ready to sound the alarm against innovations . But the doctrine , now universally admitted , of giving equitable defences in evidence , and sustaining equitable claims in the action of assumpsit , would have astonished Westminster Hall almost down to the period of the Revolution of 1688 , and encountered adversaries even in the days of Lord Mansfield . What would one say , if he were now told , that upon a bargain to deliver at a certaip , // price twenty quarters of wheat every year during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie for any breach of the annual delivery until the party was dead ? And yet this was certainly the law , while the action of debt was the sole remedy , ( as it was for aaes , ) for debt did not lie for any breach , until all the days were incurred , i. e. until the agreement wa* ended by the d*ath of the party , however inconsistent it might be with the intention of the contract . Nay , even now , the action of debt stands on the same nicety , and can not be brought upon a note for money payable by instalments , until all the days of payment are past . The sagacity of the old law discovered , that a single action only ought to be brought upon a single contract ; and to support an action for each instahnent would be to make the contract divisible . Such a conclusion , however reconcilable with common sense and the intention of the parties , was abhorrent to the settled forms in the Register . Such were the narrow views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits in supporting the new device of the action of general assumpsit , the history of which has been given with great ability by Lord Loughborough in the case of Rudder v. Price , in Henry Blackstone 's Reports . How utterly inadequate must such a system have been for the infinite diversity of contracts in our day ? If the difficulties , which have been adverted to , applied to contracts generally , they must have applied with far greater force to commercial contracts , which are so mixed up with usages and negotiations unknown to the common law , and are so loose in their terms and general in their obligations . In fact , the Admiralty was the only court , in which maritime law was much understood or studied ; and this court had the misfortune to labor under the heavy displeasure of the courts at Westminster . The civilians were always looked upon with forbidding jealousy , and every effort was made to undervalue their learning , and depress the popularity of the civil law . We know well , what were the causes of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was without a very strong apology . But it is nevertheless true , that from this very source , this disparaged civil law-this great fountain of rational jurisprudence  --  the common law has borrowed without acknowledgment all that is most useful and important in its own doctrines of contract . // It were easy to multiply these observations , and to demonstrate their correctness by exhibiting in detail , the manner in which the remedies upon commercial contracts were hampered by technical . proceedings under the old law . But such a detail would be very dry , and though matter of curiosity , would scarcely repay the labor of perusal , even to a professional reader . It has indeed often been said , that the law merchant is a part of the common law of England ; aud my Lord Coke has spoken of it in this manner in his Institutes , though it would be somewhat difficult to find out , what part of the law merchant , as we now understand it , existed at that period . If the expression , that the lex mercatoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an idle boast , it can mean only , that the general structure of the common law is such , that without any positive act of the Legislature , it perpetually admits of an incorporation of those principles and practices , which are from time to time established among merchants , and which from their convenience , policy , and consonance with the general system , are proper to be recognised by judicial tribunals . In this sense the expression is perfectly correct ; in any other sense it has a tendency to mislead . Almost all the principles , that regulate our commercial concerns , are of modern growth , and have been engrafted into the old stock of the law by the skill of philosophical as well as practical jurists . One of the leading cases , in which ' there is some flourish made about this maxim , that the law merchant is part of the common law , is Vanheath v. Turner in the nineteenth year of the reign of king James the First . It is reported in Winch 's Reports ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will extract the substance of it , to show how commercial contracts were dealt with at that period . It was a special action , and Winch states it thus . Peter Vanheath brought an action against Turner and declared upon the custom of merchants , that if any merchant over the sea deliver money to a factor , and make a bill of exchange under his seal , and this is subscribed by the merchant , or by any of the company of such merchants , that the merchant himself , or all the company , or any one in particular , may be charged to pay that ; and he shewed , that one merchant was factor of the company , of which the defendant was one , and // that merchant did substitute one G , to whom the plaintiff delivered ? 100 upon a bill of exchange , to which bill one B , being one of the company , set his hand in England , and so the action accrued to the plaintiff . The defendant pleaded , nil debet per legern ; and upon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether the defendant might wage his law . ' This is Winch 's statement of the case , very imperfect to be sure , but by which it appears to have been the case of a bill of exchange drawn for money received of the payee , by the agent of a factor of an English partnership on the company , and accepted by one of the partners , and upon that acceptance , the suit was brought against the defendant , who was one of the partners . Now the first thing , that strikes us is , that so little did the common law recognise the custom of merchants , that it was necessary to set it forth specially in the declaration , so that it might appear how the custom bound the party ; and the court might decide , whether it was good or not . After the argument , Lord Chief Justice Hobart is reported to have delivered his opinion as follows . If the bailiff at the common law make a substitute , ihe substitute is not chargeable , but here the custom will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three merchants trade over the sea , who made a factor there , who takes money there , and gives a bill and this is subscribed by one of the company ; that this should bind all or any of the company is not a good custom ; and the custom of merchants is part of the common Jaw of this realm , of which the judges ought to take notice ; and if any doubt arise to them about their custom , they may send for the merchants to know their custom , as they may send for the civilians to know their law ; and he thought the defendant ought to he admitted to wage his law . ' Now , independ .. ently of the objection , that if the defendant were admitted to wage his law , that is to say , discharge himsell ' from the debt by taking his oath , that he did not owe it , which of itself would almost extinguish the negotiability of bills , it would sound very odd at this day to hear any such doctrine assumed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the plain mercantile law , as it always was common sense , that the acts of a factor within the scope of his authority , whether done by himself or his substitute , bind the partnership , for which he acts ; and the acts of a partner in the partnership // business in like manner bind the whole . Such was at that period , as it should seem , the custom of merchants ; but it was strange to the common lawyers , and seems to have har. * monised very little with the notions of the court . Yet Lord Hobart was an eminent judge ; and we are to attribute his views , not to a want of sagacity , but to a steady adherence to the riaid doctrines of the common law , as to bailiffs and customs , to which the old lawyers clung with a pertinacious idolatry . The truth is , that these gentlemen were from*habit and professional feeling wedded to the artificial notions of the old system , and strenuously resisted almost every innovation upon it both in Parliament and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants , until the days of Lord Mansfield , was a victory gained by the spirit of the age and the influence of commerce over professional prejudices . And this leads us to say a few words upon the actual administration of insurance law during the days of Lord Mansfield , and of the improvements made by him . We do not know , that it can he done with more brevity than by quoting an extract from Mr Park . In former times , ' says he , the whole of the case was left gene* rally to the jury , * without any minute statement from the bench of the principles of law , on which insurances were established ; and as the verdicts were general , it was almost impossible to determine from the reports we now see , upon what grounds the case was decided . Nay , even if a doubt arose in point of law , and a case was reserved upon that doubt , it was afterwards argued in private at the chambers of the judge , who tried the cause , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion might be , it was never promulgated to the world , and could never be the rule of decision in any future case . Lord Mansfield introduced a different mode of proceeding ; for in his statement of the case to the jury , he enlarged upon the rules and principles , of law as applicable to that case , and left it to them to make the application of those principles to the facts in evidence before them . So that if a general verdict were given , the ground on which the jury proceeded , might be more easily ascertained . Besides , if any real difficulty occurred in point of law , his lordship advised the counsel to consent to a special case , &amp;c. &amp;c . These cases are afterwards argued , not before the judge in private , but in open court , before all the judges of the bench , from which the record comes . Thus nice and important questions are now not * Very much as it used to be within our early recollection in the courts of Massachusetts . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case seriously considered and debated by the whole court ; the decision becomes notorious to the world ; it is reco*'ded for a precedent ot ' Jaw arising from the facts found , and serves as a rule to guide the opinion of future judges. * The commendation of Lord Mansfield , which this extract implies , falls very far short of his real merits . The change in the course of proceedings did much ; but the genius , liberality , and extensive learning of this extraordinary man gave a new and enduring vigor to the system itself He may be truly said to have created the commercial law of England ; and during his long , active , and splendid life , it attamed a maturity and perfection , which perhaps no other nation can boast , and which will transmit his name to posterity as one of the greatest benefactors of jurisprudence* The achievement was not indeed the result of his own unassisted mind . He read extensively the maritime laws of foreign countries , and with an admirable mixture of boldness , discretion , and sagacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of I*ng1and . At the distance of half a century one looks back with wonder and surprise upon the labors of this single judge . His successors have here and there added some pillars to the edifice ; but the plan , th' proportions , the ornaments , the substructions , all that is solid and fundamental , and attractive , belong to him , as the original architect . Standing in the temple of commercial law , the most sober jurist , while contemplating Lord Mansfield 's labors , might with enthusiasm exclaim , Si monwn*entum queris , circumspice . Dropping , however , figurative language , we may with plain gravity venture to suggest a doubt , whether the deviations from his doctrines , introduced by his successors , have not been inconvenient in practice and mischievous in principle . They partake too much of the subtleties and technical refinements of the common law , and stand littln upon general reasoning , and those analogies , which equity and a comprehensive view of the business of commerce would commend for adoption . Lord Kenyon was an honest , intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps original cast of mind , he does not seem ever to have entered into the true spirit of commercial jurisprudence . He took no comprehensive principles in his range , and con tented himself by administering the maritime law , as // found it , without any ambition to extend its boundaries . Lord Ellenborough possessed a more powerful and vigorous mind . But his early reading beyond the walks of the common law does not seem to have been very extensive ; and he manifests on many occasions a desire to bring down the maritime doctrines to the standard of the common law , rather than to give to the latter the expansion of universal jurispru* dence . He was certainly a great judge , of a clear , decisive , and rapid mind , but devoted to England , and feeling little enthusiasm and less curiosity to embark in foreign studies . The times too , in which he lived , were not propitious to any extensive researches into continental jurisprudence . They were times of deep political and national struggles , when the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public law ; and those who clung to old institutions felt , that resistance to innovation was safety , and that dangers lurked in ambush under the cover of general principles . Fortunate will it be , however , for England , if in the present peaceful times there shall he found a successor of Lord Mansfield , who breathes his liberal spirit , and fills up his splendid outline of principles . It can not , however , be disguised , that there is a national pride and loftiness of pretension occasionally mixed up in the character of Englishmen , which lead them , especially as public men , to look down , sometimes with contempt , hut more generally with indifference , upon the usages , laws , and insti* tutions of other countries . . TV*il admirari is not always a safe or useful national motto . The English bar is not exempt from this infirmity , and betrays it sometimes , when it would be more honorable to seek instruction from foreign sources . It is curious to observe , how little of foreign jurisprudence is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is far otherwise in their admiralty and civil law courts ) upon topics , which seem most powerfully to demand its introduction . Even upon questions of the operation of the Lex Loci , how rarely has continental or even Scotch jurisprudence been cited with effect in these tribunals . Ireland is separated but by a narrow strait . Her jurisprudence is in substance that of England . Her most distinguished lawyers and judges have been bred in the English inns of court . In eloquence , in learning , in general ability , they are inferior to few in th' // United Kingdom . Yet who ever heard the citation in an English court of an Irish decision ? With the exception of a few of Lord Redesdaie 's , which prohahly owe their admittance into English society from his elevated rank in the House of Lords , we scarcely recollect any in the course of our reading . Why should they not be cited ? Was Sir John Mitford , when he wrQte his excellent treatise on Equity Pleadings , or held the office of Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the seals of Ireland ? Is Lord Manners less distinguished as an Irish Chancellor , than when he filled the office of a Baron of the English Exchequer ? Perhaps it may he suggested as an apology , that the English law is of itself so vast a field , that it can scarcely he mastered , and it is unnecessary to attempt any foreign conquests ; that the decisions of English judges are alone of authority , and it is unwise and impolitic to open wider inquiries , which would perplex and obstruct the already darkened and crowded avenues of professional studies . There is something plausible in such a suggestion ; hut it vanishes on a close examination of the subject . If the English common law were perfect in itself , and were susceptible of no improvement , it might justly refuse any foreign admixture . But no one would be so rash as to advance a pretension of this sort . The common law is gradually changing its old channels and wearing new . It has continual accessions on some sides , and in others leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to show , what were its former boundaries . What have become of the feudal tenures and the thousand questions of right and might , which formerly came home , not merely to the lords of the manors , hut to every thatched cot* tage of the kingdom ? What have become of real actions with all the complicated apparatus of proceedings , with which they so much perplexed , not to say confounded , and overwhelmed the profession ? More than sixty years ago we were told , in the celebrated judgment of Taylor v. Horde , that the pre* cise definition of what constituted a disseisin , was not then known and could not be traced in the hooks . And yet almost all the contests of the old law were upon questions , in which the law of disseisins was a material ingredient . What have become of the nice and curious distinctions in respoct to uses // and trusts , which in Lord Coke 's time and in earlier periods exercised all the ingenuity of the profession ? In a practical sense they l ) ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , since the courts of equity have exerted their most salutary jurisdiction over this vast field of litigation . Where in the old law shall we find principles to adjust the innumerable questions arising in bankruptcy ? Where shall we look for the ( loctrine of liens , of stoppage in transitu , of marshalling assets , of the execution of charities , in short , of the mass of business in which modern legal and equitable jurisdiction is employed ? It is obvious , that the law must fashion itself to the wants , and in some sort , to the spirit of the age . Its stubborn rules , if they are not broken down , must bend to the demands of society . A mere written code must forever be inadequate to the business of a nation increasing in wealth and commerce , and connecting itself with the interests of all the world . A customary law , adopted in rude and barbarous times , must melt away or mix itself with the new materials of more refined ages . Human transactions are dividing and subdividing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted or bounded by any written or positive legislation . The law , to be rational and practicable , must , as was finely said by Lord Ellenhorough of the rules of evidence , expand with the exigencies of society . As new cases arise , they must be governed by new principles ; and though we may not remove ancient landmarks , we must put down new ones , when the old are ifot safe guides , and no longer indicate the travelled road , or mark the busy shifting channels of commerce . It is most manifest , therefore , that the English law , working , as it does , into the business of a nation crowded with commerce and manufactures , must forever be in search of equitable principles to be applied to the new combinations of circumstances , which are daily springing up to perplex its courts . In adopting new rules it is indispensable to lookto public convenience , mutual equiiies , the course of trade , and even foreign intercourse . It is plain , that in such inquiries , the customary and positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , must be of very great utility . No nation can be so vain as to imagine , that she possesses all wisdom and all excellence . No civilised nation is so humblQ // that her usages , laws , and regulations do not present many things for instruction , and some for imitation . In respect to the general principles of jurisprudence , those which are applicable to the ordinary concerns of human life in all countries , and ought to be law in all , because they are founded in common sense and common justice , it is undeniable , that much light may arise from the investigations of foreign jurists . Genius and learning can never fail to illustrate the principles of universal law , even when the primary object is merely to expound municipal institutions . The Dutch , the German , the Italian , the Spanish , or the French civilian is not less a master of equity and rational jurisprudence , when he deals with the Roman law , colored , and it may be shaded , hy his own local customs and ordinances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusts in foro conscienhi*e , or the lord Chief Justice , when expounding commercial contracts at the Guildhall of London . The truth is , that the common law , however reluctant it may be to r*ake the acknowledgment , and however boastful it may be of its own perfection , owes to the civil law and its elegant and indefatigable commentators , ( as has been already hinted , ) almost all its valuable doctrines and expositions of the law of contract . The very action of assumpsit , in its modern refinements , breathes the spirit of its origin . It is altogether Roman and Pretorian . And there never has been a period , in which the common lawyers , with all their hostility to the civil law , have not been compelled to borrow its precepts . The early work of Bracton shews how solicitous some of the sages were , even in that rude age , to infuse into their own code some of that masculine sense which found favor in the days of Justinian . What , indeed , should we think , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent to the writings of such authors as D'Aguesseau , Domat , Valin , Pothier , and Emerigon ? Mr Duponceau in his late excellent Dissertation on the Jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States ,  --  a work that should be profoundly studied by all American lawyers ,  --  has said , that the works of Pothier were warmly recommended by Sir William Jones to his countrymen , but without success . ' We hope his language is too strong . That such a writer as Pothier should be neglected by Englishmen , would be a disgrace to the learning and literature of the nation . // Who has written with so much purity of principle , such sound sense , such exact judgment , such practical propriety on all the leading divisions of contracts ? Who has treated the whole subject of maritime law so fully , so profoundly , so truly with a view to its equity and advancement , as Valin ? Who has equalled Emerigon as a theoretical and practical writer on the law of insurance ? He has exhausted every topic so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions his work , for illustration , and authorities , and usages , is still unrivalled . We think , indeed , that we perceive the dawn of a brighter age in the English law , when the foreign lights , which have been slowly and by stealth admitted into Westminster Hall , will be hailed with a liberal spirit , and will irradiate its bar and benches . Mr Joy , in the case of M'Iver v. Henderson , ( 4 M. and S. 576 , ) and Mr Campbell and Mr Bosanquet in the case of Bush v. the Royal Exchange InsurCompany , ( 2 Barn , and Ald. 72. ) shewed a familiar acquaintance with the foreign maritime jurists , and argued with great effect from their authority ; and on a comparatively recent occasion , ( 5 M. and 5. 436. ) when Emerigon was cited , Lord Ellenborough said , Emerigon , whose name has been so frequently mentioned in the course of the argument , is entitled to all the respect , which is due to a very learned writer , discussing a subject with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the authorities relating to it . ' Mr Justice Bailey and Mr Justice Best , who are judges of uncommon ability , have repeatedly of late adverted to the French maritime authors with discriminating accuracy , and in terms of the most unreserved respect . We consider these indications of a liberal study of foreign jurisprudence , as extremely creditable to this age of the common law , and augur from them , for the future , a far more expanded view of commercial questions , than has usually been encouraged since the days of Lord Mansfield . If we were disposed to recommend the study of public and foreign law to common lawyers , we do not know how we coW better do it , than by pointing out some illustrious examples of its successful accomplishment in our own age . Sir James M'Intosh , of late years so distinguished in Parliament as a friend to liberty , to science , and liberal institutions , and who is at the same time a most humane and philosophical // jurist , has in his incomparable introductory Discourse to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished specimen of the advantages resulting from the mastery of foreign public writers . It would , perhaps , be difficult to select from the whole mass of modern literature , a discourse of equal lenoth a which is so just and beautiful , so accurate and profound , so captivating and enlightening , so enriched with the refinements of modern learning , and the simple grandeur of ancient principles . It should be read by every student for instruction and purity of sentiment , and by lawyers of graver years to refresh their souls with inquiries , which may elevate them above the narrow influences of a dry and hardening practice . But a still more striking example is Lord Stowell , ( better known in this country as Sir William Scott , ) the present venerable Judge of the High Court of Admiralty , of whom it may be justly said , in the language of Cicero , that he is jurisperitorum eloquentissimus . This great man has presided in the Court of Admiralty since the year 1798 ; and during this period he has commanded the admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegance of his judg* ments . There was a time , when it was somewhat the fashion in this country to undervalue the solid excellence of his opinions . Our commerce was brought so directly in conflict with his administration of prize law , that it was difficult to avoid prejudices on a subject , in which , as neutrals , we had so deep an interest , and were so liable to indulge strong animosities . But time has dissipated many delusions on this subject ; and we have had in the late war ample opportunity to try the accuracy of his principles , when we changed the character of neutrals for that of belligerents . We can now look hack upon his decisions with somewhat of the calmness and sobriety of a philosophical historian . With the exception of the doctrines respecting the colonial trade , in which it is but common justice to admit , that he either acted upon public Orders in Council , which he was hound to obey , or upon the Rule of 1756 , which . his government had previously chosen to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between his decisions upon prize law , and those promulgated by the Supreme Court of the United States , are so few , as to be almost evanescent . After the most powerful arguments // under the highest political exeitements , and with the aid of the most striking eloquence , there has been but a single principle adopted by him , which has been deliberately overruled by the Supreme Court ; and on that occasion there was a serious difference of opinion among the Judges . But it is not in respect to prize law , that we intend to speak of Lord Stowell , though he everywhere exhibits the most Drofound and accurate knowledge o fall the publicists of continental Europe ; but as a maritime judge , deciding , in what is called the Instance Court , the great principles of commercial jurisprudence . His superiority in this department over the technical reasoning of the common lawyers is most signal . He discusses every question with a persuasive and coinprehensive liberality , with a tone of general equity , a knowledge of maritime usages , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , rather than the municipal monopoly of a single nation ; and he draws from all sources , ancient and modern , the best and purest principles to aid , to illustrate , and to confirm his own judgment . With him the grave learning of Grotius , the acute , bold , and somewhat vehement discussions of Bynkershoek , the reverend testimonies of the Consolato del Mare , the collections of Cleirac , the busy , practical sense of Roccus , the brief but clear text of Heineccius , the various and exhausting labors of Casaregis , the argumentative commentaries , and luminous treatises of the French jurists , appear as perfectly familiar , as the writers of his own age and country . He evidently reposes upon them , even when he does not cite them ; and transfuses into his own eloquent and impressive judgments , whatever they afford of general doctrine , or just interpretation , upon all the doubtful questions of maritime law . One scarcely knows which most to admire , the simplicity of his principles , the classical beauty of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his critical but candid estimate of evidence , his strong love of equity , his deep indignation of fraud , chastened by habitual moderation , or that pervading common sense , which looks into , and feels , and acts upon the business of life with a discriminating , but indulgent eye , content to administer practical good without ostentation , and wasting nothing upon speculations , whose origin is enthusiasm , and whose end is uncertainty or mischief . Even // when he deals with subjects of another class , as in ecclesiastical causes in the Consistory Court , one is surprised to see with what admirable propriety he uses his knowledge of general jurisprudence and the civil law , to give vigor to his decrees . And upon questions involving the lex loci , he has triumphantly shown , that he can master the results of foreign jurisprudence , and , as in the very interesting case of Dalryrnpie v. Dalrymple , compose the strifes of the learned advocates of the Scottish bar , and fix forever upon an immovable basis a question , which had vexed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts and difficulties . We say , without hesitation , that the character of this eminent Judge , whatever may have been his original genius and ability , owes its present elevation , in a great measure , to his enlarged studies , and his cultivation of universal jurisprudence . Take , for instance , his celebrated judgment in the case of the Gratitudine in 1801 , on the right of the master to hypothecate the cargo , as well as the ship and freight , for the necessities of the voyage ; or the case of the Julianna in 1822 , on the invalidity of a stipulation in the shipping paper to cut off the seamen from wages , unless the voyage was performed to the final port of destination ; where shall we find in the annals of the common law , except among the judgments of Lord Mansfield , cases argued out upon such rational and enlightened principles , aided by sober and various learning , and endicg in conclusions so irresistible ? One seems in them to be reading , not the law of England merely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human Icarning , acting on human concerns , with reference to principles absolutely universal in their justice and convenience of application . We wish American lawyers would study the fine models of this sagacious Judge , with a diligence proportionate to their importance and utility . We can not quit this subject , without recommending to our brethren of the English bar , if perchance these pages should attract their notice , the study of American jurisprudence . Of course we do not mean of our local laws and 1 ) eculiar systems , for we should as little advise this , as we should to our own lawyers , the study of the English law of tythes and moduses , and copy holds , from which we are separated toto c*vlo . What we do recommend is the study of our commercial adjudications. // This is not said , we hope they will believe , from vanity , under a false estimate of our own attainments . American lawyers are in the constant habit of reading all the English Reports ; and it would be worse than affectation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved by them . They present to us the fruits of great experience , industry , intelligence , and ability But we also are painters . ' The American Courts , collectively considered , embrace a large proportion of talent and learning , and they are perpetuaY*y engaged in many oF the discussions , which perplex the English tribunals . Of course , there is a great diversity in the attainments of the judges and lawyers in the different States composing the Union , arising from local circumstances . But in the principal Atlantic States , the system of maritime law is of daily application to business , and is studied wth earnest diligence . In one respect there is a striking contrast between the state of the English and that of the American bar . In England , the profession is broken up into distinct classes . The civilians engross , exclusively , the admiralty and ecclesiastical courts , and even these are separated into proctors and advocates . The Chancery Courts have their own solicitors and counsellors . The barrisrers and serjeants of the common law generally confine themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney is a being , who deals with processes and pmoceedings in suits , but is shut out from the rights of arguing counsel . The conveyancer pours over his own peculiar studies for chamber practice ; and the special pleader , if he wins his way to a lucrative practice , sits under the bar a quiet spectator of forensic disputations , unless the niceties of his own craft come into play . In America all this is dif fexmxt . Tlxe* s*arw* w* k , ( ' *r* *s*ct*y an exception , ) in all these different capacities ; and in the course of a single term of a court may assume many of the functions of all of them . He is , or may be , at once , proctor , advocate , solicitor , attorney , conve yancer , and pleader ; he may draw libels and bills , frame pleas and answers , direct process , prepare briefs , sketch drafts of conveyances , argue questions of fact to the jury , and questions of law to the court ; and find himself quite at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought , that this singleness of occu // pation and subdivision of labor give to the English lawyer more accuracy , minute knowledge , and perfect facility in the use of his materials , they carry with them on the other hand some disadvantages . The general tendency of such close pursuits is to narrow down the mind to mere technical rules ; to exhaust its powers upon subtle distinctions and dull details ; to make professional life an affair of collections and recollections ; to create an acute and nice discrimination , rather than a solid and comprehensive understanding . What is gained by skill in the manipulation , is lost in the vigor of the blow . The course of the American lawyer does not , it must be confessed , generally lead to such exact inquiries , and such perfect finish , although there have been eminent examples to the contrary . But a survey of the whole structure of the law conducts him to large and elevated views , to brilliant and successful illustrations , to reasonings from various contrasts and analogies of the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow out the finer forms of thought . His learning must he deep , and various , even if it is not in all respects exact ; and will be tinctured with the hues of all his studies . His law silently acquires the tone and spirit of equity ; and his commercial discussions urge him to search for and adopt in argument , whatever of excellence the genius and erudition of foreign jurists have brought to his notice . He knows too , that in the American courts there is no disposition to discourage the study of foreign jurisprudence . There is a freedom from restraint , and an habitual eagerness to expand our law , which favor every attempt to build up commercial doctrines upon the most liberal foundation . We do not mean to affirm , that American lawyers in general cultivate such extensive studies , or are distinguished by such elevated attainments . What we mean to assert is , that the general tendency of our system is to excite an ambition for such studies and attainments , and that the genius of the profession is perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which constitute the philosophy of the law . We could point out living models , who ex* emplify all , that we have suggested in commendation of the American system ; and among the illustrious dead within our own brief career , we fear no rebuke in naming Hamilton , Dexter , Pinkney , and Wells . But it is unnecessary to trust to assertion . // The records are before us and can be searched . Look to the judgments of the Supreme Courts in the States of Pennsylvania , New York , and Massachusetts , upon questions of maritime and commercial law , as they stand in the reports of Messrs Tyng , Binney , Johnson , and Sergeant , and Rawle . It is impossible not to feel , that the arguments in these causes and the judgments , which followed them , would do credit to the tribunals of any country . They are full of learning , fine reasoning , acute distinctions and solid principles , such as might well guide the sober sense of Westminster Hall , and cast a strong light uport its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Where shall we find in our times a more thorough mastery of the civil and maritime , of the common and equity law , where a more untiring research , a more critical exactness , a more philosophical spirit , than is displayed in the elaborate arguments of her late Chancellor ? We think , therefore , that in recommending the labors of the American lawyers and judges to the attention of English lawyers , we do them a service , by which they may greatly profit ; and in this manner we may make a suitable return for the many aids , which America received from the parent country , when her own jurisprudence was loose , unformed , and provincial . The progress indeed , that has been made in America , in the knowledge and administration of commercial law , since the revolution , is very extraordinary ; and in no branch more striking than in that of Insurance . Before that event , policies of insurance were of rare use among us . Our intercourse with the mother country was so direct and so dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , through the instrumentality of agents . Our printed reports do not reach far back beyond the revolutionary period ; but the manuscripts we have seen , and the absence of references to cases in the arguments , even of ante-revolutionary lawyers , establish to the satisfaction of all accurate observers , that the subject was new to the studies of the bar . The earliest , and indeed the only case we recollect in any of our books , before the Declaration of Independence , is that of Story and Wharton v. Strettell , in 1764 , reported by Mr Dallas in the first volume of his Reports . It was not until the French revolution , by // opening new and extensive sources of profitable trade , gave an impulse to our maritime enterprise , that the contract struggled into notice from a state of languor , and became common in our commercial cities . It immediately advanced with almost inconceivable rapidity , and became so profitable , that it may truly be said to have laid the foundation of many fortunes in our country . The profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , and applied itself with a most commendable diligence to the study of all the English and other foreign authorities . And within the last thirty years , probably , as large a number of cases of insurance have been contested and decided in the American courts , upon points of difficulty and extensive application , as in the courts of England in the same period . We do not hesitate to assert , that these cases have been argued with as much learnina and ability , and with as comprehensive a view of the true principles of the contract , as any in the brightest days of the English law . And we are greatly deceived , if , upon a general examination , they will not be found by English lawyers and judges to be full of useful instruction , and worthy of their deliberate study . Many of them discuss questions arising from the complicated state of our commerce , as a neutral nation , which have not as yet undergone any adjudication in the English courts . We will close this topic with a very short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We pass over at once without any particular notice , the remarks on the subject contained in the work on Bills of Exchange and Insurance ascribed to Mr Cunningham , and in Mr Parker 's Laws of shipping and insurance , as they were so imperfect as to have sunk into obscurity . Mr Weskett 's book is a mere collection , in the form of a dictionary of all the heads of maritime law , and contains little more than an index to foreign ordinances and usages . The title , Insurance , in the collections of Postlethwayte and Beawes are of the same character . The first treatises , correctly speakmg , are those of ' Mr Millar , a Scotch advocate , and Mr Park , ( now Mr Justice Park of the Common Pleas , ) both published in the year 1787 . Mr Millar 's work is certainly creditable to his talents and industry , and exhibits considerable research and habits of observation . It has not , however , // received a great share of public favor , nor , as we believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been superseded in practice by the very superior treatise of his rival , both in method and materials . Mr Park , indeed , deserves much praise for the judgment , accuracy , and general excellence of his system of the Law of Insurance . The best testimony of its value is the continued approbation of the profession , which has already carried it through seven large editions . As a collection of authentic cases in the fullest and most accurate form , it still remains unrivalled . Although it professes to he principally a collection of cases and judicial opinions , ' the learned author occasionally discusses general principles with a good deal of ability . In 1802 Mr Ser-. jeant Marshall published his Treatise on the Law of Insurance , and again in 1808 published a second and improved edition . His work professes to be , not like Mr Park 's , a collection of cases , but an examination and collection of principles . It is certainly a work of high merit , analysing and criticising the cases with great acuteness and vigor ; and citing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a creditable liberality . Whenever he ventures to give his own comments , they indicate perspicacity and closeness of observation . But after all , the work seems to promise more than it performs . It contains little of doctrine or discussion , beyond what the English decisions exact or furnish . We look in vain for any attempt to extend the boundaries of the law beyond actual adjudications , and for any satisfactory argument upon topics , which yet remain unsettled by the courts . And a great defect , in the work , as indeed in all others  --  a defect , which has been but imper*. fectly supplied by the late treatise of Mr Stevens , is the want of a practical treatise upon averages and the adjustment of losses . We believe , that the learned author is now dead , so that there is little probability , that the work will be rendered more complete . But whatever may be the value of the English treatises on insurance , it is most obvious , that they are inadequate to supply the necessities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every work for our use , which does not contain them , is infected with a fatal infirmity . From what has been already suggested , it is // clear , that the actual administration of commercial jurisprudence in our own courts must , for argument , for authority , and for practice , be far more important to us , than any foreign opinions ever can he . In respect to insurance , although the law in most commercial states rests on the same basis of general principles , these principles admit ofcon*iderable diversity of judgment in their application , and are often controlled hy the known policy or ordinances of each particular government . This is so true , that there are probably no two civilised nations , in which the law of insurance is exactly the same in all its outlines and details . Although our own law of Insurance professes to be , and in fact is , the same in its general structure and principles as that of England , yet without any statuteable provisions , we already find many conclusions embodied in it , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these cases the English decisions may be more just and satisfactory than our own . In others we have no hesitation in declaring the American more solid , rational , and convenient . If it would not lead us into too prolix a discussion , we should incline to enter on the task of enumerating the leading differences , in order to enable the profession to form an exact judgment on the subject . But we must pass from these topics , and hasten to the close of an article already extended far beyond the limits , which we had originally intended . We will just mention , however , the point , that the right of abandonment depends upon the state of the fact at the time , when it is actually made , and when once legally exercised , it is not divested by any subsequent change of the facts , as one , in which we differ from English Courts ; and we are entirely satisfied , that our rule has the justest foundation in principle as well as policy . The same conclusion has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor Eldon . From what has been said , our opinion may be readily conjectured , as to the indispensable necessity of a new treatise on insurance , for the use of American lawyers ; and Mr Phillips has done a most acceptable service to the profession by the publication of that , the title of which stands at the head of this article . One of two courses only could be pursued ; either to republish the best English work , and append the American decisions in the shape of perpetual notes , which would have form VOL . XX. - NO. 46. 10 // ed a very inconvenient and bulky commentary , not easily reducible to specific heads ; or to recast the whole materials , and produce a new work , which should contain in one text the mass of English and American authority . Mr Phillips has chosen the latter course , and in our opinion , with great sagacity and sound judgment ; and he has bxecuted his task in a manner , which will obtain the general confidence and respect of the profession . His work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an accurate form , the whole system of the law of insurance , as it is actually administered in the courts of England and America . It is eminently practical and compendious , at the same time that it is full of information . Wherever he has introduced any comments of his own , of which he has been somewhat too sparing , he has shown sound sense , anti a liberal juridical spirit . In respect to America , his work will probably supersede altogether the use of Mr Marshall 's ; but Mr Park 's , as the fullest repertory of all the cases , will continue to retain the public favor . The labor of such a compilation must unavoidably have been great , and required the most patient research and various study . The author , as a scholar , a gentleman , and a lawyer , has now put himself before the public and the profession for their patronage of his labors ; and we are satisfied , that he will not be disappointed in the result . He need not blush for his authorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work has a solid character , and will sustain itself the better , the more it is examined . In a modest and well written preface he has expounded his design and method , and we extract from it the following remarks , which we think are characterised by a sobriety of judgment , and justness of thought , that can not fail to insure general commendation . When the inquiry does not relate to the probable decision of any one tribunal , different persons must necessarily adopt different modes of determining what is law . If a person supposes himself not to be skilful and well informed , in regard to the subject under consideration , he can only adopt the opinion of the judge or writer , whose judgment he thinks it the most safe to follow . He must decide upon authority merely , and bt* implicitly guided by the opinions of those men whom he supposes to have had the best means , and to have been the most capable , of judging , and to have formed their opinions the most deliberately , and after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself skilful // and competent to judge , he is the less determined by mere authority . But very few persons consider themselves to be so perfectly masters of any branch of legal science , as to throw off all restraint of authority ; and those who are , with good reason , the most confident of their skill and knowledge , are usually , in forming their opinions , influenced , more or less , by authority , according to the particular subject of inquiry . In most cases it is necessary to take into consideration what has been practised and decided , since the mere fact , that a thing has been decided or practised in a certain manner , is , in itself , a reason of greater or less weight , for continuing the same practice , or adhering to the established doctrine . In many branches of the law , precedent , as such , and independently of the reasons upon which it was formed , is entitled to great respect , and is not unfrequently conclusive of the law . But where a decision or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in different instances , must be consistent and also conformable to other acknowledged principles ; precedent has less weight . Concurrent decisions , however n*nerous they may be , can not establish a conclusion , which is drawn from insufficient premises ; or cause inconsistent propositions to be law . A very great part of the law of insurance consists of deductions from certain principles , which constitute a science , in regard to which , mere precedent can not have very great influence , since deductions mac curately made , lead to contradictions and inconsistencies , which no authority can vindicate . In some branches of this subject , precedent is of authority and weight , but the great part of the doctrines comprehended in this science , must stand exclusively upon the reasons and fixed principles , from which they are inferred . The inferences , which may be clearly drawn from those principles , are not made to be law , and can not cease to be law , in consequence of any number of decisions , by whatever authority they may be supported . Notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain the unvarying and unalterable law , and they need but to be presented with the reasons on which they depend , to receive the assent of a mind , which is capable of perceiving their mutual connexion and dependency . No branch of , law can more properly be denominated a science , than insurance ; and since this contract is substantially the same in different countries , and continues to be the same now that it was formerly , the decisions of courts , whether ancient or modern , and the opinions and reasonings of writers , whether American , English , Italian , or French , arc equally applicable to it . ' Of a work confessedly professional , it can not be expected , that we should enter upon a minute review , for the purpose ef detecting slight faults , or contesting particular opinions . // The task would be irksome to ourselves , and so heavy and technical , as to afford very little satisfaction to our readers . It is impossible to include in a single volume the opposite qualities of brevity and copiousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the minute details and distinctions of cases . Whoever writes a mere practical treatise , must leave much matter worthy of observation to more exhausting authors . In this age , books to be read must be succinct , and direct to their purpose . The business of commercial life will not stop , while lawyers plunge into folios of a thousand pages , to ascertain a possible shade of distinction in the construction of contracts . If , therefore , there should be any persons disposed to think , that cases and coinments should have been given more at large , the true answer is , that such was not Mr Phillips 's plan ; and that his work is to be judge*f , * not by its adaptation to other purposes , but by its actual execution of his own design . In this respect it has our hearty approbation , and we sincerely recommend it to all , who are interested in commercial jurisprudence , as merchants , lawyers , and judges . We think , however , that , in a future edition , Mr Phillips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valin , *merigon , and Pothier , upon points , which have not yet received any adjudication , and occasionally to introduce some of their speculative reasonings . We should be glad also to have more frill practical information , upon the adjustment of averages and losses , and the items , which are to be admitted or rejected , having had occasion to know , that nothing is more various , uncertain and anomalous , than the modes of settling losses in different insurance offices . Even in the same office , a departure from the principle assumed , as to one subject of insurance , is not uncommon as to another , upon some fanciful notion of its inapplicability . The form of Mr Phillips 's index also might be advantageously changed , so as to make it more easy for consultation , by the use of a larger type , and breaking it up into more paragraphs , with short subordinate titles .
