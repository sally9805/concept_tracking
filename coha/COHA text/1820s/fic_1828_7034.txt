' JNO W. DAVIS , Clerk of the District of Mussachusettes . EXAMINER PRESS . Hiram Tupper , Printer  --  Bromfield Lane . PREFACE . The design of the Legendary has been made very generally known . There still exists , however , a degree of misunderstanding with regard to it , which induces us to repeat , here , that it is intended as a vehicle for detached passages of history , romance , and vivid description of scenery and manners , materials for which exist so abundantly in our country . As far as can be discovered , the plan has met universal approbation . After a series of unavoidable delays we are enabled be offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be found interesting . Some things have been admitted which are not exactly relevant to the design of the work . This is owing partly to misapprehension by contributors , and a consequent difficulty in procuring materials of the required description ; but , more especially , to the failure of several distinguished writers , whose delinquencies we were obliged to supply at an advanced state of publication . We have received but little descriptive national poetry . This department is , consequently , almost wholly miscellaneous . We regret it the less , however , that it gives a variety to the work , the want of which might otherwise have been felt . The tale of The Palisadoes ' was , with the permission of the author , taken from a volume now in press , and it is hoped , that , though thus given in anticipation to the public , it will not diminish the interest in the forthcoming series . The article upon Vermont ' is merely introductory to some legends of that State , which will appear in future numbers . The irregularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frequent occurrence of his own productions . It will readily be seen that the difficulties attending the production of the first number of a work so entirely original , will hardly allow of its being a fair specimen . The highly respectable support promised , and a better understanding of our intentions will enable us to present our future numbers with a more specific character , and , we trust , with stronger claims upon the good opinion of the public . We should be pleased to receive well written articles Illustrating the history , manners , and scenery of the West Indies , South America , and the Canadas ; traditions of the Western and Southern States ; and , for our poetical department , national ballads , descriptions of scenery , traditions in verse , and good poetry of every description . It is particularly requested that contributions for the second volume may be sent to the publisher within the month of June next . We wish also that all who contribute to the work would give us liberty to attach their names to their productions . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for a repetition of their kind offices . With a single wish , that the national character of the Legendary may secure for it the candor and good feeling of its readers , we submit the first volume to the public . Editor . - May 1 , 1828 .

BY THE AUTHOR OF HOBOMOK . There stood the Indian hamlet , there the lake Spread its blue sheet , that flashed with many an oar , Where the brown otter plunged him from the brake , And the deer drank  --  as the light gale blew o'er , The twinkling maze-field rustled on the shore ; And while that spot , so wild , and lone , and fair , A look of glad and innocent beauty wore , And peace was on the earth and in the air , The warrior lit the pile and bound his captive there . Not unavenged the foeman from the wood Beheld the deed , and when the midnight shade Was stillest , gorged his battle-axe with blood ; All died  --  the wailing babe  --  the shrieking maid  --  And in the flood of fire , that scathed the glade , The roofs went down ; but deep the silence grew , When on the dewy woods the day-beam played ; No more the cabin smokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay moored the light canoe . BRYANT . There is a solitary spot , in a remote part of Maine , known by the name of Indian Old Point . The landscape has no peculiar beauty , save the little sparkling river , which winds gracefully and silently among the verdant hills , as if deeply contented with its sandy bed ; and fields of Indian corn , tossing their silken tresses to the winds , as if conscious of rural beauty . Yet there is a charm thrown around this neglected and almost unknown place , by its association with some interesting passages in our earliest history . The soil is fertilized by the blood of a murdered tribe . Even now the spade strikes against wampum belts , which once covered hearts as bold and true , as ever beat beneath a crusader 's shield , and gaudy beads are found , which once ornamented bosoms throbbing with as deep and fervent tenderness , as woman ever displayed in the mild courtesies of civilized life . Here , one hundred years ago , stood the village of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abnakis . These Indians have been less celebrated than many of their brethren ; for they had not the fierce valor of the Pequods , the sinewy strength of the Delawares , or the bell-toned language of the Iroquois . They were , however , an influential nation ; of consequence on account of their numbers , as well as their subtilty . The Jesuits , too , had long been among them , led by their zeal to fasten the strong girdle of an imposing faith around the habitable globe ; and they had gained over the untutored minds of these savages , their usual mysterious and extraordinary power . The long continued state of effervescence , produced by the Reformation , tended to settle this country with rigid , restless , and ambitious spirits . Our broad lands were considered an ample tract of debatable ground , where the nations of the earth might struggle for disputed possession ; and terrible indeed was the contest for religious supremacy between France and England , during the early part of the eighteenth century . Of the energy and perseverance displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian Rall , the apostle of the Norridgewocks . His rude , cross-crowned church , standing in the heart of the American wilderness , proved the ambition and extent of that tremendous hierarchy , whose roots were in another world , and whose far stretching shadow awed our own . ' Surrounded by the wigwams of the Abnakis , it seemed like an apostle of Antioch descended among savages , pointing out to them the heaven he had left . Our forefathers indeed thought it wore a different , and most unholy aspect ; but to romantic minds , the Catholic church , even in its most degraded state , must ever be an object of interest . The majestic Latin , so lofty in its sound , and yet so soulless now to all save the learned , seems like the fragments of a mighty ruin , which Rome , in her decaying pride , scattered over the nations of the earth ; and the innumerable ceremonies , more voiceless than the language in which they are preserved , forcibly remind one of the pomp and power rivalled only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humble church of the Norridgewocks kindle the imagination ; for it had little outward proportion , or inward splendor . It stood in a sheltered spot , between two small , verdant hills , with one graceful feathery elm at its side , bending forward , at every signal from the breeze , and half shading the cross , as if both bowed down in worship . Various opinions were formed of the priest , who there administered the rites of a mysterious religion . All agreed that he was a learned man ; some said he was benevolent and kind ; while others pronounced him the most subtle and vindictive of hypocrites . The English settlers , who resided about three miles from the village of the Abnakis , regarded him with extreme aversion ; but to the Indians he was the representative of the Good Spirit . It is true the maxims of the Jesuits had given something of sternness and cunning to a character naturally mild and frank ; but he verily thought he was doing God 's service , and he did it with a concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired . For thirty years he lived in the wilderness , sharing the dangers and privations incident to savage life . The languages of all the neighbouring tribes were familiar to him ; and his utterance could not have been distinguished from that of a native , had it not been for a peculiarly softened cadence , and rapid enunciation . A restless light in his small , hazel eye , and the close compression of his lips , betokened one , who had , with a strong hand , thrown up dykes against the overflowing torrent of his own mad passions . The effort had likewise turned back many a gentle current of affection , which might have soothed and refreshed his heart ; but let man do his worst , there are moments when nature will rebound from all the restraints imposed on her by pride , prejudice , or superstition . There were two objects in the secluded residence of the self-denying Jesuit , on whom he poured forth in fulness the love he could not wholly stifle within him . When he came to America , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Castine , by a beautiful young Abnakis . The child was remarkably pretty and engaging ; and the lonely priest , finding his heart daily warming toward him , induced the squaw who nursed him , to take up her abode in his own wigwam . The Indians called him Otoolpha , The Son of the Stranger , ' and seemed to regard the adopted one with quite as much interest as their own offspring . Not a year after Otoolpha and his nurse were domesticated in the dwelling of the Jesuit , some of the tribe , on their return from Canada , found a nearly famished female infant in the wood . Had not Sebastian Rall been of the party , its sufferings would , probably , have met a violent end ; but at his suggestion , comfortable nourishment , and such care as they could give it were afforded . A nose slightly approaching to aquiline , and a complexion less darkly colored than usual , betrayed an origin half European ; but as her parentage and tribe were unknown , they gave her the emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrafted her on the tree of Abnakis . From the first dawn of reason she gave indications of an impetuous , fearless , and romantic spirit . The squaw who nursed her , together with the little Otoolpha , tried in vain to curb her roving propensities . At four and five years old , she would frequently be absent several days , accompanied by her foster brother . The duties of the missionary often called him far from home , and it was absolutely impossible for him always to watch over them , either in kindness , or authority . Their long excursions during his absence , at first occasioned many anxious and wretched thoughts ; but when he found his wayward protgs invariably returned , and when he saw they could cross streams , leap ditches , and thread their way through the labyrinths of the wilderness , with the boldness and sagacity of young hunters , he ceased to disturb himself on their account . During the whole of their adventurous childhood but one accident ever happened to them . They had been at the English settlement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on their return , they took a fancy to cross the Kennebec , when recent rains had swollen its deep and beautiful waters . Saupoolah 's life nearly fell a sacrifice to the rapidity of the current ; but her foster brother ran , with the speed of lightning , to call assistance from the village they had just left . A muscular , kind hearted woman , by the name of Allan , lived in a log-house , very near the river . In the midst of his terror , Otoolpha remembered this circumstance , and went there for succor . His frightened looks told his story , even more plainly than his hurried exclamation ;  --  Ogh ! Saupoolah die '  --  the Great Spirit drink her up ! ' Mrs Allan saved the Indian child at the risk of her own life , dried her clothes , gave them something warm and comfortable to eat , and conducted them into their homeward path in safety . To this woman and her children Otoolpha and Saupoolah ever after clung with singular intensity of affection . During their childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with berries for her little ones , whom they always chose to feed with their own hands , watching every morsel of the fruit as it disappeared between their rosy lips , with the most animated expressions of delight ; and when they arrived at maturer years , they used the great influence they had with the tribe , to protect Mrs Allan from a thousand petty wrongs and insults , with which her white brethren were not unfrequently visited . Educated by the learned priest , as far as such fetterless souls could be educated , and associating only with savages , these extraordinary young people grew up with a strange mixture of European and aboriginal character . Both had the rapid , elastic tread of Indians ; but the outlines of their tall , erect figures possessed something of the pliant gracefulness of France . When indignant , the expression of their eyes was like light from a burning-glass ; but in softer moments , they had a melting glance , which belongs only to a civilized and voluptuous land . Saupoolah 's hair , though remarkably soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Otoolpha 's was brown , and when moistened by exercise , it sometimes curled slightly around his high , prominent forehead . The same mixture of nations was shown in their costume , as in their personal appearance . Otoolpha usually wore a brown cloth tunic , with tight sleeves , and large buttons , under which appeared a scarlet kilt falling to his knees , in heavy folds , edged with the fur of the silver fox , and fastened at the waist by a broad girdle , richly ornamented with Indian hieroglyphics . A coronet of scarlet dyed fur , to which were fastened four silver bells , gave indication of his noble descent ; and from his neck were suspended a cross and rosary of sandal wood , which Sebastian Rall declared to have been sanctified by the blessed touch of Innocent the Eleventh . Saupoolah 's dress was nearly similar . Her tunic was deep yellow ; and her scarlet kilt touched the fur edge of her high , closely fitted , and very gaudy moccasins . Her cap was not shaped unlike a bishop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmounted by the black feathers of three eagles her own arrow had slain . In the chase , she was as eager and keen eyed as Otoolpha . It was a noble sight to see them , equipped for the chase , bounding along through the forest . The healthful and rapid blood , coursing beneath their smooth , brown cheeks , gave a richness and vividness of beauty , which a fair , transparent complexion can never boast ; and their motions had that graceful elasticity produced only by activity , unconsciousness , and freedom . Sebastian Rall had been several years at Rome , in the service of the Pope , and had there acquired a refinement of taste uncommon at that early period . His adopted children sometimes accompanied him on his missionary expeditions to Canada and elsewhere , on which occasions the game they killed served for his support . When he saw them with their dark eyes fixed on a distant bird , arrows ready for flight , their majestic figures slightly bending backward , resting on one knee , with an advancing foot firmly fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the limb , outlines most gracefully curved , he gazed upon them with uncontrolled delight ; and he could not but acknowledge that the young savages , in their wild and careless beauty , rivalled the Apollos and woodnymphs to which classic imaginations had given birth . Such endowments are rare in Indian women ; for the toils imposed upon them , usually weigh down the springs of the soul , till the body refuses to rebound at its feeble impulses ; but when it does occur , it is the very perfection of ideal loveliness . Otoolpha would suffer no one to curb Saupoolah in her wildness and inspiration . To him and the Jesuit , she was docile and affectionate ; to all others , haughty and impetuous . The Norridgewocks regarded them both with wonder and superstition , and frequently called them by a name , which signified the Children of the Prophet . ' The distant tribes , who frequently met them in their hunting excursions , were lost in admiration of their swiftness and majesty , and called them , by one consent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our red brethren , genius was no rare endowment among them ; and seldom have souls been so rich in the wealth of nature , as the two powerful and peculiar beings , whom we have described . Many were the bold and beautiful thoughts which rushed upon their untutored imaginations , as they roamed over a picturesque country , sleeping in clefts where panthers hid themselves , and scaling precipices from which they scared the screaming eagles . Perhaps cultivated intellect never received brighter thoughts from the holy rays of the evening star , or a stormier sense of grandeur from the cataract , than did these children of the wilderness . Their far leaping ideas , clothed in brief , poetic language , were perhaps more pleasant to the secluded priest , than frequent intercourse with his own learned , but crafty order . To him they were indeed as diamonds in the desert ; ' and long and painful were the penances he inflicted upon himself , for an all-absorbing love , which his erring conscience deemed a sin against that God , who bestowed such pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply read in human nature , and it needed but little sagacity to foresee that Saupoolah would soon be to her brother something than sister dearer . ' When Otoolpha was but seventeen , and his companion not quite fifteen , their frank and childish affection had obviously assumed a different character . Restlessness when separated , and timidity and constraint when they met , betrayed their slavery to a new and despotic power . Sebastian Rall observed it with joy . Early disappointment and voluntary vows had made the best and most luxurious emotions of our nature a sealed fountain within his own soul ; but the old man had not forgotten youthful hopes and feelings , and for these beloved ones he coveted all earth had of happiness . They were married in presence of the whole tribe , with all the pomp and ceremony his limited means afforded . This event made no alteration in the household of the Jesuit . The old squaw , who had taken care of his adopted children from their infancy , performed all the services their half civilized way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fearless life as before . At the hour of sunset , it was the delight of the lonely priest to watch for their return , from a small opening , which served as a window to his study . It was a time he usually devoted to reflection and prayer ; but the good man had virtues , which he called weaknesses and sins , and a spirit of devotion would not always remain with him at such seasons . The vine covered hills of France , his mother 's kiss , and a bright , laughing girl , who had won his heart in early youth , would often rise before him with the distinctness of visions . The neglected rosary would fall from his hand , and love , as it first stole over a soul untainted by sensuality or selfishness , was the only heaven of which he dreamed . Such were the feelings with which he awaited the return of Otoolpha and Saupoolah , on the eleventh of December , 1719 . Notwithstanding the lateness of the season , the day had been as mild as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hemlocks , pines , and cedars , had drawn forth an unusual fragrance ; the children were at rest in the wigwams ; most of the sanups had gone to Moose Head Lake , on a hunting expedition ; and the few old men who remained , sat at the doors of their huts smoking their pipes in lazy silence . Wautoconomese , an aged prophet among them , declared this unnatural warmth to be a prelude of terrible things . He had gained his power of judging by a close observation of electrical phenomena and all the various changes of the weather , and it was no difficult matter to make his tribe mistake experience for inspiration . The women were all in alarm at his predictions ; nor is it strange that the learned Jesuit , living as he did in a superstitious age , and believing doctrines highly calculated to excite the imagination , should be more affected by their terrors than he was willing to acknowledge , even to himself . These feelings naturally embodied themselves in anxiety concerning the two eccentric beings , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hour at which they usually returned , had long since passed ; and strong and vigilant as he knew them to be , fearful thoughts of panthers and wolves crowded on his heart . Waking , he knew the fiercest prowlers of the wilderness would have shunned them ; but they might have slept where loup-cerviers were in ambush , and roused too late for safety . While philosophy was struggling with these harassing ideas , and every moment growing weaker in the contest , he observed in the north a flash more brilliant than ever precedes the rising sun . For a moment it was stationary ; then it moved , quivered , hurtled , and flashed , as if there had been war in heaven , ' and the clouds , rolling themselves up as a scroll , ' showed the gleaming of javelins , thrown thick and fast along the embattled line . All at once , a vivid stream of light from the south towered up , like Lucifer in his terrific greatness , and rushed onward with a mighty noise . The fiery forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear , deep spot of blue , surrounded by a few fleecy clouds . The effect was awful . It seemed as if the All-seeing Eye were looking down upon a sinful world , in mingled wrath and pity . The Catholic bowed his head , and his subdued spirit was mute in worship and fear . His solitude was soon interrupted by Wautoconomese , whose trembling agitation betrayed how little he had foreseen that his pompous prophecies would be thus sublimely fulfilled . Next the aged squaw , who , from fear of interrupting her master in his devotions , had long been crouching in her own corner of the wigwam , more dead than alive , came in , and reverentially crossing herself , implored permission to remain . To these were soon added an accession of almost all the women in the hamlet . Perhaps Sebastian Rall was hardly aware how much the presence of these rude , uninformed beings relieved his spirit . His explanations to them , mixed with the consolations of religion , nerved his mind with new strength ; and he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmness and rationality worthy of him . By degrees the light grew dim , then closed upon the speck of blue sky , which had appeared to keep watch over the souls of superstitious men , and the glorious scene seemed about to end . But suddenly a luminous bow shot from north to south with the rushing sound of a rocket , and divided the heavens with a broad belt of brightness . The phenomena of that night had been more extraordinary than any the Jesuit had ever witnessed ; but until that moment he had known their name and nature ; and , with that strange tendency to a belief in supernatural agency , which the greatest and wisest minds have , in a state of high excitement , his cheek now turned pale , and his heart dropped heavily within him , at what he deemed a sure presage of ruin to those he loved . Reason would have indeed told him that it did not comport with the economy of Providence to change the order of creation for so insignificant a thing as man ; but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ? Unable to endure the terrific creations of his own fancy , he left the house , followed only by one of the tribe , and entered the path by which the young hunters usually returned . He pursued this route , for nearly a mile , without seeing any traces of the objects of his anxiety . At last , he heard a loud Willoa . ' The source of the clear , ringing sound could not be mistaken ; for Saupoolah alone could give the shrillest tones of the human voice such depth and smoothness of melody . The Jesuit , by his long residence with the savages , had acquired their quickness of eye and ear , and a few moments brought him within view of his adopted child . She was standing in a thickly shaded part of the wood , her hand resting on her brow , looking backward , apparently listening with eagerness to the coming footsteps . A slight shade of disappointment passed over her face when she saw Otoolpha was not with her father ; but it soon gave place to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From her brief account it appeared they had early in the evening heard distressed noises apparently proceeding from a human voice ; that they had separated in search of those from whom it came , and had thus lost each other . As she finished her story , another loud shout sent echoing through the forest , betrayed more anxiety than was common to her fearless nature . Yet even amid her doubt and perplexity , her romantic soul was open to the influence of the sublime scene above her . As they wound along through the forest , ever and anon shouting with their united voices , in hopes the echo would arouse Otoolpha , she occasionally fixed her eye on the bright arch , which still preserved its wavy radiance , though a little softened by light flashes of clouds , through which the stars were distinctly visible . The arrows have been flying fast among the tribes of heaven to night , ' said she . The stars have chased their enemies over the hills . They are returning victorious ; and the moon has spread her mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these came over her , Saupoolah 's eyes had a brightness totally different from the keenness and outward brilliancy common to fine looking Indians ; it was a light that came from within , gleaming up from fires deep , deep down in the soul . It was probably this peculiarity , which had so universally gained for her the title of Daughter of a Prophet ; ' and its effect on the savage , who had attended the Jesuit , was instantly observable ; for he devoutly crossed himself , and walked at a great distance from the object of his veneration . Sebastian Rall , accustomed as he was to the wild freaks , and almost infantile tenderness of his adopted children , had often smiled at their power over the tribe ; yet something of pride , almost of deference , mingled with his own love of them . Saupoolah 's remark , and the look of inspiration , with which she fixed her eye on the heavens , awakened in his mind the remembrance of many a season , when he had listened to their wild eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in an eagerly affectionate glance at Saupoolah , and a loud shout to Otoolpha , that made the woods ring again . The young wife suddenly assumed the Indian attitude of intense listening ; and joy flushed her whole face , like a sunbeam , as she exclaimed , It is answered ! ' Another shout ! there could be no mistake . It could not be the reverberation of an echo , for it was repeated louder and louder , at irregular intervals . A rapid and devious walk , guided by sounds which evidently grew nearer , brought Otoolpha in sight . Quick as a young fawn , overflowing with life and frolic , Saupoolah bounded forward , and sprang upon his neck . But the eye of the Jesuit , always rapid and restless in its movements , quickly glanced from his new found treasure to the objects around . A European lady , possessed of much matronly beauty , lay lifeless at his feet ; and a fragile looking boy , apparently eight or nine years old , was bending over her , and weeping bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead mother , had uttered those cries of distress and terror , which had startled Otoolpha and his companion . The sight of a white man seemed to the desolate boy a pledge of safety . He nestled close to the side of the priest , and looking up in his face imploringly , burst into tears . The heart of the Jesuit was touched . There was something in the boy 's voice and the lady 's features , that troubled the waters of a long sealed fountain . The Indians exchanged whispers with that air of solemnity , which the presence of the dead always inspires . They read a mixed feeling of agony and doubt in the countenance of Sebastian Rall , but they did not ask , and they never knew its origin . After a moment 's silence , during which he seemed struggling with powerful emotion , he placed his hand gently on the boy 's head , and spoke soothing words in French , which the child understood with perfect facility . No sigh , no outward sign of despair escaped him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous quiet of a volcano , betrayed that raging materials were at work within . He ordered the corpse to be borne to his wigwam with all possible gentleness ; and when the unevenness of the path occasioned the least violence of motion , he would cringe , as if an adder had stung him . It was in vain that Wautoconomese and his frightened companion sought protection from him , on his return . Remarkable electrical appearances , in every variety of form , continued during the whole night ; but the miserable man regarded them not . The lifeless mother was placed in his study , and he knelt down beside it with the boy , and spoke not a word . The old squaw brought in her tallest bayberry wax candles , and tried to prolong her stay in the room by a thousand little officious arts ; but a gentle signal to withdraw was all she could gain from her heart stricken master . Day dawned , and found him unchanged in countenance or position . The boy , weary with grief and fatigue , had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as deep and peaceful as if unalloyed happiness had been his portion . The sight of his tranquil innocence , as the daylight shone upon his childish features , brought tears to the eyes of the rigid priest . It was a charm that broke the spell of agony which had bound down his spirit . The terribly cold and glassy look departed from him ; but never , after that night , was Sebastian Rall as he had been . Affliction did not soften and subdue him . It deepened the gloom with which he had long looked upon the world , and seemed The boy was indeed a sort of young Edwin ; ' a sad , imaginative child , fond of his books , and still more fond of rambling far and wide with the wayward Saupoolah . The log-house of good Mrs Allan was the only place where William spoke in the language of his father ; for English was a hateful sound to the ear of the Jesuit . The troubles between the neighbouring villages of English and Abnakis increased daily ; and not a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler . Distrust , jealousy , and weakness characterized all their councils . Their deep , but fluctuating feelings alternately showed themselves in insults to the priest , and acts of violence on their neighbours . Representatives were sent from the English villages on the Kennebec to the government at Boston , who protested against Sebastian Rall , for constantly using his influence to excite Indian revenge to its utmost rancor ; and letters filled with charges of this nature may still be seen in the records of the Historical Society . It is probable that they were , in some measure , well founded ; for it was the dangerous creed of the Jesuits , that all human power , good or bad , should be made subservient to one grand end . Yet the Norridgewocks had so much reason to complain of the fraud and falsehood of the English , that it is difficult to decide to whom the greatest share of blame rightfully belongs . Be that as it may , affairs went from bad to worse . Mutual dislike became every day more inveterate ; and Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or other suffered from the powerful arm of the implacable Otoolpha . His French origin , the great influence he had over his tribe , and his entire submission to the will of the Jesuit , procured for him a double portion of hatred . Dislike was returned with all the fierceness and impetuosity of his savage nature ; and English mothers often frightened their children into obedience by the use of his terrible name . In the autumn of 1724 , these discontents were obviously approaching a fearful crisis . A Council Fire was kindled at the village of the Abnakis ; and fierce indeed were the imprecations uttered , and terrible the resolutions taken against the English . Wautoconomese in his fury said , that the Evil Spirit had governed them ever since William Ponsonby came among them ; and he demanded that the boy should at once be sacrificed to an offended Deity . The lip of the venerable priest quivered and turned pale for an instant ; but it passed quickly , and so carefully had even the muscles of his face been trained in obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone be read there , as he carelessly asked , Wherefore should the child die ? ' The fierce old prophet watched his emotions as the snake fixes her infernal eye on the bird she is charming unto death . Because the Great Spirit , who dwells among the windy hills , and covers himself with the snow mantle , has whispered it in the ear of the wise man , ' said he proudly . Wherefore else did he breathe softly on the wood , for four sleeps , and take his garments from the sun , that it might give warmth to the pale papoose , on his way through the wilderness ? I tell you , he sent him to Wautoconomese , that he might sacrifice him instead of the young fawn and the beaver ; for he loves not the white face and the double tongue of the Yengees . ' And the love I bear them is such as the panther gives the stricken deer , ' replied the Jesuit . Ye are all one ! ye are all one ! ' answered the raging prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other chief ; and you say he is but a boy to the great king , who lives where the vines run with oil . Ye both have faces pale as a sick woman . One hisses like a snake , and the other chatters like a mad cat bird ; but both hunt the poor Indian like a buffalo to his trap . Wautoconomese was once a very big prophet . The Great Spirit spoke to him loud , and his tribe opened their eyes wide , that they might look on him . What is Wautoconomese now ? He speaks the words of the Great Spirit ; and ye laugh when ye tell the young men of his tribe that his ears are old , and he can not hear . ' His stormy eloquence awakened the slumbering pride of his warlike nation ; and against the whole race of white men they inwardly breathed a vow of extermination . The boy was bound for sacrifice , and evil eyes were cast upon the Jesuit . The ingratitude of those for whom he had toiled thirty long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which God had left to cheer his lonely pilgrimage , seemed to freeze the faculties of the old man ; and that day would have ended his trials with his life , had not Otoolpha stepped into the centre of the Council Circle , and , with a low bow to Wautoconomese , demanded to be heard . He spoke reverently of the prophet ; but , by all the sufferings and kindness of their French Father , he conjured them not to be ungrateful to him in his old age . He begged for the boy 's life , and promised to lead his tribe to war against every white man , woman , and child , from Corratwick Falls to the Big Sea , if they would thus reward his victory . He was a favorite with his tribe , and they listened to him . After much consultation , they determined on midnight marches at the end of three weeks , by which means they intended to surprise and put to death all the English settlers on the Kennebec . If successful in this attempt , William Ponsonby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall a victim to their savage hatred . Saupoolah slept little the night after she listened to the Council of her tribe . She thought of Mrs Allan 's kind looks , when she saved her from drowning ; and she remembered the happy hours when she used to feed the children from her little berry basket . Could she not save her from the general ruin ? She asked Otoolpha if no stratagem could be devised . He told her it would lead to detection , and the life of William and the priest would be forfeited . In her uneasy slumbers she dreamed of the murder of her benefactress ; and she started up , declaring she would save Mrs Allan 's life at the peril of her own . Otoolpha resolutely and somewhat harshly forbade her to do it . It was the first time he had ever spoken to her in a tone of authority ; and her proud spirit rose against him . I have loved him , ' thought she , but not with the tameness of a household drudge ; if such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a mate among the slaves of Abnakis . ' Her manner the next day was cold , suspicious , and constrained towards her husband . She said no more to him of her plans , but sought advice from the priest . The heart broken old man was roused into sudden energy , and solemnly and vehemently forbade her project . Saupoolah 's soul struggled in cords to which she had been entirely unaccustomed . She was silent , but determined . That night she left Otoolpha in a sound sleep , and effected her dangerous purpose secretly . She told Mrs Allan all the plans of the Norridgewocks , beseeching her to make no other use of the knowledge , than to save herself and family . The terrified matron promised she would not . But could , or ought , such a promise to be kept ? * * * * * Time passed on , and threw no light on the dangerous deed Saupoolah had dared to perform . Fears of its consequences haunted her own soul , like a restless demon ; and again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray her . More than half of her fault sprang from a kind and generous nature ; but she could not forgive herself for the vexation that had mingled with better feelings . Her pride and her buoyancy were both gone ; and upon Otoolpha , Sebastian Rall , and William Ponsonby , she lavished the most anxious fondness . The old priest cared little whether life or death were his portion ; for he was old , and disappointment had ever been the shadow of his hopes . But for the dead mother 's sake , his heart yearned for the life of the boy . Saupoolah , ever enthusiastic and self-sacrificing , promised to convey him away secretly , and place him under the protection of a Canadian priest . The time appointed was four days before the intended massacre of the English , when a Council Fire of one of the neighbouring tribes would induce most of the Norridgewocks to be absent . The night preceding his departure was a weary one to Sebastian Rall . He spent it at William 's couch in wakefulness and prayer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one object ; and he had nerved himself to think that he must part with him , and then lay him down and die . The gray tints of morning rose upon him , showing the whole of his miserable little apartment in cheerless obscurity . The old priest , stern , philosophic , and rigid elsewhere , was in the seclusion of his own apartment , as wayward and affectionate as a child . He stooped down , and parting William 's soft hair , imprinted a kiss on his forehead . The boy , half unconscious what he did , fondly nestled his cheek into the hand that rested on him . Sebastian Rall looked upward with an expression that seemed to say , O Father , would that this cup might pass from me . ' Just then the church bell , with feeble but sweet tones , announced the hour of early mass . William was on his feet in an instant , and as quickly knelt to his venerable friend to receive his customary benediction . In a few minutes , every living soul in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all quiet , and canoes were wimpling about in Sandy river . The savages had all bowed down and crossed themselves before the unseen God . The broken voice of the Jesuit was heard loudly beseeching , Ora , ora pro nobis , ' when armed men rushed in amid their peaceful worship . The clashing of swords , the groans of the dying , and the yells of the frantic , mingled in one horrid chaos of clamor . Not one escaped ; not one . Some called out , Save William Ponsonby and the priest ! ' Others aimed at the breast of the Jesuit , as if he had been the only victim desired . The English boy threw himself forward and received a stab , aimed at the heart of his old friend ; and the priest , with one convulsive bound , and one loud shriek of agony , withdrew the sword and plunged it deeply in his own breast . Saupoolah 's noble heart broke with intensity of suffering . She fell lifeless by the side of the murdered William , and a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hurried glance upon her ; and man has no power to speak the mingled rage , despair , and anguish , which that wild glance expressed . With the concentrated strength of fifty savages , he forced his way unhurt to the river side , and sprung into Saupoolah 's favorite canoe . The boat filled with water ; and he found that even here the treacherous revenge of his enemies would reach his life . With desperate strength he gained the shore , and ran toward the forest . His coronet and belt made him a conspicuous victim ; multitudes were in pursuit ; and he died covered with wounds . * * * Before the setting of the sun , the pretty hamlet was reduced to ashes ; and the Indians slept their last sleep beneath their own possessions . * * * For many years two white crosses marked the place where the Jesuit and his English boy were buried ; but they have long since been removed . The white man 's corn is nourished by the bones of the Abnakis ; and the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SILENCE . BY WILLIAM CUTTER . It was a perfect Eden for beauty . The scent of flowers came up on the gale , the swift stream sparkled like a flow of diamonds in the sun , and a smile of soft light glistened on every leaf and blade , as they drank in the life-giving ray . Its significant loveliness was eloquent to the eye , and the heart ; but a strange deep silence reigned over it all . So perfect was the unearthly hush , you could almost hear yourself think . KATAHDIN . Has thy foot ever trod that silent dell ?  --  ' T is a place for the voiceless thought to swell , And the eloquent song to go up unspoken , Like the incense of flowers whose urns are broken ; And the unvailed heart may look in and see , In that deep , strange silence , its motions free , And learn how the pure in spirit feel That unseen Presence to which they kneel . No sound goes up from the quivering trees , When they spread their arms to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow to the blast , But they breathe not a word of the power that passed ; And their leaves come down on the turf and the stream , With as noiseless a fall as the step of a dream ; And the breath that is bending the grass and the flowers , Moves o'er them as lightly as evening hours . The merry bird lights down on that dell , And hushing his breath , lest the song should swell , Sits with folded wing , in the balmy shade , Like a musical thought in the soul unsaid ; And they of strong pinion and loftier flight Pass over that valley , like clouds in the night  --  They move not a wing in that solemn sky , But sail in a reverent silence by . The deer in his flight has passed that way , And felt the deep spell 's mysterious sway  --  He hears not the rush of the path he cleaves , Nor his bounding step on the trampled leaves . The hare goes up on that sunny hill  --  And the footsteps of morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fierce , and the mighty are there  --  Unheard in the hush of that slumbering air . The stream rolls down in that valley serene , Content in its beautiful flow to be seen ; And its fresh , flowery banks and its pebbly bed Were never yet told of its fountainhead . And it still rushes on  --  but they ask not why ; With its smile of light it is hurrying by ; Still gliding or leaping , unwhispered , unsung , Like the flow of bright fancies it flashes along .
