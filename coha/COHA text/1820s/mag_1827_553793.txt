txt ART XI. - Notes on Political Economy . By J. N. CARDOZO. 1826 . Svo. pp. 125 . Charleston . THE short treatise , to which the above unassuming title is given , was written by a gentleman , who has evidently made himself f*tmiliar with the doctrines of what is called the new school of Political Economy . His object is to examine a few of those doctrines , show their consequences , and trace out the fallacy of the argument on which they are founded . For this reason , if for no other , it will be generally sought for by the true lovors of // the science . It is desirable , that some writer of talents should undertake the task , on a far more extended scale than Mr Cardozo has done ; give us a brief outline of the peculiarities in the new school ; contrast them , where it is possible , with those of the old ; state succinctly the arguments urged on both sides of the question ; and make such reflections on the growth of this branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such an undertaking would demand a good deal of research , examination , thought ; something more , in short , to be well executed , than a modest attempt at Notes . ' Mr Cardozo does not approach the most important questions ; and with many of the conclusions at which he arrives , we can not agree , although much interested in the discussion , by which he was led to them . In our own country , inquiries upon the various branches of political economy are of far more importance , than in many others , because every citizen here may he called upon to serve as a legislator ; and to think of assuming the responsibility of that high station , without some examination of the basis on which it ought to rest , or some study of the principles , by which alone it can be made to act beneficially , or not injuriously , on the general interests of society , must be , to say the least , presumptuous . The knowledge of this science is , indeed , not commonly deemed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom forms any part of the popular or recommendatory qualifications of the candidate for high political office . For these reasons and others , there ought to be some arrangement for making it more universally a branch of common education ; and the writer renders a good service , who calls public attention to any of the controversies connected with it , in a condensed form , like the one before us . There are some doctrines among the late writers on the subject particularly , which , though they have been thoroughly refuted , and for that reason probably are passed unnoticed by Mr Cardozo , may have a tendency so injurious , that they can not be too much pressed upon our examination , and shown to be utterly false . The possibility , that machinery may be too far improve4 ; that the saving of labor may thus become excessive ; that , in consequence of it , honest industry may be thrown out of employment , and condemned to suffer for the benefit of the rich capitalist , are among the number of them . And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done by some very able writers , is to call science in aid of popular pre // I " judice . Mr Cardozo does not think it necessary to reexamine them . His inquiries are , generally , into subjects more apart from common observation , and therefore less interesting , and probably less iml ) ortant , than those we have mentioned . They are subjects , however , which have called forth the attention of the most acute and intelligent writers . One of the principal objects of the author 's Notes ( and , on reading the introduction to them , we thought it was to be almost their sole object ) is to refute Ricardo 's Theory of Rents , which Mr Cardozo thinks is full of errors , and must lead to very tinreasonable or absurd results . We can not entirely agree with the objections here raised against that distinguished writer , although he has certainly made some mistakes , in his chapter on this subject . He ascribes the rise of raw produce , and of rents , to the necessity of resorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When land of an inferior quality , ' says Ricardo , is taken into cultivation , the exchangeable value of raw produce will rise , because more labor is required to produce it . ' The reason why raw produce rises in comparative value , is because more labor is employed in the production of the best portion obtained . ' When , in the progress of society , land of the second degree of fertility is taken into cultivation , rent immediately commences on that of the first quality , and the amount of that rent will depend on the difference in the quality of these two portions of land . ' There is a slight inaccuracy in in all these statements . Raw produce would rise , and rents would also rise , even if the less fertile lands were prevented in any way from being brought under cultivation . In fact , the cultivation of these less fertile lands will , in some measure , keep the price of rents and produce down , because they furnish a partial supply , and thus make the demand less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater scarcity. suppose a country of very limited extent , where the lands , though unequal , were all rich , and highly cultivated , and where none of an inferior quality could be brought forward . Suppose , that on the increase of population , produce should rise and become very high , so high , that the profits of capital invested in agriculture would he much greater , than of that invested in commerce , or manufacture , or other employments ; it is evident , that these lands must pay rent , and the rent will be just so much , as to reduce the profits of capital invested in agriculture to a level with the profits of that invested in any other way . Raw produce first // rises in price . Then rents will rise , because the returns of capital invested in agriculture are greater , than if invested elsewhere , and the landlords will make the capitalists pay for this advantage . It is not till the third or last step , and as a consequence of the two former , that new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital is employed upon the old lands with a greater return of profits . Mr Ricardo , however , goes upon the idea , that rents will not rise till new lands are actually taken into cultivation , or till a further amount of capital has been actually employed upon the old lands , and with a greater return of profits . This is clearly a mistake . Mr Ricardo , likewise , does not always point out clearly the true objects of his inquiry . In a treatise on this subject , three topics ought to be kept entirely separate ; first , The nature of rent , or what it is ; secondly , The origin of rent , or what first produced it ; and , thirdly , The measure of rent , or the proper rule for estimating its just amount . Mr Ricardo must have seen these clearly enough ; but he makes no such classification , and evidently confounds them throughout the whole of his inquiry . Will not this cousideration help to explain away the following remarks of our author ? The rent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of his work on the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation , It is defined , first , to be " that portion of the produce of the earth , which is paid to the landlord for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil . " Rent , according to this definition , is made to depend on natural fertility . But the definition given of rent by Mr Malthus , to wit , that " excess of price above the costs of production at which raw produce sells in the market , " is sanctioned by Mr Ricardo . This definition is , however , essentially different from the other , and confounds that rent , " which is paid for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil , " with that paid in consequence of the advance in the price of raw produce from restrictions on the trade in corn , and the monopoly which in some countries is connected with the possession of land . The origin of rent is described in the following manner by Mr Ricardo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities , with respect to its productive powers , and because in the progress of population , land , of an inferior quality , or less advantageously situated , is called into cultivation , that rent is ever paid for the use of it . " Rent is accounted for in this description from relative fertility . ' pp. 19 , 20. // But our author can not escape from the general reasonings and conclusions of Ricardo , in this ingenious theory , although he makes a great effort to do it ; and we are riot surprised that he has failed , for results from it can be traced very different from those , which he seems to anticipate . The following is a brief outline of the theory . On the first settlement of a new country , where rich lands are in abundance , no rent is paid , because all may enjoy them freely , and without making co mpensation . But in a short period , the produce of these will not be sufficient to furnish the necessary supply . Population has increased ; the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater demand . They rise in price ; new and less fertile lands must be taken into cultivation ; thus rent is paid on the best , but not on those of the inferior quality , which are occupied ; for by the supposition these are so plenty , that all may use them without remuneration . It can not be long , however , before the produce of these also will be insufficient to meet the full demand . Lands of the third quality are called for ; then again rents rise on the first , and are paid on the second , but not on the last , on account of their plenty ; and so the process goes on continually , as long as the country continues to advance in wealth . Mr Ricardo briefly states his views on the subject thus . If all land had the same properties , if it were boundless in quantity , and uniform in quality , no charge could be made for its use , unless where it possessed peculiar advantages of situation . It is only then because land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because in the progress of popula- ' tion , land of an inferior quality , or less advantageously situated , is called into cultivation , that rent is ever paid for the use of it . When , in the progress of society , land of the second degree of fertility is taken into cultivation , rent immediately commences on that of the first quality , and the amount of that rent will depend on the difference in the quality of these two portions of land . ' Ricardo , pp. 38 , 39 . The inferences to be drawn from reasoning on the above theory of Mr Ricardo are ; that rents make no part of the price of produce , because the price is determined by the labor bestowed upon the lands last taken into cultivation , which , by the supposition , can afford no rent ; and that , by the advance of rents , landlords , as he says , are doubly benefited ; they are benefited in the amount , and in the exchangeable value of what they receive . Mr Cardozo says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not why . The supply must have increased ; the demand must also have increased in a still greater proportion . From the first cause , therefore , the landlord will receive a larger share of the produce for his rent , and from the second cause , this produce will be of a greater l ) rice or value ; that is , the same portion of it will be worth more in the market , than it was before . But we would ask , ' says our author , what is to entitle the landlord to an increased share of the whole produce , if an increase of the whole has been effected by the skill and capital of the cultivators ? If the landlord has furnished any of the capital by which this hicrease has been obtained , his share will be in proportion to his investment ; if he gets a greater share , it will be a transfer of a portion of that to which the farmers are entitled from their capital and skill . As extended cultivation , therefore , if it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of their own improvements , the whole of the increased l ) produce arising from this extension of cultivation , is their exclusive property . There can , therefore , of right , be no increase of rent from the increased quantity of produce . ' pp. 21 , 22 . Might the author not as well ask , what right has the heir to the property , which he inherits ? A merchant or manufacturer chances to have a great stock of goods on hand , which suddenly rise in price ; would it be fair to interrogate him about his being entitled to the increased value ? We are driven back to the original institution of property to answer such questions as these . The landlord must have run some risk in the investment of his capital . Perhaps it will be a most unproductive one ; many circumstances may occur , as we shall presently see , which will transfer the rise of rents into other hands , or make it so slow in his hands , that he could have placed his capital more profitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we surely ought not to ask him about his right and title to his good fortune . All lands , which pay rent , have something more or less of the nature of monopoly . Different situations , different degrees of fel7tility , remoteness from the market , or nearness to it , these , and other circumstances , render it impossible for them to come into any competition with each other on equal terms . This fact is most remarkable in great commercial places , where the holders of convenient stands for business have greatly the advantage // over those in other situations , and they are obliged to pay for it in the form of rent . The same is true , likewise , though less obviously so , of cultivated lands remote or near , and of various degrees of fertility or improvement . The equalizing principle of rent , so clearly explained by Mr Ricardo , will place all capitalists and tenants , who are in the occupancy of spots thus more or less favorable , upon nearly the same level , and enable them to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which otherwise would be impossible . We can easily thus ascertain what will be the true measure of rents . Those of the favorable stands for business , in a large and populous city , can not be estimated with any exactness , because they must depend on the greater profits , which those places will throw into the hands of the tenants , who occupy them . But the fair rents of cultivated lands may be very clearly ascertained . The agriculturist must retain enough of the produce to pay himself for the wages , which he has employed or bestowed upon them , and enough likewise for a reasonable return of profit upon the capital invested by him ; all the residue , whether it bG more or less , ought to go to the landlord for rent , or the tenant will have an undue advantage over those in similar situations with himself , and perhaps , too , over capitalists generally . The rent of a particular piece of cultivated land , is , in short , the difference between the amount of its produce , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest lands , which can however be profitably cultivated . These remarks will show , that rent can in no case be assimilated , as Mr Cardozo thinks , to the interest on a loan of capital . j*ands rented are essentially different from capital let , because the former are always unequal , while the same amount of the latter must be always equal . It is not till after the payment of rent , that any similarity exists between them . But Mr Cardozo thinks , if this celebrated theory be true , rents will so encroach on wages and profits , that the accumulation of capital will be stopped , and population receive a fatal check at no distant period of time . And certainly the exact mathematical calculation , in which 1*'Ir Ricardo expresses his ideas on this subject , will lead many readers to the same erroneous conclusion . Mathematics are as deceptive in moral reasonings , as probabilities are in mathematics . The shades of difference between different kinds of land are faint , almost imperceptible ? and not to bG marked by numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arithmetical progression , which Mr Ricardo uses . Let it be understood , however , that he uses it merely as an illustration of his principle . At any rate , the rise on the rents of cultivated lands is exceedingly slow . Many circumstances will occur to retard or change it . The effects of science in improving the art of cultivating lands , the improvement in the tools and machinery of agriculture , and several other causes , not at all inconsistent with this theory , as our author seems to think they are , will tend to keep down the price of produce and of rents longer than this simple statement of Mr Ricardo would lead one to anticipate . A farm will pass through several hands without any sensible addition to its value . Even when new lands are necessarily taken into cultivation , though they seem of an inferior quality , the great expense is often in the first outlay , in clearing , reducing , and bringing them to a state of improvement suitable for being occupied , and then perhaps they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be thrown open in the vicinity . A near manufactory may raise its value . Many other circumstances may also occur , which will create a full demand for its produce , and thus raise its rent , or depress the rent of those , which were forinerly thought the richest and most profitable . There can be little danger , that the increase of rent , advancing according to the principles of Mr Ricardo 's theory , rightly understood , ever can become in any degree excessive . From these reflections may also be deduced an answer to another objection of our author , against this theory of rents , namely , that it makes agriculture , including the landlord 's advantages , the most profitable of all employments . Nothing can be more erroneous than this idea . It goes upon the supposition , that . by the theory the purchaser of land takes no risk in thus investing his capital , that his profits are rapid and sure , not liable to fluctuation , change , or successful competition from the cultivators of new soils ; none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Ricardo , if they he carefully examined . Every body has heard of most unprofitable agricultural speculations . But this will not weaken the general conclusions in the theory of rents , for the reasons before given . Capital naturally seeks the most advantageous employment . When , from the competition of rival adventurers , the profits of stock shall have become small and doubtful , in commerce , manufacture , and other departments of industry , we may expect more to arise // from agriculture than at present ; and this will probably be the case at no very distant period . It is a very common mistake among writers on this subject to suppose , that the rise of produce is the first and sole cause of the fall of profits . These would fall , however , for a variety of reasons , although produce remained unchanged . In our remarks thus far , we have spoken of the rise in the price of produce . It may be , however , only a fall in the price of every other article ; which amounts to precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise merely because they will command more . There may be , in consequence of improvements in agriculture , a much greater supply of produce even in proportion to the demand than formerly ; but the supply of other commodities , with which that produce is exchanged , and which measure its value , may be in still greater proportion ; it will therefore command a larger portion of those , and for this reason , and this reason alone , it seems to rise in price . Smith speaks of the stationary nature of corn rents . It is difficult to tell , however , whether they are in fact stationary . For the reasons we have given they may have risen or have fallen materially . If tried by the labor which they command , and which is the best measure of value through long periods of time , they can not have varied much . But there is some uncertainty about this , because the condition of the laborer , his food , habits , conveniences , and expectations are subject to such essential changes . We look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to dread , as the decisive proof , that a country is advancing rapidly in opulence . Observe any great commercial place , where there is a press of husiness and a crowd of population , and where there are vast amounts of capital accumulated . These are the causes of the high price of rents there , and they will not begin to fall until profits fall , business ceases to he flourishing , and the accumulation of wealth is checked . The same is observable , for similar reasons , of lands in every situation . It is true that while the country is still advancing , vents may in some places be stationary and even fall , but it is on account of their greater rise in other portions of it . Mr Cardozo thinks , too , that they are made unnaturally high , by the laws which encumber the titles to real estates , and make the transfer of them difficult and unsafe . We do not agree with him on this point . These restrictions have an opposite tendency , and make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more in danger of that extreme than of the other . if the law could free lands from embarrassing questions about title , and render the transfer of them as simple and easy , as the transfer of personal property , they would be likely to fall into the hands of those , who could most profitably use them , or turn them to the best account in the hands of others . The landlord never can find it for his interest to charge his tenant too much , because he will make the tenant 's business unprofitable , and thus ultimately reduce his own rents . He ought not to charge the tenant too little , because this is giving him an unfair and useless advantage over others in similar situations . it is in the nice calculation of asking of the tenant just so much , and no more than he can profitably afford to pay , that the true secret of assessing rent lies . Now who can make this nice and just calculation most advantageously to themselves , great landlords , who are obliged to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or those who purchase in order to vest their capital productively , and who study to employ it so as to receive the greatest possible returns from it ? There would , it is true , be a less number of large farm rents in the country , than before the restrictions were taken off , but the sum of the smaller ones must amount to vastly more than those ; and , besides , they would be more accurately looked after and carefully paid . The inferences deducible from this theory of rents seem to us very important . One of them is , that rents affect neither the wages of labor nor the profits of stock , and enter not into prices . We do not think this appears very clearly in Mr Ricardo 's chapter on the subject , though it evidently must follow from his rcasonings ; and it was the object of our remarks upon some of his inaccuracies , to make it more plain . Produce , we have seen , first rises in price . Then , and not till then , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former can not be enhanced by the latter , since it must take place before rents can be changed or affected . But it is often believed that rents do in reality make the heaviest part of prices . Landlords are sometimes represented as growing rich , and living idly and luxuriously by means of taxes indirectly levied upon the wages of the laborer , or upon the capital , which honest industry or enterprise has accumulated . But if they were to give up to their tenants all their rents , it could have no effect in reducing the prices of pro*luce , because it would neither increase the supply nor diminish // the demand . There would be the same quantity in the market , the same number of sellers , the same number of consumers . The only result of such an injudicious act of generosity on the part of landlords would be , to introduce the greatest inequality among capitalists , and into employments of all sorts , and thus lead to a state of confusion and disorder such as we can not easily describe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , in the natural course of things , that class of people , who are the most uniformly interested in their country 's welfare , are sure , without peculiar efforts of their own to advance in opulence , as their country advances in opulence , and nearly in the same proportion . The prosperity of the landholder is justly represented by Smith as always in unison with the general prosperity of society . It is difficult to conceive of any great public or private improve . ' ment , which will not directly or indirectly benefit him . His success depends entirely upon the success of every class of people around him ; while their interests , though never at variance with his , are frequently at variance with each other , and not unfrequently so with those of a great majority of the community to which they belong . He holds , too , an indissoluble interest ; but citizens in other situations , merchants , or capitalists , who find that profits have fallen , because competition has been widely extended , may transfer themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reap greater advantage , it is not without a very good reason , that the old English law , which has come to us , looks with an eye of peculiar favor on freeholders and yeomen . In these remarks on rents , we have 6bserved no difference between those of cultivated or farm lands , and those of lands in places crowded with population ; and writers on the subject generally seem to pass it by unnoticed . It was not necessary for us to point to this distinction . The character of monopoly belongs more plainly and strongly , though not more justly , to the latter than to the former . But the same principles belong to both , and the same general reasoning , which we have applied to the one , will , with a slight difference of phraseology , be found equally applicable to the other . Mr Cardozo is much more successful in some other strictures on Ricardo , and exposes one error , in particular , which has been copied , and implicitly acquiesced in , by Mr Malthus , and which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ingenious writer , in his great work on the Princi // EJan. pies of Political Economy and Taxation , employs a whole chapter in drawing distinctions between the riches and the values of a country , and seems to think that the former may be indefinitely changed , increased , or diminished , while the amount of the latter remains unaltered . This is clearly an error . The following passage from Mr Ricardo contains , in brief , the argument by which that position is maintained . If an improved piece of machinery should enable us to make two pair of stockings , instead of one , without additional labor , double the quantity would be given in exchange for a yard of cloth . If a similar improvement be made in the manufacture of cloth , stockings and cloth will exchange in the same proportions as before , but they will both have fallen in value ; for in exchanging them for hats , for gold , or other commodities in general , twice the former quantity must be given . Extend the improvement to the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all regain their former proportions . There will be double the quantity of commodities annually produced in the country , and therefore the wealth of the country will be doubled , but this wealth will not have increased in value . ' Ricardo , p. 288 . It is very easy to see through the fallacy of this reasoning . The exchangeable value of the article , the production of which is thus made more easy , must , it is certain , be diminished ; that is , the same quantity of it will not command the same quantity of other articles in the market , that it had been used to do before . Perhaps we might go farther , and admit that the exchangeable value of the whole amount of the article , so cheapened in price , has been diminished , though this is hardly possible . Admit it , however , for the sake of the argument . In the mean time , while the exchangeable value of this cheapened article is thus diminished , the exchangeable value of every other article , when compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observe the remark in the last period of our last extract . Our inference from it would be , that the sum total of the exchangeable values was doubled ; the whole of every commodity will con*mand just double the quantity of every other commodity that it formerly would . In these reasonings both Mr Ricardo and ourselves have reference merely to the internal exchanges , which may take place in the same country , and to the exclusion of those arising from foreign commerce . Our author supposes him to have been led into the above mistake , by confounding value with price . But this explanation will not do , because the real price of an article must be the same as its exchangeable value . And we // think it impossible that Mr Ricardo can have confounded it with the nominal , or money price , since in another part of his work he gives us his reasons very fully , for estimating the value of a commodity by the amount of labor necessary to be expended in its production . This , in fact , will serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposes to remain the same , because they have cost no more labor . It is an error of reasoning , and not merely of a use of words , with which we are obliged to charge Mr Ricardo . The distinction between wealth , or riches , and value seems to us very simple ; yet it has been the ground of much discussion , and led to many mistakes . Take , for example , the following remarks , which are intended for a definition of the term wealth , by Mr J. B. Say , , the most popular , and perhaps the most able writer on political economy , since the time of Smith . If we take the pains to inquire , what that is , which mankind in a social state of existence denominate wealth , we shall find the term employed to designate an indefinite quantity of objects bearing inherent value , as of land , of metal , of coin , of grain , of stuffs , of commodities of every description . When they further extend its signification to landed securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is evidently because they contain obligations to deliver things possessed of inherent value . In point of fact , wealth can only exist where there are things possessed of real and intrinsic value . Wealth is proportionate to the quantum of that value ; great , when the aggregate of component value is great ; small , when that aggregate is small . ' Say , p. 1 . Even the most superficial reader will see this to he an error . The intrinsic value of some things , of water , for instance , may be very great , thou0h they are seldom to be ranked among articles of wealth , and many , which are so ranked , and highly , have in them little intrinsic value . The wealth , too , contained in some commodities , may continually vary , either increase or diminish , while their intrinsic value remains unchanged . It appears to us , that under the term wealth we class together those objects only , which have exchangeable value , whether they are usePd or not , and that their wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to their utility or to any other inherent quality whatever . If exchangeable value be given to the most common things , they become articles of wealth ; if it be subtracted from even the richest , they cease to he so esteemed . N remarkable proof of this occiurs in the example just cited , of // water , which in some places , in cases of great scarcity , has had a high exchangeable value , and then the possession of large quantities of it may have been wealth , but it is never thought such in common cases , because from its plenty it has no exchangeable value . It is said , however , that we are not to apply the term to notes , paper money , securities , &amp;c . And why not ? The owner of a warehouse full of raw produce , or of a chest of massive gold , or of coffers of metallic money , will find them of little service to him beyond their exchangeable value ; and if the holder of a bank note , or bill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we know not why he may not give it as high a title . Let it be observed , that we are now insisting on what we take to be the common use of language . Perhaps it might have been more judiciously appropriated at first . But we have no right to limit it to suit our own ideas on the subject ; and we can not doubt that it is commonly , and , indeed , universally used , as we have explained it . We have room to touch slightly upon one other theme suggested by our author , in the discussion of which he seems to have fallen into a singular mistake . He represents a paper currency in all its forms , and with every convenient limit and restriction , as one of the greatest causes of national decline , wherever it is established . We find that nations become more thriftless in proportion as they depart from the use of a medium of circulation possessed of intrinsic value . ' That the use of a paper currency has been grossly abused , perverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ruin , and distress to thousands , and that it ought , therefore , to be put under more severe legislative restrictions , than it has hitherto been , we presume no one acquainted with the history of it will deny . But the idea of abolishing it entirely is new to us . We know not indeed how this could be effected , whatever might be the expediency of such a measure . If it were possible to suppose a country , where it had never been particularly needed , and where the channel of circulation had always been conveniently filled with gold and silver coins , the holders of large portions of these might still find , or think it profitable to send them abroad ; and then the deficiency would be felt at once . A system of credits must he established or extended throughout the community . It will , however , be very imperfect at first , because the facility of transfer is not understood , or not reduced to practice ; the creditor , who has some // doubt about the ability of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk , while those to whom he is indebted , may feel the same doubts of him , have the same difficulty of transfer , and be also in their turn exposed to the same troubles in their transactions with others . It is in this imperfect state of credit , and in order to relieve the embarrassments arising from it , that banks , or something in tim nature of banking institutions , are introduced . They assume the responsibility of the debtor ; they relieve the creditor of his anxiety and doubt ; they enable him to divide into small portions , and transfer some of his risk to those with whom he deals , and so the system is carried among every class of people , as far as commerce of any kind extends . It is all an ingenious piece of machinery for establishing , dividing , regulating , and transferring credits , as substitutes in the place of money ; for the holder of a bank note is a mere creditor of the bank to that amount . Now it is difficult to tell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural course of things we have described . Would he prohibit the exportation of specie ? Would he check credit , or the transfer of credit , or the evidence of this transfer , by paper or scrip ? Would he order that no class of people in the community , however respectable and wealthy , should assume , for honest purposes , the debtor 's responsibility , or the creditor 's risk , although all the interested parties were desirous of their doing it ? Every one of these measures must be taken , before a paper currency can be effectually prevented . But we know not how a government can take either of them , without such a gross infraction of private right , or such an improper interference with the fair bargains of individuals , as no free people of intelligence will voluntarily submit to . It has been thought by some very able writers , that the minute subdivision of these credits , or the issue of small notes by banks , ought to be prevented . We have our doubts about this however . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been ascribed to them by the foreign journals . It is now universally allowed , that a paper currency can not be safe , unless it be convertible , at the pleasure of the holder , into gold and silver , either in the shape of coin or of bullion . And with this qualification it may be looked upon as decidedly the most important modern invention in the accumulation of wealth . It renders exchanges incomparably more rapid and easy . The wheels of commerce are rid of a superfluous load . Tedious , // laborious processes in business are dispensed with . In short every step of the progress , from the first production of commodities to their ultimate distribution , is wonderfully facilitated ; and if , according to the ingenious speculations of a late writer on the subject , the quantity , or amount of the circulating medium must be in an inverse proportion to the rapidity with which it moves , and effects exchanges , a far greater sum in coins will be necessary for the purpose than in paper money . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most expensive material . A large portion of the supply of the precious metals is rendered superfluous , and the wear , tear , waste , and unavoidable losses upon those in use are in a great measure s*ived . Were it necessary to fill up the circulating medium wholly with them , as our author , together with many others , seems to think , so much capital must be withdrawn from profitable employments , and suffered to remain unproductive , and upon the decline . To procure it at the first , and to keep it good continually , must be an immense tax , though an indirect one , upon the whole community ; and its effects will be visible upon their wealth . Their real profits of stock will be less ; their real wages of labor less , their real rents of land less ; and such a people can not bring their commodities to market on equal terms with those who are free from that unreasonable tax , and whose circulating medium is cheaper and better . In the natural course of things nations tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally have encouraged them in it . We believe they will still continue to do it , notwithstanding the popular clamor we often hear against paper money . The great public evil , which writers on political economy have feared from banks , is the over issue of their notes , by which they say the value of money may he indefinitely reduced , and the value of all other commodities of course in the same proportion raised . But there is a natural limit to this not generally understood , which must check it at an early stage in its progress , if not entirely prevent it . That limit is the cost and the exchangeable value of the precious metals . A coin is worth no more than the bill , which promises to pay it , for by the supposition the one is convertible into the other at the pleasure of the holder . Whatever amount therefore of paper currency is pressed into circulation , as long as this convertibility remains , the value of it will be regulated by the labor and expense necessary for procuring gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mint . It can never continue for any length of time materially below this . If there should be such an excessive quantity of it issued as to raise the price of all other commodities , bullion , as a commodity , would rise also , the coins be melted down in order to form it , drafts made upon the bank to procure them for that purpose , and thus the over issue will be immediately checked , and the amount of the currency lessened both by the return to the bank of its notes in exchange for specie , and by an absolute diminution in the number of coins . The consequence will be , that prices will everywhere be brought down to their proper level . It has been lately said , that Adam Smith had wrong or confused ideas on currency ; that the channel of the circulating medium can nowhere overflow nor be perfectly full ; that it will easily receive and dispose of any amount of money , which may be thrown into it , however valuable it may be ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , is to diminish or increase in just the same proportion the prices of all other articles in the country . And in support of this , it is urged , that , on the discovery of the mines in America , the different nations of Europe absorbed into their circulation a much larger portion of gold and silver than had been found sufficient for their purposes before . These statements may lead to very erroneous conclusions . The amount in the quantity of the circulating medium we allow may be almost indefinitely enlarged , and all easily appropriated and used . But the amount in its whole value must remain nearly the same , and can be increased only with the growing wealth of the country . Its traffic and exchanges will absorb only a certain amount of value . It was the depreciation of this , we believe , which , on the discovery of the American mines , made a larger portion of gold and silver necessary for European commerce . It was merely a greater quantity of these , and not a greater amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If these remarks be true , an unnecessary number of bank notes of undiminished value can not be kept abroad to serve the purposes of money . But while they are exchangeable for coins , their value never will be diminished . We have no great or lasting evil to apprehend , therefore , from an over issue of such notes , nor from the injurious effects on prices which it is said to produce . If there are more notes issued from the banks than the exchanges of the country require , and thus the value of money is // lowered , and that of other things raised , yet not enough to lead to the melting of the coins , the evil will be remedied in other ways . A portion of the gold and silver will go abroad , and seek in foreign parts that profitable employment , which it can not find at home . This will have a direct effect in lessening the sum in circulation , and an indirect effect also in doing it by limiting the issues of the banks . The high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the importation of goods that are cheaper , and the competition arising from these , together with the exportation of specie for various reasons , will all tend to bring about the same results ; namely , to raise again the value of money , reduce that of commodities in general , and keep the circulating medium on its proper level . It is true , that banks have been olien disposed thus to over issue ; but , as Smith says , they are always much the greatest , if not the only sufferers by it , because they are obliged to have on hand a far greater amount of capital in proportion , and the returns of their notes to them in demand for specie , will be so rapid , that they are called upon at short intervals to replenish , in order to keep it constantly good . This is not the evil , however , in the administration of banking establishments , from which the public have to fear much , or long . It is one of a very different character . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for personal favor ; loaning notes on bad or insufficient security , and without enough metallic currency or bullion or capital of any sort to pay them off or redeem them when they are presented . It is from these , and similar causes , and not from the indiscreet , unprofitable over issue of paper , that the great distresses and embarrassments connected with monied institutions have principally arisen . How they are effectually to be prevented , we are not prepared to say . In equable times , when business is regular and uniform , a large number of separate , independent banks have a great power in correcting it . It is the interest of each to check the others ' issues ; they , therefore , watch each other , often try each other ; and their competition will have a powerful effect in regulating each other s transactions , and in making them all equal . and fair . But business is not always regular and uniform ; and the danger can never thus be entirely removed . It deserves consideration , whether some greater personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers or directors of these institutions . In our remarks we have constantly observed a distinction between fraudulent issues , and fair over issues , of bank notes . They // are commonly spoken of together ; but it is important that they should be kept separate , because the former alone require the control of government , and the latter , we have shown to be comparatively a slight evil , which wil* speedily bring about its own remedy . We have not stated Mr Cardozo 's arguments against a paper currency ; and we approach them reluctantly , because they seem to us unxvorthy of him , and can do no credit to his work . he says , that on the first substitution of paper for the coins , that class of laborers and manufacturers , who were engaged in producing the commodities , formerly to be sent abroad in exchange for bullion , are immense sufferers ; and that if , in consequence of rapidly increasing business , a country should suddenly want more coins to effect its exchanges than it has , it will soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily ' have been at the same time and in the same proportion retarded . This is to us very unsatisfactory reasoning . How ? Is it the doctrine here , that the gain of one nation is necessarily the loss of some other ? And that a whole people is to be heavily taxed in order to procure an article which it does not want , and support a class of men , who would otherwise be elsewhere more profitably employed , both to themselves and to all around them ? For , as we have seen , the expense of the rich currency is a levy on the wealth of every one . The profits of every employment must be lessened by it , and those , who are engaged in procuring the articles , which are to be sent out for the importation of the precious metals , must be , in their proportion , sufferers with the rest . The above arguments , can not be the deliberate sentiments of our author . If he has not formally disavowed them in other parts of his book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent with them . On the whole , our readers will easily gather , from what we have said , our opinion of Mr Cardozo 's pamphlet . it is generally interesting to us . It contains some very ingenious reasonings , particularly in the last chapter , on taxes . The errors of the author seem to be those of precipitancy , and want of care ; and this remark applies as well to his faults of style , as to the opinions he advances . It is sometimes difficult to ascertain , in the beginning of a chapter , what he intends to do ; and we are not quite sure , that we have found it all out , when we arrive at the end . But with all these faults , we have no hesitancy in recommending the book to those , who are fond of such inquiries , and who are willing to see the critics of Snimith , and of the lovers of Smith in their turn also , severely criticised .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
