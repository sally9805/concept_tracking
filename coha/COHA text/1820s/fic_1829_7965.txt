Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : PREFACE . from Al Aaraaf , Tamerlane , and minor poems ( 1829 ) 1 Romance who loves to nod and sing With drowsy head and folded wing Among the green leaves as they shake Far down within some shadowy lake To me a painted paroquet Hath been  --  a most familiar bird  --  Taught me my alphabet to say  --  To lisp my very earliest word While in the wild wood I did lie A child  --  with a most knowing eye . 2 Of late , eternal Condor years So shake the very air on high With tumult , as they thunder by , I hardly have had time for cares Thro ' gazing on th ' unquiet sky ! And , when an hour with calmer wings Its down upon my spirit flings  --  That little time with lyre and rhyme To while away  --  forbidden things ! My heart would feel to be a crime Did it not tremble with the strings ! Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : TO  --   --  from Al Aaraaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my early life seem , As well it might , a dream  --  Yet I build no faith upon The king Napoleon  --  I look not up afar For my destiny in a star : 2 In parting from you now Thus much I will avow  --  There are beings , and have been Whom my spirit had not seen Had I let them pass me by With a dreaming eye  --  If my peace hath fled away In a night  --  or in a day  --  In a vision  --  or in none  --  Is it therefore the less gone ?  --  3 I am standing ' mid the roar Of a weather-beaten shore , And I hold within my hand Some particles of sand  --  How few ! and how they creep Thro ' my fingers to the deep ! My early hopes ? no  --  they Went gloriously away , Like lightning from the sky At once  --  and so will I. 4 So young ? ah ! no  --  not now  --  Thou hast not seen my brow , But they tell thee I am proud  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shame At the paltriness of name With which they dare combine A feeling such as mine  --  Nor Stoic ? I am not : In the terror of my lot I laugh to think how poor That pleasure " to endure ! " What ! shade of Zeno !  --  I ! Endure !  --  no  --  no  --  defy . Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : SPIRITS OF THE DEAD . from Al Aaraaf , Tamerlane , and minor poems ( 1829 ) 1 Thy soul shall find itself alone ' Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone  --  Not one , of all the crowd , to pry Into thine hour of secrecy : 2 Be silent in that solitude Which is not loneliness  --  for then The spirits of the dead who stood In life before thee are again In death around thee  --  and their will Shall overshadow thee : be still . 3 The night  --  tho ' clear  --  shall frown  --  And the stars shall look not down , From their high thrones in the Heaven , With light like Hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To thy weariness shall seem As a burning and a fever Which would cling to thee for ever : 4 Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish  --  Now are visions ne'er to vanish  --  From thy spirit shall they pass No more  --  like dew-drop from the grass : 5 The breeze  --  the breath of God  --  is still  --  And the mist upon the hill Shadowy  --  shadowy  --  yet unbroken , Is a symbol and a token  --  How it hangs upon the trees , A mystery of mysteries !  --  Poe , Edgar Allan , 1809-1849 : TO M  --  from Al Aaraaf , Tamerlane , and minor poems ( 1829 ) 1 O ! I care not that my earthly lot Hath  --  little of Earth in it  --  That years of love have been forgot In the fever of a minute  --  2 I heed not that the desolate Are happier , sweet , than I  --  But that you meddle with my fate Who am a passer-by. 3 It is not that my founts of bliss Are gushing  --  strange ! with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hath palsied many years  --  4 ' T is not that the flowers of twenty springs Which have wither 'd as they rose Lie dead on my heart-strings With the weight of an age of snows. 5 Nor that the grass  --  O ! may it thrive ! On my grave is growing or grown  --  But that , while I am dead yet alive I can not be , lady , alone .
