txt ART . VIII. - The Speeches of HENRY CLAY , delivered in the ; Congress of the United States ; to which is prefixed a Biographical . Memoir , with an *dppendix , containin6 his Speeches at Lexington and Lewisburg , and before the Colonization Society at Washington ; together with his . flddress to his Constituents , on the Su&amp;ject of the late Presidential Election . Philadelphia . 8vo. pp. 381 . WE believe this to be the first volume of speeches of one individual , which has been published in our country . There were , doubtless , in the first generation of legislators under the Constitution several , whose collected speeches would amply suffice to fill a volume . But in consequence of the less improved condition of the reporter s art in former years , and of the general infancy of the American press , the parliamentary eloquence of the country has hitherto obtained no better record than the columns of the newspapers . Exceptions to this remark exist in Lloyd 's Register of Debates in the first Congress ( of which the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , in the collection of debates on tile British treaty , and in a few similar publications . In no former case however , we believe , has the American public been *Iatified with a volume of the collected speeciles of any single one of our public men . In England , as is xeil known , such collections are frequently made . We possess the collected speeches of almost all tile eminent politicians , who have flourished since the art of reporting has been brought to a high degree of improvement . To tile politician , such works are exceedingly valuable . In no * way illore advantageous , can the political history of any period be studied , than in the parliamentary expositions of prominent statesmen . Without these expositions . measures indeed may // be matter of history ; but their oriinal springs , their connexion with a political system , and their bearing on constitutional law , as understood by their advisers , can be but imperfectly apprehended . If this be true in England , where Parliament lays claim to political omnipotence and the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is peculiarly true in this country , in which a power beyond the legislature is recognised , residing in the people , and acting through the constitution as the expression of their will . It is this , which gives such importance to the authentic speeches of wise statesmen of the present day , and still more of the earlier days under the federal constitution . Whatever the people intended in that expression of their will which we call the Constitution , or whatever is necessarily deduced from its provisions , is the law of the land . On account of the imperfection of language , it is not in every cm , and in the vast variety of individual actions , possible to pronounce , as a inatterof course , what is or is not die rule of the constitution as applied to that case . Whenever a doubt arises , contemporaneous or closely subsequent expositions of the constitution , proceeding from judicious and able statesmen , are of igiestiniable value . And these expositions are mostly to be souEbt in the records of congressional debate . tYc know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our politicians , and the students of our political history , than a work arranged on time model of the Parliamentary History of Great Britain . It is not yet too late to compile it . The materials are in existence and in respectable quantity . Lloyd 's Register is a tolerably ample sketc9 of the debates , in the House of Representatives , during fife most interesting period , that of the first Congress . Sep* collections , as we have above observed , exist of the speeches on some very prominent questions ; and the newspapers published at the seat of govermnent for die time being , are provid*cj with snething like a series of reports , from the adoption of die tution to the present time . Such a work has indeed been stested by die enterprising publishers of the Congressional Re ter , and we confidently believe , that it would be highly acceptable to the community . Till such a work is achieved , and even after it shall have been achieved , separate collections , like that now before us , of the speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable of the politician 's materials . The political history of a country is , in a good de0ree , the history of its eminent men . Their lives and public measures are the property of the country , and their good fame is its best treasure . The public sentiment and feeling of the cOmmunity are scarce ever embodied in a more authentic form , than that of the discourses of responsible individuals , in the legislative assemblies of the nation . With the measures to which they relate , such speeches will go down to other times as a portion of the action of the age ; of the general result of the wondrously complicated political machine . If there be any part of political history , which is moie peculiarly endued with vitality , an ( l elevated above the dead letter of form and official routine , it is the al ) peal of the able and the xvise to their contemporaries and to the world , for the motives and principles , on which their measures are taken . Regarding the record and preservation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such interest and moment , the means adopted to attain these ends immediately become important . It is a very mistaken conception , that the effect of a good or a bad state of the art of reporting is merely , whether we shall or shall not have a faithful record of what is spoken in our deliberative assemblies at any particular time . On the contrary , the history of parliamentary eloquence teaches us , that on the condition of the reporter 's art will very much depend the character and quality of the debates themselves . Till the art of reporting contemporaneously was introduced , parliamentary eloquence , in the modern acceptation of the term , can scarcely be said to have existed . Among the Greeks and Romans , it is well understood , the best orators wrote their speeches either before or after they were spoken , probably , in most cases , the former . It is this with which Demosthenes ( according to Plutarch ) was reproached , when it was said , that his speeches smelt of the lamp . We find among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several repetitions of passages too long in themselves , and too exactly repeated in some points , and too carefully varied in others , to be ascribed to chance . There is also among the works of Demosthenes a series of compositions , which , under the name of Proems , were intended to serve as suitable introductions to speeches , on any arid every subject . In like manner , the orations which are preserved to us from Cicero , are evidently written compositions ; and some of them , it is known , were never spoken . // The parliamentary eloquence of England is of little consideration , till the time of Lord Chatham . There were , it is true , great geniuses , wise and accomphshed statesmen , and , no doubt , 1 ) owerful speakers in both houses of Parliament , from the time that public measures began to be discussed in that body . But when we cast our thoughts back , and ask , who were the famous orators of the time of Queen Elizabeth , of the Commonwealth , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amidst all the great names of the great men , to point them out , in anything now remaining . Sir William Pepys , indeed , tells us , that he himself had credit for the best speech ever made in Parliainent ,  --  a circumstance certainly not calculated to give us a high notion of the standard of parliament ry eloquence at that period . We are well aware , that one great reason for the poverty of the parliamentary eloquence of earlier days is to be sought in political causes . There can be no eloquence in discussion , where there is no independence of decision within doors , and no power of public sentiment without . The growth of parliamentary eloquence in England has kept pace with the march of free principles in the country , and the necessary deference of the government to the public sentiment , in the administration of affairs . Burke is reported to have said , that the debates*. a century ago were comparative vestry discussions to what they afterwards became . ' This change , in the opinion of his biogr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He is considered , by the enlarged views , by the detailed expositions of policy , the intermixture of permanent truths bearing on temporary facts , and the general lustre and air of wisdom , which lie was the first to iiitroduce at large into parliamentary discussions , 6reatly to have exalted the character of Parliament itself , and by the display of his own characteristics to have excited the emulation of others . ' No person can be more disposed than we , to ascribe to the influence of Burke 's example all that can be effected by that of any man , and more than was effected by that of any other man . But would the eloquence of Burke itself have been what it was , hut for the aid , which the press began at this period to yield to the debates ? Does not the whole elaborate structure of his speeches show , that they were conceived under // the operation of the assurance , that they would go out to the world ? Had these splendid orations , one after another , died away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing of them gone forth , hut the evanescent rumor of their power , is it possible , either that l3urke himself would have persevered in their production , or that others would have kindled with emulation ? In our opinion it is clearly impossible , and we ascribe , in a considerable degree , to the introduction of the practice of contemporaneous reporting , the sudden and extraordinary growth of parliamentary , eloquence , which dates from the latter oort of Lord Chatham 's career . We do not conceive that there is anything extravagant in attributing so important an effect to a cause , which may seem at first insignificant . It is precisely the effect of the invention of alphabetical writing on the primitive literature of Greece ; the effect of the introduction of paper on prose composition ; arid the effect of the art of printing on learning in general . Till speeches began to be reported in detail and contemporaneously , the public at large was ahnost wholly uninformed of what passed within the walls of parliament . So long as it was a breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very clear that few men would strain their minds to the utmost reach , in the highest efforts of the art of speaking well . It is only therefore , we repeat , since the practice of contemporaneous reporting grew tip in England , that parliamentary eloquence has been placed , in that country , upon its present improved footing . Nothing before it of the kind , in the history of the intellectual world , can be compared with it . We apprehend that the careful observer , who shall go into the house of commons , listen to the speeches ( unpremeditated as to language and form ) of the most distinguished members , follow the discussion to a division the same evening , and the next morning at breakfast find those speeches reported faithfully in three or four newspapers , of which about thirty thousand copies have been struck off and are in circulation , will admit that he has witnessed a spectacle of intellectual , politico I , and mechanical power combined , such as is nowhere else to be found . Did the matter stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But inasmuch as this is the great apparatus l ) y which the British government is administered ,  --  by which a greater amount of governmental business ( if we may fabricate // the word ) is done , than is anywhere else performed , it deserves the consideration of practical statesmen . It deserves the consideration especially of American statesmen , because our institutions are a series of akernate similitude and contrast with the English . Most other *overninents are wholly foreign to us . The English government presents much that we have directly imitated , in close connexion with much , which we have directly avoided . The congressional eloquence of America is , we think , in no high repute among ourselves . We do not refer merely to the habitual sarcasm or ridicule thrown upon it , r*ostly for purposes of personal satire or party detiaction . To this kind of reproach every part of the machinery of a free government is ever obnoxious . Where the press is free , men will joke their political opponents , and the English Parliament is as sadly quizzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected beaux esprits , who constitute themselves guardians of the public weal . If classical authority he wanted , Pericles was the great butt of the satirists of his day . But we apprehend that , in America , the matter goes a little farther than this . The debates in Congress appear to us to he spoken disrespectfully of , by many of the judicious portion of the community ; of that portion , who really say less than they feel and think , and whose censures deserve to be listened to . This consideration has suggested to us the propriety of some inquiry into the different character of the eloquence of the English Parliament and of the American Congress , and of the causes of this difference , if any substantial difference shall be found to exist . We may perhaps trace the superiority of the English parliamentary eloquence , in part , to circumstances incompatible with our free institutions . In the English Parliament , there are fewer speakers than in the American Congress . Except on rare occasions , which call out particular individuals not otherwise accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the house , and as many more on the opposition , are all that speak on questions of general interest . These individuals may not be the same on every question ; but one gentlemen is more likely to speak on a matter of foreign politics , another on retrcnchm*nt , a third on the Catholic question , a fourth on parliamentary reform , and not more than one or two on either side undertake the character of general champions . On // of these is of course the leading minister on the side of gov .. eminent , and occasionally an individual has , we believe , been formally designated , as the leader of his majesty 's opposition . Various causes may account for this paucity of speakers in the House of Commons . There is little motive for the inexperienced , the inefficient , the uninformed , ( of whom there is a larger portion in the House of Commons , than in the American Congress ) to attempt to speak . Every question is sure to be discussed in a masterly manner , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others to place themselves in so disadvantageous a contrast ? In this country there are many motives . The fear of the constituent is one . Members are sent from their several districts by a free choice of the citizens , and they suppose their constituents have an eye upon them , to see how they acquit themselves , at least to see that they acquit themselves somehow . The seat of government is remote from most of the districts , and its population is not large enough to possess of itself an operative public sentiment , whereas London is the great sensorium of the British empire . The member of parliament who does not produce a favorable impression at London , produces none at all , but is irretrievably lost . With us , the least concern of a member of Congress is how he stands at Washington . His heart is in Carolina , in Maine , or beyond the Alleganies . With these distant regions he communicates through the press . The speaking is the smallest part of the business ; it is only the occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps in a pamphlet , to be sent home to his constitu cuts . In England this fear of the constituent exists , indeed , to a certain extent , but far less than in this country , either as to intensity or generality . One class of members of the House of Commons hold their places entirely independent cf any form of popular election . Certainly the members from old Sarum have to make no speeches to satisfy their constituents . Another class of members of Parliament may take upon their lips that well known reply of a loving member to those whom he purported to represent , you , gentlemen , I have bought you , and do you think I will not sell you ? ' XVhen Burke knocked down one of Lord Somebody 's ninepins , the aforesaid ninepin ( lid not need to make a speech to his conlituents to get himself up again ; it xva* enough if he stood // rectus ? fl curia with his master . Still , however , this class ot members is by no means , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societ ) r is , the rotten and close boroughs are the means by which a very considerable part of the talent of the House of Commons is brought within its walls . The representation of the counties is monopolized by the most powerliil and wealthy families in them , and can rarely be contested but at an enormous expense . The matter is nearly the same with the populous boroughs ; and it is only the boroughs , which are avowedly or virtually under patronage , or influence amounting to patronage , that give entrance to men of talent , unsupported by fortune , but brought forward by political or personal friends . It is plain , however , that composed as we have represente ( I the House of Commons to be , there is much less inducement to speak to the ear of the constituent than with us . Out of some of the same causes grows a party ( liscipline in the English House of Commons of which we here know little or nothing . Men there depend more for their political standing on their party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things in our own country , the attempt to lead , on the part of a few individuals of a party , meets with no success . Neither side of the House of Representatives , or of the Senate of the United States , xvould submit to have the liberty of speech engrossed by half a dozen members . A half a dozen others believing themselves , and justly perhaps , cqual to the designated few , would be ready , on the first occasion , to throw off their allegiance , and speak for themselves and their constituents . The political leaders , in fact , in this country , seem to be perpetually baffled by the difficulty of getting followers . Make way , gentlemen , ' ( once cried a Massachusetts representative to the populace , who were crowding him out of his place , in the procession on election day ) , make way , we are the representatives of the people . ' Make way yourself , ' replied a sturdy member of the throng , we are the people themselves . ' Excepting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party excitement , there is no principle , on which a few individuals would here be permitted to monopolize the privilege of speaking in either house of Congress , however great their superiority over their brethren . In the House of Commons , it is not only no assumption for a few men , on each side , to take the thing pretty much into their our hands ; but the assumption is thought to be on the part of the member // who , not being of the dUe should presume to take up the time of the house . A new member is , we believe , usually listened to with great forbearance and even courtesy . Common justice of course demands , that the stranger should be permitted to offer a taste of his quality . Once heard , he is allowed to rise as high as mere iiierit will carry him , or the merit he may have , united with such other means of rising as are in his power . But no man is suffered , for any length of time , to whet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , where downright in capacity is allowed , by oft essaying and frequent failure , to work itself up into a respectable measure of prosing mediocrity . If on the first or second trial , the unfleds*ed leislator fail , he is remanded , beyond appeal , to the Freemasco 's Hall and the Crown and Anchor Tavern , to move resolntions at charitable meetings , and return thanks for the drinking ol his health at a public dianer . When we speak of a party discipline in England , which enables the leaders in Parliament to dispense pretty cavalierly with the speaking services of their adherents , we would have the word understood in the large sense , which belongs to the state of society in that country . Mere handsome speaking talent , backed by a reasonable allowance of sense , general information , and political knowledge , does not possess the relative weight in England which it does in America . In Congress , the weight and standing of members are in pretty exact proportion to their talent , political experience and reputation , and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as rank is unknown , and parliamentary and executive influence quite as much so . In Parliament , talent , whether for speaking or anything else , is but one element that goes to ascertain the member 's character . The patronage of the crown , family , property , command of votes by influence over boroughs ( a modification of monied influence ) , and the action on the legislature of the great institutions and corporations of tl** state , such as the church , the bank , the army , the navy , the courts , are so many cooperating influences , which strongly qualify the mere power of talent , and make its manifestation by speaking of less avail . Another circumstance , which tends to curtail speaking in the House of Commons , and bring debates within limits to which they have never been confined in this country , is the manifest necessity of the case , in consequeiice of the vast // amount of business , which is to be done . The revenue in England may now be taken at sixty millions of ponn6s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much as ours . Now the quantity of business in a government may at least be assumed to be in proportion to its revenue . In England , it increases no doubt in a ratio larger than tht of the increase of the revenue , because a good deal of business conies upon Parliament , not connected with the raising or ( uSbirsing the funds of the state . The sessions of Parliament are annually not much longer than the long session of our Congress . XVe will allow lhr safe calculation , that , xvhile the two sessions of Congress average five months each , the annual sessions of Parliament average six months . Here then , in a session but one sixth longer , twelve times as much business is to be done . The consequence is , that less time , in that proportion , must he passed in debate , and more must be devoted to business , otherwise the wheels of government must stop . The Congress of the United States feels this pi**me of business , during a part of the session , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close , the houses become impatient of debate . Questions , which it is , in the nature of things , impossible to settle without long debate , are thrust aside . Questions , which a majority think at all events ought to pass , are forced through by the previous question ' ( a course never adopted in Congress without great relLictance , but resorted to in Parliament as freely as a motion to lay on the table ) ; while questions of m*nor importance , and particularly private bills , which at an earlier stage of the session would have provoked long debates , are often taken towards its close sub silentio , or on the faith of the committees . In the result , more business is sometimes done in a week , or even a day , toward the end of the session , than in a month at its commencement . While this pressure of business exists , of course , all metaphysics on constitutional interpretation , and all popular appeals to the remote constituent , are by necessity shut out . To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the session , under this duress of business . They must act , to keep the mighty fabric of government from falling about their ears . There is another abundant source of speech-making , which operates in Congress , and not at all , or to a much less degree , in Parliament , and to which we have just alluded , namely , the unsettled state of some constitutional questions . Our govern // ment , being founded on a written instrument , and being too recent to have been settled by immemorial usage , in regard to every possible question , the constitutionality of measures is cry apt to be drawn into discussion . There is hardly any mattel of legislation , which does not in some form , undergo a constitutional argument . Universal experience in fact shows that no subject is more favorable to protracted argumentation , than the interpretation of written documents ; and a good deal of our debating is of this nature . In Parliament there is very little of this kind of debate . Parliament is omnipotent ; in other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the written documents which can be considered as forming part of the English constitution ( excepting acts if Parliament ) are of considerable antiquity . We do not recollect any great constitutional question , that has been started in England , of late years , unless it be that , which was raised by the late king , Whether the emancipation of the Catholics was consistent with the obligations imposed by the coronation oath a question arising on the construction of a written formula , of comparatively recent origin , and thus confirming our view of the adaptation of a written constitution of recent origin to create discussion . Almost every question presented to Parliament is a simple question of public or private expediency . In America , every important treaty , requiring a law to carry it into effect , every proposition for a system of bankruptcy , for a modification of the federal courts , for internal improvement , for an increase of duties on importations , is capable of being made , nay , is likely ( not to say certain ) to be made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , are for the present rather multiplying than decreasing in number . This fact , however , may be satisfactorily explained . The first generation of our legislators were many of them of the body , who framed the constitution ; others of them bad been of the state conventions , who adopted it ; and all the rest were at least contemporary with its framers . Some things , therefore , were tacitly assumed by them as matters of well understood notoriety , which by an ingenious mind of the present day , arguing solely on the written text of the constitution , may be drawn into question . Thus the legislature of the ancient and respectable commonwealth of Virginia , has recently resolved , by a large majority , that Congress has by the constitution no power to protect manufactures , no such power being // enumerated in the instrument . The second law , however , passed under the federid constitution purports to be , for the support of government , for the discharge of the debts of lie United States , and the encouragement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparative redundancy of speakinb in the Amuricen Con*rress . We Vve already observed , that its members are , politically speaking , much more on a level with each other , than those of lie Li oTh Parliament , which ranges from the prime minister , sabstantilly the sovereign of the country ilown to the merest polne 'd cipher , who comes in for his own borou2i . Whereas iii iie American Congress , notwhhstanding the necessary *iad flon of talent and political standing and consequent influence , lame is no such enormous disparity between the speaking leid rs and the silent mass of a party . But it may b hurler ob* ' *rved , that a larger pro ) orticn of the American ( m*ess than of the British Parlianient , possesses what is en n ( WV eW*ad speaking talent , ' taking that phrase now in its I * *c *e A very large majority of the members of Con*i r ss e xv yers ; generally speaking , selected in con*equenee em I 1-nence in their districts . This implies , the efore a a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a A to witness the administration of justice . The aumlience as ; cmbled in the tialls of Congress , it is true , is different , aid m*gbt be supposed to require a different style of s1 ) eak1rn* But x great majority of the members being lawyers , they *et tecir own kinshion of debate ; for instance , in making a tue use of a voluminous brief wholly unknown in the English Parh* meat in this latter body , the lawyers are a small minority , vine do the majority come with any previous training as piii ) lie speakers . A very limited recourse is had to notes , either by way of recording what drops in debate , in order to reply ; or by way of assistance to the invention . A very large proportion of the speeches in Parliament are made without the use of notes . A very large proportion of the speeches in Congress are made fr ( in ample notes . The talent of spe*king from notes , with a given degree of precision , and to an equal point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than that of speaking in the same way , o itbout notes . In the French chambers of legislation , for wa t of practice in the art of extempore speaking even from notes , tile members are reduced ( we speak of a // period eight or ten years ago-perhaps things have been changed in the interval ) to the necessity of writing their speeches out at length , and reading them deliberately from the tr* bune , and the member who possessed the talent of extempore debate stood almost alone . To this extreme , the l ) ractice of speaking from notes has , we presume , scarce ever been carried in the American Congress . To the different style of speaking in this point , the accommodations of the members of Congress and of Parliament are respectively adapted . The House of Commons is small , about sixty feet hy forty ; and furnished with benches ( disposed like those usually seen in lecture rooms where no notes are expected to be taken ) , on which the members are very closely crowded together . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubic feet ; twice as many as Fanucil Hall in Boston ; and each member is furnished with a luxurious accommodation for sitting and writing . As far as the speaking is concerned , this naturally leads to a habit of minute , discursive , prolix note-taking , an equalization of unimportant and important points ( because a mnember replies not to the great heads of the opposing argument , which have imprinted themselves on his memory , but to every little proposition , of which lie has made a note ) , and finally to an equalization of good . and bad speakers . Other evils are incident to the mode in which the two houses are furnished , which operate perniciously on the character of our legislation , as well as on the aspect of our legislature . It is now , we believe , generally admitted , that the House of Representatives , at least , convenes in a splendid hall , in which it is difficult to see , speak , or hear , and which is consequently destitute of the three first and most important properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the waste of some time and money on ineffectual attempts at a remedy The evil will , we trust , be so practically felt at length , that the necessity will be acknowledged of providing a place of meeting , which if less adapted for the conveniences of writing , reading , and promiscuons lounging , will be better fitted for the purposes of hearing , seeing , speaking , and the despatch of business . Strange as it may at first al ) pear . the evil of excessive speaking is encouraged and increased by the difficulty of being heard in the hail . This difficulty furnishes a salvo to vanity , which might otherwise be wounded . Members may ascribe , and often // justly , the coldness with which they are heard to the difficulty of hearing . Hence the inattention of the audience is no proof of the indifference of the speech ; and by an easy inference of self love , men are able to persuade themselves , that listless spectators and empty benches are no good reasons for abstainilig from debate . The vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated gesture , to weary repetition , and a sort of desperate effort , on the the part of members , to produce by length , that effect which they can not aim at in a shorter discourse , of which every sentence would tell . But although these and some other considerations , of the like general nature , may partly account for the style of speaking which prevails in our Congress , we believe it is in a great degree to be ascribed to the manner in which the speeches are reported . We understand , that in London a large number of reporters are employed in the service of each of the prominent political journals . Thee reporters accordingly relieve each other , in the task of taking notes of the debate . No one is occupied beyond a reasonable time in the house ; each is allowed reasonable time to write out his notes ; and in this way , the successive portions of a long debate are immediately transferred to the press . This is not done in the columns of one paper alone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on an average , equally well in each ; so that in those parts , where one report happens to be erroneous or defective , some one of the others is likely to be frill and correct . In this way , a complete report of a debate is sent out to the public and to the world , the morning aFter the debate takes place . A system of reporting essentially different prevails in our Congress . The E*glish method , it needs not be said , is very expensive , requiring probably the service of five or six able reporters , for each house of Parliament . In fact , we have seen it stated , that as many as one hundred persons , of literary qualifications , are in the regular employment of some of the principal English journals . So large a number could scarcely be required , but for the manner in which the reporting service is attended . It has been found at Washington , that the circulation of a political journal is wholly inadequate to the support of such a host of reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are ihe most that are statedly employed for any journal . It is scarcely possible , under these circumstances , that a report should be prepared for the next morning 's paper , in any // considerable degree complete ; although , on certain rare occasions , and by extraordinary effort , full reports in the National intelligencer have been made to follow the debates , pan passu . While it is only by extraordinary labor , on particular occasions , that this can possibly be done , the necessity of doing it , is , for varions reasons , less urgent here than in England . As we have already stated , the public to be addressed is concentrated in London , and it behoves the statesman and politician to lose no time in coining before that public , with a correct report of his sentiments . If this be not done , not only does he suffer by the imperfect representa:ions which would get abroad ; but in the vast pressure of business , where subject crowds on subject like wave on wave of a rushing tide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , it will secure no attention . In this country , the public to he affected is more or less distant , is scattered in portions remote from each other , and the march of affairs is as yet less urgent . it is of no great moment , in reference to the main objects of the maker or the reader of a speech , whether it appear to day , tomorrow , or a month hence . This state of things , of course , fits itself to the manner , in which , as we have observed , the reporting service is furnished . There is no pressure for a contemporaneous report ; there is time enough ; and the member , anxious to appear in his best dress , to correct , perhaps , his inadvertencies , and take advantage of his after thoughts , undertakes to furnish his own report , or , in other words , writes his speech out for the press . If , like Galba , hisforte lie not so much in writing as in speaking , he may , as Galba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , by a process exceedin* , ly different from that of actually making a handsome speech in his place , it is possible for any member to appear in the report , as the maker of a handsome speech . The consequence may naturally be supposed to be , that some members speak , who would not otherwise do it . If the effect produced at the moment , on the house , were the only effect to be looked forward to , and the speech delivered today were followed up tomorrow by a report far inferior ( as the best un*-revised report must be ) to the speech itself , which is thus Unhonsel 'd , disappointed , unanel 'd , No reckoning made , but sent to its account With all its imperfections on its head , ' // it is probable , that some persons now moved to speak , would refrain . This will appear still more probable , when we consider , that , on the English footing , the business of reporting is exclusively the affair of the proprietor of the newspaper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason , he exercises a discretion in abridging and curtailing . Those speeches , which he thinks the public will wish to read , he gives at length . The speeches of those members whom he wishes to favor or to expose , lie will present in such dimensions as best to answer his object . It is not to be understood , by any means , that all which is said by every member of Parliament , nor even that the substance of what is said by every member , without exception , is reported in the London journals . Still less would such be the case , were the number of speakers as great , and the speeches as long , as in the American Congress . The habitual inattention of the reporters to everything which they are pleased not to consider as important , naturally has the effect of preventing those from taking part in the debate , who have reason to think that justice would not be done them in the report . The case is wholly different in the American Congress . No such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted . Mutually dependent on each other , as speakers and reporters to a certain degree must be , in the present manner of reporting , we presume that the speeches of every member of Congress are given at equal length and with equal fidelity , or may be , at the option of the speaker . This , of course , tends to encourage debate , in the same degree , and for the same reason , that the opposite practice in England tends to discourage it . Every member is sure that he will enjoy as good an opportunity as every other , of having what he may say presented in the most advantageous form to the public . It would be easy to enlarge on these points , but we fear we have already approached the proper limits of such a discussion . It is scarcely necessary to observe , that we by no means intend , in all respects , to give the preference to the English manner of debating and reporting . It is true , the immediate result of the English system may be entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without qualification , that the quantity of speaking , and the amplitude of reportin* , should be reduced among us ; and might look upon the English plan as a good model in this respect . But if our preceding remarks are // just , these good effects , in parliamentary oratory , are closely connected with great political abuses , which would not here be tolerated . On the other hand , some of the evils which bave been pointed out in our style of congressional speaking and reporting , are incident to our free institutions , to the happy equality of personal right and consideration which prevails , and to the salutary dependence of the representative on his constituents . A part of the evil complained of is the effect of other causes , which will be removed by time . When our population becomes much greater than it now is , particularly when the seat of government shall be a populous city , it may safely be calculated that the number of journals containing regular reports will increase ; that competition will arise between them , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more expensive system of reporting . We ought , meantime , to ask , that no part of our remarks may be considered as reflecting on the liberality , intelligence , or skill of those , by whom the public is at present , or for some time past has been , furnished with the reports of the debates in Congress . They are not responsible for the imperfections which arise from the state of the country , or the nature of our political institutions ; and justly enjoy the credit of great ability and impartiality . We are quite sure they would be the first to welcome the means and opportunity of introducing an improved system . After all , in some points , in which the American debating has been censured in comparison with the British , we ought not to overstate the facts . We are inclined , for instance , on the score of prolixity , at least , to believe , that it is not exclusively an American sin . It is stated by Prior , in his Life of Burke , that the speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , were generally three hours long . Some of those of Burke , if spoken as much at length as now found in his works , could not have been delivered in much less than double that time . Nor are the speeches of the present day , in the British Parliament , of smaller dimensions . We have been informed , by a person practically acquainted with the subject , that a speech which occupies one page of a London newspaper in the report , must generally have consumed three hours in the delivery . Such of our readers as have had occasion habitually to examine the English journals will , we think , agree with us , that , on this basis // of calculation , two or three speeches of three hours each are made in every important debate in each house , particularly in the House of Commons . The majority of what are called set speeches in Congress fall within these limits . While we are on this topic , we may observe that we believe some error also prevails as to the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been remarked by a judicious contemporary writer , that the longest of Demosthenes ' speeches may be read in fifty minutes , and the most diffuse of Cicero 's in an hour . We believe , however , that it would he found impossible to read the oration for the Croxvn in three hours , although the testimony and documents , referred to by the orator , are nearly all omitted in the text of the oration . The oration against Midias is longer than that for the Crown , and that De Fals6t Legatione could not be read through in less than five hours . The orations of Cicero appear to have been shorter than those of Demosthenes . Those which are known to have been spoken do not perhaps exceed , on an average , an hour and a half in length . That , however , for Publius Sextus , we think , would consume more than twice that time . The first Verrine , the only one delivered , is comparatively short . The remainder of the series against Verres , none of which according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oration Pro Dorno 8a4 , which is supposed to have been spoken , must have occupied nearly two hours and a half in the delivery . In the year of Rome 702 , the famous law Dc *Jmbitu was promulgated by Pompey . This law required the pleadings in criminal causes to be finished in one day , allowing two hours only to the prosecutor and three to the accused . Cicero ( Brutus , c. 94 ) alludes to the labor , which this rapid succession of causes imposed upon him ; and the author of the Dialogue on the Decline of Eloquence ' dates its corruption from the passage of this law , by which , in his opinion , the freedom of speech was hampered and restrained. * We trust the foregoing observations will not be deemed wholly inappropriate to a short notice of the speeches of Mr Clay , contained in the volume before us , which are entitled to our attention as the production of one of the most eminent of American orators . In the remarks which we make upon // them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is proper in all eases to speak of living personages , and the moderation with which both praise and censure ought to be awarded , by a candid critic , to those individuals who , being engaged as leaders in political affairs , are likely to be excessively commended on the one hand , and as extravagantly undervalued on the other . Mr Clay belongs to the class of men , numerous in all free countries , and in no country so numerous as in ours ,  --  the architects of their own fortunes , men who , without early advantages , rise to eminence by the force of talent and industry . The eloquence of such a man will partake of the merits and of the defects , which are naturally incident to a want of the best opportunities in youth , and to practice commenced and continued , not in the retreats of academic leisure , but at the bar and in the senate . The great orators of Greece and Rome learned their profession of actors , sophists , rhetoricians , arid philosophers ; shut themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might get access to the best teachers ; practised before looking-glasses , and trained their voices by declamation . These arts or means are unknoxvn to the ardent youn* American , who is launched on the stormy ocean of life , with no other inheritance , than that of infancy , ignorance , and indigence . ' As he advances to manhood , he will gradually form his own manner . It will commonly be earnest but inartificial ; its alternate strains of argument and passion will succeed each other rather by accident , than in the order prescribed by systems of rhetoric . There will be fulness of matter , without exhaustion , perhaps without the most skilful disposition of topics ; arid vigor and impressiveness of style , connected with occasional inaccuracies of language . Such , in general , is the character of these speeches . In connexion with some of the remarks , which we have made above , on the manner of reporting which prevails in this country , we ought not to omit to state , that the speeches contained in the volume before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they appeared originally in the National Intelhigencer , from the pen of the reporter . Few orators in any country have ever been more negligent of fame than Mr Clay . Not one half of his speeches , we believe , have ever appeared in any form of report , and those reported have almost without exception been left by him to the unrevised prepara* // tion of the reporter . No person who has had occasion to make such a course a matter of experience , will refuse to admit , that it puts the reputation of the speaker to the greatest test . In casting the eye over the list of the speeches contained in the volume , we find them to comprehend a wide and varied range of topics . They are on the subject of manufactures , on the line of the Perdido , on the charter of the Bank of the United States , on the augmentation of the military force of the country , on the increase of the navy , on the new army hill , on the emancipation of South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mission to South America , on the tariff , on the Spanish treaty , another speech on the mission to South America , on internal improvement , and on American industry . The reader will perceive , in this catalogue , the greatest questions in our internal policy , in our foreign relations , and in our recent history . On perusing Mr Clay 's speeches on any or all of these subjects , and comparing them with those of his contemporaries in Congress , on the same or kindred topics , we presume it will he cheerfully admitted , on all hands , that he ranks second to none in the originality , power , and versatility of his intellect , in those physical qualities by which the ability and reputation of the orator are graduated , and in that general reputation of a parliamentary speaker , which is built on political standing , on intellectual talent , and external gifts , Mr Clay would probably , by a large majority of the American people , he allowed to have stood first on the roll of the eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not sure that such would he the opinion of those who should estimate his character as a parliamentary speaker , solely from the perusal of the speeches contained in the volume before us . In point of literary execution and rhetorical finish , they are not to be considered as models . They should be regarded in justice , as what they purport to be , reports of speeches , for the most part unrevised by the author . Compared with other speeches appearing under the same cir* cumstances , they appear to the first advantage . They ought not to be contrasted with that class of productions of ancient or modern orators , which owe their exquisite finish , their well compacted order , their faultless correctness , and harmonious proportions , not to the inspiration of the forum and the senatehouse , hut to the leisure of the closet , it is recorded by Plutarch both of Pericles and of Demosthenes , that they // ever refused to speak except on premeditation , even though the assembly loudly called on them , by name , to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sheridan , ' that his impromptus , both of wit and passion , passed through several editions in his study , before they were uttered in Parliament , and that he even marked down beforehand the places for Good God , Mr Speaker . ' Of this kind of preparation the orations of Mr Clay exhibit no trace . We are quite sure , that not one of them was written before it was delivered , and we perceive in the greater part of them no marks of subsequent revision . It is a necessary consequence of this , that they contain few single passages likely to be quoted as prominent specimens of oratorical declamation . It deserves remark , that in the orations of the greatest orators of the modern world , those passages which are selected as specimens of style , as extracts for declamation , are evidently such as received either before or after delivery the benefit of the limce labor et mora , and which consequently evince not so much the talent of the speaker as the skill of the writer . We suppose no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lips of Sheridan . The inimitable passages on the attachment of the colonies to the mother country , in Burke 's speech on Conciliation with America , and the terrific description of Hyder Ally 's invasion of the Carnatic , must with equal certainty have been written . Of such passages as Curran 's on universal emancipation , we are informed , that they were written beforehand , in the style of the ancient rhetorical exercises on the topics , to be used when they might happen to be wanted . Of eloquence of this kind ( and some may think it the highest kind , because it gives to some brilliant idea , struck out in a happy moment of inspiration , all the advantage of judgment and meditation , in clothing it in words ) the speeches of Mr Clay contain no specimens . In this respect , however , they resemble the printed speeches of the first orators of the age . The man who should read the collected volumes of the speeches of Mr Fox and Mr Pitt , with a view to the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task in disappointment . The disappointment , we think , would be more complete in the case of Fox than in that of Pitt , although Fox is allowed to have had the finer genius . The excellence of both , as parliamentary speakers , lay in an unsurprised readiness to grapple with any subject , and in the // full flow of thought , with which any subject was taken up and pursued ; added , in Pitt , to the effect of a lofty display of conscious political power , and in Fox to an ever burning zeal and intensity of feeling . Of this school is the parliamentary eloquence of Mr Clay . it is that of the debater , of the politician , the prominent leader of a powerful party , or the hearty chanpion of some great and favorite cause . Before and during the war of 1812 , Mr Clay was among the most conspicuous of the acknowledged leaders in Congress . On his first entrance into the House of Representatives , he was elected to the chair of that body , which , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the government . Several of the speeches in the volume before us date from that period , and may be considered as among those , which gave the tone to the legislation of the day . After the close of the war by the treaty of Ghent , in the negotiation of which he bore an honorable part , Mr Clay took up with great ardor the cause of South American independence . This was a cause wholly unconnected with the questions which had formerly divided the country ; it was in itself , in its political principles , and in its considerations of expediency , a matter of speculation . To Mr Clay belongs the credit of having first called the attention of Congress and the people to ths great subject ; and of having contributed an earlier and a greater share , than any other person , to the weight of argument and the power of persuasion , by which the public sentiment on the subject was eventually fixed . In the untried circumstances of the case , the administration of Mr Monroe held itself , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures of inquiry and observation . This gave to the efforts of iXir Clay , to obtain an immediate recognition of the independence of the new republics , the form of an opposition to the administration of Mr Monroe . His speeches on this subject , not all of which have been reported , are among the most powerful and brilliant productions of his mind , and passages of them were read with enthusiasm at the head of the South American armies . Another class of subjects , with respect to which Mr Clay has borne a part not less conspicuous , is that of internal improvement and domestic manufactures . Domestic manufactures form the subject of the first and of the last of his speeches in Congress , contained in this volume ; and the latter speech wears the appearance of more careful prepara // tion than any other which the book contains . The first of these is of the class of great constitutional questions ; and in the different speeches of Mr Clay on the subject , the entire strength of the argument in favor of the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found to be comprised . Neither do the limits of our article admit , nor does the nature of the work under review require of us , an analysis of the several speeches which compose the volume , with extracts by way of specimen . Although it may happen , that the whole of some one speech may afford of itself a satisfactory specimen of an orator 's mind and manner , such a specimen can scarcely be found in an insulated fragment , taken out of the context . Our foregoing remarks will sufficiently communicate our judgment of the quality of Mr Clay 's eloquence , with which the student of American history , the politician , and the patriot will make himself acquainted by the perusal of the volume . An interesting biographical notice of Mr Clay is prefixed to this collection of his speeches . It will enable the reader to trace his rapid ascent from poverty and obscurity , to elevated standing , wide spread fame , and some of the most honorable and arduous offices in the community . Although for this success in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind and character , which are the basis of advancement under mstitutions like ours , yet the immediate source of his popularity has been his eminence as a public speaker . His example accordingly is another illustration of the tendency of our free system to encourage the cultivation of the liberal arts , among the first of which the art of public speaking has in all ages been allowed to rank , and has sometimes even been placed at the head of the list . And most assuredly not even in ancient Rome , were stronger motives proposed to encourage the effort to excel in this art . The representative system is peculiarly adapted to bring the talent of public speaking into exercise , at every stage of its operation . The primary inofficial meetings of the citizens , in the municipal assemblies ( those miniature republics , whose organization lies at the basis of our well ordered commonwealths ) , our state legislatures , and lastly the councils of the nation , are so many tribunals where the people , as sovereign , seem to sit in audience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public service . In this view of the importance of public speaking in // our political and social system , it is matter of astonishment , that it has not yet found its place , its proper place , in our establishments for education . We are aware , that in some parts of the country , more attention has been paid to it than in others ; and recently in our own neighborhood more than formerly . But it seems plain , that the space assigned to discipline in the art of speaking , in the most improved plans of education known in this country , is far beneath its importance . The objects to be promoted , and the duties to be performed by the public speaker , in this country , are as important as they were in ancient Rome . Let us see what pains were thought due by a Roman statesman and orator to the acquisition of the art . The following we translate from Cicero 's treatise De Claris Oratoril$us. * The other chief orators of the day , ' says Cicero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me in their public discourses . Curio was then tribune of the people , but never spoke , having once been deserted by his audience in a mass . Quintus Metellus Celer , though not an orator , was not wholly unable to speak ; Varius , Carbo , and Pomponius were eloquent , and they were continually upon the rostrum . Caius Julius , also , the curule a*dile , almost daily made a set speech . My passion for listening received its first disappointment when Cotta was banished ; but in diligent attendance on the other orators , I not only devoted a part of each day to reading , writing , and discussing ; but extended my studies beyond the exercises of oratory , to philosophy and the law . In the following year , Varius was banished under his own law . In the study of the civil law I employed myself under Sca*vola , who , although he did not formally receive pupils , was willing to admit those who desired it , to be present while he gave legal opinions to his clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I formed an intimate acquaintance with the whole art of public speaking , in listening to the daily harangues of the tribune Sulpicius . At the same time , Philo , the head of the academy , having , with the rest of the aristocracy of Athens fled to Rome in the Mithridatic war , I gave myself wholly up to him and the study of philosophy , not merely from the delight I felt in the variety and magnitude of the subject , but because the career of judicial eloquence seemed for ever shut up . Sulpicius had fallen that year , and in the next , three other orators were most cruelly slain ; Catulus , Antony , and Julius . The same year , I employed myself under the direction of Mob the Rhodian , a consummate pleader and teacher . I mention these things , Brutus , although somewhat aside from our purpose , that // you might , as you desired , become acquainted with my course , and perceive the manner in which I followed in the steps of 1-lortensius . For three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orators were deceased , retired , or banished ; even Crassus and The two Lentuli were absent . ilortensius them took the lead as counsel ; Antistius daily rose in reputation ; Piso spoke often , Pomponius less frequently , Carbo rarely , Philippus once or twice . All this time , I was occupied day and night , in every kind of study . I studied with the stoic Diodotus , who , after having long lived with me , lately died at my house . By him I was trained , among other things , in logic , itself a kind of close and compendious eloquence , without which even you , Brutus , have admitted , that the true eloquence , which is but expanded logic , can not be acquired . With this teacher , in his numerous and various branches , I was so assiduous , that I did not miss a day in oratorical exercises . I had also a declamatory discussion ( to use the present phrase ) with Piso often , and with Quintus Pompey or some one else every day . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both because the Greek language , in itself more adapted to ornament , tended to form the V bit of an elegant Latin manner , and because , unless I used the Greek language , I could neither receive instri.iction nor correction from eminent Greek teachers . Meantime followed the tumults for the restoration of the republic ; the cruel deaths of the three orators Sci*vola , Carbo , and Antistius ; the return of Cotta , Curio , Crassus , the Lentuli , and Porapey ; the establishment of the laws and the tribunals ; in a word , the restoration of the Commonwealth . Of the orators , however , Pomponius , Censorinus , and Murena , peri'hed . I then , for the first time , undertook the pleading both of public and private causes ; not , as is commonly done , learning my profession in the pructice of it , but , as far as I had been able to effect it , entering the forum with my profession learned . At the same time , I studied under Mob , who had come to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodians . My first public cause , therefore , the ( lefenee of Sextus Roscius , was so commended , that there was none which I was not thought competent to un ( lertake . Many causes were now put into my bands , which I brought into court , not merely dili0ently , but laboriously prepared . And now , since you seem to wish to learn my history thoroughly , I will mention some things , which might otherwise seem unimportant . At this period , I labored under extreme emaciation and weakness of body ; my neck was long and slender , and my whole frame and constitution such as are usually thought to render the violent exercise of the lungs fatal . This circumstance was matter of the greater anxiety to my friends , because I was in the habit of speaking everything on a high key , without variety , with the // utmost power of voice and exertion of my body . When , therefore7 my friends and j ) hysicians advised me to abandon pleading , I determined to encounter any danger , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire as an orator . Having , however , come to the conclusion , that by reducing and managing the voice , and changing my mode of speaking , I could escape the impending danger , I determined , for the sake of altering my manner , to visit Asia . Accordingly , after having been two years in the practice of my profession , and acquired a standing in the forum , I left Rome* When I came to Athens , I devoted myself six months , under Antiochus , a most noble and prudent sage of the old academy , to the study of philosophy , a study which I had early cultivated , had never lost sight of , and now renewed under this admirable teacher . At the same time , however , I practised speaking diligently , under Demetrius the Syrian , an experienced and respectable teacher of the art . I afterwards made the tour of Asia , with orators of the first celebrity , under whom , with their full assent , I regularly exercised myself in speaking . The chief of these was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asiatic orator of his time , and , if to be free from everything offensive or impertinent be the test of Atticism , not unworthy to be reckoned among Attic orators . I was , also constantly with Dionysius of Magnesia , iEschylus of Cnidus , and Xenocles of Adramyttium ; the principal rhetoricians at that time in Asia . Not satisfied with these , I repaired to Rhodes , and applied myself to Mob , who had instructed me at Rome , who was not only a pleader himself in real causes , and an eminent writer , but most discreet in remarking and correcting faults as an instructer. lie exerted himself , as far as possible , to reduce my manner , redundant as it was , and overflowing with juvenile license and excess ; and sought to bring it within proper limits . After spending two years in this way , I returned , not merely trained , but altered . The extreme effort of my voice in speaking was reduced , my style had become temperate , my lungs strong , and my general health tolerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was fitting himself , not for the chair of oratory in a place of education , but for the storm and bustle of active life , at the most convulsed period of the Roman Commonwealth . Not unlikely it was the course pursued by the majority of the young men at that time , who were destined to the career of law and politics . Iu many essential features , our political institutions resemble the Roman ; at least so far as the importance of the province of the public speaker is concerned . It deserves consideration , whether the method of liberal education , so called , which prevails among us , rather by tradition than designed adoption* // be as well calculated as could be wished , to fit our young men for the duties of life ; whether the greatest portion of their time is devoted to the attainments practically most important ; and , particularly , whether the art of communication , in its two great branches of writing and speaking , and especially the latter , ought not to be raised from its comparative neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .
