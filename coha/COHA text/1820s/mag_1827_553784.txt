With Notes to illustrate the Civil and Eccieniastical Concerns , the Geography , Settlement , and Institutions of the Country , and the Lives and . Manners of the principal Planters . By JAMEs SAVAGE . 2 vols. 8vo . Boston . Phelps &amp; Farnham . TILL within a few years , the history of our own country was the last object which engaged the attention of American scholars . The study of that history formed no part of our system of education either at school or at college , and the voluntary perusal of it at a subsequent period of life , was considered the business of a mere antiquary rather than of a well informed American ciiizen. // This neglect of so important a subject certainly redounded little to our credit , and has been condemned by many as a sure and strong indication of a want of patriotism . We ascribe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of those works in which our own history is written . As these are much more remarkable for accuracy and impartiality , than for elegance of style and philosophical research , the general and undiscriminating neglect , with which they have been treated , though far from justifiable , is , on the whole , not surprising . These remarks , which are not to be understood without qualification or exception , may be applied particularly to our colonial history . The 19th of April 1775 seemed to be often considered as the birthday of our nation , not only in many , but in all respects , and our condition before that period was regarded as a state of preexistence . It is only of late , that we have learned to trace our present free and happy condition , to its remote as well as its proximate causes , to acknowledge our obligations not only to the statesmen and soldiers , who conducted the war of independence , but to those sages from whom we derived the principles , institutions , and habits , which render independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who laid the foundation of our widely extended nation , there are none who have been alike censured and applauded with so little discrimination , as the pilgrim fathers of New England . Their characters have been sometimes held up as models of almost supernatural excellence , but they have more generally been depicted in far different colors ; and there were many among us who seemed to be ignorant of almost every event which occurred in Massachusetts during the seventeenth century , except the destruction of the aborigines , the persecution of the Quakers , and the execution of the witches . Slight and vague impressions are now happily giving way to correct and circumstantial knowledge , and the early history of this state is becoming an object of great and constantly increasing interest . A complete and elegant history of Massachusetts is yet a desideratum , but the want of such a work has been supplied in no inconsiderable degree , by the ability and eloquence with which the principles and institutions of the pilgrims have been portrayed in less voluminons productions . Those , however , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must study their works ; and we need hardly state the fact , that no men ever left behind them more accurate and impartial accounts of their own conduct . // All their actions , even those which are now most condemned and regretted , are narrated with equal unreserve and minuteness ; and however we may occasionally lament their preju-. dice or passion , every line of their writings bears indisputable testimony to their sincerity and frankness . Among all the works of that period , there is none of a more extraordinary or interesting description than the book before us . An exact journal of the first governor of Massachusetts Bay , embracing the history of the country between the years 1630 and 1649 , is manifestly a document so singularly desirable , that , in other countries , and under other circumstances , its authenticity would be subjected to no slight suspicion . In this age of literary scepticism , indeed , we know not whether it will even now be universally admitted , and should not be surprised at an elaborate argument from some humble disciple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homer , showing that the hook before us is the production not of one , but of a hundred hands , that its supposed author never existed , and that John Winthrop was not the name of an individual , but a general title of all the governors of Massachusetts during the seventeenth century . As no such question has yet been started , we may be permitted to express our gratification , at seeing the whole of this work presented to the public for the first time in a complete form , and our obligations , shared by the whole community , to its present able and learned editor . The first volume was published at Hartford , in 1790 , from the manuscripts in possession of Governor Winthrop 's descendants . The manner in which the remaining portion of the work was brought to light , as well as the reasons which led to a revised copy of the whole , will appear in the following extract from Mr Savage 's Preface . Early in the spring of 1816 was discovered , in the tower of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History of New England , in the original MS. of the author , John Winthrop , first governor of the Massachusetts Bay . When the precious Izook was presented to the Massachusetts historical Society , at their next meeting , 25 April , the difficulty of transcribing it for the press seemed to appal several of the most competent members , whose engagement in more important duties afforded also a sufficient excuse for leaving such labor to be undertaken by any one , at any time , who could devote to it many weeks of leisure . The task appeared inviting to me . On the same evening the MS. was taken , and the study of its chirography was begun , the next day , // by the aid of one of the former MSS. collated with the printed volume , usually called Winthrop 's Journal . Of all the three MSS. and of the published Journal , a sufficient account may be seen in 2 list . Coil . IV . 200 . Before the collation of the former MS. with the volume printed in 1790 had proceeded through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a new edition of the earlier part of the History very desirable ; and when a transcript of the new found volume was completed , my resolution was fixed , that it should not be printed without a perfect revision of the Journal . Notes , explanatory , in some instances , of the text , illustrating . in some degree , the biography of many persons named in it , and referring to better accounts of others than I could furnish , were thought necessary . Several hundred notes were prepared , and a careful collation of the whole printed volume , for the second time , with the original volumes of MS. was finished on 2 June , J819 . Being then required to visit a foreign country , all my preparations were suspended until I returned . Care , hcwever , was taken to leave the corrected copy of the printed volume , with my copy of the third part , to be kept safely . Again called abroad in 1822 , I so carefully disposed of my copy of the third volume , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gratification of making a new one , begun 8 December , 1823 , and finished 30 March , 1824 . This circumstance admonished me of the propriety of adopting early measures for guarding against farther accidents of that kind . Application was made , at the next session of the General Court of this commonwealth , by the Historical Society , for encouragement of the publication . In consequence of the liberal aid of the Legislature , the volume comes thus early before the public . ' Mr Savage afterwards informs us , that the original manuscript will remain in the library of the Historical Society for his correction by any one , who doubts of the faithfulness of a single passage . Few we believe will undertake the task , and he has enabled us to form some judgment of his amendments , at a much less expense of labor . Whenever he has introduced a new reading , he has accompanied it with a note of reference to the corresponding word or sentence in the first edition , which is inserted at the bottom of the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savage 's favor . He has given meaning to many passages , which before bade defiance to explanation , has removed many irreconcilable contradictions , and often substituted plain sense for whimsical absurdity . Who will suppose for // example , that Governor Winthrop could say ( p. 62 ) in speaking of a night which he was obliged to pass in the woods , in consequence of losing his way , that it was through God 's mercy a weary night ' instead of a warm night ' or ( p. 80 ) that one Noddle , an honest man of Salem , was drowned while running wood in a canoe , ' instead of carrying wood , ' or lastly ( p. 323 ) that all breeches were made up , and the church saved from ruin beyond all expectation , ' instead of breaches . ' In bestowing due praise on the present edition , we would not be understood to speak lightly of the industry or accuracy of the former editor . Independently of the important assistance , which Mr Savage states himself in the above extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a glance at the fcc srmi/c at the end of the present work , or at a few of the earliest pages of the Town Records of Boston , to satisfy us of the extreme difficulty of reading the handwritin* of Governor Winthrop and his contemporaries . It is very different from the ancient Court Hand , ' so much extolled by Blackstone , and bears a much nearer resemblance to the writing of scholars of the present day . To those who inspect it for the first time , it will seem less surprising that numerous errors should have been co ? nmitted by the first editor , or that he should have given up many passages in despair , than that he should have decyphered so clearly the great body of the work . We are glad to find that Mr Savage has not contented himself with improving on the verbal labors of hi.s predecessor . He has added an Appendix , consisting of a number of authentic letters , and constituting , in our opinion , the most interesting portion of Governor Winthrop 's writings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and able notes . The good sense and impartiality of his comments form a singular contrast to the strong and undiscriminatinn attachment , generally shown by editors towards every j ) art of those productions , which they have employed their time and talents in illustrating . We would more particularly recommend to the attention of our readers , his arguments against the genuineness of the celebrated Wheelwribht deed-of 1629 . The whole train of reasoning is a specimen of acute research and powerful logic , but is too long to be inserted in this place . Mr Savage 's positions have since derived ample confirmation from several manuscript documents which came into his possession a few days before the publication of his second volume , and in our opinion he has completely put the question at rest . // This work seems to be , in the strict sense of the word , a regular journal begun by Governor Winthrop on board the Arbella ' at Cowes , March 29 , 1630 , and ending in the year 1649 . It appears from some passages in it , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication r . Though it certainly deserves the reputation which it has so long and generally enjoyed , of being on the whole , a highly interesting work , it contains much that can afford little entertainment to the more general reader , and some passages which the author would probably have omitted had he lived at the present day . Many will be surprised at finding such frequent and copious details of ordinary casualties and accidents , which a historian of this age would have passed over in silence . This misplaced minuteness may be ascribed in no inconsiderable degree , to the circumstances under which Governor Winthrop wrote , and the vast difference in many respects between the state of society at that period , and in our own times . At the present day , every breakfast table is loaded with fresh newspapers , and every morning brings its new accounts of accidents or casualties , or its tales of wonder or horror , to efihee those of yesterday from our memory . It is only occurrences of real and great importance , that can arrest the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing moment . In the days of Governor Winthrop , the inhabitants of Boston were a small and insulated peol ) le , and newspapers were a late invention even in England . The death of a single individual was felt , as that of a member of a social circle , and the loss of a few valuable aninials was viexved , and not without reason , with the same emotions with which we now look on our most calamitous tempests or conflagrations . The peculiar religious tenets of our forefathers combined with their desolate situation , in giving an extraordinary and solemn interest to every accident which befell any of their associates . They appear to have carried the doctrine of temporal rewards and l ) unisliments further than any religious sect of our own days , to have considered themselves as living not only under the constant , but almost under the miraculous care of Provideuce , and to have noted down and interpreted every casualty as a direct manifestation of divine displeasure . It may be more difficult to defend the intolerance which is frequently displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the degree in which the author , notwithstanding his naturally mild and benevolent ( disposition , partook of the reigning spirit of his onipanlon ' . // The religious intolerance of our Puritan forefathers is a fault , which it would be worse than useless to deny , and we allow that their constant and manifest consciousness of their own rectitude , furnishes them with only a partial justification . Doubtless there was much of pride and of anger secretly intermingled in their zeal for the prevalence of unmingled truth , and the establishment of an immaculate church . We think , however , that in this respect , as in many others , they have been censured with much too little allowance for their peculiar condition and pursuits . It is well known , that their object was to plant a church and not an empire . They were not merely a religious , hut a theological community ; all their thoughts except so far as they were necessarily directed to their own subsistence and security , were absorbed by those duties of which God is not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , that disputes on subjects which engrossed the whole intellect and feelings of the community , should be carried on with intense earnestness , and our forefathers were certainly not singular in transgressing the slight boundary , which separates earnestness from passion . In our own days we have seen how far passion and prejudice can be carried , in politics , in times of high excitement , when the vital interests of the nation are considered as depending on the success of this or that party ; and what politics were twenty years ago , theology was in 1640 . The disputes of parties in our own days generally produce no other injury , than the interruption of social intercourse , and the exchange of unkind looks and hard words . Person and property are protected by written constitutions and laws , which , independently of their direct operation , have , by a necessary reaction , strengthened , fortified , and extended in the public mind , those principles of justice and humanity which gave them birth . Above all , the right of trial by jury furnishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be rendered insecure , till the deepest foundations of society are broken up . Two hundred years ago , the rights of citizens were far less extensive than now , and defined with far less precision . Our colonial fathers early claimed and-exercised the power of internal legislation , and though they were forbidden to make any law contrary to the law of England , yet their proceedings were for a long time unchecked and unnoticed by the mother country . They brought with them much of that undue regard to birth and rank , which is now happily effaced by our free and equal systems of government ; their pe* // culiar religious feelings and opinions led them to pay to the clergy a degree of deference , of which some faint traces yet linger in the interior of New England ; and during many years the government was in fact an aristocracy as despotic as that of Venice . It is no wonder that power so unlimited should have been sometimes abused . The portion of these volumes which will he read with the most unmingled sentiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highminded Miantunnomoh , Sachem of the Naragansetts . We certainly think , that the conduct of the Pilgrims towards their savage brethren , though occasionally blemished with crnelty , has been too strongly and indiscriminately censured . The transactions which took place between them during the period embraced in these volumes , are marked on both sides , generally speaking , with justice and kindness . That the settlement of this country , by a foreign and civilized nation , must eventually lead to the dispersion and destruction of the aborigines , was a truth which seems to have been suspected by Sassacus , the Pequod Sachem , forty years before the war of Philip . Happily for us , the savage tribes of New England were , for a long time , too simple and shortsighted in their policy to he aware of this fact in its full force , and too little united among themselves to exert their superior power in overwhelming the colonies in their infancy . It was alike unavoidable , however , that wars should at length arise hetween the English and Indians , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the history of those times , with an unbiassed mind , and he will he convinced that our fathers had no choice between abandoning this country to the savage hunters , who originally roamed over it , and gaining an entire and exclusive possession of it by the sword . He must he a stanch supporter of abstract theories , who can maintain that they should have adopted the former alternative . But however misplaced we may consider the romantic compassion , which has been sometimes bestowed on Sassacus and Philip , the determined and implacahle enemies of the English race and name , we know not what extenuation can he found for the execution of Miantunnomoh . That chieftain had been the early friend of the English , had repeatedly visited the governor at Boston , and when summoned there to answer for his life , on some charges of treachery brought against him from Connecticut , obeyed the mandate and pleaded his cause before the Gen // eral Court , observing to his judges that though some had dissuaded him , assuring him that the English would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , he being innocent of any ill intention against the English , he knew them to be so just that they would do him no wrong . ' He offered to meet his great adversary , the sachem Onkus , at Boston , and prove to his face his treachery against the English . He urged much , that those might be punished who had raised this slander , and put it to our consideration what damage it had been to him , in that he was forced to keep his men at home , and not suffer them to go hunting till he had given the English satisfaction . ' These reasonable requests were disregarded , but after passing two days at Boston , he established his innocencr* to the satisfaction of his judges , and was dismissed in peace . The following year proved with how much foundation he had calculated on the justice and liberality of his English allies , in July , 1643 , his relative , Sequasson , was attacked by Onkus . Miantunnomoh complained to the English , and requested permission to avenge his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest and most unequivocal language . Miantunnomoh accordingly attacked Onkus with a superior force , but was defeated , and afterwards delivered up to his rival , by two of his officers . When brought before Onkus he preserved total silence . Onkus demanded the reason . Had you taken me , ' said he I would have besought you for my life . ' This the captive chieftain disdained to do . Gorton , of Rhode Island , and his associates then interfered in behalf of Miantunnomoh , their early friend and protector , and demanded his liberation . Onkus carried his captive to Hartford to take the advice of the magistrates there , and Miantunnomoh was delivered , at his own request , into their hands . What follows can not be better related than in the words of Mr Savage . It can not be doubted , I presume , that the captive , having in vain pressed the conqueror to put him to death , expected friendship from the English , to which his former services and cent deference gave him no slight claim . The Narragansetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are represented as a reward for delivering his prisoner to the English , hy the other . as a ransom for the life of their sovereign . See governor I-Iayne 's fetter to Winthrop , 3 lust . Coil . I. 229 . Perhaps the conqueror was persuaded to surrender his prey at Hartford through the influence of Gorton and his associates , for it was at first repo#ted. // that " they sent their letters in the name of the governor of Massachusetts ; " but as this clause was afterwards struck out by Winthrop , it was probably a false report . Such a deception , for a benevolent purpose , might not be a heavy aggravation of the errors of ignorance , under which those heretics sank . Whatever influence , however , moved Onkus , it seems hardly possible , that he could have anticipated the joyful result of the policy of his teachers in civilization , the deliberation of pious statesmen , by which his captive was restored to his hands , with an injunction to put him to death . A judicial investigation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as it was , we may look at the grounds of judgment . Trumbull , I. 130 , makes part of his offence " without consulting the English according to agreement . " Our author 's narrative ought to have silenced such a pretence . Little importance need be attached to another allegation , " that he had promis*d us in the open court to send to Onkus the Pequod , who had shot him in the arm , yet in his way homeward he killed him ; " nor indeed to any other part of the doubtful story about the traitorous slave of the i*ioheagan . By the acts of the cornmissioners , JJaz . II . 8 , we learn , that it was fully proved , from the Pequod 's own mouth , that he was guilty , and therefore Miantunnomob , if innocent , as our people , before his misfortunes , thought him , might believe his royal promise satisfactorily performed *y putting to death the assassin , instead of returning him to his master . Perhaps his promise to the English , on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between contracting parties of the same language . If Onkus were , however , free from all blame , and the Narragansett chargeable with treachery , and every other vice of kings , our rulers had no cognizance of the cause , and their advice to the successful warrior was cruel ; but their conduct to Miantunnomob , who had so few years before been their ally against the Pequods , can hardly be regarded as less than a betraying of innocent blood . In the congress of the united ccAonies , *xhose doings in this behalf are briefly , but fairly , told by our author , its president , and may be seen at large in Haz . II . 11-13 , it was too hastily , I think , resolved , " that it would not be safe to set him at liberty ; " and as death was the alternative , in their want of counsel and confidence to come to such a shocking resuk , against an unarmed prisoner , who was in amity with them , advice was asked , yet of only five among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of Agag followed of course . ' With profound regret I am compelled to express a suspicion , that means of sufficient influence would easily have been found // for the security of themselves , the pacifying of Onkus , and the preservation of Miantunnomoli , had he not encouraged the sale of Shaomet and Patuxet to Gorton and his heterodox associates . This idea had been unwillingly entertained years before I knew the comment of Governor Stephen Hopkins , 2 list . Coil . LX. 202 , with which I close this unhappy subject . " The savage soul of Uncas doubted , whether he ought to take away the life of a great king , who had fallen into his hands by misfortune ; and to resolve this doubt , he applied to the Christian commissioners of the four united colonies , who met at Hartford , * in September , 1644 . They were less scrupulous , and ordered Uncas to carry Myantonomo out of their jurisdiction , and slay him ; but kindly added , that he should not be tortured ; they sent some persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the captive king murdered in cold blood . This was the end of Myantonomo , the most potent Indian prince the people of New England had ever any concern with ; and this'was the reward he received for assisting them seven years before , in their wars with the Pequots . Surely a Rhode Island man may be permitted to mourn his unhappy fate , and drop a tear on the ashes of Myantonomo , who , with his uncle Conanicus , were the best friends and greatest benefactors the colony ever had . They kindly received , fed , and protected the first settlers of it , when they were in distress , and were strangers and exiles , and all mankind else were their enemies ; and by this kindness to them , drew upon themselves the resentment of the neighboring colonies , and hastened the untiinely end of the young king . " * Vol. ii . pp. 132-134 , note . Every one will regret that so few accounts now exist of the domestic customs and modes of living of our ancestors ; a fact which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place for his contemporaries , and therefore passes over such topics , as too familiar to be noticed . There was no Espriella among our forefathers , to admit us into their dwellings , and seat us at their firesides , and give us a complete view of the routine of their daily occupations and recreations . On these subjects we must be contented with scanty and incidental hints , a few of which may be gleaned from the work before us . The houses of the first settlers of Boston were generally , as might he expected from the circumstances of the country , extremely simple and unadorned . Wooden chimneys * It should be Boston , 1643 , Trumbull , 1 . 133 , hastily says , the commissioners for Plymouth are not on record this year . Their i*ames are signed to the acts . ' // were common for many years , and a wainscot of clapboards in the house of the deputy governor was considered a highly censurable piece of extravagance . The house of the ladye Moodyc ' at Salem , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our smallest dwellings , being nine feet high , with a chimney in the centre . The furniture of the early colonists was of a rather different quality . Much of it was brought from England and was of considerable value , forming a strong contrast in this respect to the humble sheds in which it was often deposited . In an inventory of the effects of Mrs Martha Coytemore , Governor Winthrop 's fourth wife , dated in 1647 , we find silk curtains , brass andirons , cheny plates and saucers , and Turkey carpets . Some estimate may be formed of the ordinary expenses of living from a remark in Governor Winthrop 's account , dated 1634 . I was first chosen Governor , ' he observes , without my seeking or expectation , there being divers other gentlemen , who for their abilities every way were far more fit . Being chosen , I furnished myself with servants , and provisions accordingly , in a far greater proportion than I would have done , had I come as a private man or as an assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a half , although I earnestly desired at every election to have been freed . In this time I have spent above ? 500 per annum , of which 200 per annum would have maintained my family in a private condition . ' There seems to have been no want of luxuries for the table . The country furnished fish and game in abundance , and though , says the Governor , in a letter dated , November the twentyninth , 1630 , we have not beef and mutton , yet , God be praised , we want them not , our Indian corn answers for all , ' an opinion in which , notwithstanding our regard for that highly useful vegetable , we find it difficult to follow him . Groceries were soon brought over in abundance from England , though it will be r*collected that our two most valued articles of that description , tea and coffee , were not then used in Europe . We are told that at a military muster of twelve hundred men in 1641 , there was not a man drunk , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that in 1630 the Governor began to discourage the practice of drinking toasts at table . Had he succeeded in abolishing it , what racking of invention and rummaging of memory for // extemporaneous sentiments might have been spared the present generation . The attempts of our ancestors to restrain luxury in dress were altogether unavailing , it is stated , September the eighteenth , 1634 , that many laws were made against tobacco , and immodest fashions , and costly apparel ; but though such laws were frequently made , we do not recollect that Governor Winthrop mentions any instance in which they were enforced . Our ancestors endeavored to regulate the spirit of gain , as well as of expense , and with the same eventual success . The prices of labor and of commodities were fixed repeatedly by positive laws , but experience soon proved the utter futility of the project , though not until these laws had been executed in a few instances , especially in the case of Captain Robert Keaine , who was compelled to pay eighty pounds for taking a profit of sixpence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances two for one . The state of morals among our forefathers , and the degeneracy of succeeding generations , have been subjects respectively of eulogy and lamentation from their day to ours ; and we recollect a sermon of Mr Stoughton , published about the middle of the seventeenth century , in which he exclaims with great vehemence , our wine is mixed with water . ' A close examination of this Journal may satisfy a candid reader , that such remarks are dictated in some degree by that veneration for antiquity , and discontent with the world around us , which are found in all countries and generations . The first colonists of Massachusetts were unquestionably , on the whole , a highly respectable community . Many of them , like the author of this work , were men partaking , like all human beings , of the errors and defects of the age in which they lived , and the society which surrounded them , but men of whom any country would be justly proud . They were among the best specimens of what was then and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its well educated commoners ; men superior perhaps to any of their successors in deep and extensive learning , and second to none for fervent piety , for stern integrity , and disinterested patriotism . But that all the early settlers of New England were of this description , is a supposi .. tion , which , though it sometimes seems to have been taken for granted , is manifestly absurd . There were several of the same stamp with those who find a place in every new country , needy and desperate adventurers , who hoped to find in a remote settlement , the subsistence which they were unwilling to procure by // Jan . Winthrop 's History of New England . honest exertion in their native land . Crimes , even of the most shocking description , sometimes occurred , and many parts of this volume bear a close resemblance to the records of our criminal tribunals at the present day . Besides , there was , even in the more respectable classes of society , a deficiency in refinement and delicacy of manners , which proves , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century . What modern audience would endure disclosures like those made by the Rev. Mr Cotton , at a public lecture , in Boston ? If , however , we can claim any superiority , as an enlightened and refined community , over our forefathers , let us never forget how much of this preeminence we owe to their wisdom and liberality . The erection of the venerable Universities of Harvard and Yale ; the adoption to a great degree of those statutes of de5cent and distribution , beautifully denominated by Judge Story , the only true and just Agrarian laws , ' which have utterly obliterated the few vestiges of aristocracy which had found a place in our land ; the provisions for the support of religion , which combine so happily the interest of the public with the liberty of the individual ; and , above all , the introduction of free schools ; these great sources of our freedom , our equality , our intellectual and moral power , were all established , by the founders of New England , during the first century of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anxious to exclude every ray of intellectual light which might disclose the defects of their own political and religious systems ; no crafty tyrants , laboring to establish the power of the few by perpetuating the ignorance of the many ; no wild fanatics , who thought that divine truth could he only contaminated by the admixture of human learning . They were enthusiasts , indeed , but it was a dignified and generous enthusiasm , an enthusiasm which sought noble ends by noble means ; it was their great object to render their posterity a religious , by rendering them an enlightened people . We may smile at the whimsical peculiarities of the Pilgrims , or lament their graver faults , but we shall show little of the boasted liberab ity of the present day , if we can read their annals with no other emotions than these ; if we fail to render due homage to their unwavering singleness of purpose , their unconquerable perseverance , their unquenchable zeal for the dissemination of pure truth , and the prosperity of their adopted country . We close this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to its venerable author , and its able // and learned editor ; but the character of Governor Winthrop is too well known to need any further commemoration , and we trust that the public will duly appreciate the patriotic zeal , which could lead a gentleman , of Mr Savage 's abilities and occupations , to undertake a task requiring such patient and minute industry . We hope that his success , in the present instance , will have its due effect in inducing him to continue his important and interesting researches . The field , which he has chosen for his peculiar labors , is a true New England soil , unpromising in its aspect to a careless observer , but yielding a rich reward to the skilful and laborious cultivator.
