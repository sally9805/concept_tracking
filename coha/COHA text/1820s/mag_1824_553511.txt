txt ART . VII. - History of a Voyage to the China Sea . By JOHN WHITE , Lieutenant in the United States Navy . Boston . Wells &amp; Lilly . 1823. pp. 372 . THIs may safely be pronounced the most complete and authentic account which has been published , at least in our language , of the kingdom of Cochin China . That country , sometimes called Onam , was first discovered by Ptolemy , by whom it is barely noticed under the name of Sinme , and is placed by D'Anville at the eastern extremity of the ancient habitable world . It is a narrow strip of land , resembling a crescent in its form , and projecting into the China Sea , immediately south of China Proper . According to our author , it extends in its present limits from latitude S deg. 40 m. to 17 deg. north , and from Cape Avarella in longitude 109 deg. 24 m. east , one hundred and fifty miles westward . Its average breadth , however , is about one hundred miles . It is bounded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southwest by the Gulf of Siam , and on the west by the Birman Empire . Little or nothing was known of this country till the middle of the last century , when it was visited by M. be : Poivre in a diplomatic character , who described it *m work which we Mve m*ot been able to procure* but which // has been liberally quoted by subsequent geographers . This is said to be a lively and interesting narrative , but whether it be entitled to the praise of strict accuracy , may be judged from the following remarks on the character of the Cochia Chinese , extracted from it by the editors of the Encyclopedia Britannica . M. Le Poivre , ' say they , represents the Cochin Chinese as gentle , frugal , hospitable , and industrious . There is not a beggar in the country , and robbery and murder are absolutely unknown . A stranger may wander through the kingdom from one end to the other , the capital excepted , without meeting the slightest insult . He will be received everywhere with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest benevolence . A Cochin Chinese traveller , who has not money to defray his expenses at an inn , enters the first house of the town or village he arrives at , and waiting the hour of dinner , takes part with the family , and goes away when he thinks proper , without speaking a word , or any person putting to him a single question . ' It argues , we trust , no great want of charity to receive a description like this , with a little distrust , as hearing a much greater resemblance to the highly colored pictures of the purity and innocence of barbarous nations , so prevalent at this time , than to the sober sketches of an impartial historian . Indeed , the civilized communities of the world , if we may judge from some of their writers , seem disposed to compensate for their encroachments on the territory and comforts of their savage brethren , by extravagant et4ogies on their virtues , thus illustrating a remark made in a sermon of Dr South , that when men ask for bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so hard as a stone , but altogether as dry . ' In 1793 , Cochin China was visited by Lord Macartney and his suite , but the English squadron merely touched at Turoii , one of its northern ports , and Mr Jackson , the sailing master of the Lion , on penetrating a little way into this hospitable country , was seized by the officers of government , and very roughly handled both by them and by the populace . The account given of this visit by Sir George Stanton therefore , however impartial , is extremely scanty . For the purpose of opening a trade with this unknown region , the brig Franklin was fitted out at Sakm , in the year // 1818 , and placed under the command of Lieutenant White , then absent on a furlough from the naval service of the United States . He sailed January 2 , 1819 , and returned August 31 , 1820 . The motives which led to the publication of this work , are stated in the following brief and candid advertisement . This volume was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be deposited in the archives of the " East India Marine Society of Salem . " Some of the author 's friends , however , who had read the manuscript , ( among whom was the Hon. John Pickering , who kindly assisted him with advice , ) conceived it of sufficient general interest to be published , and it is accordingly submitted , " with all its imperfections upon its head . " The very respectable and flattering list of subscribers obtained in his native place , when proposals were first issued , gave birth to hopes of more general patronage ; but these hopes have been but very partially realized , and the proceeds of the subscription list will scarcely defray the expenses of publication . As a proof that no fault on his part has delayed the appearance of the work , the principal part - of the manuscript was read by some of his friends two and a half years ago . To his patrons , he deems it his duty to offer the above reason for its not appearing before ; and it is only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses already incurred , that it is now published. - It would not otherwise have been committed to the press . In regard to style , grammatical accuracy , and mode of arrangement , he requests his readers to bear in mind , that this is not a book written by a professed scholar* but the production of an unlettered seaman . In the course of the work , he has endeavored to account for the discrepancy between his own humble though faithful narrative and descriptions , and the vague and disjointed accounts of some former writers , by which the Cochin Chinese character is so differently represented . He does not , however , pretend to make any invidious comparisons , but to show , that from our general non-intercourse with that remote and secluded country , few correct accounts of it have been published , and those at a period considerably remote from the present era ; since which its national character has been debased by the increasing despotism of the government . Deceived by the flattering accounts of this reputed ci dorado. , ( however correct they may once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk voyages there ; one of which was from // Salem , as early as the year 1803 ; * but they were all totally unsuccessful ; and it is presumed , that no American ever prosecuted any important commercial speculation in the country , previous to the joint adventure of the brig Franklin and ship Marmion . At least it is very certain , that they were the first American ships that ever ascended the Donnai river , and disp*layed the stars and stripes before the city of Saigon . ' In his passage to Cochin China , Lieutenant White touched at St Salvador , the Island of Banca , and several other ports . His descriptions of these places are lively and entertaining . Want of room , however , obliges us to pass over most of them without farther notice , and we shall merely say a few words of Tristan d'Acunha , a spot rendered interesting to Americans , by a curious enterprise of one of our fellow citizens . This is a little island in the South Atlantic Ocean , lying nearly in the latitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles in circumference , and with two others of inferior size , called Nightingale and Inaccessible , composes a small group , first discovered by the Portuguese in 1700 . The whole cluster is described as bearing indisputable marks of the action of fire , and is consequently supposed to be of volcanic origin . These three islands are rugged and mountainous . Tristan d'Acunha , excepting a peak in its centre , is covered with verdure ; the two others are quite barren . In the year 1811 , Jonathan Lambert of Salem took possession of the whole group , and claimed the ownership and sovereignty of the soil by right of occupancy . These pretensions were set forth in a proclamation published sh6rtly afterwards , which , both in sense and in style , was , to say the least , quite equal to some which have lately issued from far mightier thrones . He invited navigators of all nations to touch at his islands for refreshments , and for the purpose of fulfilling his engagements , carried out a colony of three or four adventurers , and cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have held his territory , without exciting the jealousy of the great monarchs of Europe , is a problem which it was not left for time to solve . The issue of his enterprise is thus described by Mr White . Lambert and his associates had resided here nearly two years , and already had their industry been crowned with great success ; // they had collected a number of the skins of seals , sea lions , &amp;c. and a considerable quantity of oil , from the same animals . The sroil , congenial to the growth of the various kinds of plants , which they had naturalized there , had begun to reward their toils with a plentiful crop of roots , fruits , and pulse , and they were made happy in the fruition of their hopes , and in the flattering prospects of future independence , which were spread before them . In the midst of the enlivening feelings which pervaded their minds on the success of their undertaking , a melancholy incident took place , which rent asunder the bonds of this little society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the death of Lambert , the soul of their enterprise ; he is reported to have been drowned , while on a visit to one of the adjacent islands . Disheartened by this unfortunate occurrence* by which they were deprived of an intelligent leader , and distrusting their own powers to prosecute their original designs to a favorable issue , they shortly after this event quitted the island in a ship which touched there ; and in 1814 their huts were found falling to the ground , their enclosures in ruins , and every part of this once florishing establishment marked with the devastations of time and neglect . ' On the 23d of July , the Franklin entered the straits of Banca , and on the following day was attacked by three Malay proas . A short engagement ensued . The carriages of her guns became useless , after a few discharges , and Mr White determined to put into Mintow , a small Dutch settlement in the Island of Banca , where he ar- ' rived in the evening . From this place he sailed two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovered Cape St James , the southern point of Cochin China , lying at the mouth of the great Donnal river . This cape he passed in the evening , and anchored just beyond it , in front of the village of Vungtau . On the following day , they were boarded by a Cochin Chinese boat , containing three mandarins with their suite . An amusing description of the first interview between these visitors and our countrymen , is contained in the fourth chapter of this work . Mr White had necessarily formed his opinion of the character of the Cochin Chinese , from the descriptions of those lively writers , to whom we have already referred . His erroneous impressions on this subject were speedily rectified* The military chief was a withered , greyheaded old man , pos. * ressing however a great deal of vivacity , tinctured with a leaven of // savage childishness , which in spite of his affectation of great state and ceremony , would constantly break out , and afford us infinite amusement . He had several attendants , who were perfectly subservient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that on all other occasions the greatest familiarity subsisted between them . One of the attendants carried a huge umbrella , with which he followed the old man to all parts of the ship , where his curiosity or caprice led him , and when invited into the cabin , he would not descend without the umbrella , so tenacious was he of every circumstance of state and appearance . Another attendant was a handsome boy of about fifteen years of age , who carried in two blue silk bags connected with a piece of cotton cloth , and thrown over his shoulder , the areka nut , the betel leaf chunam and tobacco , of which they chew immense quantities ; and so universal is this custom among them , that I never saw a man of any rank or respectability without one of these attendants . They also smoke segars made of cut tobacco , rolled in paper wrappers , like the Portuguese , from whom probably they adopted this custom . Another servant carried his fan ; and our risibility was not a little excited on seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cook 's coppers , embracing the sailors on the forecastle , dancing , grinning , and playing many other antic tricks , followed by the whole train of fanners , umbrella bearers , and chunam boys , ( for the attendants of the other chiefs had joined in the procession ) with the most grave deportment and solemn visages , performing their several * In person the Cochin Chinese are perhaps somewhat smaller than their neighbors the Malays , and of the same color , though generally not so well formed ; their constant habit of chewing areka imparts to their mouths a most disgusting appearance. * The habit of the higher classes , in permitting their nails to grow to an enormous length , can not be supposed to conduce to cleanliness or comfort ; and it is remarkable with what unwearied pains they cultivate them , as a person bearing this badge is supposed not to be obliged to perform any manual labor , and the longer the nails , the more respectability do they confer on the wearer . Their garments are seldom taken off by night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excepting in cases of ceremony , when they are temporarily superseded by other dresses , till rotten by time and filth , when they are permitted to fall off of themselves . These dirty habits engender vast swarms of vermin , and render their bodies highly offensive to more than one sense ; and the epithet frowzy , which has been applied to the Chinese , is exemplified in these people in the most emphatic sense . After having visited every part of the ship , the old mandarin began to court my favor , with the most unyielding pertinacity* // hugging me round the neck , attempting to thrust his dirty betel nut into my mouth from his own , and leaping upon me like a dog , by which I was nearly suffocated . I finally mcceeded in extricating myself from the ardor of his caresses , and getting to the windward side of him , which I maintained , notwithstanding his reiterated efforts to dislodge me . At first we could not account for this sudden and violent fit of unsolicited friendship , but in a short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been by the accounts which we had had of this country , and totally unacquainted with the real character of the people , we had taken no precaution to keep any articles out of their sight , which it would have been improper or inconvenient for us to part with ; and on this occasion we suffered severely by our ignorance . One of the inferior chiefs intimated a wish to descend to the cabin , which was granted . No sooner had we entered it , than , pointing to the looking glass , he gave us to understand that he must have that for the old chief ; being somewhat surprised at the demand , we smiled , and , endeavoring to divert his attention , presented him a bottle of brandy and a glass to help himself , which he did not hesitate to do most abundantly ; and then , giving us to understand that he considered the vessels as a present , passed them to his attendants , who , after swallowing the liquor , deposited them under their robes . The mandarin then renewed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did not demand , and in a manner to impress us with an idea that a refusal would give great umbrage to the chief on deck . Our curtains , glassware , wearing apparel , arms , ammunition , spyglasses , and cabin furniture , were successively the objects of his cupidity ; we had , however , determined to be very limited in our donations , at the same time , keeping in view the importance of conciliating these people , and gaining their good will , on our first entrance into their country ; he was therefore presented with a shirt , a handkerchief , and a pair of shoes for himself with an intimation that nothing more would be bestowed , on which he went on deck , in a very ill mood . We followed him shortly , and found the aspect of affairs materially changed ; from an excess of gaiety and good humour , old Heo , ( for that we discovered was his name , ) had fallen into very ill humor , and scarcely deigned to speak. * The old chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several very costly presents . He was now In high spirits again , and , in the wantonness of his benevolence , took off his old blue silk robe , with which he very graciously invested me ; at the same time shrugging his shoulders , and intimating that he was cold . I took the hint , and sent for a white jacket , // which I assisted him in putting on ; at this attention he appeared highly gratified . A demand was now made for some refreshments , and we spread before them some biscuit , cold beef , ham , brandyfruits , and cheese ; of the biscuit and cheese they ate voraciously , seasoning their repast with bumpers of raw spirit ; the other viands they did not seem to relish ; neither did the brandy-fruits suit their palates , till it was hinted to them , that they would produce the same effects as the rum , on which they swallowed them with great gout ; nor were they disappointed in the effects , which we had promised them would be produced by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village , they were in a state of great hilarity . ' Upon leaving the vessel , Heo invited Mr White to visit him on shore . The request was complied with , and after some formal delays , Mr White was ushered into the chief 's house , of which he gives the following picture9 The apartment , into which we were ushered , was about twenty five feet square , and this we found was the usual hall of audience ; the floor was composed of a mixture of sand and clay , which , by constant attrition , had become very compact and solid ; the walls were decorated with rusty swords , shields , match locks , gongs and spears . On each side of the entrance was an enormous bass drum , called in the East a Tom-tom , mounted on a clumsy wooden frame , and struck with a bamboo , at stated periods , by a soldier on guard ; but what method they had of measuring their time we could not ascertain . On a raised platform , at the right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment of the caungue , or yoke ; this punishment is inflicted by placing over the culprit 's neck , and resting on his shoulders , two pieces of large sized bamboo , about ten feet long each , and secured parallel to each other , by two strong wooden bars , which pass on each side of the neck , embracing it very closely , ( not , however , so as to prevent its being turned round , ) and give the criminal the appearance of carrying * ladder on his shoulders . Directly back of this platform was an entrance into anothej apartment , devoted to domestic purposes , before which hung a coarse screen , or blind , of split bamboo , resembling those used in Bengal , not , however , so thick and closely woven , as to hide from our view the women , children , and pigs behind it , who were amicably par . taking together of the contents of a huge wooden tray , which was placed in the middle of a floor , composed of small sticks , or wa*-ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured by small cords , made of a kind of flax . At the back part of the hail , a recess , was placed a large wainscot of heavy wood work , o // which was carved , in high relief , a group of non-descript figures , which must have cost the wildest and most prolific imagination no small effort to invent . On each side of the recess , in gaudy water colors , were displayed several paintings of prodigious monsters , " chimeras dire , ** and many other heterogeneous productions ; and in the centre stood a table , on which was placed a censer of brass , a bason of the same metal , filled nearly to the top with ashes , in which were stuck a great number of matches , ( the ends of all which had been burnt , ) and a little bronze Jos , or god . And , in front of the posts , or pillars , on each side , were suspended long narrow scrolls or columns of colored paper , with various characters of their language upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr White lost no time in informing the chief , that the main purpose of his voyage was to procure a cargo at the city of Saigon , and requested him to grant permission to go up the river to that place. * This the mandarin gave him to understand was beyond his power ; and added , that should he comply with the request , both parties would be liable to capital punishment . Mr White then stated , that he should go tip witho*ut permission , and was informed in return , that he would incur the same penalty . The mandarin , however , agreed to transmit to Saigon an account of the Franklin*s arrival , and a request for a chop or pass to go up the river , and assured Mr White that he would receive an answer in two days . When these had elapsed , the same promise was repeated . In short , after waiting several days longer , after receiving several more visits from Heo , and other mandarins with their followers , and vainly endeavoring to purchase their good offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length perceived , that it was entirely out of the power of these officers to facilitate his farther entrance into the country , and learned , that they had not even transmitted the news of his arrival to Saigon . He concluded , therefore , to leave Vungtau and proceed to Hue , the usual residence of the king , a city which lies in the northern extremity of his territories . From the extracts which we have made , our readers will be fully prepared to give credit to the following general view pf the Cochin Chinese charactcr. * As Mr White and the chief were entire strangers to each other 's language , they could converse only by signs , which mode of communication , however , they soon lc*rned to employ with great facility* // On this our first interview with the natives of the country , we were much surprised to find their manners so different from what we had been led to expect from the accounts we had had of them , and could only reconcile the discordance by a supposition that the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished residents of the cities , must of course be less civil-. ized ; but as we became more acquainted , and their characters were proportionably developed , we were convinced that the Cochin Chinese were in many respects but little removed from a state of deplorable * Mr White left Vungtau on the 13th of July , and after sailing along the coast , anchored on the 18th in Turon Bay . Here they were visited by three mandarins . One of these signed for pen and ink , which being produced , and some paper handed him , he wrote in Latin , Quid Interrogas ? * Calling up the remains of our acquirements in that language while schoolboys , we contrived to hold an intelligible conversation with them . ' They stated , that the king was then absent from Hu* , and that it would be absolutely impossible to procure a good cargo in the northern provinces . Disappointed in this second attempt , Mr White determined to sail to Manilla for the purpose of finding some person acquainted with the language of Cochin China , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ultimate accomplishment of his design . In both these respects , his wishes were almost totally disappointed , as the inhabitants of Manilla were singularly ignorant of every thing relating to Cochin China . He then determined to renounce his purpose altogether . He was diverted from this conclusion , by the arrival of the Marmion , of Boston , commanded by Captain Oliver Blanchard , who shortly after the departure of Mr White from Vungtau , had arrived at that place , and had also made an unsuccessful attempt to penetrate to Saigon* The commanders of these two vessels concluded upon sailing up the Donnai river in company , and after a short stay at Manilla , the Marmion and Franklin returned to Vungtau. * * This language , as we are afterwards informed by our author , had been taught these mandarins by some French Missionaries . t In consequence of the loss of Captain Blanchard , who was taken sick and died in the Donnal river , the command of his vessel had devolved on Mr Brown . // Here they were boarded by a mandarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of repeating the same course of exactions , which had been formerly practised . His demands were strenuously resisted by the commanders of both vessels , who proceeded a short distance up the river to the village of Canjeo , where , after many threatening altercations with the authorities of that place , they were permitted to send one of their officers in a boat to Saigon . This person , 1*Ir Putnam of the Marmion , succeeded in his enterprise , and soon returned with a pass , in company with an old Portuguese , called . Joachim , who had resided several months in the country , and was thoroughly acquainted with the language . Another linguist was procured , a Cochin Chinese christian , named Marianno , who also acted as pilot , and the two vessels proceeded on their voyage up the Donnai . This stream varies in breadth from a mile to two furlongs , but its shores are so bold , that vessels can sail in the narrowest parts without inconvenience . Its banks , for the most part , are covered with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though necessarily limited , is represented as very beautiful , The river is seldom less than eight fathoms in depth . The progress of our voyagers was very slow , as the ebb tide often ran against them , at the rate of five or six miles an hour , and it was not till about a week after they began to ascend the river , that they came in sight of Saigon . The length of the Donnai from its mouth to this city , is about sixty miles . At two o'clock on the morning of the seventh of October , we were again pursuing our course to the object of our destination , which was now not far distant , and the dawn soon arriving disclosed scattered cottages , patches of cultivated grounds , groves of cocoa and areka nut trees , herds of buffaloes , fishing boats , and a distant forest of masts , indicating our near approach to the city , below which at the distance of one mile , we dropped anchor at half past five . The appearance of several boats of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single woman in picturesque costume , was novel and pleasing , while great numbers of the native vessels of different sizes , plying in various directions upon the stream , gave a busy and lively interest to the scene . ' // The treatment of the fair sex in Cochin China is directly the reverse of that , to which they are subjected in many oriental countries . Instead of an utter seclusion from public view , they constitute the most active portion of the community . Besides cultivating the earth , navigating the river craft , and performing manual labor , they conduct all the commercial operations of the kingdom , and are in fact the merchants and brokers of Cochin China . Of their skill in this capacity , Mr White soon received ample proofs . Immediately on his arrival , he was visited by a bevy of them , who , after asking and receiving a glass of brandy each , began to open their business . ' Every article , which he proposed to purchase , had risen from eighty to a hundred per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price was increase4 by an advance of fifty per cent more . Mr White afterwards endeavored to procure a cargo , through the medium of a Cochin Chinese christian , named Domingo , but this encroachment on the rights of women was promptly resented* An appeal was made to the government of the city , and Domingo was ordered to permit the female merchants to trans-* act their concerns in their own way . In short , after a stay of four months at Saigon , only an incomplete cargo could be procured , at a price much beyond its fair value . Constant vigilance was necessary to secure the property on board the two vessels from theft and robbery , and the lives of the captains , during their residence on shore , were more than once endangered by the cowardly attacks of the natives , who lay in ambush , and assaulted them with showers of large stones , and other dangerous missiles . The behavior of the government of Cochin China towards our countrymen was marked by the same characteristics , which distinguished that of the populace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due form , by persons appointed for that purpose . This ceremony was attended with no little inconvenience , as it was performed by a host of officers of various ranks , who , after concluding their business , indulged themselves in a drunken debauch on board the vessels . Yet the measuring fees for the brig Franklin alone amounted to nearly three thousand dollars . The duty exacted on her departure was of equal amount . A general spirit of extortion seemed to pervade , with very little exceptiQn , aft // orders of the government , and every part of their conduct indicated an aversion to all commercial transactions with foreign nations , far exceeding that for which the Chinese are so remarkable . To our merchants , especially , we recommend Mr White 's comprehensive summary of his various difficulties and exertions . It would be tedious to the reader , and painful to myself , to recapitulate the constant villany and turpitude , which we experienced from these people , during our residence in the country . Their total want of faith , constant eagerness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain , by shuffling and manceuvring , what might have been better and easier gained by tpenness and fair dealing ; the tedious forms and ceremonies in transacting all kinds of business , carried into the most trifling transactions ; the uncertainty of the eventual ratification of any bargain , ( the least hope of wearing the patience of the purchaser out , and inducing him to offer a little more , being sufficient to annul any verbal stipulation , ) and there being no appeal , unless there is a written contract , which is never made till every art has been used , and every engine of extortion put in motion and exhausted to gain more ; all these vexations , combined with the rapacious , faithless , despotic and anti-commercial character of the government , will , as long as these causes exist , render Cochin China the least desirable country for mercantile adventurers . These causes have made the Japanese relinquish the trade ; they have driven the Portuguese of Macao from the country , and turned their commerce into other channels ; and are yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The philanthropist , the man of enterprise , and the civilized world generally , can see in the present miserable state of this naturally fine country , no other than a source of deep regret and * The natives of Cochin China seem , in short , to be a degenerate race of the true Chinese , resembling them in little except the worst parts of their character . This inferiority is very justly ascribed by our author to their government , which is a military despotism , administered with little regard either to justice or policy . Their monarchs are generally engaged in attempting to extend their territory , by encroachments on their neighbors , and their subjects are trained up to the use of arms , and in utter ignorance of allthe arts of peace . These are carried on , as we have before observed* // by the women , assisted however in a great degree by the Chinese , who are scattered in abundance throughout the kingdom . These industrious and enterprising people are the me chanics , confectioners , &amp;c. of Cochin China , filling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of our active New England adventurers in some of the southern cities of the United States . They are also hankers and money changers , and much of the circulating medium of the country passes through their hands . There can be little doubt , that the happiness of the Cochin Chinese might be materiaLly increased , in a very short time , by a change of policy in their rulers . It is needless to say , that they could never merit by any exertions the high praise , which has been so gratuitously bestowed upon them by French writers , but it is not less incontestable , that they might be rendered quite equal in all respects to the Chinese . Much was effected by the influence of the celebrated Bishop Adran , who was , in 1802 , the oracle and guide . of the reigning monarch . And during a shoi t peace , previous to the final termination of the war , he established a manufactory of salt petre , opened roads , cut canals , held out rewards for the propagation of the silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cultivation of the sugar cane , established manufactories for the preparation of pitch , tar , rosin , &amp;c. opened mines of iron , constructed smelting furnaces , and founderies for cannon . Adran translated into the Onam lan . guage a system of European militarytactics , for the use of the army . Naval arsenals were established , and a large navy , princi .. pally consisting of gun boats , galleys , &amp;c. was built and equipped . Under his direction a reformation was effected in the system of jurisprudence ; he abolished several species of punishments , that were disproportionate to the crimes to which they were annexed ; he established public schools , and compelled parents to send their children to them at the age of four years ; he drew up commercial regulations , built bridges , caused buoys and sea marks to be laid down in all the dangerous parts of the coast , and surveys to be made of the principal bays and harbors . The officers of the nav.y were instructed in naval tactics by Frenchmen ; his army was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers taught the science of gunnery . Unfortunately for the country , the death of Adran occurred shortly after this ; and // with him expired many of the wholesome laws , institutions , and regulations established by him . ' Mr White frequently visited the principal naval arsenal at Saigon , where he saw timber and planks far exceeding in size any employed in the British and American navy yards . 1 measured one plank , ' he observes , whose dimensions were one hundred and nine feet long , more than five inches thick , and perfectly square to the top , where it was two feet wide . It was sawed out of the trunk of a teak tree , and I believe there is no part of the world where these gigantic sires of the forest arrive at such magnitude as in Cochin China . I have seen in the country a tree , that would make a natural mainmast for a line of battle ship , clear of knots ; and this I learned is not unusual . ' The whole establishment was on a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the arrival of the vessel , a work had been completed bearing the features of true Roman magnificence , but at a lamentable expense of human life . This was a river , or canal , twenty three English miles long , connecting the city of Saigon with a branch of Cambodia river . This canal was twelve feet deep throughout , about eighty feet wide , and was cut through immense forests and morasses , in the short space of six weeks . Twenty six thousand men were employed night and day by turns in this stupendous undertaking , and seven thousand lives sacrificed by fatigue and consequent disease. * The prevailing religion of the Cochin Chinese is polytheisme but they treat their temples and idols with very little respect , and seem to view the whole subject with utter indifference . The Roman Catholic faith was , however , tolerated in the country , and , according to the statements of the priests , professed by no less than seventy thousand people . There was a christian church in the very centre of Saigon , under the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was styled Father Joseph , Mr White was materially indebted for several important good offices , and much useful information . The following anecdote contains an instance of true apostolic disinterestedness , which is above all comment . A few days previous to our quitting Saigon , Father Joseph begged of us some wine and flour , for a particular purpose , as he // said . Knowing his abstemious habits , our curiosity induced us to ask him , to what use he intended to apply those articles ? He ifl* formed us , that as the king had frequently been indisposed of late , and in the event of his death , an extermination of the christians was feared , the wine and flour were designed as elements to be - used at the celebration of the Eucharist ; of which he intended to partake with his converts , at their last extremity . No persuasions could induce this worthy , conscientious , and intrepid man , to quit the country with us ; he answered , that it would be disgraceful for him to desert his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock to the mercy of the wolves ; that now was the time to evince his zeal and sincerity in the service of his master ; and though an obscure individual , his sphere of action small , and fate had placed him in this remote part of the globe , his conduct would be the same as if he were in the most exalted station , and the eyes pf the whole world upon him . ' We have devoted so much room to extracts , that we must refer to the work itself , for many curious accounts of the police of the Cochin Chinese , of their medicine and surgery , their domestic habits , their food and dress , their public and private buildings , their language , their climate and soil , their natural productions , both vegetable and animal . Upon the last of these topics , however , we shall venture to mention one or two incidents . The elephants of Cochin China , which are the largest in the world , besides performing the various warlike services , required of that class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of a hook and ladder company . In care of fire , they are driven head foremost against the adjacent buildings , and the effoi*ts of one , or at most two of them , are amply sufficient to level with the ground any of the slight dwellings of the Cochin Chinese . This country abounds also in royal tigers of uncommon size and ferocity . A female of this species was presented in a , cage by the Viceroy of Donnai to Mr White . She was generally fed by throwing live puppies into the cage . One day the following remarkable incident occurred , which shews , in a striking light , the effect of first impressions on the brute creation . A puppy , not at all remarkable , or distinguishable in appear ance , from the common herd , was thrown in , who immediately , on perceiving his situation , set up a dismal yell and attacked the tigress with great fury , snapping at her nose , from which hc drew // some blood . The tigress appeared to be amused with the puny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressiofl of countenance , as so ferocious an animal could be supposed to &amp;s* sume , she affected to treat it all as play ; and sometimes spreading herself at full length on her side , at others , crouching in the man ner of the fabled sphynx , she would ward off with her paw , the incensed little animal , till he was finally exhausted . She then proceeded to caress him , endeavoring , by many little arts to inspire him with confidence , in which she finally succeeded , and in a short time they laid down together and slept . From this time they xi*ere inseparable ; the tigress appearing to feel for the puppy all the solicitude of a mother , and the dog , in return , treating her with the greatest affection ; and a small aperture was left open in the cage , by which he had free ingress and egress . Experiments were sub sequently made , by presenting a strange dog at the bars of the cage , when the tigress would manifest great eagerness to get at it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would eagerly pounce ; but immediately discovering the cheat , she would caress it with great tenderness . ' Upon the whole , we have seldom seen so many new and valuable facts in the same compass , as are comprised in the work before us . However unfortunate in a commercial point of view , Mr White 's voyage may have been to himself and his employers , he has rendered it productive of a large accession to the intellectual wealth of his fellow citizens . Besides the general information , which it affords us , of the state of a country hitherto little known and greatly misrepresented , his book abounds in accurate geographical and nautical remarks respecting the seas that he traversed , and the ports he visited , which must be of no ordinary use to our seafaring brethren . It affords one of the most striking , though by no means the only instance , of the important information , which has been diffused through our community by the laborious and judicious exertions of our intelligent shipmasters , of whom it is but scanty justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or manners , they are not surpassed by those of any other country . Independent of all that it contains , this work possesses a negative merit of no very common kind in books of travels-. its freedom not only from every thing indelicate , but from all which is tedious or irrelevant . The style is spirited and easy . The author 's fear of falling into a coarse and uncouth // mode of writing , an apprehension in our opinion quite ground-. less , has sometimes led him , especially in his first chapters , to construct his sentences in rather an ambitious manner . This fault , which is the only one worth noticing , will be viewed with indulgence by those , who remember the circumstances under which the work was composed , who place a just value on its numerous and solid merits , and who consider the high credit , which the industry and research of Mr White reflect bothon himself and on his country .                    @
