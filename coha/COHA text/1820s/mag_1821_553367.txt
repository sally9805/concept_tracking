txt BY JOHN C. GRAY7 ESQ . Gentlemen , PERMIT me to allude to the present condition of American literature , however trite some of you may think the whole subject , for the purpose of congratulating you on the tiew *and agreeable aspect , in which it now presents itself to our templation . The progress which it has made within a very few years , is too great and too manifest to be overlooked or denied . All who hear me must be well aware , that our writers are every day increasing in number and in merit , that our standard of excellence is rapidly rising , that our readers are constantly becoming more correct in their sentiments , and more severe in their requisitions . In asserting that an important change has already taken place , that our literary character is higher at this moment , than at any former period of our existence as an independent community , we shall surely give no just ground for the imputation of national vanity . These opinions are not confined to ourselves , they are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have given little indication of any undue prepossessions in our favor . As I have no wish to speak extravagantly of our actual progress , still less would I insinuate that nothing , or that little now remains to do . What we have already accomplished furnishes a ground of hope rather than of complacency , a motive to exertion and not an excuse for indolence . There is doubtless yet much room for improvement , but we have proceeded on the whole with no faltering step , and if we are but true to ourselves , the continuance , diffusion and increase of an // enlightened and efficient spirit of literature , a spirit which will produce writers as well as readers , will be henceforth no longer doubtful . The present period then is indeed an interesting era . We shall cease to depend wholly on another country , for the daily nourishment of our understandings from the first moment of their opening . We are preparing to distinguish ourselves among nations by our writings as well as by our actions . I have said thus much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our late writers , not merely on account of the pleasure innocent , to say no more , which such a retrospect must afford you , both as scholars and as citizens . It has been my object to remind you in a few words , that our literary career is actually commenced , principally because a consciousness of this fact can not but give a new and immediate interest to all speculations on our future progress . What , we are naturally led to ask , is the degree of eminence which American writers may ultimately hope to reach , and what will be their relative rank among the distinguished authors of modern times ? In reflecting on these questions , one circumstance suggests itself to the mind , as distinguishing , more than any thing else , our own literary condition from that of every enlightened country in Europe , our community of language with a nation , which has been long and highly celebrated for its advancement in letters . As far as respects the words , and as far as the words affect the sentiments , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of language , on our own literature , is the subject on which I shall now offer a few remarks to your consideration . It has often been confidently asserted , that this peculiarity in our situation , must forever render our writers incapable of every thing like originality . We are doomed to compose , say the supporters of that opinion , in a language which has beea cultivated , and how successfully ! for three centuries . The time for bold and novel conceptions , the golden age of English literature is now gone by , and every department is already occupied by writers , who have left no choice to us but to imitate them servilely , or to differ from them affectedly . We should scarcely suppose , my friends , that opinions like these , even if founded on the most solid reasoning , could ever gain e. prompt and cheerful assent , from any real friend to improvernent . Still less should we imagine that writers of genius , // though they might feel unable to deny , would delight to illus-* trate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprised , they differ but little from those general complaints of the impossibility of producing any thing new , which have been repeated with undiminished assurance , by critics of every age and nation . That all the sources of literary information arc exhausted , is indeed an idea scarcely less ancient than literature itself . Thus we are gravely told , that the works of nature ase always the same , that the passions of man are alike at all ti*rncs and in all countries , that the principles of morality are *fexv and soon understood , and that therefore nothing is left for us to say , in descriptive , in tragic , or in ethical poetry ; as if the works of nature were not all but infinite , and the operation of human passions as diversified as the occasions which excite them , and the great principles of the moral , like those of the physical creation , as various in their application , as they are simple and comprehensive in their nature . In short% the assertion that all which is most striking in the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few great masters , must be a maxim as incredible to those , who are not blinded by the splendid imagery , with which it is sometimes illustrated , as the Mahometan doctrine , that every thing worth knowing is comprised in the koran . If it needs any other refutation , than the mark of absurdity which it carries on its very forehead , we may find it overthrown by every step in the march of genius . Could we grant for a moment , that all subjects worthy of attention had been selected by preceding authors , how wide an opportunity would still be left to superior abilities . It is the business of exalted minds , not only to discover sources of pleasure before unknown , * but to elicit new beauties from those which seemed exhausted , to render old ideas novel , as well as new ones familiar . There is much in transposing , in expanding , in illustrating , in adorning the leading thoughts , which others have already marked out , and the excellence of literary compositions consists in no small degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is often preferred , and justly , to him who first pro-. duces , and we should gladly yield to other nations the credit of such originals , as Hesiod 's Works and Days , could we boast of such imitations as Virgil 's Georgics . Were all men of one tongue , as well as one blood , had there always existed an universal language , still even in this advanced age of the // world , who could say that the fields of knowledge had been explored and reaped to their utmost boundaries ? With how much less assurance then can we ascribe such a plenitude of intelligence to the literature of Great Britain . The opinions , which I have just endeavoured to disprove , - may appear too extravagant to deserve the attention which I have devoted to them . They are in truth the forgeries ofindolence , but this very circumstance renders a lively impression of their fallacy still more necessary . It is as vague sentiments and not as settled convictions ; it is in their influence on our feelings and not on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not believe that English literature is complete , and that our attempts would be unavailing , but we feel , and because we are willing to do so that English literature is rich , and that our industry is unnecessary . It is by encouraging this feeling and in no other way ; it is by furnishing a temptation to indolence , and not by circumscribing the sphere of invention , that the works of British writers can produce a disadvantage6i7i* effect on th' originality of our native productions . The extent to which this temptation can operate in relaxing the exertions of our authors iuust depend upon themselves , and will , in any event , as we may confidently trust , be far too slight a disadvantage to outweigh the numerous benefits which our rising literature must derive from our identity of language with Great Britain . To these , which we shall find a more fruitful , as well as more encouraging theme , let us now direct our attention . The first and greatest is the advantage enjoyed by our early writers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much and deservedly as we admire the richness of the English classics , we shall find it difficult to realize the full influence of this circumstance in exciting and directing our literary efforts . Did we speak a language pc .. culiar to ourselves , our standard of merit would be regulated by the works of our own writers and must depend principally on a few of the earliest . The best which we know is always excellent , and the faults of a small number of imposing examples might spread unchecked , till they became the general and settled characteristics of American composition . From errors like these we may now find an easy and a sure escape , in a diligent perusal of the works of our literary predecessors m England . To shew us what degree of excellence we can // rationally hope and should in duty strive to reach , we have the example of those who have given the only unequivocal proof of merit , by pleasing generally and pleasing long ; whose title to admiration is supported by the testimony of numer - eus enlightened generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fate of many English authors of the present period . We are powerfully admonished to an exact observance of the permanent rules of goo.d taste , by daily seeing* the works of those who have ventured to set them at defiance ; fading into oblivion as fashion varies . I do not say that we could derive the same advantages in no degree from the study of British authors , if their language were not ours also . Much is no doubt gained , from a thorough acquaintance with the classics of other ancient and modern Imti9ns , and the narrow prejudices of English scholars *f th' present day , which have so generally led them ignorantly and indiscriminately to overlook the literature of the European continent , deprive them of not a little which might improve the character of their own compositions . Yet the study 2Qf other languages , however highly and incontestably beneficial it may be rendered , is valuable to us only as we possess a thorough acquaintance with the genius of our own , and this can never be acquired without a frequent perusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of language with Great Britain not only enables us to improve our taste , by the study of numerous compositions of every variety and degree of excellence . There is another benefit resulting from it which we feel daily , and which , at some future period , we may hope to confer in return on England ,  --  that derived from the animadversions of her critics . Our compositions are submitted to the judgment of those who can combine the knowledge of natives with the coolness of foreigners , who , though well qualified to estimate our real merits , are beyond the influence of any local preju .. dices or temporary fashions , which might give for a while to works of an ordinary character , an adventitious value among is ourselves . That those critics will always be as candid as they are able , is indeed a supposition for which experience gives little warrant , but their prejudices will generally be of an opposite nature to ours , and if far more inexcusable in them , must be far less dangerous to us . It is yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own efforts , and // place too implicit a confidence in the reproofs of others , and if the beauties of our authors are not liberally acknowledged , - their faults at least will be promptly and carefully , though sometimes , it may be , harshly censured . Far be it from me , however , to recommend an entire deference to foreign arbiters , for this would be not less injurious than servile . We should learn to judge as well as to write for ourselves , and consider the decisions of the literary* like those of the legal tribunals of England , as entitled to our respect for the reasons on which they are founded , and not for the authority which is stamped upon them . Nothing would tend more to accelerate our progress in letters , than the encouragement among ourselves , of a spirit of enlightened and liberal yet exact and fearless criticism . Our writers will then be doubly guarded from error by the censures of the reviewers of both countries , by the opinions of two distinct circles of scholars , situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall better realize all the advan* tages of this two-fold security , if we consider what is yet wanting , notwithstanding our late flattering improvements , to raise us to eminence as a literary community . I say nothing of the small number of our authors , for this is incontestably owing to circumstances in our national condition , which have diverted our countrymen from the pursuit of letters , to objects of apparently more practical importance . If , therefore , there were nothing for us to regret but the mere want of writers , if we had , with regard to literature , in the sense in which Pope has applied the phrase to a different subject , no character at all , ' we might look upon our deficiency , in this respect , as an unavoidable misfortune . But will it be equally easy to vindicate our countrymen from the charge , not of neglecting to write , but of writing ill ? do the few works which we have produced compensate for their scarcity by their excellence ? does our literature flow with a pure though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , guilty of faults , which , by a wise and diligent use of their means of improvernent , they would assuredly have avoided ; do not their productions exhibit many violations of sober sense which spring from any other cause than native and insurmountable ignorance ? It is errors like these , my friends , which have tarnished our reputation ; it is a perverted taste , which , like a worm in the bud , has checked the early growth of our literature ; // it is not in genius , not in the power , which invents , combines , amplifies , and animates , ' that our countrymen have been so often deficient , but in the judgment which chastens and polishes . The last advantage resulting from our community of language with England , which 1 have time to mention , is the unequalled sphere of celebrity and usefulness , which it opens to the authors of both nations . To English and American genius only , is it given to hope for an extensive and durable celebrity in two powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of those in each country who are actuated by an enlarged and benevolent philosophy , when they reflect , that in literature we and the inhabitants of Great Britain must always be fellow-citizens , that this is a bond of union which our political separation , complete and decided as it ever should and will be , need not and can not break , that there is one common subject of interest , in the contemplation of which all national prejudices must be at the worst but faintly remembered . Let us be as anxious to rival , as we are willing to acknowledge the merit of English authors , and whatever a few narrow critics may pretend to think of our literature , it can not but win its way to the general admiration of their countrymen , and excite an esteem and veneration for our national character , in the hearts of those of our transat .. lantic kinsmen , whose opinions we least hear but should most value , of those middling classes of English society whose feelings and habits most resemble our own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Atlantean shoulders , the vast system of British empire . In the preceding sketch of the advantages and disadvantages incident , in a literary point of view , to our possession of the language of England , instead of one peculiar to ourselves , we have seen that the only evil , apprehended from this circumstance , is the additional difficulty which it has been supposed to lay on our own writers , of rising to boldness and originality of conception . I have endeavored to shew you that this supposition is a phantom of indolent or timid minds , that genius and industry can never fail to find new subjects or to throw new light on what seemed A'ully displayed already , that the common and vague idea that English literature is full , deserved to be examined and exposed , not because it is solid or even rlausible , but because it is so flattering in itself to idleness , a // to be often embraced and cherished without The slightest examination . You will probably conclude with me , that the misfortune of writing in a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it is ours to permit or to prevent any ill effects which it may tend to produce , is far more than balanced by the singular and weighty advantages* from which we must have been forever shut out , if deprived of the English tongue . Should you think , however , that this conclusion is more agreeable than correct , should you believe , that the want of a separate language must always render our literature secondary to that of England , let us at least endeavor not to exaggerate a disadvantage , which is from its very nature irremoveable . Admitting that it may not he in our power to produce authors like those who have flourished in the early history of other countries , yet if we turn from those fields of exertion , which seem preoccupied , to those which are yet left invitingly open , we may find opportunities which offer us no despicable rewards , and impose on us no trivial obligations . The difficulty of adding any thing useful or splendid to the works of former English writers , great as we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by their successors of the present day . These at least , we may expect without presumption , to rival. * But should this be our utmost hope and aim ? Are there not circumstances in our national condi.tion , which place our scholars in a situation widely different from that of their contemporaries n Great Britain ? An investigation of a few of those circumstances may satisfy us , that we have means and motives for the cultivation of literature , which are exclusively our own ; - means which if diligently improved , and motives which if properly felt , will enable our writers to acquire a degree of celebrity , which it would be otherwise almost presumption to desire . We are , in the first place , singularly and most happily distinguished , even from the more enlightened nations of Europe , by the diffusion of elementary instruction throughout every class of the community . This has been often and deservedly a subject of exultation and of gratitude , as a source of comfort , a protection to liberty , an aid to virtue , but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excellence of our literature . How much intellect must be lost in other nations by the comparative narrowness of the circle , to which the benefits of education are extended ? With us they are nnivev // sal , and the pathetic observations of Gray on talents which are obscured by ignorance and poverty , like gems buried in the depths of ocean , or flowers wasting their sweetness in the deserts , would in this country be as fictitious , as they are poetical . The influence of this general diffusion of instruction is fully and strikingly shewn , by the vast proportion of ingen .. ious and important . inventions in the useful arts , which has rendered our countrymen so distinguished throughout the world . To what is this owing , but to those rudiments of knowledge by which the minds of our citizens are from their very infancy , at once enriched and excited ? The idea of diffusing a high degree of refinement through an extensive and populous country has often been ridiculed by English critics , as one of the thousand visions of believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little else , where the great body of the people are destitute of the very elements of knowledge , however profound and various may - be the acquirements of a few studious individuals . Such a community reminds us of the wounded soldier in Lucan* whose blood flowed only through his nobler organs , while the rest of his system lay cold and motionless . I would not assert that even in nations where the first duty of the government to the people , that of providing for their instruction , ' is thus neglected ; where what should be as common as the air we breathe , is thus unnaturally , partially , and narrowly confined , that even there the labors of *elegant scholars produce no general benefit . The mind is enlarged not merely by reading . Much is done , far more than is generally supposed , by what is called reflected information , by what we gather from our daily intercourse with society . The most uneducated individual in the community may ' gain something of the knowledge which flows originally from the most accomplished ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shines around him , though the film has never been removed from the eyes of his understanding by early instruction . To every thing , however , like the diffusion of extensive information and refined taste through a great nation , such a defect must prove an insurmountable barrier . Wherever this obstacle does not exist , where the writings of scholars can be read and relished by the community in general , it is surely not extravagant to hope , that mental refinement may be transmitted to the minds of all . // This is our situation . Why then may we not one day a*-pire to the character of a people universally literary , to a dis tinction which has hithertn been the exclusive glory of Athens . It may be said , indeed* that the progress of our country towards this object must be slower than hers , for her s ubjects were few , circumscribed by the walls of one city , placed within the reach of daily intercourse . But is not the advantage which she enjoyed in this respect , compensated by the facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art of printing ? In ancient times , truth was extended and perpetuated among mankind in general , by oral communication . At the present day , the press is the principal channel of intelligence , and is more and more superseding every other . It is not the eloquent speaker , but the eloquent writer who now holds the keys of knowledge . The distance between one part of our country and another must continually become more unimportant , and the general diffusion not merely of elementary but of refined information among our citizens , if less rapid , is not less certain , than it would he were we enclosed by narrower boundaries . If this be indeed a fact , what motives of ambition does it suggest to our men of letters ! They write not for a little circle , but for a whole people ; their works may be read as well as praised by all their fellow-citizens ; they can at once delight the scholar and gratify the less educated , and to be intelligible to all , they need only be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlightened admiration of every class of society , to be the direct and immediate instructers of an immense empire , is indeed no humble duty ; but among ourselves the dignity of such an office , high as it is , deserves our consideration far less than its important influence on our political welfare . You are thoroughly sensible of the dependence of our very national existence , on the intelligence and morality of the people in general . Indeed on these the solid greatness of all states must ultimately rest . You will recollect that Virgil crowns his inimitable panegyric on the virtues of retired and domestic life , by tracing to them with as much philosophy as poetry , with not less truth than beauty , the origin of all the unequalled greatness of his own country . This was the life the ancient Sabines chose , Thus Rome 's twin founders , thus Etiuria rose . Thus Rome herself o'er all the world renowned . ' New series , No. 8. 63 // Yet with us it is not merely by his private virtues that each citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community . He has political as well as social duties . By our principles of equal representation , while all have the power of electing their rulers and judging in the last resort on the propriety of their measures , many are , at some period of their lives , called to be rulers themselves . It has been well observed of despotic governments , that , by depriving the people of all control over public affairs , they divide one of the strongest ties which hind each individual to the whole nation , and thus patriotism is necessarily extinguished in selfishness . Our situation is , in every respect , the reverse . How important is it then that the public spirit of our citizens should he enlightened , as well as ardent , and how essential to this great end , that they should be well acquainted with our admirable principles of government , many of which are singular and on a superficial view , unaccountable ! Thus to enlighten their minds must he the business of elegant scholars . It is not hare and unadorned statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political and moral principles , by which our community is regulated . They should be impressed on our hearts as well as unfolded to our minds , by eloquent historians , orators , and poets . How many of us are utterly deterred from becoming acquainted with the conduct and principles of the first settlers of our country , merely by the inelegant style in which their history is generally related ! While our system of representation renders a national literature thus important , as the vehicle of political truth , our vast extent of territory should lend us to cultivate it with no less solicitude , as a bond of attachment between our different states . It is not enough that we should have a cold conviction of the intimate connexion between our union and our prosperity . We must be held together by the attraction of sympathy , and not merely by the chains of interest , for these a people like ours , if once agitated by a spirit of discord , would cast off with as much ease as Sampson his green withes . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the triumph of passion over calculation . It is by engaging the feelings of our fellow citizens of every region , soil and climate in objects of common and lively interest , that we must overcome the necessary and otherwise irresistible tendency to // disunion , resulting from the wide and increasing expansion of our empire . Such must be the effect of elegant literary writings . The lustre , which they must reflect on our united country , would produce an enlarged exultation , in which all local and party prejudices would be swallowed up and lost . In literature , more than in any thing else of equal moment , we may hope for universal similarity of opinion , and cordiality of feeling , and the disputes , to which it sometimes gives occasion , if they oppose no insurmountable impediment , certainly offer no extraordinary temptation to the indulgence of angry and malignant passions . To no object then should public attention be sooner or more earnestly directed than to strengthening the mutual connexion between the several great members of our union , by strong literary ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all important . However different our present condition arid expectations , we should be prepared for the worst , and if the time should ever come , when our country shall he divided into furious and vindictive parties by geographical boundaries , and rent by the united force of political and of local prejudices , when a blind and excessive attachment to supposed state privileges shall shut out all regard to the permanent interest of the whole , when that which should be our peace , the christian faith , shall be rendered by the misguided consciences of warring sectaries a fountain of bitterness , it is then that our national literature may be the only subject of harmonious interest loft us , it is then that our circle of scholars may prove A hoop of gold to bind their brothers in , That the united vessel of their blood Mingled with venom of suggestion , As force per force , the age will pour it in Shall never leak , though it do work as strong As aconite . ' Need 1 mentiofl any farther motives to literary industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerful , than any which I have suggested . Those who founded and who have most ably supported our admirable political institutions , have often laboured to interest us deeply in preserving them , by admonishing us , that we were making a grand experiment in human nature , that our political conduct was a subject of high // interest and of deep consequence , to all our contemporaries throughout the civilized world . Is there any thing romantic or visionary , in recommending , for similar reasons , the elevation of our country to a high literary celebrity ? Let it not be said , my friends , that republican freedom , though compatible with security , with wealth , with physical comfort , is hostile to a high degree of mental cultivation . Let us not allow the enlightened philosophers of Europe , those men in whom all permanent and beneficial reforms must originate , to believe thtit we have gained the useful only at the expense of the elegant , let our country be distinguished not merely by the intrinsic worth which enables us to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those lighter charms , which will render her the admiration and the model of foreign nations ; with her purity let her unite refinement , let her garments be always white , but let them remain no longer unadorned .
