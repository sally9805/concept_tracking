txt ART . IX. - . Die Staats Wissenchaft , theoretisch und praktisck dargestelit , 4*c . The Science of Political Economy , theoretically and practi- ' cally explained and illustrated , *by Examples out of the : modern financial History of European States . By LEWIS HENRY VON JAKOB . 8vo. 2 vols. in one . Halle . 1821 . THE author of this valuable work is one of the many German scholars , whose merits have been latterly acknowledged by the cheap reward of nobility . This might be understood from the particle Von prefixed to his name , which , although very ancient and truly historical , is not one of those feudal epithets indicating an aristocratic origin . What honorable station the ennobled author fills , the titlepage does not designate , but from the book it appears that he is a professor in the University of Halle , is respected in Germany as a writer and translator of various works on political economy , and has arrived to the advanced age of seventy years or more . His style // eQnsequently partakes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period in which it was formed , thirty or lbrty years ago . In the introduction to this treatise it is called a text book , and it appears to have been designed as a guide for the author 's lectures on political finance . The first volume is successfully devoted to unfolding the true principles of taxation . The author leaves nothing unexplored , and traverses every country in which this branch of political economy has been cultivated , within the memory of the present generation . For although he also glances at more remote periods , and even at the financial management of the Greeks and Romans , he justly observes , that until lately the only care of financiers was , to devise means of extorting money or services for the necessities of government , without any regard to the justice or equality of taxes , and that consequently the community , and chiefly the lower orders , were oppressed beyond bearing . After enumerating what has been done and written in England , France , Italy , and Germany , as preparatory to developing the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam Smith the honor of having discovered a firm foundation for the sciences connected with political economy , and though his doctrines may not have been universally or unconditionally adopted , still he and his successors , Torrens and Ricardo in England , Say in France , Sismondi in Italy , and Sartorius , Kraus , Soden and others in Germany , are represented as the fathers of a revolution in opinion , which had become practically indispensable by the uncommon expenditures of the late war . The enormous debts thus caused coula not be met by the old slovenly method of an unequal and unjust taxation . The author , after having explained at length the ob*jects of political finance , treats of the science under three distinct heads ; first , as relating to the means of defraying the public expenses ; secondly , the public demands or expenditures ; thirdly , the mode of regulating income and expenses , with comparative views of the two . We do not mean to notice the judicious illustrations with which the author has adorned each of these heads . In two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usually convincing power , but he is generally strong and pointed . The following remarks pertaining to this topic are sound and of general application . // The principles , ' he observes , by which the impositb*n of taxes are regulated , are partly dictated by justice , partly derived from po* litical economy , and partly discovered as beneficial by the science of finance itself . Justice demands , that the taxes be indispensable , or that without them no provision can be made for the real Wants of the Commonwealth ; that they are useful for those who are taxed , or that no one be subjected to a tax for purposes from which can result no advantage to him either directly or indirectly ; that there shall be equality , or a just proportion in the division , so that the share of each individual be measured by his participation in the general advantages thus obtained for the Commonwealth , which will be according to the extent of his abilities , or of his property , protected by the salutary regulations of the state ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the payment of his tax , than that which he is to gain by the same . Political economy requires , that neither the whole sum of the taxes to be imposed encroach upon the capital stock of the nation , nor that the capital stock of each individual be affected by his share of the taxes , but that they may be paid out of his clear income ; that the tax do l*ot operate against the creation or augmentation of the public wealth , by weakening or destroying its causes ; that it take from the citizen as little as possible above the receipts of the treasury , consequently that the collection be easy , cheap , and as direct as possible ; that it inter** fere no more with personal liberty than is unavoidable ; that the amount of the taxes be not demanded in such large sums as to take a long time for the contributors to collect them , and that the taxes be , as rapidly as may be , received , and expended for their purpose , so that they shall not linger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but quickly return into circulation . The science ofjinrmce prescribes for itself as rules of beneficial tendency in levying taxes , that their amount and the time when they will be receives may be foreseen with exactness and certainty , such taxes having the preference as are certain and determined in quality and quantity , and whose pay days are fixed and coincide with the times , when payment becomes easy and convenient to the contributor ; that no op* portunity or temptation exist for evading the taxes or smuggling ; and that they may be collected by as few persons , and with as little cost as possible . All these principles , dictated by justice , political economy , and the science of finance , are in complete harmony , and reciprocally aid and support each other . ' In the application of these principles the author examines , as an experienced political economist , the funds out of which taxes may . be paid . Under this name he comprehends the aggregate of all useful things possessed by man , and distinguishes the internal funds , or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external , or the goods and money which he owns , though he considers the first only so far an object of political finance , as they serve to acquire the latter . When such funds are designed as a means for creating other funds , he calls them capital stock , and their produce , revenue . Having explained the nature of capital stock , and the consequences of its being impaired , he concludes that no state can assure itself of a permanent income from taxes , except it be paid out of the clear revenue of capital stock . It is worth while to observe the unhappy consequences , which would follow a taxation absorbing the whole , or the most of the clear national revenue , and how indispensable it is for the welfare of a nation , that taxes take only as small a part of the same as possible . But the policy of finance extends farther . It is not time to be satisfied , when the general mass of the national revenue is found competent to bear the taxes , but particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some members of the community shall not pay them out of their capital stock , when others pay only such a small part of their clear revenue , that they remain able to increase their capital in a greater proportion , while that of the poorer class diminishes . This consideration leads the author to a nice distinction between revenue and income , the former term being confined to the clear produce of capital stock , and the other comprehending all other methods by which one person may appropriate to himself the capital stock of another . Two fundamental maxims of taxation are laid down ; first , that all taxes are to be so imposed and divided , that every one may pay them out of his clear income ; and , secondly , that they only amount to the smallest possible part of this income . In applying his principles of taxation , Mr Von Jakob distinguishes the payments in kind from those in money , the personal from the real , and the direct from the indirect taxes . In the first he includes forced services , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiih , even those for military purposes , and that it is always preferable to change services into monied contributions . He declares himself opposed to all personal taxes , among which he enumerates the singular ones on Jews , heretics , bachelors , and beards , a under Peter First of Russia . Taxes on real property can not be imposed without great danger of inequality , or of totu*hing // the capital stock , and the same difficulty exists with taxes on ruoveahies . He rejects tithes , and teaches the regulation of taxes o* real and personal property , according to the clear income of each , under three different heads ; first , taxes on rent of the soil ; secondly , on interest of all kinds of capital ; and thirdly , on the revenue of skill and labor . The illustration of each of these divisions abounds with many excellent and always practical observations . On the subject of direct and indirect taxation , and the importance of combining the two into a well organised system , Mr VQIi Jakob speaks as follows . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we look at the manner in which it is imposed in most countries , as lately represented by Mr Prunner . But the question is , whether this does not admit of amendment , and whether a judicious combination of direct and indirect taxes may not be consistent with the principles of a just and equal taxation , or attain the end of a good system of iniposts with more certainty , than when we confine ourselves to one of these methods ? I hope to have resolved this problem inj he affirmative . If the whole of the clear income could be explot*d without oppressive measures , and also the payment of every person 's share at the right time could be secured , the tax on income might be the only one . But it is quite impossible to ascertain the clear income of an individual with cer .. tainty or with a near approach to the truth . It may be conjectured only to a certain extent , and the most of the statements and the result of the valuations remain more or less remote from truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may appear , is still far from being so in reality . This inequality is owing not only to defective valuations , but to the constant fluctuations of income . It changes yearly with some , with others monthly or weekly . And since the tax must at any rate be permanent for some time , it must be unequal in its effect . The more we attempt to accommodate it to these changes , the more the labor and trouble in its division and collection increase , without obtaining the end of our efforts . In particular , to collect from the poorer class a tax on income would be attended with great difficulties . In this branch of taxes , as in all direct taxation of any consequence , it is impossible to avoid remngnts or arrears , the forcible collection of which , notwithstanding the harshness of such measures , generally costs more , than the amount thus collected , and the greater part must be finally given up . Thus taxes on income can not remain the only resource , esp*-chilly to a commonwealth in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has great public demands . For , in order that // the inequality , which is inseparable from an income tax , may be *fldured , or not perceived , one is obliged to assess it in such a panner as to be assured , that nothing is touched but the clear inconi* of individuals , and that this is affected only in such a degree , that the tax can be easily paid . The result is , that though the income , in reality small , is not taxed too high , but in its just proportion , the larger clear income , which appears to be far too little in the tax list , because it could not be discovered , escapes much of its just tax . This fault is inevitable . Will you thrust yourself into the secrets of individuals , and espy the income of every citizen with exactness* you have to resort to measures highly vexatious to the public . The country will be filled with discontent and murmur , the labor and expenses of the inquisitive researches will overbalance the advantages thus gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you confine yourself to classifications or external signs , and follow in your valuations the rules of equity and liberality , even then a great part of the clear income unavoidably escapes . Between this Scylla and Charybdis no passage remains . Among these imperfections a wise financial policy can find no other way , than to choose that method by which every one is sure Dot to be , injured , and which provokes not the hatred of the taxed citizen by oppression . But at the same time other means must be tried to restore to just proportions this inequality , and to take from those , whom the income tax leaves either untouched , or not sufficiently bu*hened , in so me other way as much as they probably would have had to pay , if their income had entered the tax list to its full extent . This seems to be best obtained by a tax judiciously laid on consumption , or regulated by the expenses of the contributors . All taxes on consumption may be ranged in two classes , according to their different objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment , or the wants of humanity ; the second relates to the public services , or advantages , which we enjoy from the protection of government. * Commonly , the first class only is understood by what is named tax on consumption ; but the htter is of the same nature with the first . In regard to this , when a government takes no more than a just payment for such public matters , acts , or services , from the individuals , who receive the same , they are not to be considered as taxes . But when the government takes not only the cost , but exceeds it greatly , this additional pay is nothing else than a tax on consumption . Taxes of this class may be found in court and register fees ; in the price paid for public convenience , such as posts , turnpike roads , canals , locks , bridges , lighthouses ; in contributions for the use of public instruction to schools and churches ; in corporation expenses ; in fees which goveminent takes for diplomas , and similar writings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All taxes of this description may be // justified , if they are adapted to the probable income of those who consume such services , but they are to be rejected , if they are imposed blindly , and only because an opportunity is found , to 4eina*d money . ' The author proceeds to a minute examination of all these various sources of taxation , in which he evinces great extent of research , and a discriminating judgment . He also goes into a close investigation of the first , or principal class , to which the name of taxes on consumption is often exclusively given , and for the regulation of this class of taxes it is to be kept in mind , that their object is either to remove the inequality produced by the imperfection of the income tax , or to supply the defects of an income tax , which is too low , or to ta*k e. the place of such a tax with those who remain untouched by it . One caution is specially recommended , which is , that all indirect taxes be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : mornent when it reaches the hands of the consumer . For if an indirect tax on consumption is paid long before this period , the goods are not only enhanced in price by the interest of the capital paid for taxes , hut the merchant , or manufacturer , incurs also the risk of paying taxes for articles , which he can not sell , because they will spoil before the opportunity of a market arrives . Such is the nature of consumable goods , however , that this rule can not be rigidly adhered to , but a wise and just government will always keep it in view , as far a it can he made practicable . Such is a very imperfect outline of Mr Von Jakob 's remarks on the intricate subject of taxation . In this sketch we have done little justice to his learning or his researches . The immense fund of knowledge , which he has collected , respecting the modes of levying taxes in the different countries of Europe , is at the same time curious and highly important to the practical statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another part of his work , are here translated , not so much on account of anything original in them , as of their practical good sense , and the clearness with which the evils of an undue resort to this means of revenue are pointed out . Paper money , ' says the writer , can retain its nominal value ; so long only as it may be extended at pleasure at its full price . To effect this , a government may contrive many artificial methods , but all of them will finally fail , if it is not willing or able to pay the // *rt*h hi full , without hesitation or restriction , for ev*ry piece of *iaper money which can not be redeemed at par . If , tei*Wiwe , in time of peace , paper money , emitted with caution and prud4mce , may be of good service to the state , and save large sums of ready money , still , times of pressing difficulties are not those in which a government should resort to this measure , as is clearly evinced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money will soon sink below its nominal vahie , especially if the country be the theatre of war . Every one , who receives it in full from government , loses the whole depr*ciation experienced during the time he keeps it . Since such paper . rnoitey always sinks lower and lower , every person who expends it in mccession is a loser , and these losses are distributed through the natibn in a manner quite unequal and beyond the reach of calculation . Never , therefore , ivill a sound financial policy seek the aid of paper money in war , or other cases of distress . A nation will ther*hy always suffer greater losses , than by any other method of provid*ng for the exigencies of war . The loss , which a government thus causes to the nation , is , in the first place , divided in a most irregular way . Government has not the distribution in its power , but leaves it to accident . Thus it is a true indiscrimin*t* pi1l*sge of the nation . Again , it is quite impossible for government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or very few can repair their damages ; many even know not when and how they have lost ; all that they know with certainty is , that they have become poor . Nay , every attempt of indemnification , instead of alleviating , only increases the injustice and the evil . If the *government raises the value of the depreciated paper money , the gain does not go to those who have lost by the depreciation , but to others who have lost nothing , and perhaps have gained much . Every artificial rise of depreciated paper is thus nothing more than a blind distribution of the raised amount among those , who happen at that moment to be in possession of the paper , or in the expectatioQ of such receipts . These gain , according to the sums which they possess , or which they have to receive in p*iyment of debts contracted in bad money . On the other side , those who owe paper money , which they have received at a low rate , lose by this method as much as the paper with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider paper money as a debt of the state , which is obliged to be repaid by raising the paper to its full metallic value . But this view seems quite erroneous . The state is ignorant what individuals , and how much each of them , have lost ; there is no possibility of a general liquidation , and consequently none of retribution . Would you say the state owes it to the public ? This amounts to nothing . The public is no other than the state itself ; both debtor and creditor would be united in // the same person ; thus the debt would disappcar . But this would only happen with justice , if all individuals had in equal proportion of their im*ome contributed to the debt , and since this is not the Lase , the project appears idle . The problem how those , who have sufl*red more than others , may be indemnified , remains unsolved . All that the government can do is to stop the evil consequences , and to eradicate the evil seed of the past mischief . Very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing as restoring the losses already incurred by paper currency , the author declines adventuring in defence of any plan for this purpose . To remove present evils , and prevent future ill consequences , is all that can rationally be attempted . Several methods , which have been proposed and tried , are examined by him , and their **25;57;TOOLONG and advantages clearly set forth . Among other methods he thus speaks of the following . A quite false method of removing the evils of paper money is that latterly adopted in some countries with great expense . It consists ifl the efforts of government to enhance the course of exchange , by drawing certain quantities of paper money out of circulation , with a view that from a diminution of its mass , an increase of its value must be the consequence . The following considerations will show that this is a mistaken , useless , and wasteful operation . I say a mistaken operation , because it is founded on the erroneous idea , that the state is able to repair the damages created by the falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered losses . Not only society does not get an indemnification by the rising of the course of exchange , hut on the contrary it experiences once more the whole train of evils , which it formerly suffered by its fall , only on an inverted scale . For those , who happen to have much paper money on hand , will profit by this measure without knowing how or why , and those who have none , but are to procure it for payment of debts contracted when the money was at a lower rate , must lose . Thus the rise of the value creates just as blindly a great revolution in fortunes , as formerly its fall . Again , I call the attempt usele*s , because , for reasons explained in different parts of this work , it does not , nor can it enhance the value of paper money . Should this follow from its diminution , provision ought at the same time to be made , that it remain the only circulating medium . That is , no coined money besides the paper ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those at the head of finances , and by many others , to be an advantage to the country , and of a beneficial influence on the value of paper money . Just the contrary , however , happens from the nature of circumstances . The influx of silver prevents the enhancement of paper money , notwithstanding // its diminution . For suppose eight hundred millions of paperdollars to be worth two hundred in silver , and suppose the government to withdraw two hundred millions of paper from circu* l&amp;*tion ; then but fifty millions of silver will take their place . In this case no change occurs in the sum of the circulating medium , because fifty millions of silver are equal to two hundred in paper . Here is the true cause , why the great sacrifices of the Austrian , Russian , and other governments have nowhere had the anticipated effect . Lastly , the operation is wasteful , because the money expended for raising the value of paper is totally and uselessly lost , aud the nation gains only a new burthen of interest . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for otherwise a new revolution in private fortunes would accompany the millions of a thus created useless public debt . ' In addition to the topics above discussed , Mr Von Jakob dwells at large on all the important sources from which pub .. lic revenue is usually derived . On the subject of managing the mint , he recommends that government should totally abstain not only from all profits , but even from deducting the expenses of coining , as in England ; and he also advances good reasons for entrusting the coinage of money under proper restrictions to individuals . He speaks of the organisation of post office establishments , public loans from banks and otherwise , providing for public defence by conscription and militia , and such other objects as immediately affect the revenue and disbursements of a nation . All his discussions are marked by liberal and extended views of political science , not less than by compass of learning , strength of argument , and depth of thought .                  @ @ @
