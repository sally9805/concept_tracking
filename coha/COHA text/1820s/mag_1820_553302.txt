txt ART . XVI. - *femoirs of Richard Lo*dl Edgeworth , begun bU hi mse ( f and concluded by his daughter *Prfaria Edgeworth . London , 2 vols. 8vo. 1820 . THE ordinary and easiest kind of biography contents itself *vitli relating the principal incidents of a life , with the more peculiar circumstances which accompany them ; sometimes venturing to guess at the motives of the man when they happen to lie pretty near the surface , and now and then pre // seating the features of his moral or intellectual character *vhuh stand birth most prominently . This sort of biography is entertaining enough , and is riot without its use ; histories of mcii , who have made themselves eminent , if they are but sufficiently minute and circumstantial , must do good ; not so much by direct instruction how to act in particular cases , as by their general influence upon our habits of thooght anti feeling . All men are not to be required or enabled to possess the force of mind or character , which gives to the few supremacy over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men remarkable for goodness or greatness , do great good in bringing us into close contact with beings of greater strength or higher elevation than ourselves , because the imitative prope*smty and fatuity of our nature is constantly at work in assimilating our characters to those with which we have the mOst frequent intercourse and the closest intimacy . If they , with whom we are most conversant , have stood in the upper places of society , and have given there the most striking proofs and examples of strong minds and good hearts , we naturally carry into the humbler concerns and interests of life something of the same feeling , and act there with more energy and disinterestedness . Common life , made up of common feelings and common events , must be the lot of most of us , and we shall probably go to our graves without finding occasion or need of such entire self-abandonment , thorough devotion to good purposes , and energy in conquering difficulties or resisting oppression , as we may find recorded in history ; but if we dwell upon such examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will strengthen and liberalize our characters , although we can not fill with our generosity and *firmness*so wide spheres of action or of fame . But there is another kind of biography , .  --  the history of the internal man , and this is the most useful and the most rare . It tells not merely the sayirgs and doings of him whose life it is relating , but his thoughts , arid feelings , and imaginations ; it teaches not only his actions , and the motives which led to those actions , but the state of mind and feeling which gave efficacy to the motives , and paints at large and to the very life , the thousand thoughts , and feelings , and propensities which make up the heart anti the man . The // study of this kind of biography is indeed useful , for it tells man something of his own nature , and , in some degree , does the work of that wearying , wasting experience , whose lessons we can not learn thoreughty until we pay for them , the ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its aspirations after impossible excellence , and all its longings after impossible happiness . Biography of this sort must necessarily he rare ; few men undertake to write their own lives , and of these few , but a small proportion have acuteness and discrimination to analyze thoughts and motives , and pourtray character distinctly , and a still smaller part have enough of the ambition which longs for notoriety , careless of what sort it be , to be willing to lay open to the world the ( deepest and darkest nooks of their own hearts , however ugly and loathsome may be the things which dwell therein . Johnson said somewhere , there was no man whose life would not be amusing and instructive , if it were exactly and fairly related . What an inestimable gift would he have made mankind , if he had left them a history of his own mind , a fair picture of his own heart ; with what absorbing interest and wonder should we of ordinary minds and common place characters have looked upon the growth an ( l workings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his passions and his fears . Rousseau and St. Augrstine have been perhaps the only men who have honestly endeavoured to tell the world what they were , with knowledge enough of human nature to fit them for the task . Of these men , the first was a madman of a peculiar kind ; believing himself an object of terror and hatred to the mighty ones of the earth , and of deep interest to all mankind , he knew every thing he wrote was read with avidity , and thought every thing he did became at once a matter of public curiosity . But his Confessions were written principally , because he looked upon himself as elevated above the rest of mankind by a universal superiority , by a greater capacity , not only for moral and intellectual excellence , but for vice and folly ; by an energy , which , in whatever direction it moved , went farther than common humanity could go ; and he thought himself alike approving his supremacy , in his highest intellectual efforts , in his spasms of zealous and disinterested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded him below the reptiles which crawl fot ' // a day , and die for ever . No one , whose heart is not hardened into rock nor polluted to its very core , can read his book without a shudder . The vice , the fiendishness , he describes with an ease and freedom that is almost exultation , is quite beyond the guilt or the conception of ordinary villains . As to St. Augustine 's Confessions , it is difficult to tell whether he was instigated to make tiiem by the vanity of telling the world how great he had been , even in vice , or as he himself says , by the wish of shewing forth to the glory of God , how great a saint lie had become from how great a sinner . The life of Mr. Edgeworth belongs exclusively to neither class of biography . The first volume was written by himself at the request of his children ; the second by Miss Edgeworth . His share of the work is characterized by an openness which seems the result of a wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and the progress of his opinions , which could throw any light upon the best means of acceleratilig and directing the growth of the human intellect , to which difficult and obscure subject lie had devoted much time and labour . He however does not succeed in doing all the good he intends ; he does not seem particularly gifted with the rare talent of discriminating character , and besides , his life was a various one , and in the course of it he became acquainted with many curious and distinguished persdns ; and he can not help giving some account of their characters , and anecdotes of all sorts , by way of illustrating their mode of thinking , speaking , and acting . As he luckily tells stories very well , this does not lessen at all the entertainment his book is calculated to afford , however it may affect its usefulness . The volume which his daughter wrote discovers , like all her works , exquisite tact in judging of character and motive , and uncommon power of pourtraying it strongly and distinctly . Her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but upon the whole , she is sufficiently candid and i*npartial , and so far as a thorough acquaint .. ance with his character was necessary to the accomplishment of her task she was abundantly qualified . During a long life she had been his best and most intimate friend : at once the principal object of his care , and the most effective assistant in his labours ; few have had such opportunities of judging another 's character as she enjoyed with regard to her father , and few have so much ability to improve such op. // Mr. Edgewortli seems to have had an active and versatile , perhaps an acute mind , but floL such commanding superiority of ' intellect as would rank him among the great men of his day . His character was well adapted to his situation , and both were calculated to give him as much happiness as either or both can give . At the head of a tam*ly sufficiently high in rank to give him access to what society he ( hose , he enjoyed in this respect the advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and pleasures which dwell in the middle ranks and accompany the common pursuits of life . His mind was sufficiently strong to save him from the depressing consciousness of inferiority , to etiaide him to attain some eminence , and exert considerable influence in the limited circle to which he confined himself ; and to labour successfully and usefully in the vocations to which circumstances called him ; hut he was not urged by the strength and extent of its powers to aspire after intellectual supremacy , to climb to the regiun of perpetual frost and barrenness , where fame 's proud temple ' stands . His feelings were in the same happy medium as his mind and his cii'cumstances . Of a gentle , affectionate , and confiding temper , he was loved well by his friends and loved them enough to interest himself in all that concerned them , but he had not the ardent , enthusiastic temperament , lie did not feel the craving need of strong affection which are apt to waste one 's life in hopes and wishes that can not be answered . rJ7here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ; he was not to he withstood by slight opposition or turned from his course by surmountable obstacles . Whatever he attempted he generally persevered in , to its thorough accomplishment , and quite to the end of his long life he was always intent upon some object of more or less public importance ; the days of his life were many and they were well used ; he never forfeited or lost the affection of those whom friendship or affinity made most dear to him ; he suffered not often noi* much from the inevitable evils of life , and upon the whole seems to have enjoyed a greater share of happiness than falls to the lot of most men . His family went to Ireland in the reign of queen Elizabeth , about 1583 , and we have an account of his genealogy from that day to the present with quite enough of detail ; not too much , however , as it happens to be very amusin* // In the Irish rebellion of 1642 the family cailie very near be . ing extinguished . Captain Edgeworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty at a distance from his castle , and the rebels took the opportunity to set fire to it at night , and to drag out his lady literally naked ; she , however , found a furze bush which ser ' ed her for a hiding-place until the rebels dispersed . The infant son and heir was taken from his cradle , and a rebel , holding him by the leg , was looking for some convenient corner of the castle to ( lash his brains out , when an Irish servant claimed the right of killing the young heretic himself as one of the family , and swore that he would plunge him up to the throat in a boghole , where the crows might have a chance to pick his eyes out , . - on the ground that a sudden death was too good for him . He accordingly seized the child , and ran off with hini to a neighbouring bog , and thrust him into the mud ; but when the rebels had retired , took him up and hid him so skilfully in a pannier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the rebel camp to Dublin . Things went on then in a common sort of a way for one or two generations to a certain captain John Edgeworth , who married somebody that died after a while and left him a young widower . Sometime after he was left a widower , he determined to return to reside in Ireland . On his way thither , he stopped a day at Chester , it being Christmas-day . He went to the Cathedral , and there lie was struck with the sight of a lady , who had a full blown rose in her bosom . This lady was Mrs Bridgman , widow of Mr. Edward Bridgman , brother to Sir Orlando Bridgman , the Lord Keeper . As she was coming out of church , the rose fell at Captain Edgeworth 's feet . The lady was handsome-so was the captain-he took up the rose and presented it with so much grace to Mrs. B*idgman , that , in consequence , they became acquainted , and were soon after married . ' vol. i. pp. 9 , 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The husband had a son by his first wife , and the wife a daughter by her first husband ; the young folks soon contrived to fall in love with each other without asking or at least without getting permission of the parents , ho , for some reason which does not appear , were opposed to the match , and by way of evading the English penal statutes against the run // ning away with an heiress , it was agreed that the lady should take her lover to church behind her upon horse-back and thus should run away with him , and by this means was their marriage effected . Their first son , Francis , was born before their joint ages amounted to thirty one years . Both of theparties had fortunes , and both were utterly ignorant how to take care of them . They had occasion to go to England soon after their marriage , and to procure the necessary money mortgaged an estate ; they put the proceeds into an Ol ) *fl stocking which was kept at the head of their bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contents soon began to be very low . At another time Capt . E. sold a house-lot in Dublin to purchase a high-crowned hat and feathers , which was then at the top of the mode . He lived in high company in London and was much at court ; upon some occasion king Charles insisted upon knighting him , and paid such gallant attention to Lady Edgeworth upon her presentation , that she thought proper to intimate to her husband that she had no inclination to receive the same sort of honour a second time ; nor did she ever appear at court again , though in the bloom of youth and beauty . This was an instance of strength of mind hardly reconcileable to the improvident temper she had shewn at setting out in life , but there was in her character a singular mixture of strength and weakness . Courageous beyond the habits of her sex in real danger , she was yet exceedingly superstitious , and easily alarmed by any thing which seemed like supernatural presence or agency . Of her courage Mr. Edgeworth gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was , on some sudden alarm , obliged to go at night to a garret at the top of the house , for some gunpowder , which wa* kept there in a barrel . She was followed up stairs by an ignorant servant girl , who carried a bit of candle without a candlestick , between her fingers . When Lady Edgeworth had taken what gunpowder she wanted , had locked the door , and was half way ( lown stairs again , she observed , that the girl had not her candle , and asked what she had done with it ; the girl recollected and answered , that she had left it " stuck in the barrel of black salt . " lady Edge worth bid her stand still , and instantly returned by herself to the room where the gunpowder *vas* found the candle as the girl had described-put her hand carefully underneath it-carried it safely out , and when // she got to the bottom of the stairs , dropped on her knees , and thanked God for their deliverance . ' vol. i. pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and Mr. Edgeworth 's graiidfaiher , was a great gamester , and sacrificed to this destructive passion much of his property . He left his affairs in such disorder that his soti. at his father 's death , eight years old , must have lost his * hole l ) rol ) eety but for the kindness and care of Mr. Pakenham , his guardian , by whose advice , at eighteen , he entered at the Temple and there made himself lawyer enough to recover a considerable part of his estate , which had been detained from him by some of his family . Mr. Edgeworth relates an anecdote respecting his father , which will remind our readers of an incident in Patronage ' that has been blamed and ridiculed , as exceedingly unnatural and even impossible . He told me a singular detection of fraud in one of the suits , in which he was engsged : a deed was produced against him , which was witnessed by a very old man , who was brought into court . His venerable aspect prepos*essed the court strongly in favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient servant of the Edgeworth family , and had been accustomed to transcribe papers for the gentleman who had executed the deed . He began , by declaring , that he had foreseen from the particuar circumstances of the deed , which went to disinherit the heir of the family , that the transaction might hereafter be brought into dispute ; he had therefore , he said , privately put a sixpence under the seal of the deed , which would appear if the seal were brokeuu . The seal was broken in open court , and the sixpence was found to he dated five years subsequent to the date of the deed ! - The deed being thus proved to be a forgery , my father gained his suit . vol. i. pp. 17 , 18 . Mr. Edgeworth was a very forward and rather a petulant child , but fortunately his mother was uncommonly sensible and determined . She had excellent notions upon education and did not suffer the execution of her plans to be impeded by the selfishness which would rather ruin a child than hear him cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious management . One day Mr. Edgeworth thought proper to fall into a violent rage with his elder brother and to throw at his head a box-iron which a maid who was ironing had just l*uid down ; // his brother avoided the blow by stooping , and thereby , in all probability , saved his life . The maids seized the young offender , dragged him ( lown stairs to his mother , and there entered a complaint with one accord and with becoming zeal and indignation . Mrs. Edgeworib seemed horroestruck , but said not a word to him in anger . She ordered every body out of the room except thyself , and then drawing me near her , she spoke to inc in a mild voice , but in a most serious manner . First , she explained to me the nature of the crime , which I had run the hazard of committing ; she told me. she was sure that I had no intention seriously to hurt my brother . and ( lid not know , that if the iron had hit my brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first shock , and whilst the horror of murder was upon me , my mother seized the moment , to conjure me to try in future to command my passions . I remember her telling me , that I had - an uncle by the mother 's side who had such a violent temper , that in a fit of passion one of his eyes actually started out of its socket . " You , " said my mother to me , " have naturally a violent temper : if you grow lip to be a man without learning to govern it , it will be impossible for you then to command yourself ; and there is no kiiowing what crime you may in a fit of passion commit , and how miserable yoa may in consequence of it become . You are but a very young child , yet I think you can understand me . Instead of speaking to you as 1 do at this moment , I might punish you severely ; but I think it better to treat you like a reasonable creature . My wish is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for you , so well as you can do it for yourself. ** As nearly as I can recollect , these were my mother 's words ; I am certain this was the sense of what she then said to me . Trite impression made by the earnest solemnity with which she spoke , never ( luring the whole course of my life was effaced from my mind . From that moment I determined to govern my tcmper . The determinations and the good resolutions of a boy of between five and six years old are not much to be depended upon , and I do not mean to boast , that mine were thenceforward uniformly kept ; but I am conscious , that my mother 's warning fiequently recurm 'd to me , when I felt the passion of anger rising within me ; and that both whilst I was a child , and after I became a man , these her words of early advice had most powerful and salutary influence in restraining my temper . ' vol. i. pp. 28- ' - SO . Mr. Edgeworth must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually giving of the facility with which // he acquired and maintained a superiority over his schoolfellows , prove thai his mind was prompt and active . After he left school he grew tired of literary pursuits , took to sporting and became a desperate hunter and an excellent shot . When he was quite a boy his elder brother died , so that he bi came the heir and the hope of the family ; much to his misfortune , as it became immediately important that so mmli care should be taken of his health and life that his strong constitution almost sunk under it . In his youth when about fourteen , rather a singular accident befel him ; he was married one evening while peifectl* guiltless of any intention of the sort . One of his sisters had just entered the holy state of matrimony , and the family were testifying their joy and the neighbours their sympathy , by balls , festivities , and carousings of all sorts . Mr. Edgcworth 's favourite partner at these wedding dances was the daughter of the curate from whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ceased , the young people retired to what was then called a raking pot of tea . A description of this Flibernian amusement I have given in another place . It is here sufficient to say , that it is a potation of strong tea , taken at an early hour in the morning , to refresh the spirits of those who have sat up all iiight . We were all very young and gay , and it was proposed by one of my companions , who had put a white cloak round his shoulders to represent a surplice , that he should marry me to the lady with whom I had danced . The key of the door served for a ring , and a few words of the ceremony , with much laughter and playfulness , were gabbled over . My father heard of this mock-marriage , and it excited great alarm in his mind . He was induced by his paternal fears to treat the matter too seriously , and he instigated a suit of jactitation of marriage in the ecclesiastical court to annul these imaginary nuptials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us No suspicion even was entertained of the young lady 's having any ( lesiga on my heart , or of my having obtained any influence in hers . All the publicity that was given to this child . ish affair was fortunately of no disadvantage to her ; on the con. trary , it brought her into notice among persons with whom she might not otherwise have been acquainted , an ( l she was afterwards suitanly married in her own neighbourhood . It was before I was sixteen , that I was thus married and divorced . I say married , because in the proceedings in this strange suit it was necessary to shew , that a marriage had been solemnized , or else there could have been no divorce . ' vol. i. pp. 70 , 71. // His next marriage was almost as singular , though of a different character . In 1761 , his father sent him to Oxford . A Mr. Elers , a retired barrister , lived in the neighbourhood , and Mr. Edgeworth , sen. who had long known him , wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elers advised him to do no such thing , as he had several daughters grown and growing up , who , as the world said , were pretty girls ; hut to whom he could not give fortunes that would make them suitable matches for Mr. Edgeworth 's son ; ' but the father persisted and the son fell in love with one of the daughters and engaged himself to her . He themi went to make a visit to Bath and there soon found out that his hand was bound faster than his heart ; the dissipation of a watering place cured him of all love very effectually , but he returned punctually to the lady and true to his word offered her his hand , and true to his conscience told her with what feelings ; but she , probably thinking if he had loved her once lie might again , chose to marry him , and away they went to Gretna Green before he was twenty . At Bath he became accidently acquainted with Sir Francis Delaval , one of the most fashionable and dissipated men of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , as he does indeed of every one whom he has occasion to mention . His acquaintance with Sir Francis arose from his discovery of the tricks of a juggler then in Bath , which Sir Francis thought no one had ingenuity to see through but himself , and he invited Mr. Edgeworth to pass some weeks at his house , where he meant to play them off himself upon the public . At first our joint exhibition of wonders occcupied my attention . After arranging our contrivances in the house in Downing Street , where Sir Francis lived ; by preconcerted confederacy , we had it in our power to execute surprising feats . Company of all sorts crowded our exhibitions . Sir Francis was known to every body ; but I , as a stranger , was not suspected of being combined with the arch fiend in deceiving the spectators . Feats , physically impossible without such assistance , were performed by seeming magic , and many were seriously alarmed by the prodigies which they witnessed . The ingenuity of some of the contrivances , that were employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who sought mere amusement , but of men of letters and science , who came to our e*liibitions . This cir // eumstance was highly grateful to Sir Francis , and advantageou s to me . I , by these means , became acquainted with many men of eminence , to whom I could not at that period of my life have otherwise obtained familiar access . Among the number were Dr. Knight , of the British Museum ; Dr. Watson ; Mr. Wilson ; Mr. Espinasse , Ihe Electrician ; Foote , the author and actor , a man , who , beside his well known humour , possessed a considerable fund of real feeling ; Macklin , and all the actors of the day . ' vol. i. pp. 122 , 123 . Once when Sir Francis had occasion to stand for the Borough of Andover , a strenuous opposition took place , which made every vote valuable ; one voter alone declared that he would not vote at all , and adhered to his resolution in spite of Sir Francis ' efforts to win him . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinate in his neutrality , had a passion for seeing sights , and made it a point to go to London when any thing extraordinary was exhibiting there , but bad nevei* been able to see a fire-eater . Sir Francis proposed to carry him immediately to town , and to shew him the most accomplished eater of fire that had ever appeared . The wary citizen of Andover suspected some trick , and could by no means be prevailed upon to go up to town . Our staunch candidate , never at a loss for resource , despatched instantly a trusty servant to London , requesting Angelo to come to his assistance . Among his various accomplishments , Angelo possessed the art of fire.eating in the utmost perfection ; and though no pecuniary consideration could have induced him to make a display of his talents in such an art , yet to oblige Sir Francis , to whom all his friends were enthusiastically devoted , Angelo complied . A few hours after he received the request , he thundered into Andover in a chaise and four , express , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obdurate voter saw this gentleman come down , and with such eNpedition , on purpose to entertain him , he began to yield . But when Angelo filled his mouth with torrents of flame , that bum st from his lips and nostrils , and seemed to issue even front his eyes ; when these flames changed to various colours , and seemed continually to increase in volume and intensity ; our vuter was quite melted : he implored Angelo to run no farther hazard ; he confessed , " that he did not think the devil himself could cast out such torrents of fire and flame , and that he heliev*d Sir Francis had his Satanic Majesty for his friend , otherwise Sh ' Francis never could have prevailed upon him to break the vow which he had made not to vote for him . ' vol. i. pp. 129 , 130. // The following anecdote will indicate to one class of our readers an alarming state of their profession in England . The remainder of the extract gives us no favourable impression of the constitution of fashionable society in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Francis ' attorney 's bill was yet to be discharged . It had been running on for many years , and though large sums had been paid on account , a prodigious balance still remained to be adjusted . The affair came before the King 's Bench . Among a variety of exorbitant and monstrous charges there appeared the following article . " To being thrown out of the window at the George Inn , Andover .  --  to my leg being thereby broken. -. to surgeon 's bill , and loss of time and business*alI in the service of Sir F. B. Delaval. - Five hundred pounds . " When this curious item came to be explained , it appeared , that the attorney had , by way ef promoting Sir Francis ' interest in the borough , sent cards of invitation to the officers of a regiment in the town , in the name of the mayor and corporation , inviting them to dine and drink His Majesty 's health on his birthday . He , at the same time , wrote a similar invitation to the mayor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment . The two companies met , complimented each other , eat a good dinner , drank a hearty bottle of wine to His Majesty 's health , and prepared to break up . The commanding officer of the regiment , being the politest man in company , made a handsome speech to Mr. Mayor , thanking him for his hospitable invitation and entertainment . " No , colonel , " replied the mayor , " it is to you that thanks are due by me and by my brother aldermen for your generous treat to us . " The colonel replied with as much warmth as good breeding would allow : the mayor retorted with downright anger , swearing that he would not be choused by the bravest colonel in His Majesty 's service. - " Mr. Mayor , " said the colonel , " there is no necessity for displaying any vulgar passion on this occasion . Permit me to shew you , that I have here your obliging card of invitation . " - " Nay , Mr. Colonel , here is no opportunity for bantering , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was observed , that , notwithstanding an attempt to disguise it , both cards were written in the same hand by some person , who had designed to make fools of them all . Every eye of the corporation turned spontaneously upon the attorney , who , of course , attended all public meetings . His impudence suddenly gave way , he faltered and betrayed himself so fully by his confusion , that the colonel , in a fit of summary justice , threw him out of the window . For this Sir Francis // Delaval was charged five hundred pounds. - Whether he paid the money or not , I forget . Some years before I was acquainted with him , Sir Francis , with Foote for his coadjutor , had astonished the town as a conjuror , and had obtained from nuinbeis v , ast belief in his necroniantic powers . This confidence he gained* chiefly by relating to those who consulted him the past events of their lives ; thence he easily persuaded them , that he could foretell what would happen to them in future ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foote chose for the scene of their necromancy a large and dark room in an obscure court , I believe in Leicester Fields . The entrance to this room was through a very long , narrow , winding passage , lighted up by a few dint lamps . The conjurer was seated upon a kind of ottoman in the middle of the room , with a huge drum before him , which contained his familiar spirit . He was dressed in the eastern fashion . with an enormous turban , and a long white beard . His assistant held a white wand in his hand . and with a small stick struck the drum from time to time , from which there issued a deep and melancholy sound . His drogoman answered the questions that were asked of him by his visitants , while the conjuror preserved the most dignified silence , only making signs , which his interpreter translated into words . When a question was asked , the visitant was kept at a ( distance from the drum , from which the oracle seemed to proceed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of his associates , who , * fact , were all the men of gallantry of his day , furnished him with innumerable anecdotes of secret intrigues , which were some of them known only to themselves and their paramours . Foote had acquired a considerable knowledge of the gallantries of the city ; and the curiosity , which had been awakened and gratified at the west end of the town by the disclosure of certain ridiculous adventures in the city , gave to the conjurer his first celebrity . It was said , that he had revealed secrets that had been buried for ye*s in obscurity . Ladies as well as gentlemen among the fools of quality were soon found , to imitate the dames of the city in idle and pernicious curiosity ; and under the sanction of fashion , the delusion spread rapidly through all ranks . Various attempts were made to deceive the conjurer , under false names , and by a substitution of persons ; but lie in general succeeded in detecting these , and his fame stood at one time so high , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly . his method of obtaining sudden influence over the incredulous was by telling them some small detached circumstances , which had happened to them a short time betore , and which they thought could scarcely be // known to any body but themselves . This he efl'ected by means of an agent , whom he employed at the door as a porter . This man was acquainted with all the intriguing footmen in L1ondon , an ( l whilst he detained the servants of his master 's visitants as they entered , he obtained from them various information , which was communicated by his fellow servants through a pipe to the drum of the conjurer . It was said , that in the course of a few weeks , while this delusion lasted , more matches were made , and more intrigues were brought to a conclusion , by Sir Francis Delaval and his associates , than all the meddling old ladies in London could have effected or even suspected in as many months . Among the marriages was that of Lady Nassau Paulet with Sir Francis himself . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as it was accomplished , the conjurer prudently decaniped , before an inquiry too minute could ne made into his supeinatural powers . Lady Nassau Paulet had a very large fortune , I believe eighty thousand pounds , of all which Sir Francis Delaval became possessed by this marriage . Her ladyship died soon afterwards , and her fortune did not long continue to console her husband for her loss . The whole of the eighty thousand pounds he contrived soon to dissipate . ' vol i. pp. 133-139 . The following anecdote of George III . contains , we imagine , one of the very few pleasantries which will be recorded in the chronicles of that worthy monarch . The king ( George Ill. ) had bespoke an instrument , which he was peculiarly desirous to obtain ; he had allowed Ranisden to name his own time , but , as usual , the work was scarcely begun at the period appointed for delivery ; however , when at last it was finished , he took it down to Kew in a postchaise , in a prodigions hurry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his . JPlajesty was at home . The pages and attendants in waiting expressed their surprise at such a visit : he however pertinaciously insisted upon being admitted , assuring the page , that , if lie told the king that Ramsden was at the gate , his Majesty would soon shew that he would be glad to see him . He was right , he was let in , and was graciously received . His Majesty , after examining the instrument carefully , of which he was really a judge , expressed his satisfaction , and turning gravely to llamsden , paid him some compliment upon his punctuality . " I have been told , Mr. Ramsden , " said the King , " that you are considered to be the least punctual of any man in England ; you have brought home this instrument on the very day that was appointed . You have only mistaken the year !

A number of curious anecdotes are contained in these volumes , relative to Mr. Edgeworth 's mechanical pursuits , particularly to the ad ventures of a one-wheeled chaise . Some anecdotes of Miss Seward appear to have die effect of throwing a new light on that lady 's character , in the important point of veracity . But we can not spare z*oom to follow Mr. Edgewortli thi*ough his long and vari ' ) u5 life . He resided principally in Ireland , and in the latter part of his lil* entered into Parliament there , arid became an active and useful public man . He Iireser*ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much harm , with which it was threatened in the rebellion of 1798 ; less , however , by his talents , than by the weight of his character , by the influence he derived from his persevering and unimpeachable integPity . The work upon education was written by himself and his daughter conjointly . But how this was managed we are sorry that we do not learii precisely from what is said of it . It is a singular thing for two strong minds to act simultaneously arid upon the same subject , without interfering at all with each other . We carl hardly imagine one pursuing the train of thought which the other had commenced , and coming to the result which the other had only approached . It seems probable that one must have sketched the outlines , which the other filled up , or else that each wrote entirely a distinct part of the work . We have often heard that he had a great share in the composition of the novels and tales his daughter has published9 but while Miss Edgeworth evidently wishes to give all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even from her account of it , that he only revised , and perhaps corrected what she wrote . We however feel somewhat anxious that Miss Edgeworth should publish some work of sufficient magnitude to test her powers now that she stands alone and unaided . If it be decidedly inferior to those with which she has already // favoured the world , we shall be exceedingly disappointed , for at present we can not believe tnat any great l ) ortion of the talent , which has made all her works , even the most trifling , so amusing and instructive , lies buried with her father . Mr. Edgewr h was constantly anxious to collect facts , and to draw froni them rational and practicable rules with regard to education ; and whatever may have been his success , he deserves well at the world for having given his attention to a subject , at once so important and so much neglected ; the work which he and his daughter published is the only one we kw*v , at any talent or magnitude , exclusively devoted to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the very phrase seems almost unwarrantable ; yet nothing is more certain , indeed nothing is more universally admitted , than that childhood and youth commonly fix the character both of the heart and the mind for life , and perhaps the destiny for ever . It is then singular , that sensible men have so rarely exerted their powers upon a subject , which deserves their attention Si ) much , and would repay it so well . Almost nothing has been done in watching the growth of the mind with a view to direct or a ( 'celerate it , and therefore little is known with certainty of the causes which operate to increase or discil*line its powers , to hasten or retard its development . The book to which we alluded above is a very useful and valuable one ; with some of the views and theories it contains we can not agree1 but it is full of sound sense , and gives the re*ult of a great deal of patient and judicious observation . The tree is known by its fruits , and Mr. Edgewontli 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which attended his labours in the instance of his daughter Maria ; whom , we do not hesitate to say , lie ai ( Ie ( l nature in making one of the lirst and most useful vvomen upon earth ; an honour to her sex and a great good to mankind . In some of her tales , particularly the Good Governess , ' arid in her smaller books for children , she has stated an ( l illustrated many of her father 's principles , *nd the practical result which may be expected from them , every book she has published has shewn , in proving the extent of her powers , and the excellent use she is dispose ( l to make of them . Much improvement has been effected of late years in educatibn , but much remains to be done . The great mistake in the systems in practice here , especially in female education , // is , we think , this , that it is made much more an object to fill , than to strengthen the uuitid . Tue memory does iuoi'e than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be learned b* rote , but lie should too be often urged to an active and vigorous exertion of the intellect generaliy . History , geography , i ) ei'haps laguages , and the elements of SOnIC sciences are taught , and the pupil is thought to become sensible , just *ii l ) ropoI*tioui as lie becomes knowing while in fact no one faculty of the mind is profited by such a course of study , cxcepting the memory . All the things which are now learned should certainly be taught , but they should not be considered , either by learner or instructer , as chiefly good in aud for themselves . It uiunst be always remembered by the master , arid , if possible , ( listiuictly explained to . and strongly impressed upon the pupil , that facts are principally awl HLdee ( l almost solely valuable , when they are made materials for thought . It is one thing to add to the stores of the intellect , and another to enlarge its resources . Not unfrequez*tly have minds ofordinary strength been weakened and cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is dauigerous to a common min ( l to have authorities constantly at hand , leading-strings at every step ; for the exercise of judgment is an effort which will not be made , unless there be a call for it , and the power of judgment , if left unemployed and inactive , will sleep and die . No matter how much learning be acquired , but more should he ( lone by exercises in composition , or in some similar way- , to methodize and turn to good account the knowledge *vliichi is gained ; to enrich and chasten the imagination , to sharpen the judgment , invigorate the power of ratiocination , and give force and activity to the whole intellect . By the present system , or rather by that exclusively in use some years since , a sensible boy or girl might pass the most improving an ( l important years of life at school , and be very industrious there , and yet come home possessed of less intellectual power , than when they went ; -. hecause , ( luring the greatest part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ po**er ' of combining ideas and of examining trutlw , so far frou*i being assisted and cultivated , were not even suffered to have their natural growth , but were carefully repressed and kept in a state of forced inaction , lest the attention should he impeded in its endeavour to fasten facts upon the memory . And this may be one reason . // why a boy 's success at school is a very unsafe criterion , by which to judge of his future intellectual rank ; a strong mind will act ,  --  . wilI put forth its power iii some direction or other , and a child , who is gifted with an ardent imagination and an active mind , may find it far more difficult to direct and fi his attention upon an object which does not interest him , aud to chain down his other faculties , than a boy who is really duller and weaker . If the object of education be general improvement , there can be no doubt which of these systems should be adopted , unless impro*ement means the palsying , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the using of knowledge ; and it its object be to increase OUP power of amusing , interesting , and influencing those about us , there can be as little question . So far as colloquial talent is a good thing , we all know what exceeding dull *oi'k it is to listen to a conversation made up of other men 's shreds arid patches , and how gladly we fly from one who talks truisms arid sage remarks , which he can neither appreciate nor maintain , to intercourse with a mind which acts for itself in fearlessness and independence ; which habitually forms its own opinions , and kn ) ws upon what grounds . Intellectual strength and intellectual wealth generally go together in some degree , for the strongest mind can ; mot act without materials , and none but a mind of some strength can make large acquisitions , but they are not identically the same thing , and but little experience in life is needed to teach , that force and activity of mind are far more efficient in giving their possessor eminence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon said , knowledge is power , ' he referred to its effect upon mankind at large , and it is trite that scientific and philosophical knowledge have given man a mastery over the elements , and bowed to his bidding earth , sea , and air , hut the maxim certainly will not bear a very close application to individuals . We might have given our readers more amusement by making this article consist rather more of extracts , but it would be difficult to give , by a few instances a fair impression of Mr. or Miss Edgeworth 's mani*re de racanter ; and after all the book will owe much of the popularity it must acquire to the anecdotes , with which it abounds , and which are exceedingly well told , and illustrative of the characters of many singular or celebrated persons . We believe and hope that it // will be reprinted in this town , and then our readers can judge for themselves of its character and profit by the various talent it displays .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
