HESE passages of scripture , my brethren , have been chosen for the purpose of maintaining and illustrating a point , previously determined on as the subject of this discourse - namely - the importance of the union /z/ The institution to which we belong was founded to promote this union . To inculcate its importance , therefore , appeared to me a very fit subject for the present occasion : and the passages of scripture recited , seem to present the point which I am to pressj in a manner /z/ highlj- favouraMe to my purpose . They serve to sliow thi.t the great legislator of the Jews , and the great apostle of the Gentiles , were both eminent for the ; union of piety and science . For piety , even among inspired men , they were certainly eminent . Moses is denominated , by way of emphasis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the Lord spake unto Moses , face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend ; " and that " there arose not a prophet since in Israel , like unto Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face . " His whole history shows , that his intercourse with GOD , his devotion to the divine glory , and his benevolence to the children of his people , were of the most extraordinary kind ; and of course , that his measure of sanctilication was peculiarly great . This holy man was , at the same time , a distinguished proficient in all the learning of his day . Educated as the son of Pharoah 's daughter , he would of course have the advantage of the best schools of Egypt , then the most distinguished seat of science in the world : and the singuliir attainments which he made in these schools is attested in the text , which tells us that Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians ' ' - Whatever they could teach , he had learned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and in deeds . " Though not an eloquent speaker , yet his xvordsj as well as his deeds were mighty . No doubt the substance of what he said is here , as it always ought to be , chiefly regarded . Yet DISCOURSE I. a the criticks in the Hebrew language tell us , that his very style is characterized by its peculiar purity and excellence : and many of you know that he is quoted as an example of the sublime in writing , by Longinus , whose judgment on this subject has so long been considered as a standard . Such then was Moses - eminently holy , and eminently learned . Such was the man honoured of GOD to deliver his chosen people from bondage , to receive his law at Sinai , to establish ti e religious institutions and found the civil government of tiie Hebrew nation . Of the distinguished piety of the apostle Paul - distinguished , you will remember , among inspii'ed men , for others are not to cl im even a comparison here - it is hardly necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third heaven - caugfit up into paradise - and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter . " He seemed indeed to live in heaven , while yet on earth . His whole soul , with all its enlarged foculties , was incessantly on the stretch , in contempliting , admiring , and describing the wonders of the plan of redemption ; and in devising and executing schemes for extending the Redeemers kingdom , and promoting the glory of GOD on earth . He laboured more abundantly in his Master 's cause , than any of the other apostles . He counted not his life dear unto himself , *-if he might finish his ministerial course with joy . While he earnestly desired ' ' to depart and to be with Christ/ as " far better " than continuing in this vvorl , /z/ he was still willing to continue ; - to endure every privation , to suffer , and labour , and be persecuted , and reviled , and to seal his testimony with his blood , that he might propagate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour 's love . Yet this man , who " was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles , " esteemed himself the chief of sinners , " less than the least of all saints , and not meet to be called an apostle . " By this deep humility he rose high in the school of Christ . Verily , it seems that one who could be what Paul was , and yet estimate himself as he did , must be as deeply sanctified as any of the corrupted race of Adam ever was . This man had been sent from his native city to Jerusalem , for his education ; had been " brought up at the feet of Gamaliel , " then the most renowned Jewish doctor ; aud there is every reason to believe that , as " he profited beyond many his equals " in years , in the Jewish religion , so that he surpassed them , also , in Jewish erudition . But beside this , his quoting of the Greek poets ; his allusion to their philosophers and their doctrines ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning ; his simple and touching eloquence ; his sublime descriptions and pathetic sentiments ; all mark the superiority of his genius , and the extent and variety of his knowledge . Accordingly we find - and it is worthy of remark - that the same ancient heathen critick , who mentions Moses among the authors of the sublime in writing , places Paul in the same class . " &#9632; ' " See note A at the end of the volume . /q/ Such then was the apostle Paul - eminent for piety , and eminent for learning . And his success in spreading the gospel was , probably , greater than that of all the other apostles united . He was honoured , too , to write a far larger portion , than any other individual , of the New-Testament . Nearly a third part of the whole came , under the guidance of inspiration , from his pen . To demonstrate , as it would seem , that the power was all of GOD , our Saviour chose his first twelve apostles from illiterate men , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procured for it its first acceptance : and then , to honour the established order of nature , which is nothing else than his own order , he cliose one man , possessing the best endowments and attainments , and him he used to extend his kingdom and his triumphs , more , it is probable , than all the rest . It is apparent then , that both in founding the Jewish state , and in establisliing the Christian church , the instruh.cntality chiefly employed and honoured , was the instrumentality of men conspicuous for the union of piety and science . Moses , the man of GOD , was in all the wisdom of the Egyptians . " Paul , the great apostle of the Gentiles , * was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel . " Now as the Deity always adapts means to ends with infinite wisdom , and we here see what were the instruments which he actually employed , when the greatest /z/ ends were to be effected under his immediate appointment and guidance , it is manifest that the high importance , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and science , is vouched and ratified by divine authority . Let us then consider , a little in detail , some of the facts and principles , by which the importance of this union may be illustrated and enforced . I. It is this union which perfects , as far as it can be perfected in this world , the nature of man . The two great classes of mental powers are , the intellectual and moral . In the primitive perfect state of man , these different faculties were duly balanced , and had that just and mutual influence on each other which was calculated to raise our nature to its highest point of elevation , in the scale of intelligent being . We know from the temptation which prompted the lii*st transgression , that the desire of knowledge was then strong . We also know , that while man retained his perfection of rectitude , all his knowledge mu ; t have been subservient to moral use and improvement . It follows , necessarily , that the more he knew , the more extensively would he be pieparcd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail , from his perfect holiness , to employ all his knowledge for this high ) ur ) Ose . The complete reverse of this is now witnessed . Man has lost by his fall the moral image of his Creator , while he has retained , if not perfectly , yet in great vigour , his intellectual powers . Hence those powers are sometimes /q/ seen in much strength and with great improvement , while he remains destitute of all moral excellence . Men have occasionally appeared , who seemed to possess , at once , the talents and the depravity of demons . On the other side , unquestionable goodness has sometimes been seen , in alliance with great weakness , and great ignorance . But , let it be well observed , when eminent piety and eminent knowledge are conjoined in the same individual , then the right balance , proportion and order of the human faculties are restored ; then man regains the true elevation of his character ; then he is , in the exact degree in which this union takes place , brought back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as this is the fact , in regard to individuals , so it follows , since societies are made up of individuals , that whenever a society is composed of those who possess this character , and just in proportion as it is composed of them , it becomes truly excellent . It exhibits man , in. his social character , amiable and dignified . It renders communities eminently happy and respectable . It gives them an approximation - very imperfect indeed , but still most desirable - to the perfect society of heaven ; where intelligence and holiness are united , in the most eonsummate degree . The statement just offered seemed too important not to be made prominent , by a distinct presentment . It includes , I am sensible , a part of whui I am now more particularly to explain - /z/ II . That the union of piety and science is calculated to preserve each from abuse , and to carry each to its highest point of im ) rovement . Piety , enlightened by science , is not only most likely to be preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ignorant piety often runs ; but its sphere of action is greatly enlarged ; its incitements and its resources arc multiplied . It is of the nature of all genuine piety to turn every thing to its own improvement ; to make every object and subject minister to serious reflection , and the devout feelings of the heart ; to see the displays cf the divine perfections in all which it views of great , or wise , or good ; to rise from the creatui'c to the Creator - ' to look through nature up to nature 's GOD . " In particular , the well informed man of piety acquires a more exact and extensive knowledge of revealed truth , than , without science , can ordinarily be obtained ; and thus increases , at once , the scope , the motives , and the facilities for improvement in holiness . Science , also , sanctified by divine grace , aids its possessor in acquiring the most thorough knowledge of his own nature and lieart : and from this circumstance , is favourable to the cultivation of inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so characteristic a feature of evangelical religion . In fact the brightest examples of piety - of hum ) ) lc piety - cive been found in men of considerable science . It is even , I believe , a general truth , that the humblest christians are those who are the best informed . /q/ Nor can I here forbear the remark , that the christian religion itself supposes a degree of knowledge , in order to its general reception and prevalence . It , indeed , provides for weakness , for ignorance , and almost for idiocy . But in its establishment in society , it is not , like the systems of paganism and idolatry , a system that will consist with deep and general ignorance , and be favoured by it . You can not propagate and preserve Christianity , in any community , without propagating knowledge at the same time . You must have a measure of civilization and a measure of mental improvement , among every people where you can reasonably hope that Christianity will be permanent . The genius of the religion itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its preservation and extension : and its doing so , is among the evidences that it is from GOD , who gave us the nature which his religion will , in all cases and in all respects , improve . Let us now view the other side of the subject ; and we shall see that the service which religion renders to science is not less than that which she receives from it . Science perverted may do , and has actually done , more injury to mankind in all their interests , religious , social and political , than can be described or estimated . In every age of the christian church , scientific infidels have been her bitterest enemies , and have aimed against her the most envenomed and deadly weapons . Their success at different times has been considerable ; but in no other age , I think , was it ever as great as it has c // been ill the very age in which we live . Of this age unsanctified science has been preeminently , the scourge and curse . This it was , undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a season , into a nation of professed infidels and atheists ; and which spread the deleterious influence of their shocking system , in a greater or less degree , over a large part of the civilized world . The natural and unavoidable consequences ensued . As civil society is held together by religion , w hen this cement was removed , it tottered to its foundations . The prostration of altars was succeeded by the fall of thrones . The human mind itself was unbalanced and perverted . Men seemed to act , at that time , as men never acted before . The usual grounds of calculation , in regard to human conduct , appeared to be taken away . Both the moral and the political world were convulsed and confused . Such was the effect of infidel philosophy , when it gained the ascendant . It is no exaggeration to say , that all the massacre , carnage , convulsion , disorder and misrule , all the misery , moral and political , which has overspread and changed the face of Europe in our times , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the learning , the eloquence , the sophistry , the wit , the plots and the influence of infidels , playing the mighty engine of mental energy with strokes powerful , frequent , and directed with consummate skill , against all the sacred bulwarks of religion and morality . I can not pass from this topic without remarking , that it would seem to be a part of the scheme of providence , /q/ ( for we pretend not to fathom its depths ) to show , by what took place in the dark ages of the church , the effect of religion without knowledge ; and in contrast with this , to show , by what has taken place in this infidel age , and in the very same countries , the effect of science without religion ; and thus to teach the world most impressively and extensively , that these two great directors of human conduct should always take counsel of each other ; that they can never act separately without producing the most lamentable evils ; and , therefore , that every lover of mankind should earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially , that such is human depravity , that it will pervert knowledge itself , favourable as it is to virtue ; and that man , destitute of religion and distinguished by science , may rival a fallen angel in malignity and mischiefp But , notwithstanding the " bad eminence* ' to which unsanctified science may thus sometimes rise , it is still a general and most important truth , that nothing is so favourable to scientific pursuits , as that calm and tranquil state of mind , and that exemption from vicious courses and passions , which true religion inspires and insures . Accordingly we see in fact , that though there have been , as we admit and lament , impious men of great literary attainments , yet the remotest regions of science have oftenest been reached by those who were religious as well as learned . Beyond all controversy , religion here may claim the palm . When we come to reckon up those who have stood in /z/ the very first ranks of genius and science , in every age of the christian church , by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; many of them among its brightest examples and most ardent propagators . It deserves particular notice that religion favours the acquisition of the most solid and useful knowledge , by preserving men from the love and cultivation of " science falsely so called . " Of trifling , and merely curious speculations , it forbids all ardent pursuit . It permits no more of them to be known , than is sufficient to expose their vanity . It represents true phi losophy herself , only as a handmaid to devotion . It places every thing on a right scale of estimation . It teaches its pupil to consider every thing as subordinate and subservient to moral improvement . It pronounces accursed , every subject and every pursuit , which is inconsistent with christian purity . It leaves not its possessor to the mere force of inclination ; but urges hira , and that incessantly , by the strongest sense of duty , to press forward in every praiseworthy attainment ; always to seek most earnestly those things which are the most valuable , and which may best promote , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good of his creatures . III . The union of piety and science , happily enables those in whom it is realized , to correct the errors , and prevent the mischiefs , of those in whom this union does not take place . /q/ Pious men , without learning , know that learning is too often possessed without piety ; and as mankind are extremely apt to undervalue , or to affect to despise , what is not among their own acquisitions , learning itself is frequently depreciated , even by good people who have never acquired it ; especially if they have become , in any degree , the leaders of others . They are jealous of learned men ; jealous of their superiority ; jealous exceedingly that they are not real friends to religion ; and jealous , above all , that these men will not be the patrons of some fond notions of their own . But if a man of learning appears who is confessedly and eminently pious ; who , it is acknowledged by all , considers religion as superior to learning itself - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and ardent labours in the cause of Christ have put him above all suspicion ; this man they will hear ; to him they will listen ; to him they will grant their confidence : he can manage them ; he can correct their errors , reform their extravagances , and persuade them to yield to reason and receive instruction . In a word , if they have not become lost in fanaticism , he can form them to just views and conduct , in regard to religion : And as only such a man can produce this effect ; so , to be capable of producing it- - to be capable of preventing or arresting such a deluge of evils as often springs from enthusiasm , deserves to be esteemed among the best and highest of human attainments . Of these attainments our own Dickinson and Edwards* See Note B at the end of the volume . /z/ were illustrious examples . Among the very first men of their time , in this country , for intellectual strength and furniture , they were still more distinguished for piety than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church to which they belonged . Few other men could gain an audience of the deluded ; but these men obtained it , because the reality and eminence of their piety were questioned by none . They spoke amd wrote so as happily to correct the spreading evil , and the good which they effected was great and lasting . In like manner , only pious men of distinguished science cah be fully prepared to encounter those who turn science against religion . But for a few men of piety , who are soholars of the first order , it is impossible to say what woild be the limits of the mischief , which learned infidels , heretics and formalists , would do to religion . It would seem as if they would soon destroy all confidence ill holy scripture , and all the belief of Christianity which is founded on argument ; that they would have all iicn of liberal minds and pursuits on their side ; all youth of aspii-ing views ; all fashion and all power . We knowji indeed , that this they will never fully achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded i on a rock , lagainst which the gates of hell shall never prevail . But although , in every respect , the power is all of GOI by which his cause in the earth is effectively maintained , , yet it is our duty carefully to consider and assiduously to employ the means , which he has appointed /q/ and which he ordinarily blesses , for the attainment of this end . And since miracles have ceased , by which , at first , Christianity was sustained and extended , in opposition to all the learning , wit and power of man , it appears that science is the chief instrument by which religion is to be defended against its learned , malignant and potent adversaries . When the christian champion , with genius , erudition and truth , all in his favour , goes forth against this embodied and embattled host of darkness , it recoils - it is disconcerted , discomfited and defeated . Its learning is combated by better learning ; its argument by stronger argument ; its eloquence. by higher eloquence ; its wit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous and resistless display of truth . It is driven off the field of its own choosing . It shifts and varies its position a thousand times , and still in all it is met faced , and put to the worse . The cause of truth constantly gains by the conflict , till , at last , she triumphs gloriously : And the thousands who always go as reputation points , follow truth because she triumphs , more than because they have examined and measured her weapons , or beheld and been subdued by her charms . They are preserved , however , from the camp of the enemy , and may eventually be trained into good soldiers of Jesus Christ . IV . When science is united with religion , the latter is most adorned , recommended and promoted , in the world at large - This point has been necessarily antici- /z/ pated ; but I must , for a moment ; present it singly and distinctly to your view . Never does religion appear to all men so venerable , so commanding , so attractive , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated and enriched by various and extensive knowledge . When one such example is exhibited in real life - when it becomes conspicuously evident that the loftiest intellectual endowments have bowed before the cross of Christ , and have counted all things but loss for him , then religion receives the best homage and the highest honours which mortals can render . Then it is demonstrated that " the foolishness of GOD is wiser than men . " The influence of one such man , not only in defending evangelical truth against its learned assailants , which we have already considered , but in preventing or putting to silence the profane scoffs of impious witlings ; in removing the prejudices of youth who are ambitious of intellectual excellence : and in commanding a reverence for religion among all who observe him , is of high consideration indeed . When a few such characters appear in a cluster , they bear down all open and avowed opposition to religion , within the whole wide sphere of their influence . But even in a much lower gradation of character ; in that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may be found in considerable numbers where the union of piety and science is patronized and encouraged , the influence of the cause we contemplate , in recommending and promoting rclig- DISCOUUSE r. 17 ion , is truly gTeat and desiraole . The mass of mankind can not , and they are sensible that they can not , decide for themselves on controverted points , which involve facts beyond their power to investigate : and when they see men of confessed ability and acknowledged information , and who also are manifestly and eminently men of integrity and virtue , the advocates of religion , they follow their judgment on this important subject . The doubts which they had entertained are , in a great measure , resolved by the fact , that honest , conscientious men , fully capable of judging , have decided on this controverted point ; have decided for religion , and devoted their lives to its service . In this , and in various otiier ways , talent and learning , when seen to be united with unfeigned goodness , always have had , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind , in behalf of religion . They invest their possessor with a dignity and consequence which can not easily be resisted . Having been concerned with my brethren for a number of years in the employment and direction of missionaries , I have had numerous occasions to observe the truth and the importance of what I inculcate in this part of our subject . At first , it was supposed that , as the missionaries were to travel among people chiefly illiterate , their qualifications , as to talents and attainments , might he of an inferior kind . But experience soon exposed this error . It was speedily found that the very best talents and attainments , possessed by the clergy of our church , were needed for this service . It was found that /z/ among the people to be evangelized , there were some men of prime sense and considerable improvement , who had great influence in directing the popular sentiment , and sometimes in directing it wrong : and that if the missionary were not able to meet and cope with these , he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sent to promote : - that even in places where these able men were not found , the missionary 's character for sense and knowledge , was ever his best passport to attention , acceptance and respect ; and that , of course , one well qualified missionary was more useful than many of a diilerent character . Not indeed , that either here , or in any other part of this discourse , I would insinuate that any talents of men , or even of angels , can convert a single soul ; unless the Sovereign Dispenser of all grace shall please to communicate it specially along with the means which his ministers employ . But we have already seen that it is the usual order of the divine dispensation - that it was so even in the apostolic age - that God should succeed and bless the natural gifts which he hath himself bestowed . Nor is it ever to be forgotten , that not only the natural powers which every man possesses , but the means and opportunities which he has had to cultivate them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole inclination to exert himself to do good , are all as really the gifts of God , as the precious and special influences of his grace . I obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful , ' ' was the declaration ol ' an apostle . /q/ Neither is it to be understood , that I suppose that in missions to the heathen , and in some other missionary enterprizes , men with hut little liberal knowledge , may not be very usefully employed ; especially when there are some of another description , under whose direction and patronage they may act . The Moravian missions are striking and incontrovertible proofs that simple men , possessing eminent prudence and patience , with primitive piety and zeal , may execute the plans of more comprehensive minds , with the most desirable , and even wonderful , effect . Nay , I must not omit to state explicitly , that even where the gospel is fully established - where churches are regularly organized and settled , men of but very moderate intellectual strength and furniture , may , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . To show the sovereignty of his grace , God may sometimes bless their labours , more than those of their better qualified brethren . All this is not only cheerfully admitted , but considered as important to be kept in mind . Still , my general and unshaken position is , that the possessor of talents and learning , in union with piety , is likely to be far more influential in extending the Redeemers kingdom , than any individual in whom these qualifications are not united . In support of this I appeal to all history , and to all observation , from the time of the apostles to our own . In every age it shall be found , that the men who have been most useful in the church of Christ , have been those who united , in /z/ some degree of eminence , piety and science . These have been the men most blest , as preachers of the gospel , while they lived ; and most instrumental in converting and edifying millions , by their writings , after their death . Being dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation only , but to many . Consult your own observation . Look around you , through our own country . Wlio are the most useful pastors in our churches ? Whose labours are the most successful ? Who have the most influence with their people , and in the church at large ? May not the usefulness of the clergy generallv , be measured on the scale of knowledge and piety united ? But I fear I have referred too much to the clergij in what I have said . It is the union of science with piety in the laitij , which often has an influence not less propitious , in the promotion of religion , as well as in all the concerns of civil society . Removed from all suspicion of professional motives , of all zeal to support that which supports himself , when a layman of genius and erudition , who is also distinguished for piety , comes forward to plead the cause of religion , he does it witli immense advantage . The fact itself goes far to shut the mouth of infidelity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priestcraft : ' ' or man is following his trade , and writing for his bread . " One secular man of gi " cat parts and learning , may , on this account , serve the cause of Christ beyond many in the sacred office . Who can estimate the evils which have been prevented . /q/ and the good which has resulted from such men appearing on the side of rehgion as Grotius , and Boyle , and Hale , and Selden , and Newton , and Pascal , and Boerhaave , and Addison , and Euler , and Haller , and Johnson , and Bonnet , and Beattie , and Jones , and the titled Teignmouth , more truly ennoLled by his j office and services as president of the British and Foreign Bible Society , than if a crown had been added to his coronet . But in characters of far less eminence than these , in common cases , where liberal minded and liberally educated laymen , are noted for piety , their example and influence is often inestimably precious . At the bar , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the ntvy , or in the compting house , they may do more godd than many who enter the sacred desk . Their 's it ij , especially , to give effect to plans for the extension of religion and learning . - To whom are we indebted for this literary Establishment , so dear to us all ? Whoj had , at once , the inclination and the influence , to obtaii a royal charter , for the avowed object of promoting learning and religion - vvdien it was known too , that the religious denomination actually and chiefly to be promoted , would not perfectly symbolize with that of tlile court ? We owe it to a liberally educated , and ekninently holy layman .

Caxdidates for the first degree in the arts - In applying this subject to you , for v'hose benefit chiefly it has been selected and discussed , I have but little to say in addition to what you have heard* I would fain hope , indeed , that you have already made the proper application , each for himself . May we not reasonably hope that you all feel the desire , and have conceived the purpose , to exhibit in yourselves , according to the measure of ability which you severally possess , the union of piet and science ? To form you to this , has , you know , been the great object constantly held in view by your teachers , through the v.hole of your collegiate course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record tlis day - that to this object our efforts have been constantly and assiduously directed .

You will disappoint our fondest hopes , you will act unworthily of the place of your education , and set yourselves in direct hostility with the designs of its pious founders . * Se-i nale D at the cud of the , Toliimc /q/ Ah ! if any of you should so far separate piety and science , as to be found , at last in the ranks of infidelity , it is fearful to think of the account which you will have to render at the judgment seat of Christ . Better , in this event , that you had remained as ignorant as the savage of the wilderness - infinitely better that you had never entered these walls . Of this tremendous issue I do , indeed , persuade myself that the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you have received . Yet the appalling event contemplated is possible , and therefore ' as my beloved sons , I you . " - Yes , there have been instances of those as highly favoured , and apparently as well principled as you are , who , through the deceitfulness of sin , have been brought , eventually " to deny the Lord that bought them . " ' It is the expression of the kindest regard , when I devoutly pray , that you may rather die in the morning of life , than live to be added to the number of these dreadful examples of apostacy from truth , and hope , and salvation . Some of you I know - and I rejoice exceedingly to know it - are looking forward to the gospel ministry , as your calling for life . In such , the importance of the union of piety and science is generally admitted . To this I not only accede , but desire to remind every caididate for the sacred office in this class , that certainly till the wane of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to feel that it is not a mere matter of choice and inclination but a binding christian and ministerial duty , to be con- /z/ stantly augmenting his fund of knowledge : - constantly extending Jiis acquaintance with every subject that , either directly or collaterally , will add to his ministerial furniture . Let him by all means cultivate piety . Let him regard this as primary and essential . Let him know and remenjber that a fervent piety is that alone which can render him either safe , or comfortable , or probably useful , in the ministerial vocation . 13 ut let him also consider it as a part of his duty to God , to increase his knowledge - to increase it as much as his circumstances , in the use of constant vigilance and industry , will permit .

I therefore entreat those of you who are destined to secular employments , to take your full share of this address and charge .

Be satisfied with nothing short of a renewed lieart. a vital union with the Lord Jesus Christ , and a /q/ life of holy obedience to all the commandments of God , In regard to the cultivation of your minds , I must repeat what I have said to candidates for the holy ministry - Consider yourselves as sacredly bound to improve in useful knowledge .

Cultivate continually a sense of obligation to direct and consecrate all your knowledge and attainments to some useful end .

Produce them to the world , and be emulous to take a part - a leading part , if you are called to it - in every liberal , every virtuous , every benevolent , every pious enterprise . It will be advantageous to you all , whatever be your destination in life , to measure and ascertain , as well as you can , your own capacities . Be not too aspiring ; but yet aim high .

And let influence , when acquired , be considered as a talent , for which your are highly responsible ; - as a talent which you are to manage so as to efiect the greatest good to which it is competent . In the circle of your influence be very active . In that circle let every plan to promote learning and the arts , every attempt at useful improvements of whatever kind , every scheme of benevolence , every institution of piety , have your cordial support .

Cherish a sacred emulation to be instrumental in promoting the cause of God ; and to have a share in the work and the reward of those , who are the honoured agents in his hand of executing his merciful purposes , and of advancing his kingdom and glory in the world . /q/ With these counsels and injunctions , my last address to you must be closed . I affectionately and solemnly commit you to God ; to the care of his providence ; to the influence of his grace ; praying that you may be conducted safely through all the perils and vicissitudes of life ; and that we may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen . /z/ Prov , IIL 6. * In all thy ways acknowledge Him , and he shall direct thy pathsP X HE proverbs of Solomon are , in most instances , unconnected maxims pf wisdom , prudence or piety . The text , however , is manifestly connected with the verse which precedes it ; so that the two verses are to be considered either as containing two proverbs closely related , or else two parts of the same proverb ; of which the latter is an explanation and application of the former . The passage , in its connexion , stands thus - ' Trust in the Lord with all thine heart , and lean not unto thine own understanding . In all thy ways acknowledge Him , and he shall direct thy paths . " The spirit of this injunction is , that we should rely on the guidance and direction of God , and not upon our own understanding , or sagacity , in choosing our course in life , and in disr charging its duties . In all thy ways acknowledge Him , and He shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. A duty prescribed . II . A promise made to the performance of that duty . Let us consider each of these distinctly , and then briefly apply the subject . /z/ I. In the text there is a duty prescribed - * In all thy ways acknowledge him . " We shall , I apprehend , most fully and advantageously explain and exhibit the meaning of the inspired writer in these words , by taking three views of the precept which they contain - By considering Li the first place , What it is to acknowledge God , in the sense of this precept , in the ordinary course and concerns of life . Secondly , Wherein the duty consists , when we are entering on an extraordinary undertaking , or important enterprise , in which it is plainly lawful for us to engage . Thirdly , How our duty may be ascertained when we are doubtful , or greatly at a loss about it - and the matter in question is , notwithstanding , highly important to our future welfare . None of these views is uninteresting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of a whole discourse . The two former , however , I shall treat generally and cursorily , intending to spend a little more time in discussing the third ; because it is that in which direction is most necessary , and that , also , to which I think the text most directly points . First then , if we would acknowletlge God , in the ordinary course and concerns of life , we must have a settled and lively sense of our dependance on him for his blessing , in all our affairs and interests , both temporal and spiritual . This duty necessarily supposes that the mind of him who is to perform it is luider the influence DISCOURSE n. 31 of pious principles . He who has no feeling of these , will never , in the spirit of the text , acknowledge God in all , nor in any of his ways . Whoever has not a firm and practical belief that a divine providence governs and guides the concerns of men , and that it extends to the circumstances of each individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , never commit the lot of life to God to be mercifully ordered by him .. This , from the nature of the case , can be done only by one who truly believes , according to the doctrine of our Saviour , that ' ' a sparrow falleth not to the ground without our heavenly Father , and that the hairs of our heads are all numbered ; " implying that the providence of the Creator extends to the most minute incidents which relate to his creatures . He who acknowledges God , so as to fulfil the injunction of the text , must especially be sensible that the divine favour and blessing are , in the strictest sense , essential to his happiness . The favour and blessing of his Maker , therefore , he will be most solicitous to obtain . And knowing that God will never make his enemies happy , reconciliation with him , in the way of his own appointment , and the uninterrupted continuance of his friendship , will be sought with the greatest earnestness , and maintained with unceasing vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel and act under the conviction that if he possess the favour and loving kindness of God his Maker , he will certainly , let /z/ his outward circumstances be what they may , have the best and most desirable portion . A system of conduct founded on this conviction , will , doubtless , always require that the whole of human existence be taken into view . Not merely that small and inconsiderable part which lies on this side the grave ; but that also which lies beyond it , and is of infinite duration . To desire to be happy in time , in such manner as to be unhappy through eternity , is nothing less than the madness of folly . All suffering and disappointment , therefore , in this world , wliich an infinitely wise and good Being may see to be necessary to promote or insure felicity in the world to come , will be deliberately chosen by every man who acts with true rationality . The man who really acknowledges God will be careful to act in this manner . He will desire that measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite wisdom may see to be most advantageous to him as an immortal being ; and fully sensible that all things are ordered by God , he will desire and pray that they may be so ordered as tlmt they may all conspire and work together in subserviency to the divine glory , for his own ultimate and highest happiness . In all the occurrences of life he will eye the hand of his heavenly Father , and receive both prosperity and adversity as coming from it . He will perceive that every effort of his , will be successful or abortive , just as the Supreme Disposer of all events shall please to order . He will therefore , every day of his life , devoutly /q/ ask to be directed by God in the path of duty ; and he will cherish the habitual recollection that in all he does , or attempts , or contrives , it will still remain with Him , " who doth according to his will in the army of Heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth , " to succeed or disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a curse - " The heart of man deviseth his way , but the Lord directeth his steps . " Secondly . When he who acknowledges God in all his ways is about to enter on an extraordinary undertaking , or important enterprise , in which it is plainly lawful to engage , you will perceive , from what has already been said , that he will be exceedingly desirous to secure the divine smiles and patronage . Feeling that on these he absolutely depends , and perceiving that the concern is deeply to affect his future welfare , he will now desire and supplicate the direction , aid and blessing of God , with peculiar earnestness and solicitude . Johnson , in his life of Milton , quotes from a publication of that great poet , the following sentences , written before he had planned the poem of Paradise Lost , but after he had resolved to undertake something that Blight be of use and honor to his country . In thinking of the necessary preparation for such an undertaking , Milton says , " This is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit that can enrich with all /z/ " the lips of whom he pleases . To this must he added " industrious and select reading , steady observation , ' ' and insight into all seemly and generous arts and " affairs , till which in some measure be compast , I re ' fuse not to sustain this expectation . " Johnson adds - " From a promise like this , at once fervid , pious , and " rational , might be expected the Paradise Lost . " The biographer of Johnson himself informs us , that he , in like manner , entered on the execution of his far-famed work , entitled The Rambler , " with exercises of special prayer , and a sense of his dependance on God for success , similar to those which he records of Milton . Surely the witlings of infidelity have reason to blush , when they attempt to deride , as the weakness of enthusiasm , those devotional exercises which have been considered as essential to success , by the greatest . examples of human intellect which the world has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally important , and as such have been employed , by some of the most renowned and successful military and naval commanders , whose heroism and glory have commanded the admiration and envy of the world . Yes , brethren - he who would acknowledge God in all his ways , must especially acknowledge him in those important occurrences and enterprises of life , on which its whole complexion must depend , and by which its fortunes must be decided . Thea the mind is to be charged to be peculiarly sensible that success must come from God ; - that the Most High is then holding the destiny of his dependant creature in /q/ his hand , and is to be humbly and fervently implored to order and decide it in his mercy . But I hasten to consider ' - Thirdly - How our duty may be . ascertained when we are doubtful , or greatly at a loss about it ; - and the matter in question is , notwithstanding , highly important to oui future welfare . First of all , let the party whose case we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , in all his prayers , ask counsel , in regard to the doubt which is to be resolved . Let him also set apart some season for special prayer in regard to the urgent concern ; and if practicable let him ' om fasting with prayer . In prayer let him particularly desire and ask , that his mind may be rendered thoroughly honest and candid ; that it may in no degree be biassed. by passion or inclination ; but be made willing to know and practice duty , although it should consist in severe self-denial . As an encouragement to pray for light and direction , let him recollect and plead the gracious declaration - ' * If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally and upbraid eth not , and it shall be given him . " The wisdom here promised is imparted ' ' from the Father of lights , " by his word , by his providence , and by his Spirit , to the humble and believing suppliant . From these sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in duty , may expect to receive the guidance he has sought - And hence 3e DISCOURSE II . 2 . It will be incumbent on him carefully and diligently to consult " the scriptures of truth . " There let him faithfully search for a case similar or analagous to his own . If not successful in such a search , let him impartially consider the scope and spirit of those doctrines and principles which have a bearing on his case ; from which he can scarcely fail to derive some important aid . In this manner let him try to make the oracles of God * the man of his counsel . " 3 . Let him also carefully observe the aspect of providence . Having prayed that providence may be his guide , let him see if it do not offer some plain indications by which his duty may be gathered . These indications , however , it should ever be remembered , are to be considered with great coolness and deliberation ; and that a suitable jealousy is to be exercised lest fancy should mould them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake . 4 . The opinion of judicious friends should be taken . And that the inquirer may get a candid opinion , it will be well , if concealment be fairly practicable , not to let it be known that the rase ho proposes relates to himself . Or if this , as will often happen , can not be done , let him be at pains to make those whom he consults believe that he honestly desires to know his duty , and will feel deeply indebted to the friends who shall advise him faithfully and discreetly . It is still better to consult books than men . If it can be found that the case in question has been discussed and /z/ decided by a judicious writer , it will be known that the opinion given , in addition to other considerations , has not been influenced by any regard to the party whom it now concerns . When opinions have thus been obtained , they are to be carefully weighed and duly regarded . Yet , as every man is to answer for himself , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself - Therefore , 5 . Let him ponder his own case much in his own mind . No one , probably , will be brought to take as much interest in it as he takes himself ; and no one can know what he is , and for what he is qualified , as well as , with due care and attention , he may know himself . In making up his mind let him not be hasty ; and yet let him have it constantly in view to be entirely decided and satisfied at last ; for few things are more painful than a dubious and unsettled state of mind in regard to an important point of duty . To prevent this it will be useful to forecast , as far as possible , all the consequences of both sides of the alternative to be decided on ; - what is likely to ensue on the supposition that he takes this course or that ; that he consents or refuses ; that he acts or resolves not to act . It may sometimes be advisable to write down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have influence on each side of the question ; that being fully drawn out and seen at one view , they may be weighed and considered with the greatest advantage . In all dubious matters it is a good rule to go much , if we can , on the plan of doing that /z/ which is safe , that which is clearly lawful . ' There may , indeed , be an extreme and superstitious scrupulosity . But if it be clearly lawful to act in one way , and quite questionable whether it be so to act in another , we ought always to take the path which is not doubtful . It is , my brethren , by a sound and discreet use of the directions now given - by seeking counsel ad direction of God in frequent and earnest prayei ' - by making his word the man of our counsel - by observing the indications of the divine providence - by consulting men and books - and by carefully deliberating on all circumstances with ourselves - that we are to acknowledge God , and endeavour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the matter in question is , notwithstanding , highly important to our future welfare . It is , you will carefully observe , by acting in this manner that we recognize our entire dependance on our Maker , and at the same time make use of our own powers and endeavours , as rational and accountable creatures . And these two things are always to be joined together : for he who professes to depend on God , without using his own reason and efforts , and he who actually relies on his own reason and efforts , without feeling his dependence on God , are both chargeable with gross presumption . The one tempts his Maker , and the other idolizes himself . The man who truly acknowledges God in all his ways will carefully and constantly unite the two duties , of cherishing a sense of his absolute dependance on the assistance /z/ and blessing of the Most High , and of using his own best exertions to ascertain and perform his duty . And then - II . He may stedfastly rely on the fulfilment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In looking for the accomplishment of this promise , however , let us , my brethren , beware of expecting to receive it by any sudden , or irresistible impulse of the mind . Let us be cautious how we even desire that our duty should be intimated in this manner . Such an intimation , if it be ever given , must be considered as an extraordinary dispensation , which must be left entirely to the sovereignty of Him who awards it . We have no claim to calculate on any unusual aid or interposition of the Deity . But in an humble reliance on the divine assurance given in the text , we may hope and expect that , while we are careful , and diligent , and persevering in the use of the means that have been specified , God will direct our minds , in the exercise of sound reason and discretion , of an enlightened conscience and genuine pious sentiment , to make a right choice , or to form a correct decision , in regard to a doubtful and important point of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a determination on a question in which our dearest interests appear to be involved ; and , even at the last , we may not have the perfect clearness which we could wish . But when we have faithfully used the means which have been mentioned , and taken the course /z/ which on the whole aj ) peared to be right , we are warranted to beUeve , and ought to believe , that the Lord has directed our path . The promise was predicated on the performance of a duty , namely , the acknowledging of God . The duty , by the supposition , has been performed . The promise then became absolute ; and to believe in its accomplishment is not only lawful but obligatory . Nor is the humble believer , in applying this trutlu to indulge distrust , on account of the imperfection which may have attended the performance of his duty in the case contemplated ; if , on a careful review , that imperfection shall appear not to have been peculiar . He who made the promise knew that the duty witli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imperfectly performed . This , and all the other promises of the divine word , we are to remember , arc fulfilled to believers who act imperfectly , but yet sincerely , for the sake of the perfect righteousness , and through the prevalent mediation , of Christ their Redeemer . If , indeed , it be clearly evident , that we have not performed the duty required , with some good degree of care , and seriousness , and impartiality , and earnest desire to know the way in which we ought to walk - for these are the ingredients which constitute sincerity - then , certainly , we have no right to apply the promise to ourselves . But if these evidences of sincerity have not been wanting , altliough a lamentable imperfection may have /q/ attended them all , we may confidently expect , and shall certainly find , that the Lord will do as he hath said - he will direct our paths . In every age , brethren , the truth of the promise we here consider , as it relates not only to doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , and to great and difiicult undertakings where duty was obvious , has been remarkably experienced . History both sacred and profane , abounds with examples of the fulfilment of this promise . These examples have been confined to no class or order of men ; but they have , of course , been most striking in those who have been the greatest benefactors of mankind , and whose memory is the most precious . Their high and distinguished honour and usefulness have unquestionably been attributable - and such has been their own judgment - to the signal blessing of the God of providence on measures and efforts , for direction and assistance in which they constantly looked and prayed . Yes ; they sensibly felt their dependence on God and continually acknowledged it ; they sought and obtained his guidance and benediction ; and when success , often beyond their most sanguine hopes , crowned their labours , they ascribed the praise of all , not to themselves , but to God alone . Here , however , an inquiry of some importance demands attention . Good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful , either in their endeavours to benefit others , or to provide for themselves . If /z/ then the promise we consider be invariably fulfilled , how , in may be asked , is it fulfilled to them ? I answer - good men tliemselves may not always comply with the condition of the promise , and for this reason may not experience its accomplishment . Men truly good , in their general character , are sometimes greatly deficient in the discharge of particular duties . And in such cases the neglect of duty may be visited with divine chastisements , in such manner that the offence may be seen in the punishment . Who that reads attentively the history of David , but must remark with pain , that the neglect of parental duty was , by the righteous permission of God , fearfully punished by filial ingratitude and domestic distress " ? In like manner , there may be good men - and indeed , brethren , I fear their number is not small - who are lamentably deficient in the duty of acknowledging God . Good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not feel and confess , and with some sensil ) ility ' and constancy too , their entire dependence on God for all that they possess , and all that they expect . Still , they may be chargeable with great and very criminal neglect . They neglect , perliaps , that part of the general duty which consists in a daily and earnest looking to God to prosper their undertakings , and to bless all the labours of their hands . Or they make material changes in their affairs , or enter on important enterprises , without any special acknowledgement of God at all . Or they are not sensible , in the degree that they ought to be , of their need of divine DISCOURSE II . 4a direction . Or they do not unite care , caution and industry - the vigorous use of their own powers and efforts - with the other part of the duty . That by palpable and gross deficiency in some one , or in several , of these particulars , good men sometimes fail in performing the condition specified in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it contains , is not to be doubted . Far be it from us , indeed , rashly to judge our brethren in particular instances , and to say , when we see an individual unsuccessful in life , that his disappointments or losses are the punishment of his neglecting to acknowledge God . This is contrary to the whole tenor of scripture doctrine , and the spirit of christian charity ; and it will presently appear that our subject itself forbids such a conclusion . But although it is not for us , who know neither the hearts nor the exercises of individuals , hastily to mark them as transgressors , yet it is not only a doctrinal truth warranted by scripture , but one of great practical importance , which ought to be imprinted on our minds for admonition and warning , that good men may sorely experience the frowns of providence in their worldly concerns , because they do not suitably acknowledge God . Nay , the pious are the very persons who have most reason to expect this dispensation . The ungodly may " prosper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill up the measure of their iniquity , and receive the more aggravated condemnation in the world to come . But the Father of mercies chastens bis oii children in this /z/ life , that he may bring them to repentance , reclaim them fi'oni their wanderings , and thus prepare them for ' the inheritance of the saints in light . " It now only remains to admit , in the most explicit manner , that there may be cases where worldly success or pi'osperity may not be the allotment of those who are chargeable with no special neglect of the duty prescribed in the text . How , it will be demanded , is the promise fulfilled to these ' ? The answer is easy to him wlio has faith in God , and knowledge of his holy word . That word will teach us that nothing can be further from the truth than to believe , that the worldly prosperity which we are prone to desire , and especially that meu.nire of it wliich we often covet , would be a real favoiu- if it were bestowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are nt difliculty . In all cases where men have truly and suitably acknowledged God , and yet have not obtai:ied what they have sought , their Heavenly Fatlier has seen that it would not be good for them to obtain it . He has seen that disappointment would be better for them than success , and therefore , in very faitiifnlness he has disappointed them . He gives to Jill his people , who duly acknowledge him , as much prosperity as they can bear : as much as they themselves would wish , if every thing was as open to their view as it is to his . To these , therefore , his promise is as really and as kindly fulfilled as it is to those who are not disappointed - as it is to the most prosperous . They have actually had all the success /q/ which , taking their whole existence into view , an omniscient and covenant-keeping God saw to be best for them . To desire more , or other than this , would be the extreme both of folly and impiety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men can not be favoured without a large measure of worldly prosperity . The christian doctrine , taught too by some of the best heathen moralists , is , that the Deity not only may , but often in fact does , curse with prosperity , and bless with adversity . Those who are ultimately the most prospered and honoured , even in this world , are frequently prepared for it , by a most painful training in the school of adversity . It was so with Moses , with Job , with Joseph , with Jeptha , with David ; and with hundreds of others in every age of the world . Men , indeed , are seldom qualified either for very eminent usefulness , or for the best enjoyment of prosperity , till they have learned humility and self command , from affliction and disappointment ; and fortitude , activity and perseverance , from contending with enemies and adverse events . A man , therefore , is not hastily to conclude that he will never be prosperous , because prosperity has long been denied him . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honourable , even in this life , than he could have been if he had never seen adversity . But however this may be , if we faithfully acknowledge God in all our ways , he will invariably so direct our paths as shall be most for our benefit on the whole . For " we know that all things /z/ work together for good to them that love God , to tliem wlio are the called according to his purpose - For our light aflliction which . is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ; . while wc look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal - For all things are yours : Whether Paul or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ; and ye are Christ 's ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to make a practical application of the subject . And - 1 . It is obvious to remark , after what has been said that a large proportion of nominal christians , live habitually in the neglect , or violation , of one of the plainest dictates of the religion in which they have been educated . So far are they from acknowledging God in all their ways , that they acknowledge him in none of their ways . Instead of looking to him to direct their paths , they never think of divine direction , and look only to themselves . The particular providence of God , than which our Saviour himself taught no doctrine more plainly , these jiersons , who call themselves christians , overlook , deny , or ridicule . The duty of prayer , as grounded on that doctrine , they , of course , never perform , or attempt . God is not in all their thoughts . " They think not of either as their future judge and I'cwarder. or as ihcir j ) rpsent benefactor and protector . /q/ Such men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professors of all false religions , act upon their avowed principles with far gi'eater consistency and exactness , than many professors of the true religion act upon theirs . It is , indeed , melancholy to think , how many there are , under the light of the gospel , whom our text and subject most pointedly reprove ; who have even less sense of their dependence on God , than Heathen and Mahometans ; who never yet seriously asked counsel of God , or sought his aid and blessing , in any of their concerns . If I speak in the hearing of any of this character , let them be entreated , by every consideration both of duty and interest , to turn from a course of such dreadful impiety and danger . Hence I remark - 2 . That those who have not succeeded in their enterprizes in life , should be led by this subject to inquire , whether they may not have failed because they did not acknowledge God in all their ways . Although it be unquestionable that what is called worldly prosperity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also true , as we have seen , that it may be denied to others because they have never suitably sought the divine blessing on their undertakings and endeavours . He whose memory and conscience can inform him , that his plans and efforts to acquire worldly wealth , or influence , have ' not been formed with a suitable sense of his dependence on God for success , and with frequent prayer for the divine blessing on them , has no reason to /z/ wonder if they have all been blasted and proved abortive ; though lawful in themselves , and though prosecuted with diiigcn ( e and discretion . Persons of this description should be apprised that their best interests , their eternal well being , mny require that disappointment should continue , till it shall lead them to the God whom they have forgotten . When this shall be effected , and their future and everlasting felicity be secured , a merciful God may see meet to change his dealings with them , and to allow them a larger portion than they have yet enjoyed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they owe to their Maker and to themselves , urges them to unfeigned repentance for their ) ast delinquency , and to an immediate and cordial performance of the duty they have so long neglected . But I feel constrained to say fVirther , that I am verily persuaded there is scarcely any duty which is more imperfectly performed , even by real christians , than that which I now inculcate . Alas ! how few are they who daily live with a piopcr regard to the all-seeing and alldisposing God I who feelingly recognize their need of his counsel and superintending care , in all they do or attempt ; in lying down and rising up ; in going out and ( oming in ; in every situation , or company in which they may be found . Ii is no violation of truth or charity , though is seems a paradox in religion , to say that there is much forgetfulness of God , much implicit denial of his presence , providence , power , and faithfulness - DISCOURSE II . 4d in a word , much practical atheism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real piety . Truly , in this view of the subject , the most of us have need to be deeply abased , and henceforth to endeavour to act more as becomes the christian profession , more as " seeing Him who is invisible - and in whom we live and move and have our being . " 3 . The subject ought greatly to alarm those who have been prosperous in the world , without acknowl edging God . Men are sometimes seen who literally and habitually " forget God , " violate his laws , despise his institutions , and blaspheme his holy name ; who , notwithstanding , acquire wealth , rise to honour , or obtain fame and distinction . Sometimes they are even hardened in their impiety , by their success . They consider and proclaim it as a proof , that the declarations and demands of religion are false and vam . Thenapparent happiness , also , sometimes operates as a grievous discouragement and temptation to the godly ; especially in a season of great adversity or affliction . Such we know was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar cases have doubtless occurred in every subsequent age . But the solution of the difflculty which Asaph obtained , is that which , at all times , should satisfy the pious : and at all times it should likewise alarm-if indeed any thing can alarmthese proud and hardened abusers of the goodness and grace of God . Hear their fearful destiny announced bytheholvman whose " feet were almost gone , whose /z/ steps had well nigh slipiicd , ' ' because he was " envious at the foolish when he saw the prosperity of the wicked. * ' " I went , " says he , " into the sanctuary of God ; then understood I their end . Surely thou didst set them in slippery places ; thou castedst them down into destruction . How are they brought into desolation as in a moment ! they are utterly consumed with terrors . As a dream when one awaketh ; so , O Lord , when thou awakest , thou shalt despise their image . " Yes , brethren , we have only to think on the end of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy , but with horror . The eminence from which they fall will only serve to plunge them the deeper into perdition . The God of providence , by permitting these abandoned men to acquire wealth , or power , or fame , has shown conspicuously of how little estimation are those things in his sight. * Yet , as all worldly distinctions are his gifts , and ought to be employed in his service and to his glory , the abuse of them to his dishonour , will awfully aggravate the final condemnation of their abusers . Unless the deepest repentance , and an earnest application to the all atoning blood of Christ prevent , they will eternally wish that the most al ) ject state of poverty and contempt had been their lot in life ; rather than that they should have gone to the place of torment , chargeable with insulting their Maker by means of his own bounty , with resisting his proffered mercy , and with injuring others while they ruined their own souls .

They may see that the statement , in the doctrinal part of this discourse , that the promise of God to them has not failed , was made on good grounds - that He is not dealing with them in his displeasure , but in covenant faithfulness . In some instances , as we have remarked , the existing adversity may be intended only to prepare the way for the safe and more perfect enjoyment of prosperity in this life .

Mv YOUNG FRIENDS ! I have already directed your attention , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar circumstanrcs in which you now stand , by a man eminently qualified to give counsel to the young. * These advices you have carefully treasured in your memories , that they may be ready for use , as circumstances may demand , through the whole of your future lives . After taking care that this should be accomplished , my chief remaining concern was , to present to you on this interesting occasion , some one great and comprehensive truth , easily understood , and not easily forgotten , which should , by itself , embody every particular advice . And such a tnith , precisely , I am well persuaded , is that which our text contains - In all your ways acknowledge God , and He shall direct your paths . ' ' Regard this sacred maxim , in the manner that has been recommended , and all will be well . It will guide you in safety through this woi-ld , and conduct you with certainty to a better .

Keep it always in mind , that you must obtain the divine direction and blessing , if ever you are truly happy , prosperous or honourable , and ask , therefore , for these inestimable favours , in daily and fervent prayer . Bear with me - for I am anxious for your happiness - while I press upon you , a little fartlier , some of the leading ideas already suggested as general truths . - When you are about to enter on any undertaking or enterprise , which will deeply affect your character , happiness or usefulness , then let your sense of dependance be peculiarly awake and active ; and in special exercises of devotion look to God for his omnipotent assistance , protection and blessing . Whenever you are at a loss in regard to any important point of duty , endeavour to ascertain it by using the means which you have heard detailed in this discourse . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then go forward with cheerfulness and determined resolution ; - believing that having acknowledged God , according to his commandment , he is directing , and will continue to direct , your paths . With some of you , probably , the choice of a profession for life , not be a matter of much difficulty . It has , perhaps , already been made by your parents , or fixed by your own inclination and deliberate preference . If so , it may not be necessary to question farther its suitableness for you ; since the supposition is , that it is /z/ lawful in itself . But with others , the choice of a profession may be a subject of great difficulty and peculiar embarrassment . To such I have to say , that theirs is one of the cases , to w hich the directions I have given for determining the matter of duty , when it is both doubtful and important , is peculiarly applicable . Let them faithfully pursue the method that has been pointed out , and their choice will ultimately be right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , without exception , to enter on your professional pursuits with a distinct and devout recognition of the providence and grace of God , as the sources from which you are to derive direction , assistance and success . When a class of youth who have passed through a course of liberal studies , are leaving the place of their education , it is a most interesting thought that we probably see in them , a numl ) er of those who gire , hereafter , to have great influence on society , both in private and in pulilick life . Such , my beloved pupils , I hope and trust is your destination . And in the prospect of it , I now solemnly counsel and charge you , to use all the influence which you shall ever possess , in favour of knowledge , virtue and piety ; - particularly , that by your cxamj ) je , as well as by your words , you endeavour to engage others to acknowledge God . The neglect of this duty by communities , both small arid great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the manifest frowns of Heaven . Families , colleges , leg . /q/ islative bodies , fleetSj armies and nations - the sneer of the infidel notwithstanding - have all furnished examples of this important and awful truth . Let the whole weight of your character and influence , therefore , in all your intercourse with the world , be employed to lead men to the due and rational acknowledgment of God . In this way you may perform a service incalculably beneficial to mankind - to the interests of good morals , of social happiness and of genuine piety . This , then , is my last counsel . With this I leave vou in the hands of our common God and Father ; most devoutly praying that his providence may shield you , and his grace and favour accompany you , through the whole journey of life ; and that I may meet you all with joy and not with grief , " at that dread tribunal before which we are soon to appear . Amen . /z/ ' * And who is he that will hariiX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ? But and if ye suffer for fighteous7iess sake , happy are yeP XN the context the Apostle Peter delineates and enjoins the virtues of the christian life . To enforce what he says , he urges three considerations ; the happiness of a good life ; the approbation and protection of God ; and the influence of the christian temper and deportment in preserving its possessor from much that would harm him , and in comforting him when he suffers for righteousness ' sake . The last of these considerations is contained in the text , and will form the subject of the ensuing discourse* The three considerations , indeed , are very closely related , and in a measure involve each other ; so that in discussing the last , the two former will , of necessity , be brought into view . " Who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ? But and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye . " This passage , though di /z/ vided into two parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in the original , a single sentence , or period , and ought to be so considered , if we would perceive its full force and beauty . It contains , you will observe , a condition , an interrogatory , and an aflirmation . The condition is , the possession of a certain character , " if ye be followers of that which is good . ' The interrogatory - who will harm the possessors of this character ? And , the affirmation - that if they even suffer for righteousness ' sake , still they are happy . After speaking to each of these points in order , it will remain to apply the subject . I. We are , first of all , to notice the condition , on which the interrogatory and affirmation in the text are gi'ounded , namely , that it must be the character of the parties spoken of , that they are followers of that which is good . The original words which our translators render - * if ye be followers of that which is good , ' ' literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is good , " or * of the thing that is good . " Accordingly Doddridge hesitates not to translate and paraphrase the words thus - ' Who shall have the ability or inclination to hurt you , if ye imitate Him who is supremely good : if you copy after the benevolence of the Divine Being , and of your great Master , whose whole life was so illustrious an example of the most diffusive generosity and goodness to his followers ? " Other translators have followed this /q/ construction , and I doubt not , for myself , that it gives the true sense of the passage . It seems to be equivalent to the expression of the apostle Paul - " Be ye followers , " or imitators " of God , as dear children . " The divine Saviour was both God and man , and in him we have a perfect example . By setting this example constantly before us , we shall have a faultless copy to imitate . The perfection of the copy , indeed , we shall but imperfectly approximate ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence that otherwise wc should never reach . Subordinately to this , we should , also , be imitators of those mere men whose conduct , in various characters and circumstances , has been most exemplary and laudable . The apostle Paul exhorts the Corinthians - " Be ye followers of me , even as I also am of Christ . " And elsewhere he says - &#9632; ' Be ye followers of them who , through faith and patience , inherit the promises . " To propose to ourselves the most finished patterns of excellence , in the various relations and occupations of life , has been long and often recommended as one of the best adapted means for rising high in the scale of virtue and improvement . As St. Peter , in the text , is speaking of that which was to have influence on others , and even on enemies , it is manifest that he must have had a direct reference to visible deportment . Yet I think it of the gieatest importance here , to remark , that the conduct which the apostle recommends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its spring in the /z/ heart ; and that it can flow from no other source . No other heart than one which is renewed and sanctified by divdne grace , will have those evil passions which make a man the tormentor of himself , as well as the injurer of others , effectually subdued , or rather , in a measure , eradicated , and dispositions of an opposite nature , favourable to inward peace and enjoyment , and to oiitward kindness and beneficence , implanted in their room . Besides ; though the spirit and wisdom of the world dictate the same practice as christian principle , to a certain extent ; both , for example , requiring veracity , integrity and courtesy ; yet in certain points , and those very material to our present purpose , they not only vary , but are directly opposite to each other . The spirit of the gospel requires humility , self-denial , patience and forbearance ; and forbids every species of revenge . The spirit of the world , on the contrary , not merely permits a proud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoins them . They , therefore , who would be followers of that which is good ; - they who would be imitators of Christ , and of the most distinguished worthies of our race ; - they would take the whole revealed system for their guide ; - they , in a word , who would really come up to the demands of the condition in the text - must not be ' conformed to this world , but transformed by the renewing of their mind . " They must be vital , practical christians ; and the more they are inwardly sanctified , th more will they be outwardly what the text requiis. /q/ But , having considered the fountain as purified , let us trace a little the wholesome and pleasant streams , which it will be sure to send forth ; and which are so refreshing and delightful in the journey of human life , that none but the most perverted and depraved can fail to relish , admire and commend them . The lives of the best men , indeed , do not exhibit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , their practice is but imperfectly conformed to the standard of duty which they sincerely and supremely love , and by which they honestly desire and endeavour to regulate their conduct . But , although christian practice is never all that christian principle is calculated to make it , still the proper tendency of that principle ought to be clearly shown . Nor should we make too great an allowance for human infirmity , lest we encourage and increase an evil which we ought only to deplore . The apostle evidently contemplated in the text an exemplary exhibition of the christian character . With these remarks in view , let it be observed , that the follower of that which is good , he who truly endeavours to imitate Christ , will , in some good measure , exemplify such a system of practice as the following - He will strive to perform every duty which he owes to God and man , in a manner , at once the most exact and the most acceptable . Although sincerely and devoutly pious , so that he would sooner sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny nor be ashamed of Christ and his cause , in any company or /z/ situation in which you can place him , nor consent to modify the pure doctrines of the gospel , so as to accommodate them to a corrupt taste ; although he will , on all suitable occasions , contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints ; yet he will do all this in the most inoffensive manner that he can devise . He will be careful to profess and defend religion with a gospel temper ; and will return good for evil , blessing for cursing . He will be watchful to do nothing that shall cause his good to be evil spoken of ; and will therefore avoid austerity , moroseness , harshness , uncharitableness and arrogance . In a word , he will seek to render the gospel , in its purity , as little offensive as it can be rendered to those who have not yet cordially embraced it ; feeling the obligation and the importance of his Lord 's injunction - ' Let your liglit so shine before men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father which is in heaven. * ' In discharging the general duties which he owes to his brethren of mankind , the follower of that which is good , will be just , and fair , and equitable , and kind , and liberal , and merciful . He will obey the precept , ' Owe no man any thing , but to love one another . " lie will never circumvent , nor defraud , nor deceive , nor deal hardly with any man . He will conscientiously and faithfully perform every engagement that he makes , and never betray the trust or confidence reposed in him . In the discharge of all relative and official duties , he will be very exemplary . He will be a dutiful son , a /z/ tender husband , an affectionate father , a reasonahle master , a kind neighbour , a faithful friend , a good citizen , an upright magistrate* He will be liberal of his substance ; will give freely to the poor , and patronize all schemes for the promotion of knowledge , of piety , and of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding broils and contentions himself , but endeavouring to prevent them , or to heal them , among others . He will never do an ill office to any one ; but will love to serve and promote the interest of others , whenever he finds it in his power . He will be a man of sympathy ; he will enter into the feelings of others , rejoicing with those that rejoice , and weeping with those that weep . He will be kind , and obliging , in all his deportment . In every way that he can , and in every place in which he may find himself , he will seek to do good ; for this is what he loves j he follows it ; he is devoted to it ; for the supposition is , that he is like his Saviour , who went about doing good . " II . Brethren , can we now fail to feel the force of the interrogatory which forms the second point to be considered ? Miglit not the apostle well ask who is he that will harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not be likely to have more friends than any other man ? Will he not often convert enemies into friends ? And will he not sometimes shame , confound and silence , those whom he can not conciliate ? Will not his enemies find it difficult to assign a plausible pretence to harm him ? Nay , y they not find it difficult /z/ to get at him to do him harm ? Will not his temper and conduct become a broad shield , to intercept , or turn aside , the shafts of malignity and baseness ? To all these inquiries , and many more of a similar kind , which carry their answer along with them , the single question in the text seems naturally to give rise . The apostle , indeed , does immerliately intimate - and this we are afterwards to consider - that the man we have described , may , after all , be called to suffer . Yet the distinct , and clear , and strong import of the text is , that this follower or imitator of good and goodness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent temper and exemplary life will , in a very high degree , prove a protection to him . To illustrate this , I will a little extend the ideas already suggested , and bring into view some additional considerations . 1 . The follower or imitator of that which is good , will not harm himself , as bad men do , by cherishing those feelings and passions which are , in their very nature , painful and tormenting . It is in this way that men inflict upon themselves a very large proportion of all their sufferings . Take away all the miseries which arise from repining against God , his providence , his dispensations , his allotments ; all that are produced by the fear of his displeasure , both here and hereafter ; all that spring from discontent , from peevishness , from mortified pride , from envy , from resentment , hatred , and the desire of revenge ; all that are created by covetousness , by avarice , by ungratified ambition , and b ) DISCOURSE in. 65 disappointed vanity ; - in a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all away , and think what a mass of wretchedness you have destroyed . Think how great a proportion these bad feelings and passions make of all that does harm to human enjoyment . Think how comparatively blessed a man would be who should never feel one of them , or who , having felt them , should never feel them more . Would he not by this , have more done to make him happy , than could be done in every other way ? Assuredly he would . Remember , then , that he who is a follower of that which is good , is this very man . To see that he is so you have only to recollect his character , as already given . In proportion as he possesses that character , he will avoid all the harm , the entire mass of misery , to which your attention has just been directed . And the sole reason that he does not avoid it completely , is that he does not perfectly possess the character . But in the degree in which it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much . It preserves the possessor from being a self tormentor , the most incessant and most cruel of all tormentors . Nor is the happy influence of this character merely negative . It not only exterminates or suppresses bad passions and emotions , but it implants those which are good and productive of the highest inward delight* . Let inspiration instruct us here . The fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , long-suffering , gentleness , , goodness , faith , meekness , temperance . " No human /z/ bosom can be so happy as that in which these heavenly affections are warm and active : and in the bosom of him who is a follower of that which is good , and in his only , they are actually found . 2 . As the temper and dispositions of the follower of that which is good , preserve him from harming himself , so , also , they save him from provoking others to injure him . There certainly are some injuries which are entirely unprovoked . But in a large majority of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some occasion is given to inflict them . Here , for example , is a man of an overbearing temper . He arrogates to himself what he will not concede to others . He is determined that the world shall bow to him , and not he to it . But the world , unhappily , contains too many spirits like his own . They rise in hostility against him , and in the unequal contest he is vanquished , humbled , injured . But this injury he plainly provoked and invited . Had religion been his counsellor and guide ; had he been a follower of that which is good , who is he that would have harmed him ? Again ; here is a man far less obnoxious than the one just described . He is punctiliously careful never to give an offence . But in his turn he is resolved never , passively , to receive one . He holds it to be altogether beneath a man of spirit to suffer the smallest affront to go unrevenged . What is the conseqience ? He is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iu affairs of honour ; till at last he , not improbably , /q/ terminates his life in single combat . Now , had this man been a follower of that which is good , had he learned to forgive , and not to revenge , who would have harmed him ? How much more peacefully would he have lived ; and how much more happily would he have died ? 3 . Closely connected with the last particular is the consideration , that the follower of that which is good , in addition to his avoiding every thing calculated to irritate others , , will do much to conciliate them . His character is exactly that which is the beat adapted to make others love him . He will have many and warm friends ; and , if he live long , he will , in instances not a few , disarm those that had once been hostile . All men would rather have friends than enemies . Bad men are not only willing , but often very desirous , to have the friendship of the good , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , therefore , not only be ready to accept the friendship of an amiable and excellent man , but , when it does not interfere too much with their passions and pursuits , will usually make some sacrifices to obtain and keep it . And when they do not go even this length , they sometimes choose , from the same motive of self interest , not to appear as the open and avowed enemies of such a man . It hurts themselves , by diminishing their influence and respectability . And even when they will not be restrained ; when they either secretly or openly assail him , they often find it impracticable to do him any real injury . /z/ His character defends him , and the malignant efforts of his enemies only recoil upon themselves . 4 , As the character we consider preserves its possessor from much harm , by being amiable and conciliatory , so , it is productive of the same effect , by the dignity which it confers , and the awe and veneration which it inspires . Nothing can be farther from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is good , in the manner we have described , is calculated to bring upon him who does it , the imputation of pusillanimity , meanness , or cowardice ; and to cause him rather to be despised and insulted , than respected and feared . If the character be consistently maintained ; if all the virtues which belong to it be exhibited in their just harmony and proportion , the very reverse will be the effect produced , Milduciis and majesty , meekness and dignity , temper and firmness , kindness and decision , are so fur from being inconsistent , that they are always auxiliary to each other . The genuine character we contemplate will , therefore , be as defensive as it is inIiocent and amiable . Often has the majesty of virtue overawed the profligate and profane , and been a protection to its possessor . Sinners of a common character are abashed in its presence . Ordinary vice blushes before it , and skulks into concealment . It flees from that which exposes its deformity , by contrast , as well as by verbal reproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are naturally undaunted . Guilt violates conscience , and the principles of honour and /z/ ahamc ; innocence and integrity have them all on their side . Hence , when bad men have been resolutely bent on offering personal violence , or insult , to the follower of that which is good , the very sight and presence of the good man has sometimes confounded and disconcerted them utterly . They have fled from him , or humbled themselves before him - " Surely never man spake like this man ; " said the discomfited band that had been sent to apprehend our blessed Lord . Herod , although an absolute monarch and steeped in blood and crime , yet feared John the Baptist ; for a time heard him gladly , and did many things which he enjoined . Nor was it till the wretched tyrant was inflamed by wine , intoxicated with mirth , surrounded by his courtiers , insnared by a foolish and wicked oath and seduced by an insidious harlot , that he could be persuaded to issue the murderous mandate to destroy John ; ; 0. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what his false honour drove him to perpetrate . So much is vice overawed by virtue ! So venerable and defensive is a good inan 's character ! 5 . The follower of that which is good will escape much harm , beckase he will have no connexion with the company , the places , the occasions , and the practices from which mischiefs of the most serious kind commonly arise . Examine in what places , and on what occasions , the most calamitous disasters that disturb and distress domestic and social life have most frecuently taken their /z/ rise . You will find that they have sprung from places of rioting and drunkenness , chambering and wantonness ; from the midnight reel ; from lawless or excessive indulgence ; or from the company and counsels of wicked men . The gaol and the gibbet are furnished from tippling houses , and taverns , and brothels , and the influence of vile associates . The murders - for murders they strictly are - which are committed in the infernal practice of duelling , may often be traced to parties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conversations where the spirits are unduly excited , and the passions inflamed by intemperance . Who hath wo ? who hath sorrow ? who hath contentions ? who hath babbling ? who hath wounds without cause ? who hath redness of eyes ? They that tarry long at the wine ; they that go to seek mixed wine - At the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder . " Ah ! how many a broken-hearted parent , how many a disconsolate wife , how many a ruined child , has been indebted to scenes , and associates , and causes , such as we have here noticed , for calamities which , to the end of life , they have had to lament , without being able to remove ! It is obvious , without remark , that from this whole host of harms and evils the follower of that which is good will be absolutely free , and completely secured by the very character he possesses . 6 . Who will harm the follower of that which is good , when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his country ; and so observant of what is due to /q/ magistrates and superiors ? When it is said - " but and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake " - it is strongly intimated that a good man will suffer for nothing else . He will never , while he acts in character , do any thing for which it will be right that , from the hand of man , he should suffer . For he will obey scrupulously and exactly every known law of his country , not inconsistent with the laws of God ; and this not merely through fear , but also " for conscience sake . " It is nothing to him though he could violate or evade a law of the land , without the possibility of discovery . His conscience gives him a law which is superior to all others ; and which sanctions air others , so far as they offer no violation to itself . When , therefore , human laws leave it perfectly in his power , as they sometimes may , to defraud or injure his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's conscience . He will not willingly do wrong to any man , whatever opportunity or temptation he may have to do it . For conscience sake he will , also , obey and respect magistrates . By an authority which is supreme with him he is taught to regard them as the ordinance of God . " He will therefore ' render to all their dues ; tribute to whom tribute is due , custom to whom custom , fear to whom fear , honour to whom honour . " The apostle , brethren , seems to have had the subject of this particular distinctly in his view when he penned the text : And it is seen at once , that no individual who conscientiously obeys all the laws of society , demeans himself properly to all liia /z/ superiors , and is also extensively charitable and beneficent , ever can suffer from any law , or magistracy , or human authority whatsoever , unless he suffer unjustly. 7 . I close this part of the subject with observing , that the follower of that which is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence and protection of God . This is unquestionably a doctrine of holy scripture . The providence of God , indeed , extends to all men - nay to all his creatures , whether animate or inanimate . But he is the covenant God of his people only ; and to them alone he has given assurance of a particular favourable regard . Of them , exclusively , it is said - " He that toucheth you , toucheth the apple of his eye - Yea , he reproveth kings for their sake ; saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm - The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them. * ' ' In what particular instances or circumstances the invisible agency of angels , or of the Lord of angels , is , more especially , interposed to defend and deliver his people , is unknown to them . Yet they know the fact , that such an agency is exercised . They know , also , that the superintending care of the God of providence , is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visible or invisible , shall ever be permitted to harm them , farther than he shall permit , and overrule for their good . They have an express assurance that * when a man 's ways please the Lord , he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. * ' He controls their rage ; or he /q/ inclines them to better purposes than those which they had formed against his people ; or he limits or disappoints their efforts ; , by his providential dispensations . " Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee ; the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain " - And who can destroy whom God will save ! who can harm whom omnipotence will protect ! So extensive and comprehensive , then , is the import of the interrogatory in the text . So various and numerous are the ways , in which a good man 's character and state , will prove a protection to him . Yet , after all , as already hinted , the text admits that he may * suffer for righteousness ' sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmation , that although he suffer thus , still he is happy . Here it will be proper , first , to notice the hypothetical form of the apostle 's language - ' " but and if ye suffer . " This seems to intimate that probably some of those to whom there was reference would almostj or altogether , escape suffering* And this is found in experience to be the fact Generally those suffer least , who have least to do with public concel*ns and are least exposed to publick notice . The follower of that which is good , in the quiet scenes of private life , may be so influential , and so beloved , and scatter so many blessings around him , as sometimes scarcely to know what it is to suffer for righteousness ' sake . This , however , is far from being always the even in private life ; and it is , I think , never the /z/ m /z/ case , when the good man occupies a pnblick and responsible station , and is obliged to have much to do with concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply involved . In these circumstances , no good man can reasonably expect wholly to escape the effect of unreasonable and unjust resentment . A wise and sovereign God , indeed , awards to his people their several allotments of suffering in his cause , as of every thing else . Far more is endured in one age and place than in another . And even among individuals , in the same or similar circumstances , one is grievously persecuted , and another is comparatively but little annoyed . In view of this , we can only say - Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight . " It appears , then , that no follower of that which is good ought to calculate on a total exemption from suffering , but rather to prepare to meet it patiently and firmly . Our perfect and blameless example , the Lord Jesus Christ himself , was , we know , through much of his life , in various ways , subjected to extreme suffering for righteousness ' sake ; and at last was " taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath reminded us that * ' The servant is not above his master , nor the disciple above his Lord . It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his Lord . If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household - If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you . " These words were no doubt intended /q/ to have a peculiar reference to the apostles and primitive christians ; hut the spirit of them is applicable to the followers of Christ at all times , and in all places . So that , although the character which good men possess will be a defence to them in all the ways which have been mentioned , yet this character itself may be the very cause of their suffering . They may suiTer not only although they are good , but because they are good - ' suffer for righteousness ' sake . " The conspicuous virtues of a good man form , of themselves , a reproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they keenly feel . His character reproaches theirs , and fills them with malignant hatred against him . Sometimes , too , his duty requires that he should , in words and in a personal address , reprove their vices . At other times , he is called actively and publickly to withstand them ; to expose their pernicious principles or designs , and warn others against them ; to detect their hypocrisy ; to oppose their acquisition of unjust gain , their frauds , their extortion , their avarice , their profligacy , their licentious pleasures , their ambition , their thirst of revenge . Hence , when the vicked are armed with power , they will sometimes be satisfied with nothing , short of the blood of those from whom they have met with opposition and reproof . Our blessed Lord himself , his forerunner , his apostles , and innumerable martyrs and holy men in all ages , have been examples of this truth . But when the wicked can not , or dare not , or are not disposed to take the life of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly . They slander him ; they excite and foment prejudices against him ; they combine and lie in wait to seize a favourable opportunity to injure him , to diminish his influence , to bring him into disesteem , and , if they can , to ruin him . For the most part , their iniquitous designs and attempts are , in a great measure , defeated . Truth and integrity are generally an overmatch for intrigue and falsehood . The good man 's character , as we have seen , forms a bulwark around him , which it is not easy either to force or mine . In some instances , however , they are successful , at least for a time ; frequently they do not altogether fail in their wicked devices ; and almost always they annoy and disturb the object of their hatred . Yet , in the midst of all , I affirm , in accordance with the text , that the good man is happy - enviably happy . 1 . He is happy , on the whole , in regard to his inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suffers for righteousness ' sake , his conscience can not but be his friend , and commend him decisively for doing the very things which have brought persecution on him . It is impossible , therefore , that he should feel remorse or self reproach . At times he may have some conflicts with himself , in his endeavours to preserve a christian temper , under all the unjust and cruel treatment which he receives . Yet , in general , he is tranquil ; and a peaceful and approving conscience makes him happy . Nay , in the view of all that he has done , and of all that he suffers for it , he often lifts up his heart in /q/ thanksgiving to God , for that grace which has enabled him to " keep a conscience void of offence , " and he rejoices with exceeding great joy . Verily ? it is not easy to tell how blessed a possession is this peaceful and approving conscience , of which I am speaking . It blesses by day and by night . It takes away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep refreshing . Daniel might sleep in the den of lions , and perhaps did so , while the unhappy monarch under whose order he suffered , passed a sleepless night , in reflecting on his folly and guilt . The author of our text , we know , was sleeping - mark it - " sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains " when the angel cam.e to deliver him ; although he knew that on the following morning he was to be led out to a violent and ignominious death . And both he and his fellow apostles , when they had been beaten , at the command of the Jewish rulers , " departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame , ' ' for the name of their Lord . Was it not , think you , under an impressive recollection of these very events that the holy apostle penned the text - ' But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake , happy are ye ? " Yes , he had tried it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the precious truth which he recorded . And try it whoever may , it shall always be found true , that an approving conscience will render him who suffers for righteous ness ' sake , emphatically , a blessed man . /z/ 2 . It must be so , because the good man knows that the approbation of his conscience is the approbation of God . Conscience has often been denominated God 's vicegerent . The appellation is not always just ; because conscience is sometimes misinformed and misguided , and speaks , " peace , peace , when there is no peace . " But when conscience has been enlightened by the divine law , pacified by the sprinkling of atoning blood , and conformed to the standard of gospel obedience , then its voice is indeed the voice of God . And such , as his character demonstrates , must be the conscience of every one , who is a follower of that which is good . But in addition to his general character , the very circumstance that he suffers for righteousness sake , affords him one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and that God is his friend . W hen virtue and piety are rewarded by esteem , and honour , and wealth , many appear to be virtuous and pious , who are so in appearance only , and who drop the disguise as soon as persecution threatens them . But if a man adhere steadfastly to his duty , when it subjects him to reproach , and shame , and loss , and pain , his sincerity is proved by the most rigorous and unequivocal test . He perceives this , and he rejoices in the evidence thus afforded to his own mind , that his attachment to rectitude is both genuine and stable ; and consequently that the heart-searching God approves his conduct . Now , this is precisely the situation of the good man while he is suffering for righteousness sake . /q/ He sees that he is enduring the trial of his integrity , and he feels that he is willing to abide it . He knows that God witnesses the motives by which he is influenced , is pleased with the course he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suffers . He sees that should his enemies even take his life , they would only liberate him the more speedily from all his sufferings , and introduce him at once to ineffable and endless felicity . He can therefore say with truth , that he rejoices in tribulation . ' Yes , brethren , his consolations are sometimes inexpressible - assured that the God before whom all creatures are dust and vanity , looks down upon him in his affliction with complacency , shines into his soul with the refreshing influences of his grace , takes him into sweet communion with Himself , and leads forward his views to that crowl of eternal life , which he is shortly to receive , and shows it brightened and increased in value , by the furnace of affliction through which he is now passing . Oh ! how often has this blessed and overflowing source of consolation enabled those who have suffered , even unto death , for righteousness sake , to utter the language of holy joy and triumph , while they have ascended the scaffold or been consuming at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first martyr , they have prayed for their enemies with their expiring breath ; and the agonies of a violent death have been prevented or forgotten , in a foretaste of the heaven to which they were rising - Who , then , is not prepared to say with the apostle , ' But and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake happy are ye . ' ' ? /z/ It now only remains to apply this subject - To YOU , MY YOUNG FRIENDS , WHO ARE CANDIDATES FOR /z/ The subject , indeed , would admit of a very general application , illustrative of the excellence and advantages of true religion , and powerfully recommending it to the love and practice of all men . But I have only time to say a few words to you , whom I am probably addressing for the last tim ; and for whose sake , especially , the subject has been chosen and discussed . At parting from you , I was earnestly desirous of giving you a map , so to speak , of the course which I wished you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , to engage you to take and adhere to this course . This has been my aim , in all that you have now heard . The delineation I have given , is , I know , imperfect ; but imperfect as it is , I make it over to you , and assure you confidently , that if you , realize in yourselves the character you have heard described , you will not ftiil to be happy* Your prospects and expectations are , no doubt , very various . Some of you , perhaps , are to pass your lives in retirement . Most of you , probably , are to be publick men - ministers of the gospel , lawyers , physicians , statesmen , or soldiers . But no matter what station you arc to occupy , no matter what character you are to sustain , no matter what business you are to follow , no matter what portion of talent or improvement you may possess , this subject is alike applicable , and equally interesting to you all . Every one of you may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a follower of that which is good . If you are ; you will be happy , and if not , you must be miserable . With paternal anxiety I have often warned and advised and directed you ; and with the same anxiety I now look forward to what may be before you . The first and most serious thought which strikes my mind , and which ought to affect yours , is , that God only knows who of you will live , and who of you will not live , to take an established standing in society . The catalogue of our college exhibits the note of mortality affixed to the names of a number who , a very short time since , left this place in as much health , and with as bright and cheering prospects , as any of you now possess . Some of your names , it is highly probable , will soon be marked in the same manner . Oh ! think on this - and if any of you have not yet begun to be followers of that which is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe for a day or an hour : with it you are safe , whether life or death await you . If you live , you ought to be sensible , that you can not live long without meeting with difficulties , and enemies , and sufferings . Form what plans , or take what course you may , you can not avoid them ; they will still assail you . If you are not followers of that which is good , you will find more of them than if you are ; and you will have to encounter them with every disadvantage . Remember , then , that I have shewn you the way in which you wHl meet with the smallest share of adversity J /z/ and ill which you will have the greatest support under that which is unavoidable ; nay , in which adversity itself will be made to contribute to your felicity . By taking this way , you will also take the high road to usefulness , honour and distinction . For if you act consistently , as followers of that which is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the advantages which you have derived from a liberal education . You will feel bound to make improvement in knowledge , and to employ all your knowledge for some useful purpose . The natural result of this , will be influence , esteem and honour . I do earnestly wish that these ideas were more seriously considered and regarded than thpy commonly are . Improvement in knowledge ought not to be regarded , as it commonly is , merely as a matter of taste and inclination . It is certainly more . There is , unquestionably , a 7 ? ioral obligation imposed on all who possess the means of improvement , to make improvement to the whole extent of their means . They are entrusted with a talent , for which they must render a strict and solemn account . In like manner , every mau who possesses useful knowledge , is bound , whatever be his profession or vocation in life , to employ his whok stock of intellectual strength and furniture , in the best manner he can , for the promotion of God 's glory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientiously and steadily , he will certainly be useful and respected . Commonly he will have much influence : and often he will rise to high honour and distinction . View /q/ the suTyect in this light , my young friends ; act upoa this plan ; be governed by these principles ; be consistent followers of that which is good ; and you can not fail to pass your lives happily , and to close them peacefully or triumphantly . Writers , I know there are , and some of considerable character , who have attempted to delineate a happy and useful life , without giving to religion any place in their system . And it is doubtless true that worldly honour and integrity , sobriety , benevolence , public spirit and intellectual pleasures , wll always be productive of unspeakably more enjoyment and more respect , than can be found in any course of life which excludes them , or leaves them unregarded . Yet , after all , this system is miserably imperfect : so imperfect , indeed , that we must consider that man as wretched who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his soul while he lives ; no rational hope in death ; no satisfying prospect beyond the grave . The Creator has evidently intended that man should find his highest enjoyment even in prosperity , and his chief solace in adversity , in genuine piety . For this , therefore , no human ingenuity or eiforts have ever found a substitute , and they never will find one . My dear young friends , seek no such substitute . Seek the grace of God to make you , and keep you , truly pious . Take the entire character of a follower of that which is good , as I have presented it to you , and try to make it your own . You will find that it will be more , far more advantageous ; than I have been able to /z/ represent it . If you possess it , nothing , as you have heard , will be permitted really to harm you , because the Almighty God will be your friend and protector . Oh ! may his gi'ace guide you , may his providence protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen . /z/ JFIierewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? By taking heed thereto according to thy wordJ ' JL HESE words contain a question of great importance and interest , proposed and answered under the guidance of the Spirit of infallible truth . A point thus settled can neither need , nor receive , any additional confirmation . Yet truths , unquestionable in themselves , may sometimes be greatly illustrated and enforced by example ; and the text , it is believed , contains this additional excellence . There is much reason to think , as commentators have shown , that it was the intention of the inspired Psalmist in the text , not only to publish an oracle of the Holy Spirit , but to state tht ; result of his own experience : - to declare , that having been engaged from early life , in forming his temper and regulating his conduct by the word of God , as a standard , he could now , in advanced age , confidently assure every young man that this , and this only , would be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine word begins with cleansing , or purifying , /z/ the heart ; and that then , in natural order , it directs the whole current of life and action into " a way , " free from the pollutions and the miseries of impiety and vice . Such appears to me to be the true scope and import of the text . And as the language of the inspired penman seems pla ! inly to imply , what we know to be fact , that in forming the temper and ordering the life , there are other ways , than that which is marked out in the word of God , and that all these , as being different from the safe and right way , are to be carefully and constantly avoided by the young ; it is intended to frame the whole of the subsequent discussion with special reference to this important consideration . Those who reject revealed truth , entirely and explicitly , have still their system of principles and conduct , which they denominate moraly and which they teach and recommend . Other systems there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , nor consistent th it , which occasionally obtain a great currency , even among those who bear , and who wish to retain , the christian name . To specify some of these-There is the system of those who grossly pervert or misrepresent the scriptures ; the system of mere formalists religion ; the system of sagacious worldly men ; the system of fashionable life - and besides all those who deliberately embrace any of these systems , a multitude of mankind live and act without thought and without consistency , and therefore can not be said to follow any /q/ system . Now , as society can not exist without a regard to certain fundamental principles of morals , all the classes specified , invariably profess to pay a regard to these principles . There is often , indeed , much more professed , than is either practiced or felt ; yet the principles in question must in some measure be respected by all . Truth and integrity , for example , all men , who support any pretensions to character , must treat with respect . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false systems of morals must require what the word of God requires , yet in some particulars , and those too of the highest importance , they differ from that word , and sometimes , directly oppose it . And here , precisely , lies the danger to which men in general , and young men in particular , are exposed . Youth are not only destitute of experience , but their passions are more ardent and impetuous , and of course , the temptations to vice act upon them with greater force and advantage , than at a more advanced age . And as all lax systems of morals allow a latititirde and gratification to sinful propensities , which the word of God strictly prohibits , youth are in great danger of perversion and pollution by being seduced into them ; being tempted to reject or disregard the system which they ought to adopt , beeause it is opposed to every licentious indulgence and inclination . This danger , which is common to all youth , is , if care be not taken to prevent it , rather increased than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading itself , is not without a tendency to foster some notions and feelings which do not entirely accord with the spirit of the gospel ; * the pride of science has the same tendency ; and some of the authors usually read as standards of taste and composition , to say nothing of the fashionable publications of the day , are rather calculated to cherish than to abate the evil . To prevent , as far as possible , the mischief here contemplated , as well as to subserve other important ends , the study of the holy scriptures has , for some time past , been interwoven with our whole College course ; and those who belong to the institution know , that the comments made on the portions read and recited , have been constantly directed to the vindication and enforcement of revealed truth , in opposition to infidel objections , loose principles , and unchristian practice . Still , it has appeared to me that it might be useful to sketch , distinctly and connectedly , an oiitlme of the genuine system of moral principle and action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and with a view to attempt this , the present subject of discussion has been selected . It is impossible , however , in the time alotted to this service , even to hint at all the false principles which are current in the world , and dangerous to youth . I shall attempt no more , and indeed , no more seems to me necessary , than to lay down , vei y briefly , the leading parts of the revealed system of moral and religious principle and practice ; and to mention , cursorily , as I See note G at the end ol ' the volume /q/ proceed , some of the chief errors tft which it is opposed . The whole discussion will be conducted with a special view to the benefit of the youth of this institution , and particularly of those who are on the point of leaving it ; and yet , from the nature of the subject , much that will be said , will be equally applicable to hearers of every age and condition in life . In the prosecution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , I. What must be the origin , or vital principle , of the temper and practice of the young man , who would cleanse and take heed to his way , according to the word of God . II . The manner in which he must receive that word , and be taught and governed by it . III . How he must estimate and perform the several duties which he owes to God , to himself , and to his fellow men . IV . The means he must use to secure an effectual attention to his duty , and steadfastness in its performance . I. The temper and practice of the young man , who would cleanse and take heed to his way , according to the word of God , must have their origin , or vital principle , in the renovation of his heart and nature . That man is by nature wholly depraved and prone to evil , and that , therefore , he must be renewed in the spirit of his mind , before he can be morally pure in the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctrine taught , or implied , in every part of the bible . The written word of God , in the time of the Psalmist , could not have consisted of more than the Pentateuch ; /z/ // or five books of Moses , the book of Job , perhaps the books of Joshua and Judges , and some of his own inspired Psahns . But even in this small portion of the sacred volume - small indeed , in comparison with that which it is our happy lot to possess - the doctrine of man 's natural depravity , and consequent need of renovation , might easily be learned . Of those who lived before the general deluge , Moses had recorded , that ' * the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually " - implying , not only that his conduct was impious , but that his nature was radically corrupt . In the book of Job , if that book was then extant , it had been written " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is born of a woman that he should be righteous ? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one . " The Psalmist himself , it is plain , had fully learned this doctrine , that man is deeply polluted in his moral powers , and that he needs the omnipotent energies of divine grace to cleanse him . Of this there is abundant evidence in various parts of his writings , particularly in the 51st psalm ; in which , after tracing the dreadful guilt with which his conscience was then burthened to the seat of it , in a corrupt nature , he fervently prays - " Create in me a clean heart , O God , and renew a right spirit within me . " There is , also , the best reason to believe that the primary and essential part of the cleansing of which he speaks in the text , was , in his view of it , to /q/ take place in the heart , naturally so corrupt and defiled ; that thus , the fountain being purged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the New Testament , this truth , like most other revealed truths , is taught with greater fulness and clearness than in the old . " Either make the tree good and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by his fruit . A good man , out of the good treasure of his heart bringcth forth good things ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things . Thou blind Pharisee ! cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter , that the outside of them may be clean also . The sons of God - were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . Verily , verily , I say unto thee , except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . That which is born of the flesh is flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be born again . The carnal mind is enmity against God , not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be . If any man be in Christ he is a new creature , old things are passed away , behold all things are become new . " In this manner , the abundant and unequivocal language of the New Testament teaches that man is depraved throughout ; that none of the race escapes the dreadful and deadly contamination ; that the seat of it is the heart ; and therefore that the work of cleansing // must begin here ; that no external rites nor mere human efforts , will ever effect it , but that we must look for its performance to the power and Spirit of God . The friends and advocates of false and imperfect systems of religion and morals always hate , and often bitterly oppose this doctrine . But it is , as we have seen , a part of the trutli of God ; and observation and the history of the world tend to illustrate and enforce it powerfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the vital spring of all genuine piety and true christian practice ; as well as the most sure and solid basis of pure morals . To attempt to make a man truly good without this inward cleansing , is like endeavouring to make a bad tree bear good fruit ; or like attempting to purify the streams which constantly flow from a polluted fountain . Remember , then , that if you would effectually cleanse your way , and take heed to it according to the word of God , you must seek the grace and aid of his Holy Spirit , to transform your hearts , and implant there the living principle of holiness ; as that which is essential to a life conformed in all things to his revealed will . Never foi*get that , not only an outward , but an inward purity is necessary ; that , not only reformation , but regeneration , is indispensable ; that , without a cordial love to the law of God , its outward observance will always be constrained and irksome ; that obedience to it never can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sight of God , it never can be real or acceptable ; for it /q/ is the heart that the heart-searching God always regards . Keep in mind that a new and clean heart is the source of all evangelical repentance for sin ; of all genuine and saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ ; of all the graces of the Spirit ; and of all the best and most powerful springs of moral action , and christian deportment , - of a blameless , amiable , exemplary and useful life . II . The man wlio takes heed to his way according to the word of God , must receive that word as his standard of duty and action in all things ; and adhere to it , in opposition to all contravening opinions , authority , or example . This position is but a varied expression of the leading idea held forth in the text ; and yet no individual will act in full accordance with it , who is altogether a stranger to that great change of which 1 have just spoken , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he in whose heart the fountain of depravity has been healed , will , with readiness and pleasure , make revealed truth , in very deed , " the man of his counsel , ' ' and the guide of his life . He wiW be able to say with the penman of the text - " The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether : more to be desired are they than gold , yea , than much fine gold ; sweeter also than honey and the honey comb : thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors. * ' A book which both interests and instructs us we commonly read rapidly , carefully , and repeatedly . Such a book will the bible always be , to the man in whom the work of sanctification is begun . Hence he /z/ will speedily become familiar with its contents , and will well understand its leading doctrines and precepts . He will thus have his criterion of truth , and rule of duty always at hand , and ready to be applied as circumstances may require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be able to bring all questionable principles and practices to an infallible test . The man we contemplate , will make a vigorous use of his reason to ascertain , and , as far as he can , to comprehend and explain what the scripture teaches ; but he will never think it a proper exercise of his reason to controvert , oppose , or modify , any thing that it teaches . There are , my young friends , two great inquiries , relative to matters of religion , into which all others may be resolved . The first is - Are the scriptures the word of God ' ? The second - What do the scriptures teach ? * We are to make the best use of our reason , of which we are capable , to answer both these inquiries . ' &#9830; ' Reason , * ' remarks one who had examined this subject deeply and accurately , " Reason is , primarily , no more than the test or touchstone of evidence ; and in a secondary sense only the standard of truth ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or false , which the competent evidence proves to be the one or the other . If , in the present case , reason , after fully and candidly examining the evidence - evidence drawn from every source - r ' See note G at Ihe end of the volume i Doctor George Campbell . /q/ decide that there is not ground to believe that the scriptures are the word of God , then they have no authority whatsoever , more than other human productions . But if , on the contrary , the evidence is found to be irresistibly conclusive , that the scriptures are the word of God reason , having ascertained this , can not legitimately controvert that word for a single moment ; but must take it exactly as it is ; must labour to understand and explain it , as far as practicable ; and when she can go no farther , must reverently submit her powers to the authority of God . In a word , the proper office of reason here , is precisely the same that it is in relation to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , are very numerous . She is to take facts as she finds them , explain and harmonize them as far as she can ; and when she can do no more , fairly acknowledge her ignorance or weakness ; and wait for more light in this world , or for more strength in the world to come ; recollecting , that at last , and to all eternity , finite reason , or intellect , will never be able to comprehend more than a little , comparatively a very little , of that which is infinite . To act differently from this is manifestly to act most irrationally and impiously ; for it is , in the indulgence of a proud and self-suflicient spirit , to follow the uncertain guidance of that twinkling ray of intellect which our Maker has given us ; in preference to the unerring guidance of that infinite fountain of intellectual light , of which He is the source and centre , and from which our feeble beam of reason has been derived . /z/ Can we be more certain of any thing , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and do we not know , by much sad experience , tliat the conchisions of our own reason are not always true ; that they are often erroneous and dekisive ? Is it not then , I ask - all duty apart - is it not one of the plainest dictates of reason itself , always to trust God in any thing that he has revealed , rather than to trust ourselves , in any reasoning against it ? Reason dictates , too , that we should be deeply grateful to God , that he has not left us , as the wisest of the heathen were left , to wander in endless uncertainty , in regard to religions truth and duty ; but has told us plainly in his infallible word , what is truth , and what is duty . Are there some things in that word the comprehension of which transcends our powers ? That very circumstance goes to show that the word of God is like all his other works , and by doing so , increases its credibility . ' Unsearchableness to human faculties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , ' * is a sort of signature , impressed on the works of the Most High ; and which , when found in any thing attested as from him , ought to be held at least a presumption in favour of the testimony . ' ' It is , therefore , no objection to the humble christian , but the contrary , that he can not fully explain , or comprehend , how it is , that in the perfect unity of the divine essence , there are three distinctions , usually denominated persons - Father . Son , and Holy Ghost . DISCOURSE IV . 9f He receives this truths without difficulty or hesitation because he finds it unquestionably taught by the word of God ; and he applies it to the great and important practical purposes to which that word directs him to apply it For the same reason he believes that the divine and human natures were united in Jesus Christ ; and on this , as the gospel teaches , he founds the mediatorial character of the Saviour ; and the great doctrines of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believers , by the imputation of his righteousness . He delights exceedingly to observe that the pel , manifestly considering the Redeemer as God , as well as man , abounds in representations of Him as om* nipotent , omniscient , and omnipresent ; always with his people ; alwaysL protecting them ; always helping them ; ready to sustain them even in their dying hour ; - - to take them to his blissful presence ; to raise their bodies at the last day ; to acquit them in the final judgment ; and to receive them , glorified in body and soul , to share with Himself the endless and ineffable bliss of the heavenly state . Once more ; it is no stumbling block to him who takes revealed truth exactly as he finds it , that he is not able fully to explain the connexion which subsists between the perfect freedom and accountableness of man , and the absolute sovereignty of the grace and providence of God . He will find , upon due examination that there is a depth in this subject , as in many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore /z/ must adventure with caution , and beware not to proceed too far . His principal concern will be to understand what is practical ; and this , with the right temper of mind which he possesses , he will not find difficult . He will not want arguments to convince him that he is a free and accountable creature , because he is conscious of it - he feels that he is so ; and because he perceives that the scriptures continually suppose it , and that the whole organization and arrangements of human society are , and must be , built upon it , as a conceded , or self-evident truth . At the same time , his own experience , as well as the unerring word , dll teach him , that he is entirely dependent on divine grace , for every right and holy exercise of his mind ; and for strength and ability properly to discharge every duty . He can cordially subscribe to the apostle 's declarations - - By grace ye are saved , through faitli , and that not of yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves , but our sufficiency is of God . ' ' Let others , then , explain this subject as they like , or lose themselves in it , as they often do ; or let his own speculations on it be what they may , still he has for practice , which he chiefly regards , a plain and satisfactory rule of duty - a rule dictated by common sense and experience , and sanctioned by the word of God , namely , that he is entirely ' responsible for all his voluntary actions , thouglits and desires : and that he is to look to God , sensible of an entire dependence on /q/ him , for grace and assistance to think , and will , and act aright , at all times and in every duty . In regard to the providence of God , he is fully persuaded that all events past , present and to come , have been , are , and will be , perfectly subject to its direction or control ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that all moral beings ever have been , and ever will be , as fully and justly accountable for their conduct , as if this providence could be supposed not to exist . It deserves particular notice , that he who takes the plain word of God for his guide , never can adopt or think favourably , of that half atheistical notion , that the divine providence is nothing more than some general ordering of the laws of nature , or the destinies of nations ; so that many things fall out , in the affairs both of communities and individuals , without any special direction , control or care of the Deity ; many things , in a word , that must be attributed to accident or chance . No truly ; he believes , and it is delightful for him to believe , that in regard to this matter , there is no such thing as accident or chance . That every thing , whether great or small , is ordered or permitted by God ; that in God he lives and moves and has his being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all numbered ; " and that " a sparrow falleth not to the ground without his Heavenly Father . " Here is the stable foundation of his habitual trust in God ; and here is his encouragement to pray for providential protection and favours , both for himself and others . /z/ Thus , I hope , it appears - for I am solicitous that to you it should appear - that he who walks simply by the word of God as a rule of duty , does not act blindly , or weakly , or irrationally , as is sometimes supposed and said ; but , on the contrary , that he , of all men , makes the most proper use of reason in matters of religion . But , in closing this part of the subject , I must distinctly remind you , though the thought has several times been hinted , that , with the man we contemplate , iligion , in all its parts , is ever a practical , more than a speculative subject . He studies it , and examines it , and thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He labours to ascertain the truth that he may conform his heart and his life to its dictates ; and he is much employed in endeavouring to render this conformity more and more exact ; more advanced towards that perfection after which he aspires , but which he expects not to reach , till " mortality shall be swallowed up of life . " We must also particularly remark , that the man who leanis from the bible the importance of piety , will learn from the same source , in what manner its spirit is to be regulated , and its duties performed . Hence he will avoid formality , on the one hand ; and fanaticism on the other . Formality leaves the heart out of the exercises of religion ; and makes the whole to consist in intellectual attainments and exterior observances . Fanaticism indulges the alTections and the imagination , to the neglect and violation of reason , decorum and the word of God . But he who in all things endeavours to /q/ keep close to that word , will rigorously subject his fancy and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly strive to serve his Maker in spirit and in truth . While his heart is in all his religious exercises and duties , his understanding , enlightened and directed by scripture , will never permit him to exceed those bounds of fervency which scriptural example and instruction clearly warrant ; nor will it ever suffer him to listen to any pretensions of new revelations from others , nor to expect , nor even desire them for himself . All the revelation that he admits is in his Bible . This he holds sacred and holds fast , without suffering any addition to it , or diminution of it . , By this he tries himself and tries others ; his state toward God ; the exercises , views , suggestions , workings or feelings of his own mind ; and all that , on the subjects of religion and morals , he either reads in , books , or hears from human lips . III . Let us now consider , more directly and fully , how this man will estimate and perform the several duties which he owes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 . He will be attentive to the right order and relative importance of his various duties , and be careful to place in the first rank those which he owes immediately to God . The order and relative importance of our several duties , is a matter of far greater moment than seems commonly to be apprehended . False and imperfect systems of religion and morals , usually dwell much on what men owe to themselves , and to each other ; and , very little comparatively , on what they owe to God . /z/ It is their favourite representation , indeed , that our Maker is , iij general , best served by taking care of ourselves , and by doing good to his creatures . Now , in this there is something extremely specious , and yet entirely fallacious . The error may , perhaps , be best exposed by remarking , that , while we readily and fully admit , that to consult our own true happiness , and that of our brethren of mankind , constitutes , indeed , an important part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so ; yet that it can be shown , both from reason and experience , that those are most likely to be eminent examples of personal and social duty , who are most sensible of what they owe immediately to their Maker ; who are most exact and fervent in their worship of Him , and most employed in holy communion with Him . It is certainly natural and reasonable to expect that they who by habitual intercourse with the Father of their spirits , become , as they evidently must become , most impressed with a sense of his universal presence , of his glorious majesty and supreme authority , of his boundless goodness and infinite amiableness , should be most exact and active in obeying all his commandments , and among the rest those which require them to " make their light shine before men , and to do good and communicate . " Or if the a ) peal be made to experience , we may safely challenge any opponent to point us to higher and better examples of excellence in , personal character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than have appeared among men of eminent piety . In giving rank and consequence , therefore , to his several duties , he who walks by the word of God as his rule , will carefully follow the example which the Deity himself has set in the Decalogue , and which our Saviour regarded in declaring which was the first and greatest commandment . His duties to his Maker will have the first place in order and importance . Piety to God he will consider as the leading and essential part of his morJ system , and as affording the best security for a sacred regard to every otherIt is not my intention , however , to extend the present discussion to a particular enumeration and explanation of the duties w hich we owe immediately to God . Some of them will necessarily claim our attention , while speaking of the duties which we owe to ourselves and to each other . But it will be observed , that almost the whole of what has been said relates to the duties which we owe to God ; so that supposing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther specification is not important . Suppose a man to be renewed in the temper of his mind ; to have obtained a familiar acquaintance with the scriptures ; to regard and be governed by them in the manner that has been described ; to hold the fundamental doctrines which have been mentioned ; and to consider his duties to God as primary in their obligation , and importance ; and he can neither be ignorant of /z/ these duties , nor of the manner in which they may be acceptably and profitably performed . Of modes and forms of worship , and of church order , it is neither my duty nor my inclination to speak on this occasion . Yet I must not forbear to remind you , that it is a gross and pernicious error to suppose , that all who may call themselves christians , hold every thing that is essential to Christianity . Li the christian system there are essential doctrines and essential duties ; so that whoever deliberately denies the one , or habitually violates or neglects the other , is utterly unworthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship and church order , which are so far from being essential , that men of perhaps equal holiness of heart and life have differed widely , in making a choice among them . In regard to these , I have only to say , examine them carefully and candidly for yourselves , and let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind . " Having already protracted this discourse to as great a length as is customary in this place , the consideration of the duties which we owe to ourselves and to each other , must be delayed , till the usual hour of worship in the afternoon . In the mean time , meditate on what you have heard ; and may the Spirit of grace seal his own truth on each of our hearts ! Amen . /z/ JFIierewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? By taking heed thereto according to thy word . ' In discoursing on this text of sacred scripture , it has been proposed to show - I. What must be the origin or vital principle of the temper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take heed to his way , according to the word of God . II . The manner in which he must receive that word , and be taught and governed by it . III . How he must estimate " and perform the several duties which he owes to God , to himself , and to his fellow men . IV . The means he must use to secure an effectual attention to his duty , and steadfastness in its performance . On the two former of these heads of discourse the discussion was finished in the morning . We also entered on the consideration of the third : and here , as the first thing demanding attention , I endeavoured to show , that the voung man who would take heed to his way , /z/ according to the divine word , must be careful to make a right estimate of the rehitivc importance of his various duties , and to place in the first rank those wliich relate immediately to God . We are now 2 . To consider those which he owes to himself and to his fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to each other , are , in many cases , so intimately blended together , that to attempt to give them an entirely separate treatment might produce both obscurity and repetition . We will endeavour to take them in such order as shall seem most favourable to clearness and utility . I begin with stating , that the young man who takes heed to his way according to the word of God will cherish a sacred and inviolable regard to truth . The obligations of truth in general are admitted by all , and the notorious violator of it never fiils to be reckoned infamous . No character is more universally detested and despised than that of the liar ; and hence no offence is reckoned more intolerable than the imputation of this character . This notwithstanding , loose moralistg are usually found to reldx , in many instances the obligation of truth . Courteous falsehoods , jocular falsehoods , humane falsehoods , temporary falsehoods , and if the expression be not a solecism , useful falsehoods , they do not condemn , but often justify . Not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of that God whose character it is , that he can not and will not lie . Without doubt the degrees of guilt involved in /q/ different acts and kinds of falsehood are widely different ; and it must be admitted that there are some nice and difficult points wliich may be stated in relation to this subject . But those who found virtue on the nature and will of God can not , after all , admit the innocence of intentional falsehood in any case whatever . And indeed if the obligation to regard truth be derived from utility alone , this will dictate an invariable adherence to it . Such an adherence will not only most effectually secure pence of conscience and inward quiet , but will also contribute greatly to give weight and respectability to the whole character ; and thus to increase the capacity for usefulness in him who exhibits it . Integrity is closely connected with truth . Often , indeed , integrity is nothing else than action conformed to the dicta.tes and obligation of truth . The man who habitually lives and acts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of giving an account to God for all his actions , can not fil to be upright . He will avoid all guile , and fraud , and unfaitlifulness , and dishonesty , whatever prospect of gain may tempt him to practice them ; or however much he may have it in his power , should he yield to temptation , to escape shame , or punishment , or the loss of character , from his fellow men . His inquiry will always be , how can I answer , in this concern , to my conscience , and to the all seeing God ? not , what colour can I give it ? or what defence can I make for it , before the world ? Hence he will be scrupulously just in all his dealings and /z/ transactions with others . He will walk strictly by the rule of doing as he would be done by . He will be much more afraid of doing wrong , than of suffering wrong . You may trust him without reserve . He will never take an advantage of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contracts he holds sacred , and fulfils them in their true intention , as well when the law can not touch him , as when it can . He punctually performs all his promises and engagements . He ranks the demands of justice , before those of mercy , or liberality , and is therefore just before he is generous . Money that he owes , he never considers as his own . Money that is entrusted to his keeping , he feels no liberty , without the consent of the owner , to apply , in any way or degree , to his own benefit . In dubious matters he always endeavours , as far as possible , to keep on safe ground - knowing that , to a prudent man , it is much to be safe ; and that to an upright conscientious man , it is much to be#without fear or suspicion , that he has done wrong . He discharges every official duty , and performs every professional service , and executea every public and private trust , diligently , faithfully , seasonably and fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to man . " Characters like this are indeed rare ; but he who takes heed to his way according to the word of God , ill demonstrate that such a character is not always imaginary . He will exhibit it in himself . /q/ Farther ; the man who makes the word of God his guide , will unite a steadfast adherence to what he believes to be truth and duty ? with the exercise of candour and charity toward those who differ from him . We are commanded " to buy the truth and sell it not ; also wisdom , and instruction , and understanding . " We are exhorted " earnestly to contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints . " He who is obedient to these injunctions of scripture , never can admit that intellectual error is always innocent ; that it is no matter what a man believes if his life be good ; that any system of religious opinions which a man honestly holds , must be safe for him , and many sentiments of a kindred spirit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of comparatively little importance to discover truth or to embrace it : to contend for it would be folly ; and to search much after it would be useless trcuble . But the notions in question contravene , not merely particular passages , but the whole scope and spirit of scripture , which go to teach us the infinite importance of true religion , ) in opposition to that which is false and delusive . He , therefore , who is governed by scripture can yield to no such opinions as these , whatever currency they may obtain , or by whatever imposing appellation they may be distinguished . He will neither adopt these opinions , nor act so as to have it understood that he considers those who have embraced radical errors as being in a good and safe state . He can not do this . Do you ask , then , in what respects his candour and charity will manifest /z/ themselves ? I answer ; he will recollect that , although there are essential errors , yet that all error is not essential ; he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of small comparative importance ; for that also which is fairly imputable to education and to prejudice . Those who err through temptation , or any circumstances calculated to lead them astray , he will regard with compassion and treat with lenity . He will never contend about trifles . He will cordially embrace in his christian charity all who appear to hold the essentials of religion , and to love and serve the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth . He will even mourn for the divisions that exist among christians of tiiis character , and do all that he can to heal them . And toward those who hold the most destructive errors , he will be careful to guard against all bitterness of spirit ; all unchristian temper and language in his treatment of them . As he will not hate them , nor wish evil to them , he will show them every civility and kind attention which he can , consistently with steadfastness in duty ; so that it shall be manifest that he differs from them on principle and with regret ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and take such ground as would permit him to receive and treat them as brethren . It is thus that he will unite inflexible attachment to essential truth , witli the candour and charity which the gospel Requires . DISCOURSE V. Ill Again ; he who is careful to cleanse his way according to the word of God , will most vigilantly guard himself against those ' ' jieshlij lusts that war against the soul. * Flee youthful lusts/ ' is the apostolick injunction delivered to a young man ; and he who makes the word of God his rule of action will regard it as strictly binding on the conscience . Though corrupted nature , therefore , plead for licentious indulgence ; though youth lie the season when temptations to it are the strongest ; though fvishionable opinion attach little or no inf.imy to such indulgence ; though even the sneer and ridicule of the licentious themselves must be borne by him who scruples it ; still , he whom we contemplate will say , with a young man of old , " how can I do this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , shun the places , the amusements , the visible objects , the company and conversation , the books , and even the cherishing of those imaginations , which put his chastity and personal purity at hazard . Agreeably to the Apostolick precept already recited , he will literally jiee from all temptations which assail him on this quarter . Some vices may be boldly met , contended with , and conquered ; but from all provocatives of impure desire and indulgence , safety is to be sought , whenever it is practicable , by flight . Again ; no one who takes the scriptures for a rule of life can indulge in idleness . It is so reproachful to those who bear the christian name , that when the church was gathered from amongst the heathen , the /z/ apostle Paul gave commandment , that if any man would not work neither should lie eat . No human being is entitled to be idle . His Maker has given him faculties which he is bound assiduously to cultivate , and appointed him duties , for the diligent performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims on all its members , from which no individual can plead an exemption . But , though idleness is criminal at any period of life , it is peculiarly so in youth . This is the period which specially calls for improvement and exertion , because , if neglected now , the neglect can never afterwards be fully repaired . Every subsequent period will have duties and demands of its own to fill it up : and if we have to prepare for action when we ought to be in action , we sustain a certain loss : we accomplish less than we ought to have accomplished , and we lose advantages which may never again occur . All our faculties , moreover , become torpid by disuse and inaction . If this takes place in youth , it often proves entirely fatal to all improvement , usefulness , or respect : the idle youth becomes in manhood , a useless and contemptible drone . Generally , indeed , the event is even worse than this . Idleness is the inlet of every vice . Into the unoccupied mind every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The youth , therefore , who takes heed to his way according to the word of God , will never think it innocent to be idle . He will view his time as one of the most precious talents with which God has intrusted him . and he will occupy /q/ with it unceasingly . He will make conscience of being diligently employed . He will beware , too , of a kind of busy idleness : that is , he will not only be always doing something , but something that w ill turn to account . He will be diligent in his proper employment , in acquiring the knowledge , the ability , the preparation , which his profession in life will require ; or which will qualify him for the greatest usefulness in that sphere of life in which he expects to act . Again ; the young man who takes the word of God for his rule , will feel himself bound to withstand the dictates of malignant and vindictive passions and to cultivate those of an opposite character . Envy , and anger , and malevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bosom . A false maxim of the world may tell him that " revenge is sweet , " ' and false honour may require that he should take personal vengeance for every insult . But the gospel will have taught him that forgiveness is sweet ; that it is a duty which he who refuses to perform , forfeits his hope of salvation ; that he is not to return evil for evil ; that he is to love and pray for his enemies ; and that ' * vengeance belongeth unto God . " He will , therefore , never be a duellist , whatever may be the consequences of refusing a challenge . The law of God is , with him , paramount to the laws of false honour - I say q false honour 5 for the law of God and genuine honour can never militate . And that surely must be false honour which requires a man , not only to disobey his Maker , but to /z/ act in violation of the fundamental principles of society ; in a manner , too , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the horrible practice alluded to , kills his neighbour ; and which frequently also , inflicts the most grievous and incurable anguish , and sometimes poverty and helpless wretchedness , on the innocent , amiable , and virtuous relatives of him who has fallen . Assuredly the man who takes heed to his way according to the word of God , can bear anij thing that lie may sufler with innocence , rather than incur the guilt and remorse which he must incur , by making himself responsible for such dreadful evils . But let a man act with entire consistency ; let him show himself a christian in his whole temper and deportment ; and he may decline peremptorily the murderous practice of duelling , without any real loss of character . The men of false honour can not , if they try , make him infamous . With the exception of the most abandoned , they will themselves secretly respect and venerate him ; and the love and applause of the good and pious he ' will certainly secure . Nothing is more erroneous that to suppose than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not consistent with the most genuine magnanimity . They are not only consistent with it , but they are its best support and its brightest ornament - In accordance with this , I observe farther ; that the young man who takes heed to his way according to the word of God , will aim to be distitiguishcd for every excellent and praise-worthy /q/ aftaimneftt . Nothing is more injirioiis to ingenuous youth , than to imbibe the notion , , that fervent piety is inconsistent with aiming at distinction in intellectual improvement , and honourable action . The enemies of religion are fond of inculcating this notion , but observe how the language of inspiration exposes its fallacy - " Whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report , if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things . ' ' What can any mind , influenced by a laudable emulation , desire more than this ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is virtuous , and all that is worthy of praise ? The error on this subject may sometimes arise from the circumstance , that the gospel gives no countenance to that idolatry of fame and distinction , so often observed in mere worldly men , and which they sometimes openly avow . The gospel teaches us to make the glory of God and the good of his creatures the object of supreme regard ; and that to these we must be willing to sacrifice every thing that comes in competition , even character and life itself . Now , as this is a requisition evidently reasonable in itself , so , I affirm , that it is one which points to an act of the most genuine magnanimity . It has been well said , that " nothing is truly great , the contempt of which is great . " But , the slave of human opinion is always reckoned a despicable character ; and /z/ to rise superior to tliat opinion , however general , when it is manifestly wrong , as it is in the case contemplated , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . And it is precisely this , which is required of the christian . But his rule of duty is , as we have seen , not hostile , but friendly and favourable , to all the habits , and all the exertions , which lead to high attainments in every thing excellent . Accordingly we find , in fact , that men of distinguished piety have often held the highest rank in literature and science , and in every honourable trust and employment . He , therefore , who takes the word of God as his rule , will find himself not only permitted but required , to cultivate his faculties with constant diligence , and to aim steadily and vigorously at the best attainments of which he is capable , that he may be prepared to serve God and his generation witli the greatest efiect , and the best title to reputation . He who thinks or acts otherwise , mistakes his christian duty , as much as he mistakes what is conducive to his interest or advantageous to his character . This leads me to remark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God for his rule of duty , will learn that he is bound to devote himself to the promotion of the best interests of mankind . We have already glanced at this ; but it is a point which ought to be made prominent . The example of Christ should be carefully studied and copied by all his disciples . He was the living Word of God ; and the pious and elegant Home seems to intimate that He is distinctly referred to in /q/ the text . ' He , " says Home , " who became man for our salvation , passed through this state of youth undefiled ; that he might , as it were , redaim and consecrate it anew to God . Let every young man often meditate on this circumstance . " To set us a perfect example was not , I apprehend , the only , nor the chief purpose , of our Lord 's appearance in the flesh . Yet it was , doubtless , one purpose , and an important one . Now , this example , as it was exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus epitomized by an inspired speaker - " He went about doing good . " This , too , was eminently characteristic of his apostles , after his death ; and it must , in their proper measure , characterize his sincere followers , in every age . I take it , indeed , to be one distinguishing feature of the Bible system of ethicks , that it inculcates a benevolence warmer , purer , more active , and more extensive than any other system . The influence of the gospel has abated the ferocity of war , and filled Christendom with hospitals , poor houses , and charitable associations ; institutions unknown to the most refined nations of heathen antiquity . In a word , the gospel every where breathes a spirit and speaks a language like this - Look not every man on his own things , but every man , also , on the things of others . Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus . " The young man , therefore , who takes his views of life as here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living must be to do good : and this , if he drink deeply into /z/ the spirit of the gospel , will be the ruling principle of his soul . Fame or reputation may follow him if it will , and it often will . But so fur from making it the supreme object of his regard , he will be afraid of being unduly governed by it ; afraid lest , by too nuich mingling with , it should debase , the high and holy motive which ought to influence him - a desire to imitate and obey his Redeemer , in glorifying God and in doing good to man . Feeling strongly this desire , he will consult how he may , in every way , most extensively promote the best interests of mankind ; how he may advance both their spiritual and tem ) oral happiness . The result will be a vigorous and persevering activity in endeavoui'ing to extend the blessings of the gospel ; to promote learning and science ; to aid all charitable designs , and humane and benevolent enterprises and institutions ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible ; - of a few , if not of many ; - of one , if not of more . It seems scarcely necessary to guard what I have just said by remarking , that an ardent desire to promote the welfare of mankind at large , ought never to interfere with the reasonable claims of those who are more nearly connected with us . Till these claims have been fairly satisfied , or provided for , we are certainly not permitted to indulge in a difl'iisive liberality . He who is devoted to doing good , must never neglect to make a suitable pro ision for himself , for his family , and for all who are dej ) endent on him , or who have a right to look /q/ to him for support or assistance . Tliese have been placed by the God of providence more immediately under his care ; and it is by benefiting them , by promoting as far as possible their temporal and eternal well being , that a large and essential part of the good , which he can ever do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man would take effectual care of his own family , and do all that he might in the several smaller departments of society in which he has most influence , the demand for general beneficence would be greatly diminished . This is worthy of remembrance . But , in truth , there is comparatively little danger that a man will not reserve a sufficient portion of his property for the use of himself and his kindred . Almost the whole danger is of the other extreme - that he will be selfish , covetous and contracted . More than a hundred examamples of this are seen , for one where a man defrauds or injures his family by giving too largely to charitable objects . The duty that he owes to his familij , is the miser 's standing plea for hoarding his wretched pelf . But he who takes the Bible for his guide will consider himself as the steward of Gods boimty in all that he possesses ; and he will give no more to his children , or relatives , than , in the exercise of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the most good ; to make them the best and most usefid members of society , and the fairest candidates for a heavenly inheritance . All the rest , be it little or much , he will , without grudging , expend in acts of beneficence ; in propagating /z/ true religion ; in promoting good morals ; in enlightening the ignorant : in relieving the sick , the poor and the needy ; in protecting the helpless ; in patronizing the worthy ; in succouring the widow and the orphan ; in diffusijig happiness through every circle , great or small , in which he moves and acts : so that the world shall be the better for his being in it , and he be prepared to leave it without reluctance , whenever he shall be called to ' enter into the joy of his Lord/* ' Thus have I endeavoured to show how the young man who takes the divine word as his unerring counsellor and guide , will estimate and perform the several duties which he owes to God , to himself and to his fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . The means he must use to secure an effectual attention to his duty , and steadfastness in its performance . When a good rule of conduct has been cordially and zealously adopted , an important point is gained ; but a far more difiicult thing is still to be elTected , for such it will be found , to conform steadily and habitually to that rule , and to guard against every seduction from it . Here it is , indeed , that in every thing which relates to practice the danger of failure is the greatest . A young man may sincerely admit both the truth and the importance of all that has now been said on this subject , and yet his practice may be sadly at variance with it , in many particulars . In order actually to live as he admits that he ought , and in his /q/ deliberate purpose is resolved that he will , he must constantly and emphatically ' take heed . " This is undoubtedly implied in the text . When we are directed to take heed there is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , is to be watched against and avoided . To be heedful , is to be attentive , cautious , wary , circumspect , vigilant . To be heedless , is to be thoughtless , careless , and fearless . He , therefore , who , in the spirit of the text , " takes heed to his way , " must be deeply sensible that the path of life is beset with dangers , snares , and temptations : that he is liable to be deceived and seduced from the riorht course : or to mistake it and depart from it through inattention , or because efforts may be required in pursuing it , which he will find too painful , and too frequent , for him to make . In these circumstances , if he expects to pursue the way " of duty steadfastly and successfully , let him daily read and ponder that unerring word which he has taken for his guide . Let him set before himself the rewards and punishments which it exhibits , and yield his mind to the hopes and fears which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maxims , and directions deeply on his memory . Let him resolve all doubtful points of duty by a recurrence to his infallible test . Let him cultivate a sense of his weakness and proneness to err , and pray , daily and earnestly , for the guidance and the aids of divine grace . Let him frequently and carefully examine and compare his temper , /z/ and his whole conduct , by the standard which he has adopted . When he perceives , as he often will perceive , that he has wandered from the path of duty , or come short of its requisitions , let him lay himself open , honestly , to the reproof of the divine word . Let him humbly and earnestly seek forgiveness , and watch and pray against a repetition of his defection or offence . Let him be guarded in his whole walk , and careful of any unnecessary exposure to temptation . Li fine , with the word of God imprinted on his memory and his heart , let him vigilantly and vigorously exert himself to perform his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; trusting to the providence of God to order all his lot in life , and putting himself , in daily , solemn acts of devotion , into the divine keeping and protection . Doing this - though he will never be a perfect man , yet he will so walk by the word of God as to have an humble confidence before him , and * a peace " in his soul " which passeth all understanding . " My young friends - Candidates for the honours of this institution , in the ensuing week - It had been practicable and easy to address you in a far different manner from that which I have adopted in the discussion which has just been closed - possibly in a manner that would have been more acceptable , liut at this time I did not feel at liberty to choose other ground , than that which I have taken . Your religious instruction in this /q/ institution has been formally and solemnly committed to me . On this occasion I was to finish , as it relates to you , the discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall probably never speak again on the concerns of your souls ; - never , perhaps , after the ensuing week , meet you again , till I meet you in the final judgment , to render our mutual and solemn account ; - I for the manner in which I shall have endeavoured to lead you to God and heaven , and you for the manner in which you will have received and improved my counsels and warnings . Fearful , indeed , had been my responsibility , if I had given you any superficial view of religion and morals ; - any other view than that which , according to my best judgment , the Bible gives ; and which you have now heard imperfectly delineated and explained . Your eternal solvation , I verily believe , depends on your having such a religion , in the main features of it , as I have now pointed out ; evidenced , substantially ? by such a conduct as you have heard described . Most earnestly and tenderly , therefore , I entreat and conjure you , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seriously to heart . Suffer not the morning of life to pass , without seeking the effectual grace of God , and a vital union with Christ , as indispensable to your safety and happiness . Genius and science sometimes seem as if they invited and hastened the approach of the king of terrors . Thus it was , you know , in regard to Barratiere , and Beattie , and White , and to their names , might parental partiality be /z/ trusted , I should add another - the name of a son , whom I loved too much . That son , a few years ago , stood , exactly as you do now , to receive the farewell address of my eloquent predecessor . * But the speaker and the hearer are both gone . The president and the pupil are now together in the dust of death . Yes ; and the president and pupils who are now standing face to face , must follow them speedily - God only knows how speedily - to " the clods of the valley . " Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy blissful presence , and send for us when thou wilt . But , my young friends , not only did the high and awful concerns of your souls ' eternal welfare dictate this address , but a persuasion , also , that what you have heard , will , if duly regarded , best promote your happiness , your improvement , your usefulness , and your honour in the present life . False or formal religion may , I know , bolster up the mind in a temporary peace . But , beside the all important consideration , that the destructive delusion must vanish at death , it is , even for the present life , a cold and precarious system . It imparts little positive pleasure , and the shocks and trials of life often shake it to pieces , scatter it to the winds , and leave its wretched victims without a refuge , when they need it most . True evangelical piety , at once rational and fervent , animates and elevates the soul ; it affords , sometimes , a prelibation on earth of the pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume . /q/ heaven ; it often causes its possessor to rejoice even in tribulation ; and it gives him , generally , a peace and serenity which the vicissitudes of life can not destroy , nor lastingly impair . As , then , you would be happy , both here and hereafter , seek happiness in ' pure religion , and undeiiled before God and the Father . " In regard to improvement in all that is praiseworthy , who is so likely to pursue it steadily and successfully as he who adds to the ardent love and desire of it , which religion does not forbid , the strong motive of a conscientious discharge of duty ? Yes , my young friends , if you conduct your studies on the principles which have now been explained , you will consider it as a part of the duty you owe to God to improve your time and your talents to the utmost . You will certainly show , and I am peculiarly desirous that you should show , that orthodox principles and fervent piety are not hostile , but favourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usefulness , I am sure , will be best of all promoted by the system I have been recommending . We are ever most likely to reach that which we aim at uniformly and vigorously . Now , to be useful and to do good , is , you have heard , to be regarded as your great object in life . This will certainly gain you reputation , and ensure to you publick approbation and publick trust . In our free and happy courtry , the able man , the man of unbending integrity , the benevolent and useful man , will always be employed , and placed in publick and con- /z/ fidential stations . He will be , at once , the happiest man in domestick and social life , and the fairest candidate for his country 's honours . In a word , the more you examine it , the more you will find that the system now laid before you , best consults your whole interests , both in time and in eternity . It is the Bible system - And in hope that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may impress and remain on your memory , I now hold up before you this sacred Volume , and solemnly charge you to receive and regard it as your guide through life ; and may the God of all grace enable both you and me to cleave to " the way " in which this Holy Book directs us to walk , till we meet before his throne on high ! - Amen . i /z/ For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-wardP xN this passage the apostle Paul points out the source , from which he and his fellow labourers in the gospel derived their support and consolation , amidst all the difficulties and dangers which they were called to encounter . He had just been speaking of " the trouble which came to them in Asia , " by which they " were pressed out of measure , above strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In connexion with this , and the intimation that their deliverance was in answer to the prayers of the church , the apostle introduces the text - In discoursing upon it , my purpose is to show that what St. Paul experienced , will be the experience of all , who shall act upon the same principles and in the same manner that he did . With this view , I will en-deavour /z/ I. To explain what is implied in " having our conversation in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God . " II . To show that he who has " the testimony of his conscience , " that the tenour of his life has been of this description will have a source of inward peace and satisfaction that nothing can destroy . I. In explaining what is implied in having our conversation in the world , in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , " I begin with remarking , that there is an opposition stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By noticing this opposition distinctly , by attending carefully to the contrasted terms and phrases which occur in the passage , we shall be likely to obtain the clearest and fullest views of what the inspired penman desired to recommend . What then are we to understand by ' fleshly wisdom " ? The phrase , I think , may designate two systems of conduct , both of which deserve our notice . In the Jirst place ; Jiesh is a term sometimes used in scripture to express , generally , the state of those who are destitute of true religion . Thus we are told that ' they who are after the flesh , do mind the things of the flesh , " and that " they who are in the flesh can not please God . " Fleshly wisdom , according to this sense of the term Jlesh , may signify the same as unsanctified sagacity , or mere worldly prudence . A system of action in which men , from a regard to their temporal interest /q/ solely , without any reverence for religion , may adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of advancing themselves in the world , or of securing renown with succeeding generations . There certainly appear to be some , who , either from the sentiments of a mind which naturally abhors artifice , chichane and disguise , or from the influence of education and example , maintain a character for open and upright conduct , in their intercourse with the world , while religious considerations have little or no influence on their minds . They have the good sense to discern that inflexible integrity is favourable to a high standing in society , as well as to a lasting fame . They have , also , a pride in their honesty , and they scorn to violate it . Fleshly wisdom , thus exercised , may lead , you perceive , to a degree of simplicity and sincerity of conduct , resembling that which proceeds from religious principle . The respects in which they differ , for diff'er they do , we shall afterwards consider . But secondly ; the term Jlesh is most commonly used in the sacred scriptures to denote , in a peculiar manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions and desires , of our nature . Thus it is used when it is said that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary the one to the other : " and shortly after the inspired writer adds , ' * Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these , adultery , fornication , /z/ uncleanness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envying , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like . " Hence we are required to crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts ; " and are informed that " if we live after the flesh we shall die ; but if we , throiigh the Spirit , do mortify the deeds of the body we shall live . ' ' Fleshly wisdom , according to this sense of the term Jlesh , must mean that art and management by which a worldly and wicked man , seeks the gratification of unlawful or unworthy desires , under the mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it comprehends every dishonest principle or unrighteous plan , every species of deceit , fraud , duplicity and unlawful disguise , which a vicious man may adopt or pursue , for the attainment of his selfish or wicked ends . It is this kind of fleshly wisdom that instructs a man never to utter an unwelcome truth , whatever prospect there may be of doing good by it . It teaches him always to watch the current of popular and fashionable opinion , and turn it to his own fame or interest . It leads him to temporize , and accommodate himself to whatever sentiments or practice will , in his opinion , promote his worldly advantage . It enables and disposes him to mark the oversights and weaknesses of men and to profit by them . It prepares him , in a thousand ways , to overreach and make tools of others , so as to render them subservient to his own purposes , and it disposes him never to miss /q/ the opportunity of doing it . In a word , having set up self as his idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and uses all his prudence , talents , and invention , to make every thing serve on honour it . Now , to proceed in this manner successfully , requires great skill and management ; and heuce the art is called wisdom . Its object is the flesh ; and hence it is called ( ? /i/ ? / . There is , you observe , a most material diff'erence between this character and the one before described ; though both are destitute of religion . Both are formed by a supreme regard to the things of the present life . But the possessor of the former , chuses to prosecute his views along the high road of honour and integrity ; the possessor of the latter condescends to pursue them through all the windings and labyrinths of intrigue , cunning and deception . The apostle 's character , in which simplicity and godly sincerity were conspicuous , differed essentially from both . It differed from the former , most manifestly , in the principle on which it was formed . While worldly prudence , as we have remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity is produced principally from a regard to God and eternity . You will take notice that the author of our text ascribes it to the grace of God , as the ultimate and efficient cause , that he had been enabled to pursue such a conversation in the world as he actually did . It was from this principle , as the vital root , that his unblemislied integrity sprang up and was nourished . Hence it is /z/ called a godly sincerity . The grace of God was both its origin and support . Divine grace , by transforming and renewing his mind , had taught him to ** set his affections on tilings above , and not on things on the earth . " It had taught liim to consider God as his portion , Christ as his Saviour , and the precepts of the gospel as his rule of life . It had taught him to do every thing with a view to the glory of his Creator , and with a reference to eternity . It had tinctured his whole soul with a warm love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine grace , constantly afforded , had enabled him to maintain a perpetual sense of the divine presence ; to remember that his soul was always nciked and open to the eye of that God with whom he had to do ; and that very shortly , he was to render a strict account for every deed done in the body , whether it were good or evil . By the grace of God he had been taught these things ; and by the same blessed light and influence they had penetrated deeply into his mind , and formed all its principles and habits . Hence simplicity and sincerity , in all his conversation with the world , would naturally proceed . Hence , in fact , he delivered the unadulterated doctrines of Jesus , in all their extent and purity ; without concealing any part of their nature , tendency or consequences . Confiding in the infinite power and wisdom of the Master whom he served , and that they would be exerted to gie such effect to honest endeavours as was most desirable , he refused uttej'ly the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection that God was the God of truths he would have trembled at the tliought of employing any species of falsehood or delusion in his service . For the same reason , in all the common transacJtions which form what is here called our conversation in the world , " simplicity and sincerity distinguished his thoughts , his words and his actions . His language was not a covert , dark , ambiguous set of words , that might take various senses , or be construed into any . It was the clear , plain and simple expression of what ill his soul he believed , desired and pursued . His ends and designs were not disavowed , while he prosecuted them in secret . He professed them candidly , and follov , ed them conspicuously . Such was the general conduct of the Apostle , as referred to in the text : and it differs , I repeat , from mere worldly honesty in its principle - in originating from a deep and tender sense of accountableness to God . The two systems produce , in a degree , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motives of the mind are exceedingly dissimilar . The honesty of worldly men takes its origin from a respect to the things of time , and is influenced chiefly by a regard to the opinions of men . Christian simplicity springs from the faith of tilings eternal , and regards above all things the command and authority of God . The former terminates its views in self applause or advantage ; the latter in the approbation of the Most High . The one makes the concerns of the present state supreme 5 the other makes them /z/ all subordinate and subservient to a better and an eternal state . This difference I thought it proper distinctly to exhibit , because it is real ; because it is useful to sec the various foundations on which conduct somewhat similar may rest ; and because , if I mistake not , it shows that the sentiments of honesty , candour and integrity , which are founded on religious considerations , are incomparably the most stable , extensive and durable ; and that they are those only which , with any propriety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we have no regard for God in our actions , let them be in their tendency what tliey may , it is absurd to suppose that He will accept them , in the same manner as if we had such a regard . With the heart-searching Jehovah motive gives its character to all that we do . " Tlieir works , ' ' said our Saviour , " they do to be seen of men , and verily I say unto you they have their reward . " But having given this general view of the subject , and explained the origin or foundation of Godly sincerity ; I am now to remark that it is , in a most peculiar manner , opposed to fleshly wisdom , considered as a system of deliberate deception , and was , I suppose , principally intended by the apostle to be so taken . Let us , then , for a few moments pursue this contrast , and mark a number of points in which it most remarkably takes place . These , indeed , have been in a degree anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ideas under different aspects , for the sake of a fuller iUustration. /q/ First : the ends , or objects which fleshly wisdom pursues , are kept out of sight ; while a man of real simplicity or sincerity fairly and frankly avows his aims and intentions . If the apostle had been under the influence of fleshly wisdom , as his enemies represented him to be , his object in preaching the gospel would have been personal applause , and the popular influence and respect which he might acquire by it . This would have been the real design of his labours , and his religious exhortations would have been no more than a covert vehicle , to carry him forward to this end . But , influenced as he was by simplicity and godly sincerity , he actually pursued those ends , and no other than those , which he professed to the world . An earnest desire to promote the cause of Christ and the salvation of souls , if you could have seen his naked heart , would have been found predominating there , directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering and animating his whole soul . This contrast is the same in all cases . The man of fleshly wisdom conceals his ends . They are unlawful , or mean , or in some way dishonourable and he is ashamed to reveal them . They need disguise and must be covered . The man , perhaps , is , in appearance , a flaming patriot ; while , in reality , he is only seeking power , or gain for himself . Or he is extremely civil or courteous ; and yet has no other view than to make you instrumental to his own emolument . Or he appears very fair and obliging in his dealings , and yet his real object is only to get you fully iu his /z/ power and to defraud you of what you possess . But it would be endless to enumerate all the vile purposes , which this fleshly wisdom may suggest to difi'ereut men , according to their various situations or employments in life . To all of them , however , a mind in which simplicity and sincerity reigns , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despise them all . It will permit a man to make no pi'ofessions which are not sincere . Does he profess to be a christian ? He is one in his heart . He allows himself in nothing secretly which he knows to be contrary to the gospel . He really loves religion , and from his inmost soul endeavours to obey and observe its dictates . Does he eome forward as a friend to his country ? His country 's interest is what he truly and earnestly seeks ; and no tide of popular opinion will warp him from it . He will sacrifice character and influence , when he might retain them , rather than dissemble in what he thinks would be for the public good . Does he profess benevolence ? He feels what he professes . He treats all men with kindness , because the law of kindness is in his heart . Has he assured you of his friendship ? You will never find him other than a friend ; and the most so , when you need his friendship most . Docs he seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is what he seems . There is no trap , or catch , laid to ensnare and injure you . If you understand your own interest , it will never be disadvantaged by the treachery of his offers . He is a plain meaning and a plain dealing man . lu a word , in whatever way /q/ you take him , the man of simplicity and sincerity lets you see the ends at which he really aims , as far as it is proper to disclose them ; and , without exception , he is careful not to beguile the innocent . If he has professed his views you always know where to find him . Secondly , These characters differ as much in regard to the means they use as to the ends they pursue . Nay , it is here that the characteristic opposition is , perhaps , most frequently seen . Fleshly wisdom , if it can persuade its possessor that the end is lawful , or laudable , will teach him to seek it by all the means in his power . That the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not its avowed maxim ; and it considers as an allowable , and even a commendable policy , every artifice or finess , by which a favourite purpose may be accomplished . It even treats contemptuously , those scruples , which make men hesitate and refuse to adopt unfair or deceptive measures . It attributes such scruples to weakness of mind , to squeamishness of conscience , to ignorance of human nature , to the want of understanding the management of affairs , to the want of comprehensive views ; and I know not to how many other wants which men of fleshly wisdom are always ready to impute to the man of christian sincerity . For such a man , belie , e it , must , and will forever , abhor and avoid all such disingenuity . He will esteem it a system of detestable craft and deceit , whatever specious names , or fair representations , its admirers may give it . His language will be - O my soul , come not tliou into their /z/ secret ; unto their assembly mine honour be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the most desirable and important end is to be sought by unlawful means . He will abhor the policy of doing evil that good may come ; or of professing to aim at a point which is exactly opposite to that which it is his intention if possible to reach . He will do the thing that is right , and leave the event to God . And here , let me remark , is another advantage of those who found their integrity on the principles of true religion . They have a governing conviction that there is an Almighty power , which controls and directs the affairs of men . They know that ( iod orders or over-rules all events , and that the hearts of all men are i his hand , and that he can " turn them as the rivers of water are turned . " To Him they look to give success to a good cause , when they have done their duty in endeavouring to promote it . And they are confident that He both can and will give it the issue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and therefore to make use of forbidden or disingenuous means to bring about what they esteem desirable , would be at once to violate the laws of God , and to invade his prerogative . In many instances they are sensible that it is not for them to determine what event is actually the most desirable upon the whole , nor what means will most certainly promote it . Their concern , therefore , is to abide by the plain rules of duty , leaving all consequences to Him to whom it belongs to order them according to his sovereign will . /q/ In a word , with a man of godly sincerity , there is no price that you can set upon his duty . Propose to hira any object , however valuable or desirable in itself , if the means by which it must be acquired are not lawfulj or even if they are very questionable , you will solicit him in vain . His language will be that of Job - ' All the while my breath is in me , and the Spirit of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness noi ? my tongue utter deceit . God forbid that I should justify you . Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me . My righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go . My heart shall never reproach me as long as I Jive - For what is the hope of the hypocrite , though he hath gained , when God taketh away his soul ? " Thirdly , The contrast of which I am speaking , is apparent , not merely on some particular occasions , but it is manifest in the general character of the parties who exhibit it . Fleshly wisdom itself , taken in the worst sense in which the phrase can be used , may lead a man to act as if he were honest and upright , when his worldly interest draws in that direction : and it is a wise order of providence , no doubt , that not only his ultimate good , but his immediate benefit , should so frequently urge a man to his duty . But the real integrity of the heart is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general habits of life . It is habit , especially , that marks a man 's true character . In particular acts , a good man , through the force or suddenness of temptation , may dreadfully transgress ; and a bad man , as we have just /z/ remarked , may , from a regard to his interest , appear to be honest . But it is our conversation in the worUl , " as the Apostle calls it ; our conduct taken in a complex view ; our behaviour in the various circumstances in which we are placed , in all the business we are called to perlbrm , in all the characters and relations that we sustain ; - this it is that must give us the character of simplicity and sincerity , or the reverse . Here the contrast I would exhibit is clearly and strikingly seen . Here , on the one hand , you see a man who has * a darkness of character in which you can see no heart . " He is artful , sly , deceitful , slippery , cunning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and designs , now this thing and then another , but aUvays prepared with a plausible pretext for the change ; you never know what dependance to place on his professions , or whether what he appears to be aiming at , be the real object of his pursuit , or not . Here on the other hand is an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile . " He is a plain , undisguised , frank , fair , upright , thoroughly honest man , always the same , always candid and ingenuous , you rely upon him in every thing , and you feel as safe in trusting him as in trusting yourself . Even in times of the severest trial , or the greatest danger , his integrity is as inflexible as ever . He is then supported , and fortified , and comforted with the assured hope of a better state beyond the present : for the supposition is that he has such a hope to sustain and animate him . And indeed , at such times , what could he do without it ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , what will the infidel do without it ? How will he maintain his integrity when all prospect of worldly advantage from it is taken away ? Consider him pressed by all the distresses of the present life , supported by no definite and cheering expectation in regard to futurity , having it entirely in his power to relieve himself by unlawful aid , perhaps invited and pressed to accept of that aid - will lie , in such circumstances , be found inflexible ? Ah ! it is hazardous to trust him then . It is then that the unspeakable advantages of religious integrity are seen and felt . - Thus have I endeavoured to illustrate the character of him who has his " conversation in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God . " But , it is probable , that some of you may be ready to ask - Will not the character we have heard described and recommended , render its possessor the dupe and victim of those very men with whom he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudence on all occasions , and may we not employ skill and management on many ? Is it not necessary frequently to conceal our intentions ; and sometimes to accommodate ourselves to the time , the place , the company , and many other circumstances , in which we may be called to act ? In answer to these questions , let me distinctly observe , that the character I have drawn will be greatly misapprehended , if it be considered as hostile to the most wary , prudent , and guarded conduct or be- /z/ haviour ; and therefore that it will not expose its possessor , peculiarly , to imposition and deception from crafty and designing men . It is by no means to be supposed that a character for simplicity and sincerity implies either weakness of intellect , or ignorance of the world . This , as I have remarked , is the favourite representation of rogues and knaves ; but it is just as false as the most of their other statements . Christian integrity admits , fairly , of the following things - 1 . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sentiments , or to avow our designs , when others have clearly no right or claim to know them ; and we ought to do so , when it is probable that by declaring them we should injure ourselves and do no good to others . It is upon this principle that our Saviour has grounded the injunction - " Give not that which is holy unto the dogs ; neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you . ' ' ' Upon the same principle we may in any case forbear to act , when action will plainly be without effect , and especially when it will probably increase rather than prevent or mitigate an evil . 2 . Compromise , in a qualified sense , is consistent with christian integrity . In forming and prosecuting plans of benevolence or utility , in concert with others , mutual concession is not only lawful but commendable . Without it , indeed , such plans can never be extensively formed and executed . If each individual will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will plead /q/ conscience as a bar to uniting with others , there can be no union , no co-operation , and no great good effected . Having stated fairly our own views and wishes , if we judge that integrity requires such a statement , we may lawfully lend our aid to any design or enterprise which we think beneficial or commendable on the whole - &#9632; Among things which are clearly morally evil , we are , certainly , to make no choice ; but among natural evils , or mere inconveniences , it may frequently be the part of duty , or of prudence , to choose the least ; and when we can not effect much good , we ought always to be ready to co-operate cordially in effecting a little . 3 . Skill and address in the use of lawful means are perfectly consistent with christian sincerity . It requires us neither to be blunt , nor rude . Decorum and true politeness never interfere with it , but may be made its powerful auxiliaries . It permits us to consult time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to the infirmities and weaknesses of mankind . That all this is allowable , or rather that it ought to be regarded as highly important , is manifest from what the author of our text tells us of himself . We learn from his own writings , as well as from what is related of his conduct and character in the Acts of the Apostles , that he was a man of the most consummate address ; that he paid all due deference to rank and station ; that he always consulted the characters of those to whom he spake ; that he condescended , and even conformed to many prejudices ; that he rbore to /z/ do many things that were lawful because they were not expedient ; that , in a word , he was made all things to all men , that he might by all means save some . " Thus acted the apostle Paul ; and yet , under the guidance and sanction of the Spirit of infallible truth , he penned the solemn declaration which forms our text . His whole history and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' simplicity and godly sincerity " may be united with talents and accomplishments of the highest order and of the most various kinds ; that they consist with a deep knowledge of mankind and with the greatest skill in the management of every concern ; that they are frequently an overmatch for all the subtility and malignity which can be arrayed against them ; and that they are not only defensive but highly ornamental to their possessor . Let us now consider II . That whoever has the testimony of his conscience , that he has had his conversation in the world in that simplicity and godly sincerity which has been described , will have a source of internal peace and satisfaction which nothing can destroy . That the experience of the Apostle went fully to the support of this position we have his own explicit declaration , not only in the text , but in numerous other passages of his writings . Nor was his experience , let it be observed , that of a man whose life was destitute of those trials which should give it weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , who had more /q/ opportunities to know from experience , whether godly sincerity was a never failing source of peace and satisfaction . Educated with the fairest prospects of honour and distinction among his countrymen the Jewsj he had for the sake of Christ , become an outcast from his nation , and was persecuted with the most deadly hatred . As to this world , " he had suffered the loss of all things . " The attainment of distinction and opulence , which his birth , talents and education , seem to have put in his power , he had resigned for contempt and poverty , and a life of incessant toil , anxiety and jeopardy . Hear his own account of this matter - and recollect too that it stands in the same address which contains the text . Speaking of those who insidiously endeavoured to misrepresent him with the churches , and which , in itself , was no inconsiderable trial , he says , " Are they Hebreves ? so am I. Are they Israelites ? so am I. Are they the seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ ? ( I speak as a fool , ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft . Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one . Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ; in journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren jin weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , /z/ in cold and nakedness . Besides those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches . " Such were the unparalleled sufferings and trials in which was passed , not a sliort period , but the whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a man , who , as a Hebrew of the Hebrews , brought up at the feet of Gamaliel , " once had the most flattering prospects which the united influence of birth and erudition could give , of possessing power and honour and affluence , as great as his nation could bestow . This was the man who declared that the testimony of a good conscience that he acted with simplicity and godly sincerity in all his intercourse with the world , had not only supported him under all his changes , and sacrifices , and perils , and pains , and degradations , but had enabled him to rejoice and glory amidst them all . Such an example , surely , affords a powerful support to the doctrine I inculcate . But the truth is general . Every man who acts as the apostle acted , will also be enabled to rejoice as he rejoiced . Lend me your serious attention , while I briefly explain how this happy result will always be produced . 1 . The testimony of a good conscience will not only preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he can be placed , from all self accusation or reproach , but will affoid him the sweet solacci and the powerful support of self approbation . The faculty of our minds by which we both censure and approve our own motives and conduct is conscience . /q/ But our supposition is that the party we consider hai the testimony of his conscience full in his favour . It is impossible , therefore , that he should accuse or reproach himself , since the faculty from which alone accusation or reproach could come is employed , so to speak , in an opposite direction - in acquitting and approving him . This the apostle assures us was the cause of his rejoicing ; and we see , from the very constitution of our nature , that the same effect must take place in every one who possesses the good conscience which he possessed . let a man be free from all self reproach ; let him have the entire approbation of his own mind ; let him , on the closest examination of himself and the most careful review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually rejoice , in the course he has pursued , the part he has acted and the motives by which he has been governed , and he is completely out of the reach of deep or lasting misery . Subject him to privations , burden him with cares , load him with contempt , expose him to dangers , inflict upon him bodily torments - he will feel them , he must feel them , but still he will rejoice . The surface of his sensibilities only will be touched . His inward man , the sensorium of his soul , will remain sound and whole , and full of delightful sensations . Or if , for a moment , he be shaken or agitated here , he will recover speedily , will rejoice with renewed joy , and meet the storm with increased strength and augmented firmness . It is the soul of man that feels , and the soul of this man will and /z/ must have feelings which exclude misery and make it joyful . It is in the season of severe trials that the support which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most needed and most sensibly experienced . While men are prosperous in the world they often find it practicable to lull their consciences , or to escape from them , or , by the aid of false princi ) les , to accommodate them to their wishes or their passions . But in a time of deep afiiictlon , when all outward circumstances are adverse , when the mind is cut off from all that is pleasing in the world , from all external and adventitious aids and objects , and is driven inward on itself , then it is not easy to escape from conscience , nor easy to maintain inward qu'et with a misguided conscience . Then has come the hour for reflection , and recollection , and examination and inquiry , and wo to him whose peace and contentment have rested on the sandy foundation of carelessness , or forgetfulness , or falsehood , or mistake , or ignorance , or sophistry ! He is now likely to discover that his refuge has been ' ' &#9632; a refuge of lies , " ' that he has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist the storms and billows of adversity which threaten to sweep him - and happy is he if they do not now actually sweep him - into the abyss of despair and perdition . On the other hand , the test to which adversity brings him who has the testimony of his conscience that he has /q/ had his conversation in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity , only serves to satisfy him the more fully of the rectitude of his motives and actions , and to prove to him more unquestionably that he has an unfailing source of consolation . Examination and scrutiny are always favourable to truth . They ascertain it more clearly , and fix our confidence in it more firmly . Hence the man of godly sincerity , when he examines himself closely in the season of adversity , becomes more satisfied than ever that he has acted right ; and the testimony of his conscience in his favour becomes of course more decisive , and powerful , and consoling , and enables him to say with emphasis , " I rejoice even in tribulation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we believe , on the closest and fullest examination , to be right , we must conclude to be the object of approbation with the Deity , who is perfect rectitude . But on such examination , as we have just seen , the man of godly sincerity conscientiously believes that he has acted right . His course of action , therefore , he must conclude - he can not doubt - is the object of approbation with his God . Yes , he is satisfied , he knows that God regards his uprightness with complacency . And can a mind fully persuaded of this be miserable ? Can any thing destroy the pleasure and satisfaction arising from such a persuasion ? No , brethren - Earth and hell may attempt in vain to render that man unhappy , who is justly and firmly persuaded that God is his friend . The approbation the friendship , the favour , the love /z/ of the Supreme Being , wlicn we are thoroughly satisfied they are ours , appear as much superior to any thing that creatures can give or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Possessing these , the mind can look down with a holy indifference or disregard , on all the things of time ; on all adversity , in whatever form it may come ; while looking up to God it exclaims - " Thy favour is life , and thy loving kindness is better than life - My flesh and my heart faileth , but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever . " This leads me to remark 3 . That the man of godly sincerity is comforted and made to rejoice at all times , and especially in the time of afiliction , by the assured hope and expectation of future and endless happiness . Both the considerations already suggested are always and inseparably connected witli this , and derive from it their principal force and efficacy . That virtue , indeed , should ever suffer under the government of an infinitely wise , powerful and good Being , is what we shall not find it easy to account for , on any other supposition than that there is a state of future and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , to the mere deductions of reason . ' Christ hath abolished death , and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel . " We know froni the oracles of infallible truth that ' ' God hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness , by that man whom he hath ordained - that he will bring every work into judgment with every /q/ secret thing , whether it be good or whether it be evil - that he will judge the secrets of men - that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad ; and that the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment , but the righteous into life eternal . " Here is the description of those awful realities of a future state , those deeply interesting scenes and events , to which the man of godly sincerity is looking forward , through the whole of his christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the judgment of the great day . ' ' How shall I answer then ? is the solemn question which he frequently puts to himself . To answer then " with joy and not with grief , " is his great concern . This influences him to maintain ' a conscience void of offence , toward God and toward man . " This determines him to preserve his integrity , though it should cost him his life ; and to approve himself to the heart searcliing God , w ho is so soon to judge the secrets of his heart . And now we contemplate him as having the testimony of his conscience that he has , truly and prevalently , acted under the influence of these considerations . Amidst all the sin and imperfection of which he is conscious , for which he is deeply humbled , and which bring him to a simple reliance on the merits of his Redeemer , both for acquittal and reward , he still perceives that he has acted with sincerity ; that he has habitually endeavoured to obey all the divine commandments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his duty ; that he has followed its dictates , in o ) position to the frowns and the flatteries of the world ; that he has been ready to encounter , and is at this very moment willing to bear reproach , and persecution , and loss , and pei-il , and poverty , and death itself , rather than desert his duty , or dishonour his Saviour , or refuse him any service that he may require - He perceives this ; he is intimately and deeply conscious of it . He is therefore permitted - and oh how does he admire the ineffable grace and condescension by which he is permitted - to consider himself as a real disciple of Christ , as vitally united to him , as sure of his approbation * when he sliall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe . " He anticipates the day of dread decision , when his Saviour will acknowledge and honour him before the assembled universe , will turn all his infamy into honour and all his sorrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head , and will say to him with all his chosen people , Come ye blessed of my Father , enter into the joy of your Lord - inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world . ' And now say , my brethren , if the man who , with humble confidence , anticipates a participation in these glories of the final judgment , and the succeeding felicities of an eternal duration , may not , and will not , even exult and triumph amidst any sufferings - no matter of what kind or from what quarter they may come - /q/ which the world can inflict . Yes , he may - He may , even in the view of certain martyrdom , say , as the author of our text actually said - " I am now ready to be offered ; and the time of my departure is at hand . I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith . Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in that day ; and not unto me only but unto all them also which love his appearing . ' My young friends - whose connexion with this institution is about to be dissolved It was my design in selecting the topic you have just heard discussed , to lay hold on the present interesting occasion , to recommend , in the most powerful manner of which I am capable , the character you have heard described , to your attention and imitation . And if I shall be so happy as effectually to succeed in this , I shall be instrumental in confering on you a benefit of the most essential kind ; a benefit which will be as lasting as your existence . For if you possess that simrlicity and godly sincerity of which the text speaks , and which you have heard discrimini tsd from fleshly wisdom of every kind , you will possess true religion ; and you will possess it , too , in its best , most lovely , and most useful form . This - observe it distinctly - is what I recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid that I ever should attempt - to make you , or others , believe , that a system of mere worldly prudence , and an amiable exterior , will secure the salvation of the soul . It certainly will not . God has to do with the heart ; and your religion must begin by a change there , and be influenced by evangelical views and motives throughout , if it ever lead you to heaven . At the same time , these evangelical views and motives , as has been shewn in this discourse , will form the deepest , broadest and most solid basis , on which to rear the fabrick of integrity and honesty before the world . Build , therefore , on this foundation . Never be content , or think yourselves safe without it . But having said this , I think it not improper , and hope it may be useful to add , that I know of notliing which affords so fair a hope that a man will eventually become truly pious , as that inflexible attachment to what he believes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man of integrity , while yet he is not a man of practical piety ; provided only that he avoids the danger of making a religion or righteousness of this character . If he have it , as he may have it , without building his hopes of heaven upon it , there is much reason to expect that the love of truth and tenderness of conscience , with which it is usually associated , will lead to true piety at last . The apostle who penned the text did make a righteousness of such a character , in his unconverted state . And tliough he was converted by miracle , yet he tells us himself , what /q/ amounts to saying , that this miracle would not have been wrought if he had not possessed this character - if he had not * sinned ignorantly in unbelief . " If he had not verily thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth " - if he had offended in the manner he did , against the convictions of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always acted as he verily thought he ought to act ; and therefore , though he acted very wickedly- - and his case proves incontestibly that a man may act very wickedly when he fully believes he is doing right - yet his sins were forgiven ; and he became , probably , the most useful mere man that ever lived . His case is exactly to my present purpose . If , then , you would hope to be truly pious , never trifle with truth ; never use deceit ; abhor all fraud ; and maintain a character for uprightness and integrity : And yet , I repeat it , beware that you do not content yourselves with this ; but seek the renovation of your heart and nature , and a vital union with the Lord Jesus Christ , making him your all in all . But alas ! it is painful to say , that there arc men who profess religion , and who , en the whole , we know not how entirely to exclude from our charity , that are , nevertheless , grievously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , indeed , they can not be christians , in any thing but in name . But there are degrees of this as well as of every other ex- /z/ cellence ; and it is a most Ian . mtable reflection on religion , that its professors - yea , and its very ministers , are sometimes reproaclifully defective in simplicity and sincerity of character . Tliere is scarcely any thing which more than this , can injure the cause of Christ , diminish their own influence and respect , and in every way interfere with their usefulness . Let your religious character , my young friends , never be stained by this blot . Be , in all things , what you profess to be . And such of you as shall be called to preach the gospel , I now solemnly charge to preach it in purity and simplicity . Deeply abhor either to conceal the truth , or to deny , or disguise , or keep back , any important sentiments that you really hold . And in addition to this , always sustain a charactei ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall free you from every just or credible charge of duplicity , insincerity , or want of candour . My young friends - do not think that I press this subject upon you too much . It is not done from any particular distrust of your integrity . You have given me no cause for such distrust . But you do not know , and all I can say , without your own experience , will not make you sufficiently sensible , how important this subject really is . Much , you will recollect , you have heretofore heard me say upon it ; and you are also eware that it is a principle in the government of this institution , that frankness , truth and honesty , shall be /z/ the best apology for every fault . But this is the last time I am to address you ; and I wish to send you into life under the full impression of the truths and principles , which I have now particularly explained and inculcated . I therefore leave it as my last parting charge to you all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with this , and to carry it with you through the whole of life . You have been hearing of some of the advantages of doing this 5 but the half has not been told you . Integrity will stand your friend , and be your best recommendation , in a thousand ways and instances that can not be specified . Sheer integrity is esteemed as the most precious quality in those who are to be employed and trusted in any business , station , and relation of life : and I heartily agree with a late popular writer , that " considering how high a price the article bears , it is wonderful that there is not more of it in the market " - which , indeed , is little else than giving point to the old proverb , that honesty is the best policy . It is a recommendation , too , of this quality , that it does not require talents and genius to possess it ; though talents and genius are nothing but curses without it . All may be honest and upright : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be respected sincerely , and will be employed in preference to all others . I have shown you that this /z/ character , rightly understood and sustained , will neither subject you to the charge of weakness , nor to the impositions of knaves . No assuredly ; but while it will make you honoured and loved by all honest men , it will make you respected and feared by knaves themselves . Above all , genuine , godly sincerity will , if you possess it , befriend you , when you most need to be befriended . It will , as you have heard , solace and support you in those dark hours of adversity in which the world will no longer have any power to help or comfort ; or when it shall turn against you , and inflict on you all its wrath . Then will godly sincerity raise you above all its rage , and fill you with " a peace which passeth all understanding . ' ' Yea , when you shall stand on the brink of the eternal world , it dll still cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , and antedate that bliss of heaven of which it will ensure the full possession . To conclude all - Endeavour to excel in every thing that is praise worthy ; - in science ; in manners ; in acquaintance with human nature ; in a knowledge of the world and the characters of men . Be erudite , be courteous , be conciliating , be prudent , be guarded ; yet always be honest and upright . In every thing - in religion , in politicks , in you profession , in all your intercourse with the world , give yourselves for what you are . Never wear a mask . Show yourselves to be trust worthy , by actually being so - If you do this . /q/ I repeat it , you will be honoured , you will be happy . - I have done - I commit you to God - praying that he may deeply impress on your minds whatever of salutary counsel you have now , and at other times , heard from these lips ; and grant us a happy meeting at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator , in the days of thy youths J. HESE are the words of inspiration , recorded by the pen of the wisest of men - by the pen of a prince wlio , in circumstances peculiarly favourable to success , had tried to derive satisfaction from earthly possessions and pleasures ; but who , having found and pronounced the trial vain , delivered the text as part of a different and a better method of seeking after happiness . The subject , therefore , claims our attention , on the highest authority both divine and human . The true and obvious design of the text is to recommend and enjoin early piety . This , therefore , will be the distinct and single object of the ensuing discourse ; which I propose to address immediately and exclusively - and I am sure it will be affectionately also - to the youth of my charge . In the prosecution of this design , I will endeavour I. To explain the import of the precept , " Remember thy Creator . " /z/ II . To specify and urge some important considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of their youth , " to yield to this precept an immediate and cheerful obedience . A few leading thoughts only , will be offered on the iirst of these divisions . Our time must be chiefly occupied with the second : for in regard to this subject , as to many others , instruction is less needed than persuasion ; a knowledge of duty is not wanted so much as a disposition to perform it . I. The precept , Remember thy Creator , " must be considered as enjoining all that is comprised in genuine practical piety . As forgetfulness of God is not only a sin in itself , but the cause of many other sins , so a due remembrance of Him is both an important duty , and the most powerful incitement to every other duty . The precept we consider plainly supposes , what experience uniformly attests , that he who lives habitually under an impressive recollection of the being and attributes of God - of his universal presence , his infinite majesty , his unspotted purity , his inflexible justice , his inviolable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the account which must shortly be rendered to Him of every deed done in the body - can not be regardless of his commands , nor inattentive to any service which he requires . Do you believe it would be possible for the daring blasphemer , the profane swearer , the careless sabbath breaker the child whose undutifulness breaks a parent 's /q/ heart , the murderer , the duellist , the drunkard , the adulterer , the thief , the prodigal , the perjured person , the griping miser - to rush forward , heedless and unconcerned , in perpetrating their several enormities and abominations , if they remembered God ? if they believed and recollected distinctly , that " for all these things God would bring them into judgment ? " What ! could any one in the possession of his reason habitually do that , the penalty of which he knew to be eternal perdition ! No , it would be impossible . Fear , although it would not change his heart , would restrain him from the acts of flagitious vice . Abandoned sinners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in holy scripture . There we are told that they forget God ; " that God is not in all their thoughts ; " that " the fool hath said in his heart there is no God " - Here is the exuberant fountain of licentious sinning . On the other hand , when men are brought seriously to remember their Creatoi - to have some operative belief of his presence , of his inspection , and of their accountableness to Him , they immediately begin to think and act in a manner which usually terminates in true religion . The truth is , the Holy Spirit , the Spint of grace , is the blessed agent , who both commences and perfects this momentous work . He it is who first brings men to consider their responsibility to their Maker , and then prompts , and aids and directs their minds , in that whole train of exercises , the issue of which is a sound conversion unto God . The process ; indeed , by which this issue /z/ is effected , is extremely various ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displeasure is frequently the feeling which is first experienced , as it is that which is naturally produced , when the unsanctified mind obtains some just and impressive perceptions of the being and attributes of God . This is often followed , or accompanied , with a deep sense of guilt , misery and helplessness . The gospel offer of free salvation , through the atonement and righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ , is now regarded as inestimably precious ; and he is , at length , received and rested on by faitli , as the all in all of the soul . With this faith , by w'hich alone the sinner is justified , true evangelical repentance for sin is always mixed . Sin , in its very nature , appears unspeakably odious , and it is mourned for , hated and renounced , without any exception for a favourite lust or indulgence . The law of God becomes the rule of life , his service the l ) usiness of life , and his glory the great end of living . An inward and effectual change , evinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be productive of great inward peace , arising from a sense of pardoned guilt , of reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ , and from his love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost . Outwardly , this change will be manifested by a scrupulous and exemplary discharge of every duty which is due both to God and man - a discharge of duty proceeding from love and obedience to Him who has enjoined it , and from a desire " to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things . ' ' /q/ The import , then , of the precept , Uem ember thy Creator , ' ' is nothing less than an injunction to regard and reduce to practice , all that is comprised in the summary exhibition of genuine vital piety which has just been given . And as no religion short of this will savcf the soul , you will carefully keep in mind that in pleading with you to enter on a life of religion , it is a religion of this character and extent , that I always have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I en-deavour II . To specify and urge some important considerations which should engage you , who are now " in the days of your youth , " to yield to the precept in the text an immediate and cheerful obedience . Let it claim your particular regard that , in the precept we consider , the word ? ioxv is peculiarly emphatick . Remember norv thy Creator in die days of thy youth " - 7/ow before the fleeting period of youth be past ; jwiu ' while the evil days come not , nor the years draw nigh , when thou shalt say , I have no pleasure in them ; " now , without thinking of evasion or a moment 's delay . Be reminded , too , that what I have said , in regard to the influence of the Holy Spirit and the aids of grace being concerned in the conversion of the soul , is by no means to be considered as discouraging attention and exertion , on your part . So far is this , indeed , from furnishing a reason against laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it affords the most /z/ powerful encouragement , both for me to speak and for you to hear . The doctrine of our dependence on the grace of God , ought ever to be viewed in an encouraging light ; as inspiring hope , by pointing us to an Almighty Helper . Divine influence is not a blind impulse . It is God 's own appointment that his grace should be looked for in the use of means . It operates along with considerations and motives addressed to our reason and conscience . While these considerations and motives are candidly and seriously pondered , divine grace inclines the will and affections , renewed by its power , sweetly to consent and obey - to choose and act aright . Endeavour , therefore , to open your minds to the full influence of truth ; and lift up your hearts , at this moment , in fervent aspirations for the presence and assistance of the Holy Spirit , that you may hear effectually - sensible that you are hearing for the life of your souls . 1 . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to engage you to enter on a life of true religion in your youth , is the reasonableness of the thing itself . Bend your whole attention to this for a moment . Say if it is not fit , and proper and rational , that the God who gave you all your powers , and made you capable of lus service , love and enjoyment , should have those powers occupied in loving and serving Him , as soon as they are capable of this employment . Say if the reverse of this is not most unreasonable , base and rebellious . Is it not both irrational and wicked , in a very high degree , that you should give all the first exer-r /q/ tions and affections of your minds to objects which rival your Creator ; which exalt themselves into his place , and are directly opposed to his claims and authority ? To whom but to the God who made you , the Saviour who died for you , and the Sanctifier who must prepare you - if ever you are prepared - for heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With what language shall I show the reasonableness , and persuade you to the resolution , of making God your Jirst love ? You can not deliberately intend to remain his enemies , and perish forever . Oh , then , be not so infatuated , so ungrateful , so impious , so unutterably base , as to refuse Him your hearts , till they shall , for a season , have been prostituted to the love of sin and the service of Satan ! To God your Maker , let all your mental powers be consecrated , from the period of their earliest exercise . On this your ultimate salvation may depend . For 2 . The faculties of the human mind are more Iiappily adapted to religious exercises and duties in youth , than they usually are in after life . In youth the affections are more warm and tender , the conscience is more sensible and easily impressed , the rational faculty is more fresh and active , and the whole mind is more fair and less biassed against truth and duty , than it almost ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of piety commonly find in the youthful mind a soil most favourable to their radication , growth and fruitfulness . At whatever period , indeed , the ' good seed " may be sown , it will never ' spring up /z/ and bring forth fruit , " unless it be quickened and cherished by the power of divine grace ; and this effect , we admit , could as readily be produced by that God with whom all possible things are equally easy , in the old and rocky heart , as in the heart that is youthful and soft . But the God of nature is the God of grace ; and both in nature and in grace , he commonly operates according to the fitness of things , and in a regular order established by himself . By his order youth is fitted and intended for improvement of every kind ; for improvement in morals and piety , as well as in understanding and knowledge ; and in youth , accordingly , the life giving power and effectual culture of his grace are oftenest witnessed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become pious , a large majority of the whole number become so before they are far advanced in life . If then you would avail yourselves of an advantage in seeking the favour of God , from his own appointment , and from the very constitution of your nature , you must do it now - now before your hearts are doubly hardened and perverted by the habits and the deceitfulness of sin . You will be most likely to attain genuine piety , and to attain it with the least pain and difficulty , ii you seek it in youth ; and if the attainment be now made , you will perform the duties of religion far more comfortably and advantageously , than if this great concern be delayed till you reach a more advanced age . This will more fully appear , by considering /q/ 3 . That in youth there is a freedom from that pressure of worldly business and cares , and from a thousand unavoidable avocations , which commonly occupy and engross the attention , when men have entered on active or professional life . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it extremely diMcult to keep up that fervour of piety which had previously been excited - To enkindle the flame is , often , in these circumstances , scarcely practicable . With youth who have occasionally some serious impressions of religion , while yet the love of pleasure or the lure of ambition sways their minds , it is , I know , a favourite notion , which often serves to lull their consciences , that when they shall be established in business and settled in families , they will find a period far more advantageous than the present , for devoting themselves to the service of God , This is , in various respects , an awful delusion . Presumptuous youth ! Your Maker requires you 7iow to remember him . And do you deliberately resolve to remain , for years to come , in a state of disobedience to his command ? Do you not know that " God is angry with the wicked every day ? ' ' and should not this awaken your fears , that you may be cut off in your sins , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Have you not seen some examples , for they frequently occur , of this alarming dispensation ? Examples of those who have been hurried out of life , before the time had come which they had proposed and , /z/ irO DISCOURSE VII . promised to devote to religion ? And will you , in the face of such examples , venture on this tremendous risk ? Have you not , also , heard already in this address , and do you not believe , that the influences of divine grace must be afforded to you , if you ever truly repent of your sins and turn to God ? And have you not great cause to fear , if you systematically resolve on continuing to offend Him for a season , that he may give you up to that final hardness of heart and searedness of conscience , which will as certainly be followed by perdition , as if it were already sealed by death and judgment ? Alas ! how many have I known - for my observation has long been directed to this very point - how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not far from the kingdom of God , " but who were seduced from pressing into it , some by one tcniptatlo.i , and some by another , till they became at length hardened in impenitence . Some of them have already passed into eternity ; some of them yet live ; and some are , at this hour , numbered among infidels or scepticks . Let me warn and entreat you , to shun a course . of such unspeakable peril - " Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption . " But even on the supposition that your life shall be prolofed to the period which you have assigned for religion , and that the strivings of the Spirit of grace shall also be continued - for God is a sovereign , and it belongs not to us to pronounce with certainty on the limits of his forbearance and grace - still there is every reason /q/ to believe that it will be far more difficult , then , than now , to enter on a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional business , the deceitfulness of riches , the society and opinions of worldly men , the unpleasantness of making a change of character and adopting new habits of life , and the influence of family connexions decidedly hostile to religion , may all conspire to increase the diiTiculty we contemplate . They often have conspired , and some of these causes always will operate , to create obstacles , which require resolution and exertion of the most vigorous and determined kind to surmount or remove , from those who have to commence , if they ever do commence , a life of true religion , after they are immersed in the world . On the whole , my young friends , be assured , as the result of much observation , that you are never likely to find so favourable an opportunity to attend effectually to the concerns of your souls , as you now have , within the walls of this house ; and that you have serious cause to apprehend , if you go from this house without religion , that you will go through life and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation - To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts . " 4 . Another motive or consideration , which should de termine the young to remember their Creator in the days of their youth is , that by so doing they will obtain /z/ the best and most satisfying evidence of the sincerity and reality of their religion . There are seasons in the lives of almost all men , in which the mind turns on serious subjects , and looks to religion for consolation . But alas ! melancholy experience demonstrates that all seriousness is not religion . In hours of danger and distress , or disgust at the world , thousands have professed , in the most solemn manner , and apparently with the most honest intention , to devote themselves to God , who have discovered , after all , that their hearts , although wounded , were not changed : for as soon as the cause that seemed to render religion necessary was removed , their seriousness vanished with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the morning dew . " The sun of health , or pleasure , or prosperity , converted it into vapour and scattered it to the winds . The knowledge of this has grievously distressed some , who have given the best evidence that affliction had been the season , or age the period of life , in which they had been brought home to God . ' Ah ! - says the afflicted penitent - how many have there been who in distress promised as fairly , and seemed to think as seriously as I do now ; and yet all was temporary , all delusive ? How can I know that I am at heart better than they ! How can I be certain that I am sincere ! ' ' - What evidence have I - says the hoary headed penitent - that I truly love God , and am not merely cloyed with the world ! I did not choose religion till the world had , in a measure , lost its relish . The best part of my days , at any /q/ rate , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him only the remnant of life , and the leavings of sin ; and I fear that it is by mere constraint that I profess to make even this offering/ ' Those who have the least cause for these fears and jealousies of their sincerity , are the very persons who are the most apt to indulge them . And is it not desirable , my young friends , to escape the pain and perplexity of such a state of mind as this ? Is it not desirable , not only to be truly pious , but to have the comfort of it too ? If so , embrace religion while you are young . If you voluntarily choose it , while you are in youth and in healtli ; - if when the world flatters , when the opportunity of sinful indulgence favours , when depraved appetite vehemently prompts , when all the enemies of your souls assail you with advantage ; - if in these circumstances you choose the ways of true piety and godliness , you will have every possible evidence that you are sincere ; that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his favour is sure . This advantage you now have , and you will not have it at a future day : if you lose it pow it is lost forever . Yes , if you prefer God before the world , when the world is most inviting and attractive , you obtain an evidence that he is supreme in your affections , which otherwise you can not have . Then , in the hour of danger and distress , he will be your sweet and comfortable refuge . You will go to him with a filial confidence . If spared to advanced life , when Hhe evil days come , and the years draw nigh when you shall say /z/ I have no pleasure in them , " you will have the satisfaction to know that in better days than these , you made the Lord your portion ; and you will have the supporting assurance that " he will not cast you off in time of old age . " I can not , indeed , adopt the unqualified language which some use , when they talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged christian in the view of eternity ; because I know assuredly that it must be , not ; his own merits , but the merits of his Saviour , that must afford him solid comfort then ; yet this I may say , that a life of piety is the very best edence that our union with Christ is real and sure . In this view exactly , it is mentioned by the Apostle - " I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand . I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith ; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord the righteous judge shall give unto me at that day . " In a word , a life of piety begun in youth , from the circumstances of its commencement , and from the opportunity it affords to grow in grace , to be useful in the world , and to gain experience in religion , affords the best advantage for obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all desirable ; certainty that the soul is safe ; certainty that everlasting happiness is yours . Inconsiderate youth ! what would you not give to have your happiness for this world insured ? Behold , I point you out a way to insure it for eternity ! /q/ 5 . What has just been said receives much force , from the consideration that early piety is , in every view , productive of pleasure and satisfaction , through life . This is a consideration suggested by Moses the man of God . In his remarkable prayer for the children of his people he says " O satisfy us early with thy mercy , that we may be glad and rejoice all our days . " Solomon recognizes the truth of the same doctrine when he says - " Wisdom 's ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace . " And the Apostle Paul adds his testimony to the rest - ' " Godliness is profitable unto all things , having the promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortified by the authority of scripture , its justice is admitted by youth with more difficulty than almost any other . Religion , they will allow , is advantageous for a future world , but not for the present . " You may speak , say they , of its insuring happiness hereafter ; but we can not concede that it is favourable to present pleasure . " Nay , I suspect there is scarcely another idea which the adversary of souls presses on young minds so frequently and successfully as this , that religion would destroy their pleasures ; or that it would prove hostile to their worldly interests . Let me beg your candid attention , then , for a few minutes to an argument on the point ; and afterward judge for yourselves . Shall I begin with speaking of persecution ? To that persecution which destroys life and property , we , at present , are happily not exposed . But if we were , I should /z/ tell you , that where religion has produced one martyr , the want of it has produced a multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her shrine a hundred victims of sensual pleasure and lawless indulgence , where adherence to religion has been the cause of death to an individual . The victims of vice , too , have expired by deaths unspeakably more distressing , than the holy martyrs of evangelical truth have experienced . Do you think that the bloated wretch , who drags out a miserable existence of years of lassitude , langour , disgust and pain , the effects of intemperance and debauchery , and at last dies without hope - Do you think , I say , that the sum of this man 's sufferings - leaving eternity out of view - is not unspeakably greater , than the amount of his who , with heaven in prospect , dies on a scaffold , or is consumed at the stake ? I leave the answer to yourselves . To the hatred of the profane , the sneer of the ungodly , and the persecution of the tongue , you must expect to be exposed , if you become truly pious ; for All that will live godly in Christ Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred and the sneer of unreasonable men easier to be born , than the agonizing remorse of your own consciences ? Is it not more tolerable that the tongues of wicked men should persecute you for doing your duty , than that the prayers , the tears , the admonitions , and the entreaties of your pious parents and friends , should reproach you for neglecting it ? And are you not chargeable with pusilanimity and inconsistency , if censure from those who differ from you on common subr Discourse Vil ifr jects affects you but little , and yet you are found to shrint from the revilings of a wretched infidel , or an impious blasphemer ? Or will you suggest that religion is the ilulSe of glooiti and timidity " ? The justice of such a suggestion I mlist explicitly deny . Religion , like every thing else , has been abused , and the best things , when abused , usually be ' - Come the worst . But religion , in its genuine spirit , is the consoler of the dejected : and , taken in experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the souls of pioiis men from sinking , under distresses that overwhelm those who are not supported by its powerful and sacred influence Or do any of yoii suppose that trUe piety is unfavourable to a reputable standing in society ? Nothing is more contrary than this , both to reason and experience . Religion in all ages arid countries , has been considered as the guard of integrity and confidence . Without her oaths and sanctions society can not exist . Hypocrisy itself bears testimony to the excellence of religion , in inCjiiring respect and confidence . Knaves become hypocrites that they may be trusted . Their pretence is detestable , but it proves that genuine piety is of acknowledged value , for nothing that is base is ever counterfeited . Let a man be believed to be really and deeply under the influence of religious principle , and he is trusted without reserve . It gives a dignity and g wigh " to his character which nothing else can confer , /z/ Religion too is friendly to industry . Industry , indeed , is a part of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says an inspired apostle " hath denied the fitith and is worse than an infidel. * ' Now character , confidence , and industry , are confessedly favourable to wordly prosperity , and they are all unquestionably promoted by religion . That religion preserves from vice and moderates the passions , is implied in its nature and name . A vicious christian is a perfect solicism . An ambitious , proud , revengeful , drunken , unclean , profligate christian , is language of which every one instantly perceives the absurdity . And does religion afford the best guard against all the evils that vice and intemperate passions and appetites produce ? Assuredly it docs . Look round then upon the world , and when you see - as you certainly may see - that the greater part of all the miseries of human nature proceed from these causes , confess that the remedy of these evils , - a remedy which heals the very fountain of them in the human heart , - can not be hurtful to happiness , but must abundantly increase it . Neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable enjoyment of our possessions , nor to a participation in any rational pleasure . The limits which ijt sets and the restraints which it imposes , in regard to these particulars , are precisely those which reason itself prescribes to every prudent man . Religion forbids avarice , but it also forbids prodigality . The beneficence and charity which it requires , are unspeakably /q/ a lighter tax than that which dissipation and sinful indulgence levy on their a otaries . The pleasure too , which arises from doing good with our substance to the bodies and the souls of men , is tar greater than that which arrises from splendor of equipage , from the indulgence of animal appetite , or even from the imitative arts . Every gratification and pleasure of the senses , which does not weaken , degrade , or injure our nature , nor intrude on more important concerns and pleasures , religion permits . And who , that values himself on being raised above the level of the brutes , would wish for more than this ? To crucify the flesh with its aifections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this self command and self denial are really conducive to the greatest enjoyment on the whole . They render him , who complies with the precept , infinitely happier than the slave of appetite , even when appetite can be indulged . That man has not yet learned the laws of his nature , any more than the laws of the gospel , who does not know that moderation , forbearance , and even a degree of abstinence , is necessary to the highest gratification of his senses . To all the pleasures of friendship and society true piety is peculiarly favourable . There is something in that softening which genuine religion gives to the heart , or affections , which peculiarly qualifies its possessor to be a friend . So true is this , and so much verified by experience , that I would beg you to make the observation for yourselves , whether in the sphere of your own acquaintance , the warmest , tie tenderest , the most lasting , and /z/ the most valuable friendships are not found among pers , ons of piety , of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , is it improper to repeat the observation of one who had seen much of human nature and human life , * namely - that all that politeness and courtesy of manners , which bears so Iiigli a value in the world , is only the outward expression , and too often a mere expression , of that humanity , meekness , kindness , and benevolence of heart , which the gospel requires . To govern the heart and life , therefore , by the spirit and requisitions of the gospel , will give that very deportment which constitutes true politeness , in every thing but arbitrary forms and gracefulness of carriage . But returning to things of more importance , how necessary is religion , both to dignity and liappiness , in danger , disease and approacljing death . Danger and death , I grant , are frequently braved without religion . But in every such instance , however a thoughtless world may dignify the daring deed with the appellation of heroism , reason and revelation pronounce it madness . To be fear-less of eternal perdition , is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most of those who , unaided by religion , encounter imminent danger without dismay , do it on the calculation , or in the hope , that their good fortune , as they call it , will bear them safely through : Or else , their spirits arc excited and supported by the animating influence of active and interesting scenes .. Many a man has been , like Cromwell , a dauntless soldier ' Prince of Conti . /q/ on the-tsld of battle , who has been dreadfully terrified when ' teame to look deliberately into eternity , from a sick and dying bed . With few exceptions , when the hope of life is taken away , he who is unsupported by religion will tremble , as well he may ; and he who is truly pious will then lose his previous fears , and be calm , if not triumphant . On the whole , therefore , that serenity and inward peace which genuine christian faith produces , by satisfying the believer that in all situations and events he is safe , must manifestly have a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in seasons and circumstances of alarm and peril . To comfort the afflicted is an office that the world itself commonly assigns to religion . It is indeed difficult for religion to perform this office when it is resorted to only in affliction ; but when early piety has proved religion to be sincere , it is in afflic'ion a comforter indeed - Ah ! my dear youth , your anticipations of futurity often resemble the dreams of Joseph . He dreamed of his prosperity but not of his adversity - - He dreamed that his brethren should bow down before him , and that his parents should do him homage . But he never dreamed of the cruel hatred of his brethren , the loss of his liberty , the effects of slander and jealousy , the gloom of a prison and the danger of an ignominious death . In like manner , but without his unerring guidance , you often picture to yourselves the pleasing prospects that , as you believe , lie before you ; and you love to leave out , or to cast into shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . /z/ But you ought to be apprised , that if you live , ilngill not be long before you will find that to have suppo/. ' jU distress , to have a balsam for a bleeding heart , is ohe of the most desirable of all possessions . This medicine of the soul you will ask ) hilosophy in vain to administer . It must be found in ' " the balm of Gilead , ' ' applied by " the physician there . " The efficacy of atoning blood , and the sympathy of that Saviour who , by shedding it , has reconciled the sinner to his God , and who is constantly Houchcd with the feeling of our infirmities , " will be found a precious remedy for a wounded spirit , when the world has lost all its power to relieve or soothe . To be comforted by the love and favour of a covenant God in Christ , when all earthly comforts fail , and so comforted , to rejoice in tribulation , ' " is the high privilege of the christian believer alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remember that religion has , at all times , joys and pleasures of her own . Hope is the solace of human life . He who has the largest and best founded hopes is the happiest man . What think you then of the hope of the gospel ? What think you of the happiness of him who habitually and assuredly hopes , after all the joys and sorrow of this fleeting and shadowy state are past like a fugitive vision , to receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away ; to see God as he is ; to be the companion of saints and angels ; to grow in the capacity of enjoyment , and to have that capacity filled with unutterable bliss , to all eternity ? What think you of such a hope ? Is the situation of the /q/ meanest who possesses it , to be compared with that of the most Splendid sinner who wants it ? Is the state of him wlvO is afraid of hell , or if not afraid , constantly in danger of it , to be compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure candidate for heaven ? Believe me , this hope of the christian frequently produces a present joy and peace , which are literally unspeakable j which are ' * exceeding great and full of glory . " ' When the light of God 's countenance is lifted on the soul , when his love is shed abroad in the heart , when the Saviour is beheld in his fullness and the believer embraces him in faith , when the divine glory is seen in the plan of salvation as inefTable and overwhelming , and when all the soul goes forth unto God its exceeding joy - then the christian experiences a felicity , one moment of which he would not exchange for ages of sensual delight . He will tell you that there is nothing on earth which deserves the name of happiness in comparison with this ; that he never knew what happiness was till he tasted of this ; that this fills the soul in all the extent of its powers and energies , and sweetly constrains it to exclaim , Whom have I in heaven but thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides thee . " Thus , have I argued this point , and shov , n you , I think conclusively , that it is a just consideration and a powerful motive , to choose religion early , because it will increase and insure your happiness through the whole of subsequent life . Yes , I repeat it I urge you to be- /z/ come pious that you may be happy , in those ; various scenes and circumstances which may awail you in your whole passage through the world . Be this passage longer or shorter - whether you live to old age , or die at an earlier period , there is nothing which will , at all times , and in all imaginable situations , contribute so much to your peace , your contentment , your respectability , your support , consolation and comfort , as unfeigned piety , reigning in the heart and governing all the life and conversation . 6 . Another motive , or consideration , that should induce you to remember your Creator in the days of your youth is , that God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinners , who have no just knowledge of God or of themselves , are apt to suppose that they may certaiidy obtain sanctifying grace and become truly pious , at any period that they may see fit to assign for the purpose . It is on this supposition that those unqualified promises of amendment and piety are made , which we sometimes hear from profligate men , when they are pressed by danger ; and it is on the same ground that all those calculations of future repentance are founded , with which thousands , as you have already heard , deceive and ruin their immortal , souls . They forget that their nature is depraved throughout ; that to change their hearts must be the work of God ; that faith and repentance are his gifts , and that they will never feel any thing but an insurmountable reluctance to attend to their /q/ immortal wterests , unless God shall be pleased to give thejn the inclination , and to help them by his grace . They forget all this , and full of a presumptuous reliance oft themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to offend their Maker , and provoke him to withhold that very grace which is absolutely necessary to the execution of their promises or purposes . He who has right views of religion knows that it is all a system of sovereign mercy , and that he must rely on the grace and promise of God , for all that he can hope to he or to doHere , then , is my argument - God hath said - they who seek me early shall find me . " It is of infinite advantage to have this promise in your favour ; you have it in early life , and you will not have it afterwards . If you avail yourself of it now , you may go to God , and humbly plead his own gracious declaration . He allows , he is pleased with this . You may tell Him that you rely on his own word , ' on which he hath caused you to hope ; " - that by special offers and engagements he has mercifully condescended to encourage and invite young persons to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this in your own case ; that you are now young , and would by his assistance and grace be consecrated and devoted to his service , glory and praise ; and that you now look to Him to make good to you the precious assurance , that those who seek him early shall find him . Oh ! lose not this advantage , I en- /z/ treat you . Did you know how valuable a promise of God appears to a soul which feels its guilt and its danger , you would think it an unspeakable pri41ege to have one exactly suited , as this is , to your state and circumstances . Risk not the danger of being brought into a situation , in which you may be harrassed witli awful fears of the divine dereliction - fears that you will never find what you seek . Now you are assured that if you seek , with humility , and earnestness , and perseverance , you shall certainly find - find a reconciled God , and an eternal friend and portion . How great is this encouragement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another motive or consideration which urges to early piety is , that it affords the prospect of a higher degree of happiness in the world of glory . The state of celestial glory is represented in the New Testament as an inheritance - " an inlieritance incorrupti ) le and undefiled , and that fadetli not away , reserved in heaven for you , who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation , ready to l ) e revealed in the last time . " This inheritance is the purchase and legacy of the Redeemer , and as such all his people rclceive it ; and not , in any sevise or degree , as what they have merited for themselves . Yet , in apportioning this inheritance , in bestowing a reward perfectly gratuitous , the richest allotment and the highest honours will be assigned to those who have loved and laboured most . We arc told expressly , that " those wlio turn many to /q/ righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever , " and that ' ' as one star differeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the resurrection of the dead . ' The whole parable of our Lord , in regard to those who received different talents , and who occupied with them or neglected them , goes likewise to confirm the idea , that future rewards will be proportioned to present advantages , exertions and improvements . If , then , you begin the love and service of God in early life , you become candidates for distinction in the mansions of heaven . You may , indeed , die in early life , and in this event you will be safe and glorious . But if you are spared , and are diligent , active , and zealous in your Lord 's service , you will , through endless ages , share in that ' far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory , " which is reserved for those who shall have done and suffered much for Christ , This is a consideration which , perhaps , you may never before have taken into view ; but it is manifestly both just and important . Are the distinctions of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with emulation , and kindle the ardent desires of your minds ? This day I propose to you distinctions of an infinitely higher order ; distinctions among the inhabitants of heaven ; distinctions in the ranks of saints and angels . Here is an object for the efforts of a holy magnanimity , the contemplation of which may well make your souls burn within vou . Enter early into the service of God : enlist this day under the great captain of salvation , and not only will he bring you off /z/ conquerors and more than conquerors* ' overall your enemies , but you will be candidates for those palms of triumph , and those high and holy preferments in his heavenly kingdom , which are awarded to his most active servants and most zealous and faithful friends . Let us now for a moment review the motives and considerations wliich have been specified . They are these - I have shown you that the early devotion of yourselves to the service of God is a thing perfectly reasonable in itself - Tliat in youth the faculties of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genuine piety - That then the mind is not burdened with those cares , engrossed with that business , nor exhausted with those anxieties and exertions , which are likely afterwards to occur - That early piety will give you the best evidence that your religion is genuine - That it will also qualify you to pass the whole of your after life with the greatest satisfaction , advantage and pleasure - That God has made peculiar promises to those who seek him early - And that , by entering on a life of religion in youth , you may become candidates for a higher state of glory and reward than you might otherwise attain , in the heavenly world . These considerations have been addressed - as all the considerations of true religion are addressed - to reason , to conscience , to a sense of gratitude and duty , to the judgment , the will and the affections . They all conspire to show you that you ought to choose , and to persuade you actually to choose , to devote yourselves ty God . /q/ But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your undivided attention , what has constantly been supposed and occasionally inculcated , that this is not a matter in which you may choose on the one side or the other , as inclination may prompt , without any responsibility for the decision you make . No , verily - Let me speak it and you hear it with the deepest solemnity - it is the command of Almighty God , that you remember him in the days of your youth . It is a positive precept of the Lord Jehovah , that is now claiming your attention . He commands like a wise and equitable parent , he commands what is right , and reasonable , and for your own benefit , as has been fully shown . But he uses authority , as well as reason and persuasion . Be it , then , most deeply impressed on your minds , that if you this hour refuse to give yourselves to the Lord , and every day and hour that you shall refuse it , you will incur the awful guilt and danger of disobeying an explicit command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has the most perfect right , the most unquestionable and unlimited authority , to require that you give your hearts and services to Him , in the morning of life . He actually does require it : And I ask of you - and consider me as asking you , as particularly as if I called each of you by his proper name - , whether you are prepared for an act of direct disobedience to the God who made you . If you are , the consequences will be inexpressibly fearful . You will remain under the divine displeasure , during the whole period of your disobedience . You will , every moment , be in dan- /z/ ger of being cut off in your sins , and sent dovvu to the abodes of eternal woe . If spared in life , you will still be in danger of growing more and more hardened in sin , of being left , in the rigliteous displeasure of God , to be filled witli your own devices - to fill up the measure of your iniquities , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! why have I spent so much time on other and lower considerations ? When we know what God commands , we have no need to reason , and no right to hesitate . Young people of my charge , you must remember your Creator - You must now remember him , or his wrath abideth on you - And to think of living constantly under the frowns of the Eternal ; constantly in danger of perishing forever - the mind can not bear it , the thought is intolerable ! Hasten then to a compassionate and inviting Saviour . Behold I now present to you Christ Jesus , in the offer of the gospel , standing with open arms to receive you ; and inviting you , by every tender and by every awful consideration , to come to Him for life and salvation . I conjure you , without a moment 's delay , to accept his invitation . By his unutterable dying love , by the precious blood which he shed for your redemption , by all the worth of your own undying souls , by the fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you - I conjure you this moment to form the solemn resolution , in a reliance on his grace and strength , that you will henceforth earnestly seek , till you satisfactorily find a saving interest in the dear Redeemer . May God of his mercy grant that this resolution /q/ may be formed in each of your hearts , and that you may now rise and accompany me to the throne of his grace , in fervent prayer that he may enable you to carry it into full effect ! Let us pray . o /z/ ' And the king was exceeding sorrij ; yet for his oat/is sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject herP A HE world has seldom witnessed an exhibition of depravity more shocking , than that which is described in the narrative of which these words are a part . John , the fore-runner of Christ , with a fidelity and firmness becoming his character , had pointedly reproved Herod Antipas , king , or Tetrarch , of a part of Jewry , for a most flagitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had , without any just cause , divorced his lawful wife , and taken from her husband Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip , and espoused her as his own . On this , the Baptist , regardless of the monarch 's authority or displeasure , had given him a plain and severe reproof . He said - " ' It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife . Therefore , " continues the Evangelist , ' Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him , but she could not . For Herod /z/ t / /z/ feared John , knowing that he was a just man and a holy , and observed him , and when he heard him , he did many things and heard him gladly . And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birth day made a supper to his lords , high captains and chief estates of Galilee : and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced , and pleased Herod and them that were with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give thee . And he sware unto her - whatsoever thou shalt ask of me I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom . And she went forth and said unto her mother - What shall I ask ? and she said , the head of John the Baptist . And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying . I will that thou give me by and by , in a charger , the head of John the Baptist . And the king was exceeding sorry , yet for his oaths ' sake , and for their sakes who sat with him , he would not reject her . And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ; and brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother . ' What an unparralleled scene of complicated wiekednjess and cruelty is here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till I have given you the admirable and eloquent remarks of Dr. Doddridge , on this horrible transaction . We see , " says Doddridge , ' in this dreadful instance of Herodias , what an implacable degree of malice may arise in the hearts /q/ of sinners , on being reproved for the most scandalous and mischievous vices . Instead of owning the obligation to one that would have plucked her as a brand out of the burning , Q thirsts insatiably for his blood ; and chooses rather to indulge her cruelty and revenge in taking away his life , than to gratify her avarice and ambition in demanding a gift , that might have been equal to the half of a kingdom . But how mysterious was that providence which left the life of so holy a man in such infamous hands , and permitted it to be sacrificed to the malice of an abandoned harlot , to the petulancy of a vain girl , and to the rashness of a foolish and perhaps an intoxicated prince , who made the prophefs head the reward of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are sure he can never be at a loss to repay his servants in another world for the greatest sufferings they endure in this , and even for life itself when given up in his cause . We may reasonably conclude that death could never be an unseasonable surprise to this excellent saint . When the executioner came into the prison by night , perhaps breaking in upon his slumbers , and executed his bloody commission almost as soon as he declared it , a soul like his might welcome the stroke , as the means of liberty and glory ; assured that the transient agony of a moment would transmit it to a kingdom , where the least of its inhabitants would be in holiness , honour , and felicity , superior to John , in his most prosperous and successful state on earth . /z/ His enemies might a while insult over him while his disciples were mingling their tears with his dust , and lamenting the residue of his days cut off in the midst . But his death was precious in the sight of the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So will he ere long plead the cause of all his injured people , and give a cup of trembling and astonishment to those that have made themselves drunk with their blood . Let cruelty and tyranny do their worst , verily there is a reward for the righteous , verily there is a God that jiidgeth in the earthP After these impressive and edifying reflections on the whole narrative of which the text is a part , let us proceed to consider it separately : and to make a practical application of the instruction which it affords . I. " The king - says the text - was exceeding sorry. * ' From this it appears that Herod , bad as he was , still retained no inconsiderable degree of sensibility . From some cause or other , he felt much - He was not only sorry , but * exceeding sorry . " Let us inquire into the probable causes of this sorrrow. 1 . He was probably sorry because the performance of his rash oaths would injure his character and reputation with the world . Although a despotick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather loved and respected , than hated and detested , even by his own subjects . All tyrants , whether great or small , always wish to be feared by those who are dependent on them ; but they do not wish to be hated and despised - They commonly desire and /q/ expect to be reverenced and loved . In this , indeed , they must necessarily be disappointed , because servile fear and a degree of hatred are inseparable . Servile fear is a painful feeling , and we naturally hate that which gives us pain . Tyrants , however , the inconsistency notwithstanding , seldom fail to demand and expect that their dependents should dread them as masters , and yet love them as parents ; and they are frequently angry , even to madness , when they find that their expectation can not be realized . History informs us that the father of the Herod to whom our text refers , took the most effectual measures which a dying man could take , to have seventy elders of the Jews put to death , on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world might be attended with mourning and not with rejoicing . What a wretch is a tyrant , with all his pomp and power ! And how precious is that love and veneration which we delight to yield spontaneously to virtue and goodness , but which wealth can not buy , nor power exact ! But if the Herod of whom the text speaks , and who too closely resembled his father , had so completely alienated the affections of his own subjects - as indeed seems to have been the fact - that he could have but little hope of regaining them , and therefore might pay but little regard to this consideration , still he was , no doubt , very desirous to have his character stand fair with the Romans , from whom he held his power , and who hated acts of wanton and individual cruelty . He would ; therefore // be exceeding sorry to do a tiling which would injure him in the estimation of those to whom he owed allegiance ; and whose good opinion he was most of all solicitous to secure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn to do that which might brand his memory with infamy to the remotest ages . This , happily , is a consideration which sometimes has a degree of influence on those great and pestilent scourges of the world who are regardless of better motives . The disgusting transaction to which the text refers , has not only rendered the name of Herod an abomination with eery reader of sacred story , but the Jewish historian , already named , has recorded it , to the endless reproach of his character with his own nation : And it is at least possible , that the anticipation of something like this , might mingle with other considerations , to render him exceeding sorry , at the perpetration of the detestable deed to w hich his oaths had pledged him . 2 . We are warranted in saying that Herod was afraid that John 's popularity would produce public disturbance and insurrection , if he were put to a violent death . One of the cvangelick historians explicitly states , that when Herod would have put John to death , he feared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a certain point beyond which no people will bear oppression , nor suffer their feelings to be outraged ; and when their oppressors , even in the most absolute governments , pass this point , they often do it at the expense of their whole authority and life together - They are /q/ deposed and destroyed at once . Of this Herod appears to have been aware and fearfid . Tlie Jews , although their fathers had slain manyprophets , had still the highest regard for the prophetick character . They had now , for several centuries , been without a prophet in their nation . John had convinced them that the character , so long extinct , was revived in him : and his reproof of their cruel monarch , not only for incest , but ' for all the evils which Herod had done , " demonstrated that he possessed the elevated and undaunted spirit of the ancient prophets , and must have endeared him greatly to the people at large . From these causes , they appear to have held him in such profound veneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , was afraid to provoke their rage , by taking away the prophet 's life . And when he found that he had , unawares , given his oath and pledged his honour to do this very act , he was of course exceeding sorry - exceeding sorry that he had brought himself into a situation in which he was to run the risk of exciting a public insurrection , by which both his power and his life might be endangered and lost . This kind of sorrow the vilest of men often feel . They are not sorry for the sin they commit , but sorry that they can not commit it without inconvenience and danger . But yet , 3 . There seems to be good reason to believe that Herod had some very painful compunctions of conscience , on this occasion . It appears that he had , for a while , refused the entreaties of Herodias to put John to /z/ death , not only because he feared the people , but because he feared the Baptist himself ; feared him with that kind of dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed with authority , is often compelled to feci , in the presence and under the rebukes of a man of confessed and eminent holiness and virtue . Nay , we are assured , that there had been a time when the preaching of Jolui had made a considerable impression on Herod . Tlie context informs us that " Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and a holy , and observed him , and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly . " Now , although it is certain , that Herod had so far silenced or resisted the remonstrances of his conscience , as not only to imprison John , but to have resolved to destroy him , if the fear of the multitude had not restrained him ; yet it is highly probable that when the matter came to a point , and he saw himself about to give the decisive mandate to take away the life of this holy man , whom he had once venerated , and to whose admonitions he had in many things yielded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agitated . We have the more reason to believe this , because we find that Herod*s conscience gave him dreadful disturbance after he had perpetrated the murderous act . He appears to have been a Sadducee ; and of course he denied , as all the Sadducees did , the resurrection of the dead , and a future state of rewards and punishments . Yet so powerfully and painfully did the awakened con- DISCOURSE Vllf. 201 science of this professed infidel operate that , in opposi " tion to all his avowed principles , no sooner did he hear the report of the miracles of Christ than he said - " It is John whom I beheaded , he is risen from the dead . ' What a fearful tormentor is a guilty conscience ! And liow often are infidelity and superstition united ! He who had professed to believe that " there is no resurrection , " apprehends the immediate and miraculous resurrection of the victim of his crimes . Alas ! like innumerable infidels since , Herod did not really believe what he professed . He professed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he viewowsXy feared would prove to be false . On the whole , from the facts just stated , we have good evidence to conclude that the mind of Herod shuddered at the prospect of taking the life of John ; and that , on this account , as well as from the other considerations that have been stated , he was exceeding sorry to find that he had sworn to do what he dreaded to perform . Happy had it been for him if he had refused to redeem his impious pledge ; if he had rather broken than fulfilled his wicked oaths ; if he had rather lost his honour in the eyes of his courtiers than killed the prophet of the Lord . But he thought otherwise ; and we are now II . To examine the principles or motives from which he acted . What these were we are told in the text - * For his oaths ' sake , and for their sakes who sat with him , he would not reject her . " 1 . *For his oaths ' sake he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most conclusivelvj that Herod 's repeat ' /z/ // cd oaths on this occasion were not obligatory . His sin - and a sin of no ordinary atrocity it was - consisted in making these oaths . Of this sin he oiiglit to have repented , and not to have added to it , as he certainly did to a most awful extent , by performing his oaths . Circumstanced as he was , nothing was left him , in the way of duty , but to tread back the false and rash steps he had taken , by a full and frank acknowledgment of error and guilt , and by an absolute refusal to fulfil the engagements which he had unlawfully made . This is unquestionably the course which ought to be taken , by every man who has been led , by whatever cause , to bring himself under a promise , vow or oath , unlawful in itself . One of the fathers of the christian church has made a remark to this efltct - that the very terms of Herod 's oaths , did not bind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have answered Herodias , that a prince was bound to regard justice more than all his dominions : that , in this view , the Baptist 's head was worth , not only more than the half , but more than the rivhole of his kingdom ; and therefore that he was not pledged to comply with her iniquitous demand . It was , moreover , infinitely absurd for a man so abandoned as Rerod was , to pretend to feel a moral obligation to do a thing most unrighteous in itself , after disregarding every obligation to do what was right . How w as it , then , that ' * for his oaths ' sake " he was induced to act as he did ? Must we believe that he was left of God to such a perversion of mind as really to think , and DISCOURSE Vril. 203 feel , and act , as if he were bound to keep bad oaths or promises , although he had violated , and was then living in the violation of the most sacred vows and engagements ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to such utter delusion , as actually to consider himself under some strange kind of obligation , to risk his reputation , to risk his life , and to act against the plainest principles of moral equity , rather than break the oaths he had made , or even give them another construction than tliat which his adulterous wife and her w icked daughter had chosen to put upon them ? It certainly does appear , in fact , that such men as Herod waS ; will not unfrequently make an unlawful oath or vow , and keep it scrupulously , when they can be bound by no moral tie . They will bring themselves under an oath , or a curse , to do , or to forbear , a certain tiling - a thing sometimes right and sometimes wrong in itself - and this engagement no consideration will induce them to violate . All this , hovrcver , may probably be resolved into that same principle of false honour , on which , as I apprehend the whole conduct of Herod on this occasion must be explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which a man must think meanly or honourably of himself , and be so estimated by others , when , this standard is notwithstanding opposed to some plain and important principles of moral duty , as taught and sanctioned by reason , conscience and the word of God . Honour always purports to be something that is noble , dignified or /z/ generous ; and nothing surely can be truly so , which is characterized by the contrariety I have mentioned . It may be called honour , but it must be called so fakely ; and therefore , without any harshness or exaggeration , it may be denominated false honour . Now there have been men , in every age , who have been prone to establish such a false standard as we contemplate , and to make the point of honour consist in a Strict conformity to it . Certain principles and practices , hostile to the duty which is due both to God and man , they , by a kind of tacit compact , agree to consider as marking the character of the man who acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders himself worthy of the esteem , countenance and company of those who , according to their classification , are men of honour . And on the other hand , those who will not conform to their principles and standard , they agree to consider and treat as mean spirited , contemptible and utterly disqualified for the regard and society of honourable men . Some of the patrons of this system treat all religion with open contemj ) t . But others profess to reverence its dictates generally ; and some of them , like Herod , retain no inconsiderable sensibility of conscience . In all cases , however , they are manifestly practiccl infidels . They attempt to abrogate the divine commands by requisitions of their own which diametrically oppose those commands . They establish a system of human opinion and a criterion of character , in direct hostility with that which God has prescribed , and which he has sanctioned ; /q/ not only in his word , but in the natural conscience of man . Practically , therefore , they entirely set aside the divine authority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , formed by themselves , into a superiority to that which has been given by Him . Nor do these men permit any one who claims to be of their number to falter , whatever may be the consequences , in pursuing the course which they have marked out . They are the most rigorous and unmerciful exacters on earth of a strict conformity and an unwavering regard to the rules which they have adopted . No matter if such a conformity and regard will , in any given instance , destroy a man 's peace and happiness both for time and eternity , still they insist that he shall not hesitate ; that he shall modify nothing ; that he shall go straight forward ; or else be branded as a man destitute of honour , and unfit for the society of gentlemen . To this description of men it appears that Herod belonged , for their principles alone will explain his conduct . On his natal day , in a season of festivity , in which it was his object to make a pompous exhibition of every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured the excellence to which he aspired , he had made such a promise as only a monarch could make , and had confirmed the promise by reiterated oaths . The fulfillment of these oaths was doubtless , in his expectation , to exalt him still more , and to make him the object of admiration and envy , with those whose opinion he most regarded . Such oatlis /z/ were not to be broken or modified , wbatever might be the hazard , the pain , or the loss , which a strict compliance with them might produce . He could lose nothing that he valued so much as his honour . This is the standing remark which such men have ever made on such an occasion . What , therefore , though every principle of justice and morality , and every dictate of religion and humanity , forbade a compliance ; what though he was very sorry " that he had placed himself in this predicament , and perhaps would have given the half of his kingdom to be fairly delivered from it ? still , when Herodias demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake he would not reject her. * ' To have done so , while he retained his false rule of judging , would have sunk him in his own estimation , even though his power might have protected him , as probably it would have done , against the open sneers and insults of his associates . But their esteem and admiration was , in fact , the idol that he worshipped . Hence 2 . It is added in the text - For their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her . " It must be admitted that the circumstances in which Herod was placed were calculated to give the utmost force to his corrupt principles , to render any retraction peculiarly difficult and mortifying , and to urge him al most irresistibly , over the precipice which he had rashly and foolishly approached . Those who sat with him were * his lords , high captains and chief estates of Galilee ; " the first men of his kingdom , both in civil and military /q/ stations . They had been invited by their prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting with him at a banquet , in which , doubtless , every efTort was employed to give to convivality and festive pleasure their highest zest , they were surprised by an unusual , voluntary and condescending act of the daughter* of the monarch 's wife , Salome , possessing all the charms of youth and beauty , and all the grace which art could give them , enters the assembly , and exhibits , for the entertainment of the guests , her superior skill in dancing . Enraptured by this unexpected heightening of the gratification both of himself and his company , Herod repeatedly and publickly swears that he will reward her courtesy with any gift tliat she shall please to name , even to the half of his kingdom ; and he appears to have urged her to put his sincerity and princely munificence to the proof . Here , then , were power , pride and gallantry , all put in pawn for the fulfilling of his promise , and all , of course , to be indelibly tarnished , if the pledge were not redeemed . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few moments to consult with her mother , ' came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked saying , 1 will that thou give me , by and by , in a charger , the head of John the Baptist ? ' * ' What a moment was that for Herod ! At that moment he probably saw that all which had been done by these artful and abandoned women , w-as the result of a deliberate and deep laid plot to ensnare him , and to ' W ' learn from Jocphus that her name was Salome . C d &; e 2 ) /z/ compel him to sacrifice John . But he saw himself completely taken in the snare . He saw the truth of what lie might before have learned from Solomon , that " a whore is a deep ditch ; and a strange woman is a narrow pit . She also lieth in wait as for a prey , and increaseth the transgressors among men . " But in his opinion he had made this discovery too late to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have exposed the detestable artifice by which he had been entrapped , and to have refused , decisively and firmly , to be made the instrument of a harlot 's murderous vengeance ? Certainly he ought to have done so . But to do it his whole temper must have been changed at once ; all his maxims of honour must have been abandoned , and his whole system of life and domestick arrangements must thence-forward have been completely changed . In a word , he must have taken shame and blame to himself before all the rank and fashion of his kingdom , knowing at the same time that they would not fail to despise him for doing it . To him , feeling as he did , this was worse than death itself . No - it was , without doubt , a prime object to dissemble and conceal his folly and his guilt . He had himself placed the wretched women who had beguiled him in the stations which they held , and in which he still intended to maintain them . He would , therefore , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had over-reached him , and made him the tool of their base and malignant passions . The desire to conceal all this would be among his strongest temptations to fulfil , with apparent fearlessness , the promise /q/ which , in his heart , he was exceeding sorry that he had ever made . Ah ! it is a dreadful situation when a man has gone so far in vice , that he is in a sort compelled to go farther ; - that he can not retreat without shame and confusion , nor go forward without increasing his guilt and sealing his perdition . How cautiously should the first steps be avoided , which may lead to such a fearful issue ! But an alternative , after all , it has been supposed and said , was left to Herod , by the adoption of which he might have waved a compliance with the revolting request of Salome , without forfeiting his honour , even in the estimation of his companions . He might , it has been suggested , have told her , that he felt himself at liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , though certainly not to make one that was less so : that seeing her disposed to wrong herself , by asking what he was sure she would eventually regret , he must interpose to prevent it , and would do so by granting her what he knew would afford her the most lasting satisfaction : and then , that he might have made her a present which would have been a proud display of his royal power and liberality . It is not certain , however , that Herod had time or sobriety enough to think of such an alternative as this ; nor , if it had been suggested , that either he or his companions would have judged that its adoption would preserve his honour . It is true , indeed , that those who claim for themselves exclusively the character of men of honour , do seem , at times , to go a good deal farther than their /z/ own principles require . But it must be recollected that those who have not been taught in their school , are probably not competent judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched monarch whose case we consider , had sworn to give Salome wJiatever she should ask . Now , to propose any thing else than what she did ask , might seem to reflect on her choice ; and not to consist with that high and delicate regard to sex and rank , which men of honour always affect . It might also appear unprincely ; as implying , either that he wanted the power , or else that he was afi'aid , to do what had been required : and to be afraid of any thing , except t ! ie loss of honour - afraid even of the wrath of Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell , " is what - I speak it with horror - is never permitted to a man of false honour , when that honour is at stake . The fact undoubtedly was , that the fidelity of John had given an offence to Hcrodias , for which she was resolved that nothing but his blood should ever atone . No gratification could be put in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sat with him knew it too . When therefore , this was asked , his honour , he thought , was concerned to grant it , without hesity.tion or evasion ; because to do otherwise , would be considered as a reproachful shrinking from ! iis promise and oatlis , by those with whom he was associated . Yes - though the plain truth must appear like paradox or irony - a nice sense of honour required , in his opinion , that he should immediately kill the best man in his kingdom , and cause his reeking head to be brought in a charger to a royal ban- DISCOURSE Vin , 211 quet , and there that it should be formally delivered to the enchanting damsel , who had requested this princely present , and that she should take it and deliver it to her mother , who had prompted her to demand it . The point of honour required exactly thla bloody proceeding , and admitted of no alternative . It was nothing , therefore , though the thing itself was shocking beyond all description - so shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or female hands help to execute it ; nothing , though ' the king was exceeding sorry " that he had sworn to comply with this request ; nothing , though the compliance would strike at his character , safety and conscience , all at once ; nothing , though it was forbidden by every law of God , of justice and of humanity - as a man of honour , he could not and would not refuse it . He did not refuse it - The holy Baptist was that night beheaded ; and a sting was fastened in the bosom of this man of honour , which no time ur efforts could ever extract , whose poison no art could mitigate , and whose corroding anguish , through the whole of subsequent life , was , we have reason to fear , the earnest only of the gnawings of that worm which should never die , and the torments of that fire which should never be quenched . It now remains to close this discussion , by directing your attention to some important lessons of practical instruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforces . It teaches us I. To beware , generally , of imbibing and avowing false and dangerous principles , and particularly of die /z/ perversion and abuse of the principle of honour and shame . The whole of Herod 's guilt and misery might , probably , be traced to his Saduceaii tenets . And alas ! how little , frequently , do the young and unthinking suspect , when , with heedlessness and levity , they drink in the principles of infidelity , or adopt any system of loose morals , that they are taking poison of the most fatal kind ; a poison which , if not seasonably counteracted , may prove the bane of all their happiness , both in this world and the world to come . Before they are aware , they may find themselves pursuing a course , or pledged to actions , which lead directly to ruin . Yet retraction then will be all but impossible . They will have taken their side , and avowed , perhaps boasted and sworn , that in the circumstances in which they now find themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of their associates , therefore , imperiously forbid them to retreat , and impel them forward , it may be against their present conviction and inclination , till they plunge into the gulph of final perdition . My young friends , you can not be too vigilantly on your guard against adopting dangerous principles . Never hastily favour those that are even questionable or doubtful ; and never , especially , pledge yourselves to act on any such principles . If you do , you may speedily find yourselves in so unhappy a dilemma , that you must either retreat with mortification , or persevere in guilt , till it end in destruction . Let me particularly and earnestly caution you , as a matter of great moment ; against the perversion or abuse /q/ of the principle of honour and shame . A sense of honour and shame , whether rightly or wrongly directed , is exceedingly powerful in its influence ; and the most so , commonly , in minds of the greatest natural sensibility and ingenuousness . This principle was doubtless intended by our Creator to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so conducted and limited as to answer this intention . But alas ! when perverted or excessive , as it often is , it leads to the most awful and appalling crimes . Among others , it is frequently productive of suicide itself . Shame before men , is exchanged for the endless and inconceivable shame and anguish of the invisible world . See , then , the importance of regulating this principle by the unerring standard of divine inspiration . Adopt no principle , as a principle of honour , cherish no sentiment that can excite shame , if it contravene any thing in God 's revealed will . Keep on this ground and you will be safe ; depart from this , and you will certainly be in danger . Holy scripture will teach you , that the principle in question , excellent and useful as it is , within , its proper limits , will lead to sin , and not to duty , when those limits are exceeded . When , therefore , you have done wrong , never refuse , through shame or pride , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if rightly viewed , is far less shameful than to persist , however undauntedly , in error and guilt ; and it will be so estimated by all whose opinion is most deserving of regard . Policy , therefore , as well as duty , points to this course . The wise and the good will never reproach a man for transgressions , which he has fi'ankly /z/ confessed and penitently forsaken . None can do this , but the mean spirited and the hard hearted . But , what ought chiefly to be considered is , that the approbation of God is infinitely to be preferred before that of man ; that we ought to dread the shame and contempt of the final judgment , unspeakably more than any which our fellow worms can at present inflict ; that , in a few fleeting days , it will no longer afi'ect us to be honoured or despised by mortals , but that , if we discharge our duty , we shall secure an eternity of happiness beyond the grave . 2 . Learn from this subject the danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of a general love of pleasure . Herod was probably under the influence of an intemperate use of wine , and he was certainly intoxicated w ith the pleasures of a feast , when he made the rash oaths which produced embarrassment , regret and murder . Nor was his case , let it be remembered , a singular one , except in the atrocity of his crimes . It is the common and general effect of intemperance , to produce guilt , remorse and infamy . The man who has drowned his reason in his cups , has sunk below the level of the brutes , and is often the worst of madmen . How then should every one who has any regard either to his body or his soul - to his personal dignity , to his reputation , to his health , to his substance , to his fiimily , to his peace of mind , or to his eternal interests - how shoidd he avoid the first and most distant approaches to inebriation ? How watchfid should he be against forming habits , DISCOURSE Vlll. 215 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How resolutely should he withstand all temptations , or solicitations , to pass the bounds of the strictest temperance and self possession ? Believe it , there is no vice into which men are oftener led l ) y insensible advances , than into intemperance . A powerful propensity to it is frequently contracted , before the danger is so much as suspected . To guard against it elTectually , I would recommend to you all to adopt , and inflexibly to adhere , to a whole system of practice , calculated not only to ensure your sobriety on particular occasions , but to preserve your habits from any tendency to its violation . In doing this , the most powerful of all considerations should be , that in the enumeration , by an inspired apostle , of characters which preclude all hope of salvation , the drunkard is one . While he remains such , he is one of those who " have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God . " Against the indulgence of lewd propensities , as well as of intemperance , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Herod had been chaste , there is no probability that he would ever have murdered John . It was his adulterous connexion with Herodias , which originated the faithful reproof of the Baptist , so oifensivc to himself , and to the harlot whom he called his wife . It was her blood-thirsty malignity , aided by that art and subtility which licentious women usually possess , that en snared him effectually , and impelled him to the deed which has blasted him with eternal infamy . But Herod /z/ is by no means a solitary instance of these effects of libidinous indulgence . History , both sacred and profane , and even your own observation , may furnish you with many examples , of at least similar effects , proceeding from the same cause . Perhaps , indeed , there is no one vice which , in its extreme , more debases and pollutes the mind , more brutalizes the whole man , leads him to more shameless , detestable and atrocious acts , and which oftener gives him a diseased body , as well as a degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is there any vice to which a man is more in danger of becoming enslaved , if he indulges in it at all . Yet this is a vice , my young friends , to which persons at your age are especially exposed , and against which they need to be peculiarly guarded . Diflicult therefore as the subject is of being properly and profitably discussed in publick , I could not forbear to state to you what you have heard . - For the rest - and for the best description that was ever given of the arts and the dangers of a lacivious w'oman - I refer you to the seventh chapter of the book of Proverbs ; and I cainestly exhort you to read it seriously , and to ponder it deeply , in your closets . In the mean time , I shall repeat in your hearing the solemn and impressive admonition with which that chapter closes - " Hearken unto me now , therefore , ye children , and attend to the words of my mouth : Let not thine heart decline to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hath cast down many wounded ; yea many strong men have been slain by her . Her house is the way to hell , . going down to the chambers of death . ' ' /q/ But , beside intemperance and lewdness , the excessive love of pleasure may lead to evils without number . Many , like Herod , become intoxicated with pleasure , when not entirely intoxicated with drink . Their spirits are so elevated , and their passions so excited , by the company and the pleasurable scenes around them , that they are set loose from all sober restraint . In these circumstances , they say and do many foolish and extravagant things , for which , on reflection , they are " exceeding sorry . " But they have so entangled themselves , their pride , their honour , their character , have become so enlisted or involved , that they persist , and add one vice and folly to another . Examine the sources and causes of violated friendships , of deadly offences , of bloody quarrels , of family as well as personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contentions which degrade the characters of all who are concerned in them ; - examine , and you will find that a large part of them may be traced to taverns , to theatres , to parties of pleasure , to seasons of mirth and festivity , or of public display - to some place or occasion where the parties were stimulated by the observation of their companions , or intoxicated with the flow of their own spirits , so as to lead them to speak and act , as they never would have spoken and acted in their sober moments . There they committed their first error , there they pledged their character , and afterwards their pride would not permit them to correct the faults into which their precipitancy had led them . Listen to the admonition of the /z/ apostle . * Young men exhort to be sober minded . ' Yes , and that you may preserve sobriety of mind , I do earnestly exhort you , to stand aloof from all places of unlawful pleasure . Shun them , as you would shun the pestilence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lawful , at times and pluces of innocent indulgence or recreation , I counsel you to beware of too much excitement . Let not your spirits hurry you away into any excess , or extravagance , of speech or action . Guard especially against all hasty and rash expressions , all precipitate promises or engagements , which , in the hour of reflection , you will review with deep , and it may be , with unavailing regret . 3 . From what has been said in regard to Herod , you may learn that the principles on which he acted , are the the very same on which men of false honour act at the present time . Consider the duellist . He has adopted a standard of honour , in opposition to the dictates of revelation , reason and conscience . In a hasty or unguarded moment , or perhaps , indeed , with coolness and deliberation , he has given or provoked a challenge , and is pledged to a deadly combat - it may be with one whom he has loved or venerated . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fi iends , who , in a few hours , may stand over his lifeless corpse , and to the latest hour of life suffer anguish , and perhaps poverty too , as the consequence of his rash act ; while his own soul , all covered with its crimes , and self- sent to the bar of God , shall stand there to /q/ receive its unchanging destination . Or suppose it is Ins antagonist who is to fall . Then , though he survive , he may he corroded with remorse to the end of his days . The spectre of his murdered brother , hurried to the eternal world , may haunt his dreams , and seem to tell him of another meeting beyond the grave . But what of all this ! The challenge has been given and accepted ; and the man of honour has promised with an oath , never to refuse such a call as is now made upon him . Although , therefore , when he reflects on these things , he is " exceeding sorry " that heis thus circumstanced ; yetj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their sakes who have been his chosen associates , he will not refuse to figiit . He will do it , though all temporal and all eternal considerations honour alone excepted forbid him . Honour in one scale , and all the tenderest endearments of life , with the alternative of heaven or hell in the other - honour preponderates . He fights and falls ; or he lives , to die a thousand deaths ! And are these , O false honour ! these the offerings that must be made at thy shrine ? Thou bloody Moloch ! thou fiend accursed ! depart from earth to thy native hell ! Precious youth of my charge - I charge you , in the name of Christ our Saviour , have nothing to do with this sanguinary demon . No matter what are the consequences of not accepting a challenge . They weigh less , in comparison with those which follow an acceptance , than the dust of the balance against the everlasting mountains . // Let us next consider the gambler . He too claims to be a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he neglects or refuses to pay . His wife and children , likewise , often want their daily bread , and arc likely to be turned houseless on the world . But he will sell or pawn his property , to the last farthing , that his delts of honour may be fully paid . He is , indeed , exceeding sorry that this necessity is laid upon him , but his honour he must sustain . Promises and obligations , of the most sacred kind , he will habitually violate ; but a promise , or an oath , to pay a debt of honour , he will always fulfil . My dear brethren , there is , in these two practices of duelling and gambling , all that is calculated to provoke not only our abhorrence , and indignation , and regret , but our scorn and derision too . If tliey did not involve such serious consequences , they would be the fittest of all subjects for ridicule and contempt . There is inherent in these practices something so infinitely absurds and in the claims to honour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous , that it is didicult to expose them in their true colours - and I have sensibly felt this dilRculty - without the appearance of a manner that savours of sarcasm , and borders on the ludicrous . But ah ! their coiiseqiiences are serious beyond the power of description . These consequences produce no smiles , but many tears . Every christian should weep over them . Every christian should do all in his power to prevent them . And every christian must , as things absolutely inconsistent with his character and profession , utterly /q/ renounce and avoid these practices for himself . Remember this , my young friends - Remember that you must renounce them ; or as the dreadful alternative , renoujice the gospel and the hope of heaven . Keep this alternative steadi'y and constantly before you . If you do this and are not lost to reason as well as to religion , you can never be duellists or gamblers. 4 . Finally - From the example of Herod , learn , on the one hand , the danger of losing the serious impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ; and on the other , the importance of cherisliing them , till they deepen into permanent piety . When Herod heard the Baptist gladly , and did many things agreeably to his instructions and exhortations , there was a flattering prospect of his thorough reformation . Had he retained and cherished the impressions which he then felt , had he yielded to the dictates of conscience and gone the whole length which duty required , how happy had been the change which would have been effected in his character ! what an enormity of crimes and guilt would he have avoided ! how different would have been his condition on earth , and his prospects for eternity ! But he stifled the remonstrances of conscience , he resisted the Spirit of grace , he lost his regard for religion , he turned a deaf ear to his faithful reprover , he abandoned himself to his vices ; at length he became a murderer ; and at last , as history informs us , he lost his throne , was banished from his country , and with Herodias , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miser- /z/ able death in exile . A course similar to this , if not its exact parallel , has often been witnessed , since the time of Herod . There have been many , who , in youth especially , promised to be examples of piety , the blessings and ornaments of society , who yet , in the end , became abandoned to every thing vicious and vile . For a time they were attentive to instruction , moral in their behaviour , did many things commendably , were seriously thoughtful about their eternal interests , nay , deeply anxious about their salvation , and apparently " not fir from the kingdom of God . " But from sloth or carelessness , from a strong attachment to something inconsistent with religion and forbidden by it , from the seduction of bad companions , from imbibing corrupt principles , from the scoffs and sneers of the profane , from a desire to be rid of painful feelings and unpleasant duties , from the pleasures or the business of the world - ( from some of these causes , or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the voice of conscience was disregarded and suppressed , the mind was turned away from religious trutli and duty , serious impressions were effaced , hardness of heart ensued , positive aversion to religion soon followed , indulgence in vice speedily succeeded , infidel sentiments were then adopted , and the apostacy became complete - The unhappy men lived in siu , sometimes vvith a degree of decency , but oftener as profligates or blasphemers ; and they died without hope , perhaps in horror and despair . Be warned , my dear youth , for what I have told you is not ficiiou , but /q/ fact , which I have witnessed for myself ; - be warned not to trifle with serious impressions of religion ; be afraid of losing them ; be careful to cherish them ; beseech God to strengthen and increase them - * Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption . " A season of tenderness of mind in regard to the demands of religion , is a season awfully critical and important . Eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which a man acts at such a time . If it pass over without a thorough conversion from sin to holiness , it is frequently followed by great obduracy or stupidity : sometimes , as you have heard , by final apostacy . If , on the contrary , such a season be carefully , and watchfully , and prayerfully improved , it terminates in a renovation of the heart ; in vital union with the Lord Jesus Christ ; in genuine set ' tied piety . Be not deceived : there is , be assured , no entire security against your ultimately becoming scepticks and profligates , unless you become real practical christians . You may think otherwise , and resolve to be regular and moral , and to treat refigion with decency and respect , without embracing it cordially as a rule of life ; and of all this , I readily admit , there are some examples . But I do affirm , that there are also many examples of those who set out in life on this plan , with as fiiir a prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone eventually into all the extremes of corrupt principles and licentious practice ; and therefore /z/ that no individual who adopts the plan , can have any security that he will not be added to the number . Ah ! my young friends , we all depend for our safety on the preserving grace of God . Let Him remove the restraints of his grace from any man , and that man is undone . ' He , therefore , who trtistcth in his own heart is a fool . " If you would be secure , you must seek security by choosing the Lord as your portion , and by constantly imploring his grace , protection and guidance . He who does this , is the most promising candidate for happiness and usefulness on earth , and the only candidate for the bliss of heaven . The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge , but fools despise wisdom and instruction - Hear , O my son , and receive my sayings , and the years of thy life shall be many . I have taught thee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right paths . When thou goest thy steps ghall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest thou shalt not stumble . Take fast hold of instruction ; let her not go : keep her , for she is thy life . ' /z/ A devout man - 1 HIS is the character of Cornelius , a Roman centurion , and the first convert to the faith of Christ , from among the Gentiles . It does not appear that he was a Jewish proselyte . Yet , having his military station in the land of Israel , he had no doubt derived great benefit from the Jewish scriptures ; for it is certain that he was not only instructed in the knowledge of the true God , but a most fervent and acceptable worshipper of Him , even before he was visited by the apostle Peter . Till that time , however , he was but very imperfectly acquainted with some of the most important points of true religion . Men may sometimes have much grace , who have but little knowledge ; especially when their defect of knowledge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of the means of information . It is always true , indeed , that when divine grace changes the heart , an ardent desire will be felt to know more of God and of his holy will ; so thiat rapid and surprising advances in /z/ knowledge will often be made , as soon as the opportunity of acquiring it is offered . But before this , the soul may be deeply sanctified ; and then , as in the case of Cornelius , better information will be earnestly sought ; and in the order of God 's providence , it will usually not be long , before it will , in some good degree , be communicated . Unto every one that hath - saith the Saviour - shall be given , and he shall have abundance - If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself - He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . ' ' ' It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endeavour , in a reliance on divine aid , to give you the outline , and the chief features of such a character as that of Cornelius was - the character of a devout man ; and then to make a practical improvement of the subject . The characteristick distinction noticed in the text is , I am well aware , undervalued and despised by the profane and ungodly world . But let us be careful that we be not found among those to whom it is said - " Behold , ye despisers and wonder and perish " ! Assuredly the solemn hour is not far distant , when to have been a rich man , a powerful man , an influential man , a wise man , a learned man , will afford little consolation ; but when to have been a devout man , will fill the soul with hope , and joy , and triumph . Yield me , then , your serious attention , while I endeavour to present such a man to /q/ your view , as the object of your imitation ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - attainments which , in some measure we must all make , or be undone forever- I begin with observing , in general , that a devout maa is the designation of an individual , not only of real piety , but of etnifient piety ; of piety which is not merely or principally speculative ; or such as consists chiefly in a profound or accurate knowledge of the principles of religion . A devout man is one whose religion is eminently practical . It is seated in his heart , and constantly influences his affections and actions . It is continually leading liini to humble intercourse with his Maker ; to commune with the Father of his spirit , through the mediation of his Redeemer ; to an impressive recollection of the divine presence ; to seek the light of God 's countenance ; and to regard , as the highest happiness on earth , the comfortable assurance of his favour . In a word , his piety has a direct and constant influence on his temper and his life . He strives to iuiitate the perfect example of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission to the will of God , in meekness , in humility , in condescension , in kindness , in the forgivness of enemies , in going about doing good . The regard of the devout man to the law of God is peculiarly eharacterized by its being impartial , though imperfect . He feels his obligation to obey all the laws of God , and he steadily aims at such an obedience . Yet this obedience is not ostentatious ; not rendered that /z/ men may observe and applaud it . It is an obedience which is humble , sincere , strict , simple , frank , cheerful , coming right from the heart , - dictated by cordial love to God , to the law which he has given as a rule of life , and to the grace of that gospel in which is all a sinner 's hope . Nothing can be farther from the character of a truly devout man , than to take one part of religion and leave another . A spurious and unfounded claim to this character , has indeed , sometimes been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing the truly devout man into disesteem and contempt with the world . There have been men who have pi-d'essed and appeared to be very devout , to be mu.ch given to prayer , who have talked much of the spiritual part of religion , and of their own engagements and exercises in it ; and yet , at this very time , as has eventually appeared , these men were living in the violation of all the moral laws . They were ambitious , or covetous , or dishonest , or unclean , or intemperate , or vindictive , or idle , or mischief makers , or liars , or whatever else , capable of disguise , is vile and impious . Certainly a more detestable race of hypocrites than these can not exist : and we not oidy give them up freely to all the reproach and abhorrence of the world , but we claim to join in that abhorrence ; to join in it with as much sincerity , and with far more regret , than they who sneer at all religion , because these men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I repeat ir , the man truly devout , is of all men the most careful not to neglect any part of his duty . He is what he appears to be . He lives as in the presence of Him " who seeth in secret , " and who will * ' bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good or whether it be evil . " Of all hypocrisy , therefore , he is deeply afraid ; not only of th . t which is intended to deceive the world , but of that also which arises from self-deception . He sacredly regards truth and uprightness in all his words and actions . He is exemplary in obeying the second table of the divine law , as well as the first . He is just and benevolent to man , as well as devout toward God . His piety sweetens his temper , instead of souring it ; and in place of disposing him to omit any duty which he owes to his fellow creatures , it renders him doubly scrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every duty , when seasonably performed , as equally a part of the service of God ; and to do it " as unto the Lord and not to man . " Having taken this general view of the character of a devout man , let us now consider it somewhat in detail , and examine its constituent parts . 1 . First , then , a devout man is a roieived 7naji . " Yc can not gather grapes of thorns , nor figs of thistles . A corrupt tree can not bring forth good fruit . " You may as well expect an effect without a cause ; nay , you may as well expect a cause to produce that effect which is most unnatural , or contrary to its proper tendency , as to expect a holy temper and life to proceed from an un- /z/ renewed human heart . * The carnd mind is enmity against God ; " it is sinfnl and depraved throughout ; and while it remains so , all its exercises will be sinful . It must therefore he renewed , before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovation that the temper , taste and desire are implanted , out of which genuine devotion grows , and in which it has its root and nourishment . That " repentance unto life , " and that faith in Christ " for pardon and justification before God , which are the foundation of all holy communion with Him ; that love to Jehovah and to his law , which is the vital principle of all genuine and acceptable obedience ; all these , without which a devout life can not exist , - all are the fruits , or products , only of a renewed nature . A renewed nature , therefore , is essential to a devout life , as a cause to an effect , as the root of a tree to its foliage and fruit . But there is something farther , of high importance , that must be noticed here - Oh that I could state it in such a manner as suitably to impress your minds and my own . Shall I say , then , that some men are converted more than others ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet some good men are more thoroughly renewed , are far more extensively or deeply sanctified than others . Now a devout man , as we have already remarked , is a man of eminent piety ; and therefore he who aspires to this character , must remember that he can not possess it without a large measure of heart sanctilication . Without this , all efforts at an ex- DISCOURSE IX . gSl emplary discharge of duty , will be difficult , feeble , and often omitted ; and all that will be done at last , if not entirely abortive , will be miserably imperfect . He that would be really and eminently devout , must be inwardly and eminently holy . 2 . A devout man is a inan of prayer . He of whom the text is spoken " prayed to God always. * ' The terms devout and prayerful are , indeed , very nearly of the same import . It is from his being much devoted to prayer , that the devout man , chiefly and primarily , obtains his distinctive appellation . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To pray much , and to have much real engagedness in prayer , is essential to the character . The devout man always considers his seasons of prayer , as among the most precious and pleasant of his life . Still , he knows that he is sanctified but in part , and that every christian is in danger of neglecting , or of becoming remiss in prayer , from temporary coldness , and a consequent indisposition to the duty . Christian prudence will therefore dictate , not only . that he set apart a portion of time daily for secret prayer ; but that the time and place for engaging in it , be deliberately assigned and sacredly regarded ; and that such arrangements of secular concerns be made , that , in ordiuary circumstances , the closet hour shall not be interrupted by company or worldly care , but be sacred to heavenly intercourse . The devout man will sooner lose a portion of his usual sleep , than lose the privilege and comfort of sweet communion with his /z/ God . This is his spiritual nourishment , aiul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to guard against neglect , he have set times for prayer , he will not confine himself to these . A devotional frame of spirit will lead him to seize many a secret opportunity to pour out his heart before God , beyond his twice or his tlirice in a day ; and to observe seasons of special prayer , sometimes accompanied with fasting , when peculiar providences , or his own state of mind , demand them . Like the holy men of scripture , the devout man will be , in secret , a frequent and fervent intercessor for others ; for his family and kindred ; for all who ask his prayers ; and for many who never ask , but who urgently need them . With the royal Psalmist he will also be able to say ' My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness ; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips ; when I remember thee upon my l ) ed , and meditate on thee in the night watches . " He will likewise frequently use ejriculatory prayei - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , in sorrow and in joy . Devout meditation will often precede , and often mingle with his prayers . On the sabbath of the Lord , especially , he will meditate mucii on the things of God , and his meditation will be accompanied with many devout aspirations of soul . In these exercises his thoughts and desires will ascend to heaven , and anticipate something of its employments and its pleasures . /q/ The devout man will delight in social , as well as in secret prayer . With his family , with christian friends on many special occasions , with the sick and the afflicted , and in the public worshipping assemblies of God 's people , he will not fail to join in this sacred exercise . A meeting for prayer only , that is , a meeting in which there are no other exercises than prayer and praise , will not , when properly conducted , be a dull and tedious meeting to him . Nor will he go to church merely to hear a sermon . The devotional exercises of publick worship - prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshing . In a word , the devout man lives a life of holy intercourse with Heaven . And as it is by prayer that this intercourse is most directly carried on and preserved , he will be ready and rejoice to engage in it , in every way and form , in which the duty is prescribed or sanctioned in the scriptures of truth " Praying always , with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance , and supplication for all saints . " 3 . The devout man will earnestly desire to tinderstand and obey the revealed will of God . So did Cornelius . He had , as we have already remarked , manifestly availed himself of his residence in Palestine , to obtain a knowledge of Jehovah , and of the manner in which his worship might be acceptably performed . He promptly obeyed the divine command to send for Peter , to tell him " what he ought to do . " And when the /z/ apostle came , he said - ' Now , therefore , are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are commanded thee of God . " No devout man , who has access to the Bible , will fail fo become familiar with it . To him it will be emphatically the book . He will read and study it far more than any other book . He will make the testimonies of the Lord the men of his counsel . " ' Whenever he doubts or inquires in regard to duty , his appeal will be to ' ' the law and to the testimony . " In ordinary circumstances , he will suffer no day of life to pass , without reading a portion of holy scripture devoutly . He will treasure it up largely in his memory ; and will meditate on its truths with great delight . They will furnish him with many a mental repast in solitude , and in the wakeful hours of night . He will know experimentally what the Pscilmist meant , when he said of these truths , ' they arc sweeter than honey and the honey comb. * ' He will taste no pleasure superior to that which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his heart , with power and sweetness , by the Spirit who endited it . The devout man may occasionally read the scriptures of trutli to observe the beauty and sublimity of their composition , or with a view to decide points of controversy . But he will oftener - far ofteuer - read them with all his attention engrossed to know the will of God , that he may do it ; that he may apply what he reads to practice ; that his temper and conduct may be improved /q/ and governed by it ; that his devotion may be enkindled , and his affections be sanctified . Hence , with an honest and earnest desire , he will seek to know the real " mind of the Spirit , " in every part of his holy word . Every part he will esteem precious ; and by comparing one part with another , and combining the whole , he will become a consistent , exemplary , bible christian . Tlie devout man will , also , be a diligent and serious attendant on the preached word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' and that the preaching of the gospel is a divine ordinance , he will never absent himself from it for a trivial cause ; never because he thinks himself already better instructed than those who occupy the sacred desk ; never on the pretence that he can read a better sermon at home , than he can hear at church . He knows that without the divine blessing , means apparently the best adapted to do good , will never produce that effect ; and , on the contrary , that with the divine blessing , means which appear very imperfect or defective , will be completely efficacious ; and that vvhea men attempt to supercede an appointment of God by a device of their own , they have no reason to look for his blessing , but rather to expect his frowns . Nothing , therefore , but causes not to be controlled , will prevent the regular attendance of the devout man on the preached word . And when he hears it , his attention will not be occupied in criticising the speaker ; nor in marking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eu ' /z/ deavouring to obtain spiritual edification for himself . This is his great object , and if he misses this , he can not be satisfied . The preaching that is not ciilcidated to give him this , he can never approve . He could not approve it , though it should exhibit the imagination of Milton , the reasoning of Locke , the learning of Cudworth , or the eloquence of Gabriel . He can take notliing as a substitute for the food of his soul . And what he desires and seeks he often finds . He is often fed and refreshed from the provisions of God 's house . In the strength of what he there receives , in a single attendance , he sometimes goes forward with alacrity , for many days , in his christian course . He both remembers and anticipates sanctuary seasons , as among the most profitable and delightful portions of his earthly existence . On sacramental occasions , in particular , not only the sweet and heavenly communion which he holds with his dear and adored Saviour , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel , illustrated and enforced at the time , and deeply impressed by the solemnities of that sacred scene , produce a most lasting and salutary influence on his heart and life . In a word , by the preaching of the gospel and its accompanying ordinances , he is instructed , edified , warned , reproved , directed , humbled , encouraged , comfqrted , animated and quickened , as his various circumstances and exigences may demand . 4 . A devout man will always be a man of fajnih/ religion , Cornelius was " one that feared God with all /q/ his house . " He was not only devout himself , but he was desirous that all who were about hitn should be of the same character . Accordingly , we find that he had " a devout soldier , who waited on him continually , ' ' and whom he could trust with his confidential message to Peter . Nay , he was willing and desirous that his house should be a place of meeting for religious exercises ; for we are told that when the apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were come together . " And a most happy meeting it was ; f jr it was here that , " while Peter yet spake , the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word . " How often , since the days of Cornelius , have associations of devout christi .. ns found their Saviour 's promise fulfdled - " where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them . " ! Every devout man will love to live and breathe , as much as he can , in an atmosphere of piety . His religion is social and benevolent ; and it will be among his highest gratifications to see many sharing with him in thebenefits of redemption , and the pleasures of a holy life . On his family he can never look , but with the tenderest concern for every individual , who , he has reason to fear , is yet in an unrenewed state ; and for his offspring he will " travail in birth again , until Cb.rist be formed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and his household after him , that they keep the way of the Lord . " Like Joshua , he will say - as for rae and my house we will serve the Lord . " Pie wiU /z/ carefully , tenderly and perseveringly instruct , converse and pray with his children and servants ; and labour , by every proper method , to win them to the paths of piety and peace . He will , when the occasion demands it , mix authority and correction with persuasion and tenderness ; that he may preserve them from vicious habits , and train them up " in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . " He knows the value of their souls ; he feels responsible to do all in his power to save them ; and he can not be contented while he sees them in danger of endless perdition . My brethren , it is by family instruction , family religion , and family government , that more may be done to serve the best interests both of the church and of the state , than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no truly devout man can be habitually regardless of duties of such high importance and such extensive influence . 5 . A devout man will , like Cornelius , be " a just manP The duties of justice are of the highest obligation upon all men . And a foul reproach it is to religion , when men of the world , who make a righteousness of doing jiistbjj can charge the professed followers of Christ , as , alas ! they sometimes truly may , with being less exact in discharging the demands of justice , than themselves . But such a charge will never lie against a man whose piety is both genuine and eminent . He will be known as a man of strict honesty and honour . He will ' * abstain from all appearance of evil. * ' and of course will have nothing to do with disreputable , or /q/ even with questionable dealings , or transactions . His probity will form a distinct and prominent feature of his character in the eye of the world . His integrity , therefore , will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be punctiliously careful to pay every man his due . He will never take the advantage of any one ; never betray , or be unfaithful to a trust ; never be litigious or contentious ; never grind the poor ; never be cruel or hard-hearted . In all respects , he will act uprightly and conscientiously ; paying a sacred regard to the golden rule laid down by his Saviour - ' All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them ; for this is the law and the prophets. " 6 . A devout man will not only be just , but , according to his ability , liberal also , in the distribution of his worldly substance . Of Cornelius it is particularly recorded , that " he gave much alms to the people ; " and that his " r/q/q/ ; z ? , " as well as his ' prayers , " came up for a memorial* ' before God . In the New testament , covetqusness is declared to be idolatry . It is several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perpetrators of which it is expressly declared , tiiat they shall not inherit the kingdom of God . " Yet the mournful fact must not be dissembled , that there is no inconsiderable number of professing christians , and some that seem to be devout , wiiom we can not vindicate from the charge of manifest and habitual covetousness . What shall we think or say of such iijeu ? I profess , brethren , that I have found it /z/ more difticult to form a favouraMe judgment of these men than of almost any other description of persons , who have any claim to be reckoned pious . On the whole , we must , doubtless , make some allowance for natural temper , and some , also , for the effects of long and bad habits in an unsanctified state . Yet , let us keep in nnnOt , after all , not only that any indication of a covetous temper is peculiarly unamiable and unbecoming in a christian ; but that he in whom it prevails and becomes characteristick let other appearances be what they may - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who is truly devout there will , I think , be but little temptation to this sin . The eminently devout and holy reformer Luther , is stated to have said , that he thought he had been tempted to almost every sin , except covetousness ; but that to this , he had never known a temptation . This seems to me perfectly natural . The devout man is , in a high degree , weaned from the world as his portion . He lives above and beyond it . His heart , and his treasure , and his conversation are in heaven . He can not , therefore , easily form an idolatrous attachment to things that perish in the using ; and , least of all , to sordid pelf . Wealth , if he possess it , he will desire to make subservient to the interests of eternity . That use of worldly piroperty , by which his ' incorruptible inheritance* ' may be ensured or increased , or by which others may he brought to possess the same , he will consider as tht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ He will , moreover , consider all his possessions as the gift of the God of providence ; and himself as the responsible steward of his Lord 's bounty . Hence , he will feel a sacred obligation to promote the glory of God , to the utmost of his power , by all that he holds in trust ; and will think himself entitled to no applause for the distributions which he makes . He will , from the same principle , not think himself permitted to scatter his donations with a careless profusion , or an indiscriminate liberality ; but to make them with discretion and care , that they may be productive of the greatest good of which they are capable . In as much , also , as a devout man is a man of humane feelings , and of ardent and expansive benevolence , he can not , see " his poor brother have need , and shut up his bowels of compassion from him ; " nor see how hundreds and thousands of immortal beings like himself , may be essentially benefited , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his property , and not contribute for this purpose , to the very utmost of his ability . His inquiry will be , not how little will suffice for him to do , but how iniich he may lawfully do , in consistency with other obligations . His heart and his delight is in doing good ; and he has infinitely more pleasure in his acts of beneficence , than a miser ever enjoyed in hoarding his wealth . The detail of his alms deeds , and of his other charities , I shall uot attempt to give . He will consider /z/ the relative importance of every claim on his liberality , and will answer to each , according to a conscientious estimate of its magnitude and moment . 7 . Finally - A devout man will be a man of good report . Such was he whom our text commends . He was of good report among all the nation of the Jews . ' ' You will not understand me here , as affirming that a devout man will never suffer from evil tongues . The venom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best men that have ever lived , have been misrepresented and vilified . Nay ? the spotless life of our Redeemer himself , did not exempt him from the vilest imputations and slanders . But truth is mighty in its influence , and will at length prevail over falsehood and malignity . In a diffusive publick , there is a love of truth and impartiality , which will ultimately do justice to innocence and integrity ; so that a good man will , eventually , be of good report . Those who know him best , will always esteem and love him most . Inquiry , provoked by malignity itself , will serve to extend the knowledge- , 1 his real character . Thus , he will live down the lies and misrepresentations which did him a temporary injury ; and his future reputation will become less vulnerable from all the attacks that have been made upon it . Now , a devout man is , by our supposition , eminently a good man , a conscientious man , a just man , a liberal man . An evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a man . At a distance , indeed , his character may suffer for a short time , but it will , in the /q/ end , in spite of all the endeavours of the wicked to tarnish it , come forth like gold that has passed the fire . The God of providence is on the side of the devout man ; and will ' ' bring forth his righteousness as the light , and his judgment as the noon day . " If he live long , his worth will often be widely known and acknowledged . Sometimes a whole nation , as in the case of Cornelius , will speak his praise ; and distant generations be taught to admire and imitate his virtues - " The memory of the just is blessed . " Having now finished the delineation of the character of a devout ny n , let me remind you of what I have already intim- ) /id , that my design in doing it has been to hold up thispharacter as worthy of general imitation ; as an exemplar which every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what has been said I foresee an objection ; an objection , not from those who directly and openly deny the excellence of the character itself ; for to these I make no reply at present - The objection I anticipate will come from those who will admit , at least in words , that the character which has been exhibited is one of great excellence , and that it were well , perhaps , if the world could be peopled with those who possess it . But they will object that the character is rather ideal than real ; that its colouring is far beyond the life ; that men deeply engaged in the business and cares of the world , can not be as devout as the representation given requires them to be : that , in a word , the character exhibited is out of nature ; and that to busy men , especially , the im- /z/ itation of it is not practicable . I wish to state the objection in all its strength ; and so stated , I admit that it is specious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy you , if you will lend me your candid and serious iittention . Let it be carefully considered , then , whether the representation which has been given is not scriptural . If it be , it must be received as just , and the duties to which it points must be viewed as obligatory . We must be careful not to lower the standard of duty , because it transcends our practice or our inclination . Practice and inclination in that case should be raised to the standard , and not the standard be brought down to them . Now , let it be recollected that , in the representation given , the character of Cornelius , as set forth in the text and context , has been distinctly referred to , as affording a warrant for each particular we have gone over , except the first ; and that no more was asserted there , than what is true of every good man , and therefore must be true of him who is devout : and that in all the enlargments and . illustrations , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by plain passages of scripture , and have invariably , as far as I can judge , accorded with its scope and spirit . The speaker verily believes , that not one leading sentiment has been delivered , which might not be shown to be clearly supported and sanctioned by the authority of holy writ . If , then , what has been said be scriptural , and the scripture be , as it certainly is our /q/ standard of truth and duty , let us remember that every truth , and every duty , is consistent with every other truth , and every other duty . Falsehoods and vices often clash , but truths and duties never do . The inclination or practice , therefore , which keeps any man from being as devout as a scriptural statement requires him to be , must be wrong , and ought to be corrected , instead of being made the ground of a complaint that the statement itself is extravagant or unnatural . The devout man has not been represented as perfect , or sinless . This he certainly never is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , feels , confesses and bewails his imperfections . Nor has his life been represented as an uninterrupted succession of pleasurable exercises , or of holy joy . It is entirely consistent with all that has been said to admit - and I explicitely admit - that he may be acquainted with spiritual conflicts , and sometimes with a degree of dejection and fear . My subject and design required that I should describe the prevailing temper , the general character , and the leading dutieswhich a devout man will always exemplify ; and to exhibit these , not in the lowest degree in which it is possible for them to exist , but in as high a degree as that in which they may actually and frequently be found . Repeatedly have you been reminded that we were considering the character of one eminently pious . It is doubtless true , and important to be remembered , that genuine piety admits of many gradations ; and that there may be a measure of true dcvoutness , in those who are sadly defective g46 DISCOURSE IX . in some lineaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christian brethren , we ought to be very careful not to suffer this , or any similar concession , to render us content with our imperfections . Let us ever keep in mind that the man who wishes for no more religion , than exactly the lowest measure that will carry him to heaven , has , within himself , unequivocal evidence that he possesses no true religion at all . He manifestly views it as a sick man views a nauseous medicine ; which he consents to take that it may preserve his life , but of which he desires to take not a particle more than is necessary to his safety . The man of real piety loves religion for its own sake . He who has * tasted that the Lord is gracious , ' ' always desires to drink deeply of the " cup of salvation , * " - to partake largely of the water of life . ' ' He is humbled while he contemplates his numerous short comings , and covets earnestly the attainments of those whose piety appears to be of a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a holy emulation , and loves to dwell upon it , as an excitement and encouragement to himself , to press towards a higher mark . But , with reference to the point now in discussion , facts probably will be considered as more decisive than arguments . To facts , then , the ap ) eal is confidently made , that the character which has been set before you , taken in its full extent , was not only the character of Cornelius , and of other saints of whom the scripture gives us an account , but that it has often been realized in modern /q/ times - realized not only in ministers of the gospel , and in men of leisure and seclusion from the world ; but in men whose professions or occupations were as little favourable to fervent and habitual devotion , as any employments can be , which are in themselves lawful : and in regard to whom it is also true , that they were as industrious , and as successful , in their several pursuits , as those who paid no regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more eminent or occupied lawyer than Hale ? Who was a more busy or a more distinguished physician than Boerhaave ? Who was more incessantly devoted to science then Boyle ? Who was a more wealthy and extensive merchant than Thornton ? Who was a better soldier than Gardiner ? Who was ever more unfavorably situated for devotion than Meikle ? Yet these were all eminently devout men . And were it proper for me to name the living as well as the dead , I could , blessed be God , point you to busy men , in wliom the character in all its parts is , at this moment , exemplified . Ah ! my brethren , we want nothing but a right heart , to make it practicable , and pleasant too , to be devout , in any business or situation of life which is consistent with our christian character . The business or situation which really precludes , or habitually interferes , with devotion , is unlawful in itself , and ought immediately to be abandoned . But it is only a few , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary business is more unfavourabje to a devout life than worldly concerns /z/ always are . Ydu whom I now address , have surely no ground for such a plea : and the mass of mankind have , elearly. no special hindrance to a holy intercotirse with the Father of their spirits , but that reluctance to the duty which they carry in their own bosoms . Here , indeed , is the true source of the objection to which I have been replying , wlienever it is made to bear on practice . As a point of speculation , or as a matter of temptation , it may occur to any one . But as a satisfying reason , a reason to be deliberately acted on , for not being devout , I truly believe it is pleaded only by those who , in seeking for an excuse , find , or rather fabricate it , here . My dear brethren , it is in this very point - and the truth ought to be plainly stated - that the characteristick difference is found , between those who are born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of God love devotion , and they who are yet alienated from Him never love it . Unsanctified men never love " to draw nigh unto God ; " and hence they always find devout exercises inherently and irreconcilably offensive . They may love speculations on religion , they may learnedly advocate its divine origin , they may defend all its outworks , they may be criticks in the languages of the sacred volume , they may understand its doctrines , they may attend on all the ordinances of the church , they may conti'ibute to its support , they may zealously contend for forms - in a word , whatever is external , or merely intellectual in religion , may be tolerable , and even pleasing to them . But from their heart and affections religion is completely /q/ excluded ; and as these are essential to devout exercises , such exercises are always , to unsanctified men , the object of irreconcilable aversion . Hence it was necessary to show , at the very entrance of this subject , that a devout man must be renewed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is to constitute and complete his character . It appears , then , that if we possess true piety , we not only may but that , in some good degree , we must be devout . Yes , let it sink down into every heart , that he who has not a devout religion , has no genuine religion . He dislikes communion with God ; and heaven itself , if he could be admitted there , would be found a place of no enjoyment to him . A devout spirit is essential to capacitate or qualify us for a participation in the exercises and employments of the kingdom of God above . And the more that any man possesses of this spirit while he dwells on earth , the more ripe has he become for heaven ; and the more of its pleasures will he anticipate , before he rises to the mansions of the just . Among the many considerations , brethren , which urge us to the cultivation of a devout spirit , that which I have last suggested is certainly one , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who shall possess the most of this spirit , will be the happiest christian . It will render all his duties easy and pleasant , it will alleviate all his afilictions , it will render him almost a stranger to fear , it will give him contentment with his lot , it will fill him with divine /z/ consolations , and will often constrain him to say with the apostle , ' ' I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ , which is far better . " But usefulnessj as well as happiness , will be increased , in proportion as a spirit of true devotion is augmented . Not only will the possessor of this spirit adorn and reconunend religion , by the character which you have heard described , and strive to promote it by all those exertions for its direct advancement which constitute a part of that character , but the prayers of devout men have a mighty efRcacy - a mighty efficacy in heaven - a mighty efficacy in drawing down blessings , not only on themselves , but on all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . The prayers and alms of Cornelius brouglit an angel from heaven , to direct him where to find the instruction which he needed ; and in the sequel , the miraculous influence of the Holy Ghost fell on him , and on all his friends who had assembled at his invitation . Brethren , we expect no miracles ; but ! if we had more men like Cornelius ; if the ministers of the gospel were more like him ; if private christians more resembled him ; if we had more of those who wrestle with God , more who are mighty in prayei " we should certainly see the blessed effects of their powerful and prevalent intercession . Tlic Holy Spirit would descend in his saving influence . Revivals of pure religion would take place . Our houses would become Bethels ; our children would become pillai*s in the church of the living God j our schools and /q/ colleges would become nurseries of piety , as well as of science ; and means and instruments would be furnished for evangelizing the world . Yes - devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their alms must furnish the necessary funds , and their prayers must draw down the blessing of God on missions to the heathen , the Mahometans and the Jews . Here , at this moment , is the great want . We want more devout men ; and till we have them , the gospel will not obtain its most rapid and wide extention . Let every christian be sensible of this ; and as he values his own happiness ; as he desires the salvation of immortal souls ; and above all , as he would most extensively promote the declarative glory of his God and Saviour , let hira aspire to more eminence in the character of a devout man . In conclusion , I particularly call upon you , my young friends , to remember that you are now in the period of life most favourable to the formation of this truly excellent and sublime character . Listen to the observations of one of my venerable predecessors in office , distinguished for his profound knowledge of human nature , and accurate observation of mankind . Suffer me - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this college , as I now address you - " Suffer me , upon this subject , earnestly to recommend to all that fear God , to apply themselves from their earliest youth , to the exercises of piety , a life of prayer and eommuniou witli God . This is the source from which /z/ a real christian must derive the secret comfort of his heart , and which alone will give beauty , consistency and uniformity , to an exemplary life . The reason why I mention it on this occasion is , that Tjoiith , when the spirits are lively , and the affections vigorous and strong , is the season when this habit must be formed . There are advantages and disadvantages attending every stage of life . An aged christian will naturally grow in prudence , vigilance , usefulness , attention to the course of providence , and submission to the divine will ; but he will seldom attain to greater fervor of affection , and life in divine worsliip , than he had been accustomed to from his early years ' And is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever eminently devout , you must begin to be so now ? Must this best of all attainments be soon made , or the hope of making it be resigned forever ? I know you are ambitious to hve influence on earth . But by being devout you will , as you have heard , have influence in heaven . Here is the highest , as well as the holiest distinction of mortals . Every devout man , like Jacob , " lias power with God . ' His prayers prevail where the issue of battles is decided ; where kings receive their thrones or ' are hurled from them ; where the destinies of empires are ordered ; where nations are blessed or cursed ; yea , where salvation is extended to immortal souls - one of which is of more value than the material universe , or than all the temporal felicities of man . O ! if you aspire , aspire to do good ; aspire to be prevalent intercessors before the throne of /q/ God . - Blessed Spirit of all grace ! breathe , O breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Transform and sanctify every heart . Make every spirit here devout . Thus shall we be prepared to serve God and our generation most extensively on earth , and then to rise and join in that perfect devotion , which saints and seraphs , in the temple above , offer , through the ages of eternity , to the Father , to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost . Amen . /z/ qwq , IT is known to those who are acquainted with the state of religion Ml this country , about the middle of the last century , that a great and general attention to religion was , at that time , excited in a large part of what were then called the British provinces of North America . The population of the whole intervening region between Maryland and Massachusetts Bay , was , in a gi-eatcr or less degree , affected by this excitement . The celebrated Georgf . VVhitefip:ld , was chiefly instrumental in producing the religious impressions which were then o extensively and generally felt . He , however , /z/ had many and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and censured by many and bitter enemies . The author avows himself of the number of those , who believe that a great and glorious revival of religion then took place ; the happy effects of which , in a measure , remain to the present time . It is not denied , however , and it was admitted and deplored by the friends of the revival while it existed , tluit in many places and in numerous instances , there was much extravagance and delusion . And was it ever otherwise , among those who had been brought up in ignorance or formality , when suddenly and powerfully impressed with a sense of their dangerous state and the importance of their eternal concerns ? Here was , in fact , the real cause of most of the excesses and errors which abounded , at the period contemplated . The pi-oper remedy or preventive of these evils , so far as human efforts can remedy or prevent them , is a well educated ministry , a competent number of able and pious pastors , and a general diffusion of religious knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . The whole of the extraordianry attention to religion , of which the ministry of Mr. Whiteficld and that of his fellow labourers had been the instrumental cause , was often and unsparingly ' reviled and ridiculed , by the enemies of vital piety . This , of course , rendered them the objects of deep abhorrence by those who were the subjects of their censure and sarcasm . But a worse effect was , tliat those who most needed to be instructed and reclaimed from error and extravagance , were rendered exceedingly jealous of friends as well as enemies ; jealous of almost every man who did not justify their excesses ; jealous of him as hostile to the whole revival , and to what they considered as the special work of the Divine Spirit . It was happy for the American church , at this time , that she possessed such men as Dickinson and Edwards . These men were well and widely known for their exemplary holiness of life ; and as the advocates of orthodox principles and vital godliness . They were , likewise , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revival of religion , and vindicators of it , so far as it did not exceed what reason and revelation would justify . Their acknowledged talents , also , gave great weight to their opinions . They both came forward , most opportunely , and ultimately with great effect , to correct the errors and entluisiasm which attended the revival ; while they defended it generally , against the attacks of its adversaries . What was written by president Edwards , from his eminence as an author , and from being printed with his other works , is pretty fully and extensively known . This is not the case with the production of presideiit Dickinson , on the same subject ; although no contemporaneous publication /q/ was probably as much read or had as much influence . It is the second edition of this excellent tract which now lies before the writer , and which bears the following extended title - /z/ A MINISTER AND A GENTLEMAN OF lUS CONGREGATION , /z/ The WORK of God in the conviction and conversion of sinners , so remarkably of late begun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against some uncommon ajifiearances among us are distinctly considered . Mistakes rectified , and the work itself particularly proved to be from the Holy Spirit , /z/ An ADDITION , in a second conference , relating to sundry Antinoinian principles , begining to obtain in some places . By the Rev. Mr. Jonathan Dickinson , Minister of the Gospel at Elizabeth-Town in New-Jersey . Philadelphia , printed and sold by William Bradford at the sign of the Bible in Seco7id-street , 1743 .

But it appears to have occasioned an attestation to the excellence of the publication , from the ministers of the town of Boston , which will be given at length .
