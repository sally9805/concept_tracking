txt ART . XXIII. -. , q treatise on the Materia Medica , intended as a sequel to the Pharmacopa*ia of the United States : being an account of the origin , qualities , and medical uses of the articles and compounds , which constitute that work , with their modes ofprescription and administration . By Jacob Bigelow , .111 . D. author of . american Medical Botany , and Professor of Materia Medica in Harvard University . Boston , Charles Ewer , 1822. pp. 424 . Tins treatise is founded upon the Pharmacopmia of the United States , which has been lately adopted . To this work it is , as its title implies , a supplement or sequel , and consists of a commentary upon its several articles , and an account of their design , character , and application to use . A pharmacopmia is , in its nature , little more than a mere catalogue . It contains barely the names and origin of the simple substances employed in medicine , or of those which , if not simple , come already prepared into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients , and modes of preparation of those which are compounded by him . It is a pharmaceutical directory , which enumerates and describes such drugs and preparations as are called for by physicians , but enters *ot at all into a dis .. cussion of their virtues . It is a mere book of business , containing the information which it is necessary for the physician and apothecary to have in common . It informs the apothecary what // the physican requires ; it reminds the physician of what hi* apothecary keeps . As a hook of instruction alone , it has , of course , little value ; and requires to be accompanied by other works which enter into a description of the qualities and virtues of the articles it enumerates , in order to become of much use to the student . Such a work is this of Dr Bigelow . It is intended as the companion of the Pharmacopceia . The establishment of a new system , which has altered in many particulars the pharmaceutical nomenclature formerly in use , new modelled many of the preparations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered such an undertaking at the present time peculiarly appropriate and seasonable . A consideration of the materia medica , in the most extensive manner of which it is capable , would embrace a consideration of the genera principles upon which external agents produce changes in the actions of the system ; of the relation between those changes , and the processes taking place in disease , in consequence of which the remedy removes or alleviates it ; of the general objects or indications to be had in view in the treatment of disease , and of the nature of disease as connected with those indications ; besides a simple detail of the qualities and uses of the separate articles of which the list of medicines is made up . Indeed a complete vicw of the materia medica embraces nearly the whole field of pathology and therapeutics . A complete treatise upon it would contain the greater part of that which is found in systems of practice1 under a different arrangement , and considered in a different relation . Few writers , however , have proposed to themselves so extensive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has confined himself to a simple detail of the history and uses of the articles enumerated by the Pharmacopceia , without entering , except incidentally , into any of those discussions of a general character , to which we have alluded . So far as its plan extends , it is very complete ; more so we suspect than any other modern treatise ; and contains a greater mass of valuable information than is usually condensed into the same space . We can , of course , attempt no analysis of a book of this nature , particularly as the subjects , of which it treats , are possessed of little interest to general readers . But we proceed to give some slight account of the plan upon which it is written , with such remarks upon its character and execu**on as seem to us just . // The subjects are arranged in alphabetical order ; a method which undoubtedly has the recommendations the author points out and accords best with the objects he has in view , although it gives less opportunity for considering the modus operandi of medicines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their administration , than an arrangement into classes . It is true that a sketch of a system of classification is given at the com-* mencement of the volume , and some remarks in explanation of the meaning to be affixed to the terms designating the different classes . But we think it would have been a valuable addition to the work , had the author entered into a more extended consideration of the general objects for which these different classes of remedies are administered , and the nature of their operation , since there are many important truths with regard to these subjects , and much information which might have been thrown together in this way , before entering upon the details of the work , for which a place could not afterwards he found under the head of any particular article . Each article is described as it respects its origin , its qualities , its medical uses , its forms of exhibition , and doses . Where there is danger that its quality may be occasionally inferior , that it may have deteriorated , or been adulterated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are described , and much information afforded by which physicians may determine if the medicines met with in the shops of druggists are of good quality , from the proper source , and unmixed with any foreign ingredient . More attention is paid to these circumstances than has usually been devoted to them in works upon materia medica , but yet not more than their real importance demands . People in general are not aware , and even physicians are not , to what changes the articles administered in disease are liable from a variety of different causes . Drugs , which are imported , are selected and brought from foreign countries , not by physicians and apothecaries , hut by merchants . They are brought tos an article of traffic and not as a mean of restoring health , and they are therefore liable to all the varieties in virtues and quality to which other articles of commerce are liable , from intentional adulteration and deceit , besides the tcircumstance that those engaged in the purchase are not often judges , and are therefore more likely to be deceived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be influenced by a regard to cheapness of price , than the excellence of an article , as the profit in the sale of an indifferent one at home , will not be lessened in proportion with the price abroad . Cheapness of price will also induce merchants to seek out new sources of supply for drugs which are scarce and in demand ; competition between different sources will induce foreign dealers to reduce their price ; whilst a reduction of price is generally accompanied by a deterioration of quality , or a change of the article for some other of a similar but inferior kind . And indeed such is the effect of different climates and different soils upon drugs of vegetable origin , that it is seldom that the same drug , coming from different places , is of exactly the same quality , although in common use it passes for the same , and is used in a like way . Of such alterations , and substitutions Dr Bigelow gives us a number of striking , examples .. The genuine African columbo has , for some years past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article brought in large quantities from New Orleans , possessing about half the bitterness of real columbo , and apparently the root of Frasera Walteri . It is just beginning to be discovered , that the real Peruvian bark is a scarce article in the markets of the United States , and that its place is taken by a cheaper bark , of a different character , brought from Carthagena and Caraccas , under the name of yellow Mrk , and which there are reasons for supposing to belong to a species of Portlandia . Our importing merchants and druggists inform , me , that this Carthagena bark , under the name of yellow Peruvian bark , constitutes probably nine tenths of the reputed cinchona now consumed in the United States , its wholesale price being to that of realbark of Peru as about one to fifteen . The adulteration of medicines is so easily , if not frequently , effected , that it is not always safe to buy large quantities of any medicinal substance in powder . In Gray 's supplement to the Pharmacopmias may be seen half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which consists of Peruvian bark , mahogany saw-dust , and oak saw-dust , ground together . In the same work is an artificial *7aye ne pepper* which it is conscientiously recommended to color with vermilion , instead of red lead , which last is injurious . In this city , the occupant of a wind mill was lately indicted in one of our courts , &amp;r grinding gypsum into cream of tartar . Dr Paris , mentions a fire in London occasioned by the owner of certain premises being employed in making Balsam of Copaiba. // The misapplication of names is frequently , even in articles of small consumption , a source of important error . I have seen the Hyoscyamus Niger offered for sale in this city under the name of blessed thistle , a harmless plant , still retained by the dispensatories . From the influence of English names , we very often find Carthamus substituted for Crocus , Celastrus scandens for Solanum dulcamara , and the latter for Atropa belladonna . ' Pref. pp. 8 , 9 . This is truly an important subject , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accustomed to do , particularly those who are in the habit of dealing out their own drugs . Where apothecaries prepare and deliver medicines , it is of less moment to the faculty , because their standing and reputation will lead them to be cautious and faithful . We have been feelingly warned , within these few years , of the dangers that assail us through the medium of our food and drink . Mr Accum has excited an effectual alarm upon the subject of death in the pot , but what is this to death in the pill , though some evil-minded persons stand ready no doubt to say , what they affect to believe , that no less was to be expected ? That the indulgences of the palate , highly seasoned viands , luxurious diet , unsparing potations should bring him to death 's door , has been the lot of man from the infancy of his race ? Intemperance of one kind or another has been the foe of his life and health from time immemorial , and it matters little whether the evil is perpetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by a tough beef steak seasoned with artificial Cayenne pepper ; whether the demon lurks in the shape of the sparkling juice of rich Madeira , or of the execrable mixtures sold under the accommodatingname of bitters , for the morning drains or phlegm .. cutters of our backwoodsmen . This might be submitted to ; it is one of the ills that flesh is heir to . But when druggist and apothecary , pestle and mortar , enter into the lists against us ; when death attacks us through our medicines as well as our diseases ; when we swallow poison and saw-dust in the potion which we hoped to find a healing draught ; when we find there is no balm in Gilead which is not sophisticated by vermilion , red lead , or plaster of Paris ; this is indeed the unkindest cut of all , and we can only dispose ourselves to yield up the contest with what dignity we may , and fall with the dying exclamation of Ca3sar upon our lips . // It behoves patients and physicians both to have an eye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prescribe , or the other to swallow , if the honest endeavors of both are to be thwarted by the substitution of some unhallowed and adulterated compound , instead of the pure elixir , tbe unalloyed balsam which alone can amend and heal . What avails it to the sick man , shuddering with the rigors of an intermittent fever , that he has the best medical advice that the twenty-four states can afford him , if he is doomed to perish under the infliction of a diet of factit ' *ous Peruvian bark , composed of the refuse of the tan-yard and saw-pit , soaked in a solution of aloes to give it taste , color , and efficacy ? Who would not rather endure some at least of the tortures of indigestion , than throw himself upon the mercy of those who will send him , for the best ipecac-. uanha , a mixture of powdered sarsaparilla and tartar emetic ; or still worse , a villanous compound of sulphate of zinc and the dust of decayed coffins ? an ominous conjunction- .. -a medicine , one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , to make the food it feeds on . ' Under the head of qualities , are described the various circumstances of taste* color , appearance , &amp;c. by which we are enabled to distinguish medicines from one another , and to determine , in some measure , the excellence of particular specimens . In this connexion also is given such information as is important , with regard to the composition and chemical relations of the articles of the materia medica . So far as those derived from the mineral kingdom are concerned , a knowledge of their chemical composition and relations is of very considerable consequence , and should be accurately acquired . A* it respects those from the vegetable and animal world , an intimate acquaintance is of far less importance , though some geicral notions with regard to their relations with one another , a id their susceptibility of being influenced by chemical agents , are frequently found of great use . This knowledge becomes of service both in the composition of medicines and in their exhibition . For without it , the physician may mix such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralize one another , destroying the qualities of those on which its efficacy depended ; or he may direct those to be tak*ih simultaneously or at short intervals from one another , which shall combine in the stomach and either become inert , or form a third substance of a more powerful and dangerous nature . // But on the other hand , ' says Dr Bigelow , it is not essential that we carry our chemical scruples so far as to consider all substances as incompatible , which produce chemical union or disunion , out of the body , and occasion a precipitate or a change of color . If chemistry be allowed to acquire this ascendency , it ivill encumber the practice of medicine with an insufferable load of clogs and difficulties , and surround our commonest medicines w1th a wail of incompatibles . We should not be able to prescribe the Peruvian bark with chalybeates , lest it should turn them into ink , nor with animal food , lest tannin and gelatine should conspire against us and fill the stomach with leather . It is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material control over the force of chemical agents ; that wh'le they promote some combinations , they prevent others ; that they separate elements which have strong mutual attractions , and dissolve bodies which are insoluble in common menstrua . I be . lieve that the incompatible character , given to some of our common medicines in hooks , has been deduced from chemical experiments more than from medical trials . ' Pref. pp. 12 , 13 . Of the late investigations of chemists into the composition of many of the vegetable medicines , and the nature of some of their constituents , a sufficiently full and complete account is given by our author , although he expresses an opinion , in which we heartily join him , that these researches are likely to be of very little real importance , and that those results only are of practical utility , which are sufficiently general to be uniform , permanent , and of easy application . ' These researches indeed seem to be more nice than wise . They have been prosecuted to a degree of minuteness which reminds one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by instruments of investigation as deceptive and as imperfect . Not only the common constituents of vegetables have been found to differ in almost every different plant , such as gum , mucilage , resin , volatile oils , &amp;c. but a great proportion of those which have active properties present , upon analysis , some new , distinct , and peculiar principle , or an acid or an alkali . Some plants , in fact , have two or three of them ; thus in opium , meconic acid , morphine , and narcotine ; in cinchona , kinic or cinchonic acid , and two alkalies bearing the names of cinchonine and quinine . When we cQnsider the intrinsic difficulty and delicacy of the analysis of vegetable substances , the nature of the processes and agents to which they are submitted , // often alone sufficient to destroytheir chemical character , and the opposite and almost contradictory results obtained by different individuals from the examination of the same plants , it is not perhaps too much to say , that there is in many cases a probability that the elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply evolved by the operation . Under the heads of Uses and Exhibition are considered the physiological influence of medicines , the effects produced by them upon the body , considered as a vital system , their application in disease , and their doses , modes and times of exhibition . This embraces by far the most important part of a treatise on materia medica , and it is on the character of this part that its value must principally depend . In these respects the work before us is judicious , discriminating , and exceedingly practical ; particularly so in pointing out very clearly the comparative value of different articles , and furnishing data from which the student may determine for himself what degree of faith to attach to the reports of the efficacy of various medicines , with which he is constantly assailed . Indeed the highest recommendation , perhaps , which it possesses , is found in the good common sense with which it abounds , and which is particularly displayed in the opinions delivered with regard to the virtues and properties of medicinal agents . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , and that is with respect to the proportion of space devoted to the consideration of different medicines . Some notice is bestowed upon all ; enough in all cases to enumerate their real or reputed powers ; and a larger share of it upon those whose undoubted e tlicacy as remedies gives them a claim to particular distinction . In general this attention is very accurately distributed according to their relative importance ; but there are a few articles with regard to which we regret that the author did not think it worth while to enter into a more copious and extended detail of their character and agency in the treatment of diseases . This might have been done without enlarging too much the size of his book . The fact is , that notwithstanding the immense number of articles of which the physician occasionally makes use , he depends principally upon a very few . Probably were three quarters of the articles of the materia medica struck from its lists , the practice of medicine would be more safe and certain // than it ever has been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful practitioners have been those whose number of agents was limited , and whose method of treatment was exceedingly simple . This arises from the fact , that a thorough acquaintance with the powers of a few important medicines is of more advantag * , than a superficial acquaintance with those of a great many . There are many circumstances which would lead ns to give the work of Dr Bigelow a preference over most of those which are in common use . it is distinguished by a more judicious and discriminating selection of its materials , a comprehensive brevity in its descriptions , and a greater freedom from useless redundancy . Many of the dispensatories in the hands of physicians are too large and copious for convenient consultation ; and this not from the quantity of useful information which they contain , but from the dilution of their valuable matter by an abundance of that which is irrelevant , so that one is completely lost in the heterogeneous mass of good , bad , and indifferent , in which he finds himself immersed . In fact , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice done it as the materia medica . There is no one subject , except perhaps the wonders of the invisible world , upon which the credulity of mankind has been so unremittitigly called into exercise as that of the efficacy of external and internal applications of medicinal substances to effect the cure of diseases . There is nothing , about which they are so easily deceived by stale and palpable artifices . They stand always ready to believe the most exaggerated and improbable representations with a faith which strains neither at the gnat nor the camel . Of this disposition of mankind , physicians have always had their due proportion ; and it has displayed itself , more especially , in treatises on materia medica . It has been the misfortune , too , of works of this kind , that they have generally been compilations , and have thus not only given currency to the unfounded notions of their authors , but have also embodied the accumulated results *of the credulity of all other writers , and entailed them upon their unhappy readers . Speaking of the materia medica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , it is perhaps , of all the physiological sciences , that which best shows the caprice of the human mind . What do I say ? It is not a science // for a methodical mind , it is a shapeless assemblage of inaccurate ideas , of observations often puerile , of deceptive remedies , and of formuke as fantastically conceived , as they are tediously arranged. ** An individual , not yet initiated into the arcana of medical science , would be led to imagine , from the perusal of some books of this kind , which enjoy a good share of reputation , that the resources of the art of healing were inexhaustible ; that for every disease there was a remedy , upon which you might lay your finger at once , without dread of failure . The only merit , of which their authors seem to have had an idea , was that of industry in collecting ; of judgment and discrimination in selecting and collating , they could have had no conception . It certainly is a high recommendation of the present work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of the virtues of medicines , not only without good assurance of the authority on which they are alleged , but without even an examination of it . There are no gross and unqualified statements , borrowed loosely from those whom accident , interest , or desire of personal reputation-for there are some men who seem to consider their character implicated in maintaining that of a remedy they have introduced-have led to make exaggerated representations of the effects which they have witnessed from the exhibition of some particular articles . All the opinions delivered with regard to the powers of . medicines are tempered by that philosophical spirit of scepticism , with which every one , who has been engaged in the practice of physic with an unprejudiced observation , must approach the subject . There is no undue commendation bestowed , no extravagant praise ; the claims of all are examined with fairness , and justice is generally administered to them with great equality . We have one word to say with respect to the style , which , along with other circumstances , recommends this work to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspicuous , and concise . And these are no small excellencies , when it is com pared with some of the medical productions of our countrymen , whose ambitious and inflated manner , particularly when contrasted , as it may sometimes be , with their lean ideas , shows more of a disposition to cull the flowers of rhetoric , than gather Ariat . Generale , Thtrod. // the seeds of science , forgetting , no doubt , that where the blossom is monstrous , the fruit is apt to be abortive . To our remarks upon this work , we wish to add some account of the National Pharmacopoeia , by the appearance of which it was suggested , and upon which it is founded . We are the more desirous of doing this , because it has been made the subject of so much undeserved censure and obloquy , that we esteem it almost a duty to do what little lies , in our power to remove the prejudice which may have been excited against it in the minds of those who , not being members of the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its merits . The proposal for forming a Pharmacopoeia of the United States , was made by the late Dr Lyman Spaulding , of New York , a gentlemen much respected in his profession , to the New York County Medical Society , in the beginning of the year 1817 . It was favorably received by that society , and in accordance with it , the next year , a plan for effecting the object was prepared , and measures taken to carry it into execution . According to this plan , district conventions were to be called in each of the grand divisions of the United States , Eastern , Middle , Southern , and Western . These conventions were to select delegates to form a general convention , to be held at Washington , and each was requested to prepare a Pharmacopoeia to be submitted to that meeting . In pursuance of this plan , and in consequence of an invitation from the society which originated it , delegates were elected from a great proportion of the medical societies and schools in the different parts of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions had a meeting , the eastern and middle , each of which prepared a Pharmacopoeia . Still , in the southern states , although a quorum did not assemble , yet measures were taken to secure the election of delegates for the general convention . This was held in the city of Washington , in January 1820 . The eastern , middle , and southern districts were represented , and from the pharmacopoeias presented by the two former , the convention proceeded to compile a pharmacopoeia for the United States , which was published at Boston in the course of that *year , and has gone extensively into circulation throughout the country . In the formation of it , the American medical public was // fairly represented . The plan met with a more cordial approbation and a more ready co-operation than could have been anticipated . Twenty incorporated medical bodies , including state societies and the faculties of colleges , of seventeen different states , beside the District of Columbia , expressed their decided concurrence in the measures that were adopted , and nearly all of them were represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the world with the countenance of the great body of the profession , its authority can not well be questioned , and those who concurred in its formation are , in some measure , bound to give it their support , in spite of the imperfections which it no doubt possesses , but which , from the nature of the case , one would have expected to find in greater number rather than in less . These imperfections are such as may be easily corrected when pointed out , as they are the results of haste and consequent oversight , and are not of a nature to affect essentially the substantial merits of the work . A fair and manly discus .. sion of its faults is desirable . For when once pointed out and clearly designated , they may be amended . For this object the convention has made ample provision , and has designated the authority by which any requisite alterations may he made . In fact a long list of Corrigenda has been already published . In this way , we have every reason to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still retains , and rendered an honor as well as a convenience to the American faculty . Not that it can be expected that universal satisfaction is ever to be given , or that the work can be made , we will not say so perfect , but so accommodating , as that all parties shall be contented with it . It would indeed be a curiosity , if captious and capricious criticism could not find a flaw in it . But even in its present state , notwithstanding the objections with which it has been met in some quarters , we conceive that it is calculated to answer a very important purpose . The great objects of a national pharmacopoeia are to establish a uniformity in the names and preparations of medicines throughout the United States ; that the physician , wherever he may be , shall be sure of having , for the same name , the same article , or the same preparation , made of the same materials , and of the same strength ; that , in the perusal of mcdical // works , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents and what preparations are intended by the terms employed . It is notorious that , heretofore , this has not been the case ; that , even in the same city , you may find in the shops of different druggists articles put up or prepared according to different pharmacopoeias ; whilst in one state the Edinburgh may be in vogue , and in another the London . This is a great evil ; and if the national work is sufficiently well done to do it away , we can afford to overlook those faults in its construction which do not affect its usefulness in this respect . We do not hesitate to say , that this is decidedly the case , that the work , with such corrections as have been made in it , is fully adequate to this object , and we trust that it will gradually succeed in effecting it . We are disposed to go furthcr than this ; we think that the American pharmacopceia has many excellencies , particularly in its general plan , which will render it , when it has gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it is easy to point out inaccuracies and oversights in the detail , for these are inseparable from a work made up by a number of hands , and in great haste ; but it is not easy to point out any very considerable defects in its general con* struction . A pharmacopoeia must always be , to a greater or less degree , an imperfect work , from the doubtful and unsettled nature of the subject itself . It may be said to stand upon ground which is perpetually shifting and giving way . New observations and discoveries make , daily , some changes in the number and relative importance of the articles of the materia medica , and this , of course , makes some corresponding change necessary in the pharmacopoeia . The American work will bear a pretty good comparison with others of the same kind . It has not been more hardly dealt with by its enemies , than those of London and Paris , both published under the auspices of the principal medical authorities of their respective cities . The latter of these has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that produced it . ' It was not to have been expected , that a convention of physicians , called together from the most remote parts of the country , with great inconvenience and sacrifice to themselves , should have been able in the haste with which they must have // transacted their business , unacquainted with the views , feelings , and opinions of each other , to prepare a work which should stand the test of criticism , or should be more than tolerably perfect . A convention was not proposed , because it was thought that a convention would prepare a better pharmacopmia than could be prepared in any other way . On the other hand , it is plain enough , that there is rio other way in which such a work would not be likely to be better done . Many physicians , individually inferior to any member of the conven* tion , would probably make a better system , than they could do in their collective capacity . But a convention was proposed , because it could do what no other body could do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be universally adopted , and establish uniformity , to which all other recommendations are secondary . It is far better to have one system , indifferent in itself , but universally adopted , than a number of them , each exceedingly perfect , and complete in itself , but of narrow and limited authority . As it is , we look upon the formation of the pharmacopoeia of the United States , as an event upon which the medical profession and the public ought to be congratulated . It can hardly be doubted that , emanating , as it does , from the highest possible authority , it will , sooner or later , receive the support of physicians at large , and be acknowledged as the basis of pharmaceutical language and preparation throughout the country . We are glad to be able to add , that several of the most respectable medical bodies in the country have , by an express vote , adopted the pharmacopceia of the United States , as their standard . This has been the case with the state medical societies of New York , Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pharmacopmia , prepared many years since , and generally in use , to adopt that of the United States .
