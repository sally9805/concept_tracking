Jllso some valuable medical Receipts for the Rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spitting of blood , Dropsy , Consumption , Scurvy , Itch and Piles , and every stage of the Flux cured . To which are added many curious secrets in Nature and Art . By Dr. James Johnston . The above have been proved for more than twenty years , never to fail . In comformity to the act of the congress of the United States , intituled , ' l An act for the encouragement of learning , by securing the copies of maps , charts , and books , to the authors and proprietors of such copies , during the times therein mentioned " And also to the act , entitled , " An act supplementary to an act , entitled , " An act for the encouragement of learning , by securing the copies of maps , charts and books , to the authors and proprietors of such copies during the times therein mentioned/ ' and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing , engraving , and etching historical and other prints . " /z/ Ckrk of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania . /z/ Bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at London , but are got into some countries ; and whereas people think they are bred of hogs , hair , wood , wool , cloth , and fur , these things breed only lice , moths , and worms ; but bugs proceed from old feather beds ; whereon has long laid sick and sweaty people , which produces putrified smells and vapours ; so does close press beds that have not the advantage of the pure air ; as also close rooms , where the air wants free egress and regress , from these causes bugs proceed : and also consumptions , weakness of the back , and such like diseases that people little think of . And if you observe , you shall never find these creatures in shops , or where no beds are , or have been put . One way therefore to prevent them , is to wash your rooms , and keep them very clean , and keep your windows open in the day time , that the air may come in , and in a morning lay open your bed clothes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the moisture contracted in the night time ; this is a great preservative against all vermin , as also of your health . How to destroy House Bugs . Take gunpowder beat small , and lay some about the crevices of your bedstead , and fire it with a match about your bedsteads , and keep the smoke in ; this do for an hour or more , and let the room be kept close for some hours after . Or take sprigs of fern , and lay upon the boards , kills them . Bugs . Take JbangTuj o ' wormwood and white /z/ helebore ; boil them in urine till it is half wasted , and wash the joints of your bedsteads with it . Bugs . Take a quantity of unslack 'd lime , put it into a quart of water , and let itsland 3 or 4 days , then pour off the water , arid add a quantity of common salt , the stronger both of lime and salt the better ; wash the sides of the wall and bedstead with this liquor two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bugs . Burn brimstone under the joints of the bedstead and creases where they lie , and they 'll come out presently , that you may kill them ; do this two or three times a week , and keep your room close . Bugs . Take soap that lies after your washing , and boil onions in it ; then wash your room and bedstead with it . Bugs . Take strong vinegar , and mix salt with it ; then sprinkle your room . This prevents bugs and fleas , and is very wholesome in houses , or at sea ; so is rue , wormwood and rosemary wholesome to smell to , or vinegar sprinkled alone . Bugs . Take three ounces of guinea pepper : burn it on a chafindish of coals in your chamber ; shut your doors and windows , but take great care to go out yourself . This do twice a-month in hot , weather , and it will kill all sorts of vermin in the bed . Bugs .

Take the rind of green walnuts , bruised and steeped in water three or four days ; then /z/ wash the room and bedstead with it twice a week . Bugs . Hang a bear 's skin in your room , and they will be gone . Or get a trap about a yard and a half long , or more , if your bed is broad , and about half a yard in depth ; put it at the head of your bed to the bottom of the pillow , and in the morning they will creep into it ; take it into your yard , knock it , and they will drop out , so you may kill them . They are made of wickers , by basket makers . Bugs Take wormwood dried , and put it in bags pricked full of holes , and lay between your bed and sacking mats or boards , and some under the bolster , and under your bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this prevents the breeding of either bugs or fleas . To conclude , let your rooms be kept clean , set open the windows when you rise , and lay your bed clothes open four or five hours , and it is the only way to prevent both bugs and fleas . Lice . Lice . Take butter unsalted , and boil it up with pepper to a salve ; then cut off the hair , and anoint the head , and put on a cap . Lce . Take staves-acre powdered , and mix it among the hair , then tie it with a cap , and it kills them . Or oil and staves acre . Lice . Take aramanths ( apothecaries sell it ) , boil it in lye , and wash the head : or take olibami'ii and as much swine 's grease , boil them together , and anoint children 's heads , it kills lice . JVife and Lice in the liead . Take of bees wax an ounce , three ounces of ' olive oil , three drams of staves acre ; of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nits and hce. /z/ Lice . Take red crpiment and saltpetre , each a dram , louse herb two drams , mix them together with oil and vinegar , so anoint the head . Byrus . To kill Lice on Trees . Through drought many trees and bushes become lousy , as sweetbriar , gooseberries , &c.; therefore frequently wash them , or dashing them with water may prove the best remedy . For Crab Lice . Wash with the decoction of penny royal ; Or , boil majoram in water , and wash with it ; or the juice of stinking gladon . For lice in the Eyelids . Rub your eyelids with salt water , or brimstone and water , or with vinegar of squils , alum and aloes . Fleas . Take lavender and wormwood , and boil them in vinegar well , and sprinkle your blankets with it ; or savory laid in your chambers kills them . Fleas . Take unslacked lime and strew in your chambers : penny royal wrapt up in a cloth and laid in your bed , drives fleas away ; lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water , and the room sprinkled with it . Arsmart ( the hot sort ) strewed in a chamber kills all the fleas . Fleas . Soap lees and onions boiled together and sprinkled in the room , kills both them and bugs . Fleas . Marsh fleabane spread in your room , or burnt , drives away fleas and gnats . Culpepper says , that f Ider leaves gathered with dew on them , and laid in a chamber , gathers all the floas thereto , which you may kill or throw out oi the window . , /z/ Fleas . Rub a small piece of board over with hogs grease , and all the fleas will gather to it in the middle of the room . To kill Fleas and Wall Lice . Take the decoction of thistle and arsmart or coloquintida , bramble , or colewort leaves , and sprinkle about the house , drives them away , or anoint a stick with the grease of a hedge-hog , and lay it in the room , and the fleas will gather and stick to it . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh butter , or make it into a paste with barley or wheat meal and honey , and lay on trenchards or boards where they come : they will eat it , and it makes them drink till they burst . It is a strong poison , therefore be very careful in using it , and wash your hands after it . Or unslacked lime and oatmeal mixed , and laid on boards where they come , kills them . Rats or Mice . Take oatmeal and powder 'd glass only , or mix them with fresh butter , and lay where they come . Or filings of iron mixed with oatmeal , or with dough or oatmeal flpur , and lay where they do come . Rats and Mice . Black hellebore and the seed of wild cucumber mixed with such food as they eat , kills them Or mix powdered hellebqre with wheat or barleymeal only , made into a stiff paste with honey , and laid where they come , they eat it , it is present death ; but great care must be taken , lest any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mice . Take honey or mead , and make a stiff paste with wheat or barley - meal ; then mix the filings of iron or steel with it , and throw it where they come , they will eat it , and it kills them . Rats and Mice . Chips of cork fried in suet , and laid where they come , kills them . Field Rats and Mice . In the dog days the fields are generally bare : then find out their holes or nests , which are little and round , like an auger-hole , and put hemlock seed thereinto , or hellebore mixed with barleyj they eat it greedily , so it kills them . Bats or Rear Alice to drive away . The smoke of ivy burned does it . /z/ Take a head or two of garlick , onion , or leek , and put it into their holes , and they will run out as if amazed , and so you may with a spear of dog take them . Moles . Beat hellebore , white or black , and with wheat flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine or metheglin , make it into paste , and put small pellets as big as a small nut into their holes , and they eat it with pleasure , and it kills them . Moles : Take the bark of dogs cole , powder it , and mix it with wheat flour , or barley meal , or rye flour , and with milk and wine make a paste , put some of these pellets into their holes , and they will eat it , and it kills them . Moles . Take marking stone and wild cucumber juice , and pour it into their holes . Some set traps at the mouth of their holes . /z/ To drive Moles away . In places you would not dig nor break much , the fuming their holes with brimstone , garlick , or other unsavoury things , drives them away , and if you put a dead mole into a common haunt , it will make them absolutely forsake it . Moles to take when you plow . Take with you a large vessel full of water , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened with the plough , pour therein pitchers or large cans of water , and that will make them in a little time come out , and thus you may destroy them in plowed land or pasture ; in common land make trenches in spring time to catch them . Moles . Some say that in gendering time , if you lead or draw a bitch mole in a string along the ground , the buck will trace her , and so you may catch them in a pot set in the ground . Moles . The best instrument to destroy them is made thus : take a small board of about three inches and a half broad , and five inches long ; on the one side thereof raise two small round hoops or arches , and at each end , like unto the two ends of a carrier 's wagon , or a tilt boat , large enough that a mole may pass through them : in the middle of the board make a hole so big that a goose quill may pass through , then is that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two inches and a half long , about the bigness that the end thereof may just enter the hole in the middle of the board ; also you must cut a hazle or other stick , about a yard , or a yard and half long , that being stuck into the ground may spring up like unto the spring they usually set for fowls ; then make a link of horse hair very strong that /z/ will easily slip , and fasten it to the end of the stick that springs ; also have in readiness- four small hooked sticks ; then go to the furrow or passage of the mole , and after you have opened it , fit in the little board with the bended hoops downwards , that the mole when she passes that way , may go directly through the two semicircular hoops . Before you fix the board down , put the hair spring through the hole in the middle of the board , and place it round , that it may answer to the two end hoops , and with the small sticks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot of the hair spring : place it in earth in the passage , and by thrusting in the four hooked sticks , fasten it , and cover it with earth , and then when the mole passes either the one way or the other , by displacing or removing the small stick that hangs perpendicularly downwards , the knot passes through the hole , and the spring takes the mole about the neck . Though the description seem tedious , yet this is very plain , and easily performed ; these vermin being so very prejudicial , even worse to ground than swine . Weasels . Take sal armoniac , and beat it , and with wheat flour and honey make it into a paste , with the white of an egg , and lay it in pellets where they come , and they eat it , and it kills them ! Weasels to f tight away Mice . Put bells about his neck , and let him run about your house , and he 'll frighten away all the mice . ' T is their nature to destroy mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . That Weasels may not suck the eggs . Lay rue about the hens that lay , and they will not come near them . /z/ Weasels . The smell of a burnt cat frights them away , as all insects will be frightened away with their own kinds being burnt . Caterpillars . Caterpillars destroy the leaves of trees , and devour cabbages and other tillage , and are generally the effects of great droughts . To prevent their numerous increase on trees , gather them off in winter , taking the prickets away that cleave to the branches , and burn them . Or , anoint the tree bottom round about with tar , then get many pismires and put them in a bag , hang them so that they may touch the body of the tree ; the pismires can not get down for the tar , so for want of food will devour the caterpillars . Caterpillars . When they are upon coleworts or cabbages , take some salt water and water them with it , and it will kill them . Caterpillars . Our gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whilst they are touched with the cold of the night , they easily drop down . Caterpillars of many swts , the Wolf , the Black Fly , the Calendar Worm , &c.; The most hurtful is the wolf and calendar worm , that lurk in the heart of flower buds , shutting them up that they can not open , which they sconsume ; the trees that blow early , look as if signed by lightening ; those that blow late are not so subject to this evil . Caterpillars . Take three ounces of wormood , one ounce of assa foctida , steep and break them , /z/ and boil with four pails of water in the air , because they are stinking smells , and when bojled , strain out the ingredients through a linen cloth , and use it when cold at pleasure , befqre the bud be opened , and they will do no harm to the tree ; you may also add other ingredfbnts , as tobacco stalks , wild vines , colloquintida , or the like. , and expect very good issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To kill green bugs in gardens , sprinkle the places where they fix with strong vinegar , mixed with the juice of henbane ; or some water the plants haunted by them with the cold decoction of mustard and laurel seed in water ; some quash them with their fingers , which is a good way ; or fleabane boiled in water and sprinkled , kills them . Vine Fretters in Gardens , &c.; Stick a rod half a foot high in the ground , with mugs or cups turned over the top of it , and you will find that they will creep under there for shelter , so you may easily kill them . An universal remedy against all animals offensive to flowers . Democritus says , put 8 or 9 crabs in an earthen pot with water , and let them stand 8 days in the open air , then take of this water , and water your plants in their infancy ; repeat the same once in eight days , and you will find it effectual against all sorts of vermin . To gather Frogs and kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bruise it by the water side , and the frogs will gather to it . /z/ To prevent Frogs croaking . Set a lanthorn and candle upon the side of the water or river that waters your garden , it is done . Toads will not come near sage if rue is planted about it . Snakes and Adders , to drive from the garden . Wormwood planted in divers places , they will not come near it . Snakes and Adders . Smoke the places with hartshorn , or lily roots , burning in a fire pan , and they will fly from the place . Snakes and Adders . The roots of centaury laid about your ground , will make them depart ; or , lay deer suet about the place , and they will be gone . For the Bite or Sting of a Snake or Adder . Take the juice of ash tree leaves squeezed into good white wine or beer , and drink it , and wash with it , then cover the place stung with ash tree leaves , and it cures you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c.; In April or May , lay fresh dung in places where they come , and they will resort to it . In July or August turn up the dunghill , and you will both find their eggs and many of them , which destroy ; do this two or three times in a summer . Pismires , Flies , Earwigs , and Spiders , that hurt Orange Trees , Carnations , &Pc.; These are very troublesome vermin in a garden , especially where carnations are preserved ; for they are so fond of these flowers , that if care is not taken to prevent them , they will entirely destroy them , by eating off the sweet part at the bottom of the leaves . /z/ To prevent which , most people have stands erected , which have a basin of earth or lead round each supporter , which is constantly kept filled with water . Others hang the hollow claws of crabs , lobsters , &c.; upon sticks in divers parts of the garden , into which these vermin get ; and by often searching them you will destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service to your wall fruit ; for these are great destroyers thereof . Miller 's gardeners dictionary . Pismires , Earwigs , and other Vermin that hurt Gardens . In gardens are July-flowers , which are subject to harm , both by rain and the sun , and much watering , and from earwigs and pismires . The rain spots them ; the sun withers them by drying the ground too much : strong water spoils them , especially at the last of * their blowing : pismires gnaw the flowers , and make holes in the leaves , earwigs devour the flowers , at least the leaves , that they fall out of the shell ; to preserve them , let the sun be upon them but one hour in the day , and they will last long . Pismires , and other Vermin about Orange trees , and July flowers . Put here and there a glass , , with water and honey in it , wherein they will drown themselves ; six or seven will go a great way . When July-flowers are in flower , give moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant does not want watering , since the shorts only want to grow , but when the first flower is gone , you may give them more water again , and place them in the sun , in their old place , that the seeds may grow ripe . /z/ Pismires . The smoke of the root of wild ciu cumber drives them away . Pismires . Muscle shells burnt with storax , and beat to powder , strew the garden where they are , and they will come out of their holes then kill them . Pismires . Encompass the stem five fingers in breadth , with a roll of wool newly plucked from a sheep 's belly . Pismires . Hang a glass bottle if the tree , with a little honey in it , or other sweet liquor , and it will draw the ants into it , which stop and wash , and place it there again ; also often watering the walks or paths kills them . Pismires . In winter dig the hills , and take out the core , that it may be lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay your turf down , it may lie lower than the other ground ; it prevents ants returning , and the rain and frost coming , kills the rest . Plants to preserve from Pismires . Take the dregs of oil , and mix it with lupins , and anoint the bottom of the plants therewith . To keep your Sugar box or Spice from Pismires . Cover your box with white wool . Pismires to drive au ay . Take brimstone and powder it , and let it stand till it hath coloured the water , then sprinkle the water on the banks . Earth and Field Mice , Snculs , and other Vermin that hurt Tulips . To preserve tulips from vermin , cover them with wooden frames 4 inches high , and do them over so close with iron wires , that none of these vermin can get through to hurt them . /z/ Snails . Set tiles , bricks , or boards hollow against the wall , pales , &c.; and they will creep under them for shelter , about Michaelmas they get to such places for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying them in December , which is the easiest , best , and surest way to destroy them . Snails ; the gardener 's way . Besides what is wrote above , they seek them by break of day , or after rain , when they come out of the earth to feed , and are easily killed . You ought to keep out of gardens dogs and cats . To Ml Flies . Take white hellebore , and steep it in milk or sweet wine , and sprinkle the room they come to , and they will die . Flies . Take origanum and alum , and beat them , and mix them with milk , and sprinkle them about the room , kills them . To gather Flies together . Beat coriander seed , and put it in a deep earthern pot , and all the flies will gather to it . Flies . Treacle and water put into an earthern dish pretty thick with treacle or honey , they will light in it and stick . Or . dregs of sugar and water mixed , they will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble Cattle . Boil bay berries in oil , and anoint them with it , and they will never sit on cattle ; or , wet the hair of horses with the juice of the leaves of gourds at Midsummer , and they will not molest them . If cattle are anointed with the juice of arsmart , flies will not come near them , though it is the heat of summer . /z/ Flies , Spiders , Scorpions , &c.; to drive out . Burn a hoop 's feathers in the room , and make a smoke , then these insects that smell the smell will be gone , and come no more . To drive away flies , and all otlier sorts of Insects . All insects are driven away generally by means either of hindering the breeding of them , and so they destroy locusts eggs : or , we hinder their coming by shutting all windows close ; some things drive them away and kill them : namely , fire and cold : also any sharp , sour , or extreme bitter , as / vinegar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colloquintida or lupins will do it ; some things do it by the scent , as brimstone , vitriol flowers , and the leaves of elder , both corianders , horns and hoofs ; some things offend them many wa ) s , as rue and verdigrease . The ancients used two things against them ; pitch and lees of oil ; pitch defends from the air , and oil from living creatures ; storax , I observe by its scent or smoke , will drive away almost all insects . To prevent Moths eating clothes . Take beaten pepper , lay it among your clothes , airing them well first , and it will prevent them . Moths . Take the branches of bay tree and lay among cloth or woollen , it preserves from moths , worms , or corruption ; so does moist hemp . Pieces of Russia leather put in boxes , prevents moths and all other vermin . MotJis to destroy . About August they appear , and that mostly in the night , and if you set a candle in an apjsle tree lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ burn themselves , and you will find abundance of them dead in the morning . Earwigs , Wasps , Gnats , Hornets , and Flies Earwigs are very numerous , and injurious to fruit , and the way to destroy them is , by placing hoofs , horns , crabs or lobsters claws on branches of trees into which they will resort ; early in the morning take them gently off and shake them into a tub of water , or on the ground , and tread on them . Or , cut a melon or apple , lay it to the ear , cut a hole in it , and lay on that side , and it will come into the apple . Wasps and Hornets . Wasps and hornets are destructive , to bees arid fruits , &c.; In spring or summer , before they are increased , destroy the old ones , for a few increases to a multitude . Wasps , Gnats , and Earwigs . Scald them , if in the thatch of a hollow tree , and smoke them with any stinking combustible matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rags into the wasps holes , where the nest lies , and presently fling a spade full of earth over the holes . Wasps stinging . Apply a copper halfpenny , and hold it for a little space , and it will ease the pain and prevent swelling . Gnats and Flies . Shut your windows close in summer towards the evening , and smoke your rooms with brimstone , and burn straw in them , or they will fly into the flame , or be choaked . Or the smoke of burnt fern drives away gnats , serpents , and other venomous creatures . Or loose strife does the same . /z/ Gnats and Flies . Ash leaves bung up in a room , attracts them , that they are less troublesome ; also balls made of new horse dung and laid in a room will do the same ; by this means you may overwhelm them with a basin , and keep them there . Worms . Water wherein the leaves and seed of hemp is sodden , sprinkled on the earth , brings them out . Worms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or salt and water made into brine , and sprinkled on the ground . Some say , soot strewed on the ground kills them . Others commend chalk and lime strewed on the ground . Take a quantity of green walnut husks , and rub them on a brick or tile , holding them at the bottom of a pail of water till the water is become bitter , which sprinkle on the ground brings the worms out in a quarter of an hour . Worms in gardens , s ? c . Water your bed with the brine of salt meat , and it kills them : or water your garden with a strong lixivium made of ashes ; or lay ashes or lime about any plant , and neither snails nor worms will come near it : as the moisture weakens , you may renew it . Some smoke their holes u ith ox or row dung : or the mother of oiLsprinkled on their holes , kills them . Worms . St-ethe the leaves and seeds of hemp in water , and sprinkle it on the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two prongs is best , and stick it in the ground , and shake it well , brings out worms : morning and evening is the best time . Worms in Jlpple - trees . Lay a sea onion about the trees , to preserve /z/ them from worms : if they come naturally , bull 's gall , or hog 's dung ' mingled with man 's urine , and poured to the roots , destroys them : but if they are hard to destroy , the bark must be digged into with a brass pin , or such like tool , and tended till the point takes upon the worms , and drive them front the place : but where there is a place ulcerated , stop it with ox-dung . An apple tree plant , the root being anointed with bull 's gall , they and their fruit will be free froui worms Mrzaldus , Worms to prevent eating chests of drawers , or Wood . Rub them with linseed-oil , or , rub them with wormwood , rue , or other bitter herbs , preserves them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of linseed-oil and polished , will look pleasant . Polecats . If you can conveniently have a channel about fyour pigeon house , and that will preserve them and all other fowl , for no beast of prey will take the water . Polecats . Some make a dead fall to take them , which is made of a square piece of wood , weighing 40 or #0 lb. : they bore a hole in the middle of the upper side , and set a crooked hook fast in it , also they set four forked stakes fast in the ground , and there lay two slicks across , on which sticks lay a long staff to hold the dead fall up to the crook , and under this crook they put a short stick , fasten a line to it , and this line must reach down to the bridge below ; and this bridge you must make about 5 or 6 inches broad . Then set on both sides of this fall , boards or pales , or hedge it with close rods , and make it ten or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the fall is broad . /z/ Badgers . Badgers are pernicious creatures , and destroy young lambs , pigs and poultry . Some take them in a steel trap , or a spring , as foxes are taken . Some make a pitfall about five foot deep , and four long , make it narrow at the top and bottom , and wider in the middle ; then cover it with some small sticks and leaves so that he may fall in when he comes on it ; sometimes a fox is taken thus . Others hunt the badger to his hole in a moonlight night , and dig him out . Hedgehogs always make their cave or cabin contrary to the wind . Foxes . Foxes are great destroyers of lambs , poultry , geese , &c.; to destroy which , take a sheeps paunch , and tie it to a long stick , then rub your shoes well upon it , thai he may not scent your sweaty feet ; draw this paunch after you as a trail , a mile or more , and bring it near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the tree with a gun , and as it begins to be dark , you will see him come after the scent of the trail , where you may shoot him : draw the trail if you can to windward of the tree . To take a Fox in a steel-trap . The best way is to set your trap in the plain part of a large field , out of the way of all paths , yet not near a hedge , or any shelter : then open th j trap , set it on the ground , and cut out just thr form thereof in a turf , and take out so much eailh , as to make room to stay it , then cover it apain very neatly with the turf you cut out : and as to_the ' = joint of the turf will not dose exactly , get &ome; mould oi a new cast up mole hill , and put it close round the turf , sticking some grass in it as if it there grew : make it curious and neat , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the trap , three several ways , scatter some of the mole-hill mould very thin on a place 15 or 16 inches square , then on these places , arid where the trap is placed , lay three or four small bits of cheese , and then with a sheeps 's paunch draw a trail a mile or two long to each of these three places , and from thence to the trap , that the fox may come to one of these places first , for then he will approach the trap more boldly : and thus you will never fail of him : be sure let your trap be left loose , that he may draw it to some hedge or covert , or he will bite off his leg and be gone . A spring trap for a Fox or Badger . Bend down a stick in the wood , or set a pole in the ground where he uses to come , much like that set up for a woodcock , which hangs them up . To explain it better : tie a string to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string make fast a small short stick made thin on the upper side , with a notch at the lower end of it : then set another stick fast in the ground , with a nich under it : then bend down the pole , and let both the nicks or notches join as slight as may be : then open the noose of the string , and place it in his path or walk , and if you lay pieces of cheese , flesh , or such like , it will entice him that way . Fox . Anoint the soles of your shoes with swine 's fat a little broiled , and coming trom the wood , drop here and there a piece of roasted swine 's liver dipped in honey , dra ving after you a dead cat , and he will follow you so that you may shoot him . /z/ Jl hook to take a Fox , tied to a tree or Gibbet . This hook is made of large wire , and turns on a swivel like the collar of a greyhound ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox . They hang it from the ground so high that he must leap to catch it ; and bait it with flesh , liver , cheese , &c.; and if you run a trail with a sheep 's paunch , as before directed , it will draw him the more easily to the bait To take an Otter . Otters are great destroyers of fish , and will travel in a night ten or twelve miles ; they lie under the roots of trees near the water ; some take them with snares , others with spears , and some with hunting dogs . To kill them , lay near their haunts an eel slit on the back , with some few corns of ratsbane put in the slit , then sew it up again ; place the eel from the navel upwards out of the water , and he will eat it so far , but seldom farther , and it certainly kills him .

Take what quantity you think fit , put it in an earthen pipkin , add a third part of capons or goose grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is better , incorporate them on a gentle fire , and stir it continually till it is cold , and thus it is finished . To prevent frost : take a quarter of as much oil of Pretoleum as you do goose grease , and no cold will congeal it . How to use Bird-Lime . When your lime is cold , take your rods and warm them a little over the fire ; then take your lime and wind about the top of your rods , then draw your rods asunder one from another , and close them again , continually plying and working them together , till by smearing one upon another , you have equally bestowed on each rod a sufficient proportion of lime . If you lime any strings , do it when the lime is hot and at the thinnest , besmearing the strings on all sides by folding them together , and unfolding them again . If you lime straws , it must be done likewise when the lime is very hot , doing a great quantity together , as many as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them before the fire till they are all besmeared , every straw having its due proportion of lime ; having so done , put them up in cases of leather till you have occasion to use them . /z/ The best way of making Water Bird-lime . Buy what quantity you think fit of the strongest birdlime you can procure , and wash it as long in clear spring water till you find it very pliable , and the hardness thereof removed , then beat out the water extraordinary well , till you can not perceive a drop to appear , then dry it well : after this , put it into an earthen pot , and mingle therewith capon 's grease unsalted , so much as will make it run , then add thereto two spoonfuls of strong vinegar , a spoonful of the best sallad oil , and a small quantity of Venice turpentine ; this is the allowance of these ingredients , which must be added to every pound of strong bird-lime as aforesaid . Having thus mingled them , boil all gently over a small fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let it cool ; when at any time you have occasion to use it , warm it , and then anoint your twigs or straws , or any other small things , and no water will take away the strength thereof . Of taking small Birds , which use Hedges and Bushes with Lime-twigs . The great lime bush is best for this use , which you must take after this manner ; cut down the main branch or bough of any bushy tree , whose branch aud twigs are long , thick , smooth , and straight , without either pricks or knots , of which the willow or birch tree are the best ; when you have picked it and trimmed it from all superfluity , making the twigs neat and clean , then take the best birdlime , well mixed and wrought together with goose grease , or capons grease , which being warmed , lime every twig therewith within four fingers of the bottom . /z/ The body from whence these branches have their rise must be untouched with lime . Be sure you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give distaste to the birds , yet let none want its proportion , or have any part left bare which ought to be touched ; for as too much will deter them from coming , so too little will not hold them when they are there . Having so done , place your bush in some quickset or dead hedge near unto towns ends , backyards , old houses , or the like ; for these are the resort of small birds in the spring time : in the summer and harvest in groves , bushes , or white thorn trees , quickset hedges near cornfields , fruit trees , flax , and hemp lands : and in the winter about houses , hovels , barns , stacks , or other places where stand ricks of corn , or scattered chaff , &c.; As near as you can to any of these haunts , plant your lime bush , and plant yourself also at a convenient distance undiscovered , imitating with your mouth several notes of birds , which you must learn by frequent practice , walking the fields for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds sounds , especially such as they call one another by . Some have been so expert herein , that they could imitate the notes of twenty several sorts of birds at least , by which they have caught ten birds to another 's one that was ignorant therein . If you can not attain it by your industry , you must buy then a bird call , of which there are several sorts , and easy to be framed ; some of Wood , some of horn , some of cane , and the like . Having learnt first how to use this call , you c2 /z/ shall sit and call the birds unto you , and as many ot them light on your bush , step not out unto them tillyou see them sufficiently entangled ; neither is it requisite to run for every single bird , but let them alone till more come , for the fluttering is as good as a stale to entice them more . You may take these small birds only with lime twigs without the bush . Some boys have taken two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about three inches long , and have gone with them into a field where there were hemp cocks ; upon the top of half a score lying all round together , they have stuck their twigs , and then have gone and beat that field or the next to it , where they saw any birds , and commonly in such fields there are infinite numbers of linnets and green birds , which are great lovers of hemp seed . And they flying in such vast flocks , they have caught at one fall for them upon the cocks eight dozen at a time . But to return , there is a pretty way of taking birds with lime-twigs , by placing them near a stale or two made of living bats , placing them aloft that they may be visible to the birds thereabouts who will no sooner be perceived , but every bird will come and gaze , wondering at the strangeness of the sight , and having no other convenient lighting place but where the lime twigs are you may take what number you list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the bat , being bigger and more easily to be perceived , besides he is never seen abroad but he is followed and persecuted by all the birds that are near . If you have not a living bat or owl , their skins /z/ will serve as well , stuffed , and will last you twenty years ; there are some who have used an owl cut in wood , and naturally painted , with wonderful success . Jl Secret to hinder Pigeons from quitting a Pigeon House . Take the head and feet of a gelt goat , and boil them together till the flesh separates from the bone ; take this flesh and boil it again in the same liquor , till the whole is consumed ; bruise into this decoction , which is very thick , some potters earth , out of which you are to take all the stones , vetch , dung , hemp , food , and corn ; the whole must be kneaded together , and reduced to a paste or dough , which form into small loaves about the thickness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven , and take care it do not burn ; when they are baked , lay them in several parts of the pigeonhouse , and as soon as they set there the pigeons will amuse themselves with pecking them , and finding some taste therein , which pleases them they will keep so close to it , that they will not afterwards leave it but with regret . Others take a handful of salt which they candy , and afterwards put into the pigeon-house . Birds . Get white orpiment , barley , wheat , or any other grain that birds love , boil them together , and throw where birds come , and you may catch them presently , yet not the worse to eat . Birds , to keep from Fruit . Hang a bundle of garlick on a branch of a tree , or lay it on your corn stalks , and they will not touch your fruit . Some smear their tree branches with juice of garlick . To catch Birds . Get such seed as fowls love , mix it with grated /z/ onion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geese , to take . Take a tame duck or goose , with a string by the leg , where wild geese or ducks come , and strew in that place such seed or grain soaked in lees of wine ; where also white hellebore is boiled , you may take forty at a time ; it will quickly make them drunk : let not the tied goose or duck come to the seed . To catch Birds . Take any corn and steep- it in wine lees and juice of hemlock , and cast it to the birds , and it makes them drunk presently . How to teach Birds to speak , or whistle tunes . Keep them in dark places , and play any tune to them for half a year , or till the time that young birds taken out of the nest begin to sing , and they will learn , if cocks , any tune you please , and exceed a flageolet , especially a linnet , bullfinch , robin , or goldfinch , &c.; And to teach jays , magpirs , starlings , parrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk often the same thing to them ; by candle-light , or in the night-time . To scare Crows , Ravens , Jackdaws , Pigeons , &c.; Crows dead and hung up , much affrights them ; but among cherry trees , and other fruit trees , draw a line from tree to tree , and here and there fasten a bLck feather , and this will do Bat Fowling , the manner of it . Observe where birds roost in great numbers , as they generally do in hedges , or trees , then go in a dark night , one with a pole , and beat the contrary side , and two or three be with you , carrying long boughs : and you may easily strike them down ; if among shrubs as in a wood , let one on each side /z/ beat at a pretty distance . Some use nets , made like a racket at the end of poles , with which they are easily knocked down . To take Sea-pyes , Crows and other Birds . Get a minnow , tie a thread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the thread , then lime your twigs with bird lime , and lay them by the river on some rush , water leaf grass , or the like : then when she sees it , she catches it up , and the lime twigs take her wings , and she drops presently . Partridge , to take . Get sweet wine , and with wheat flour , make a paste , lay it in pellets where they come , and they will be soon foxed , so you may take them with your hand . But if you put a little coculus indicus to it powdered , it is the better . To take Wild Ducks , Geese , Herons , Sea Chills , , &c; Drive a stake into the ground two or three foot long , just by the water-side , then take a strong horse-hair with a large hook fastened to it , and bait it with fish , or frog , or guts , &c.; and let your line or lines lie in the river and they will swallow it , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same manner snares made of horse-hair , and often catch them by the feet as they swim about . Birds that are Lousy . Anoint them with linseed-oil cures them . Of ordering and improving Stocks of Bees . The bee though a small creature , and by many numbered amongst insects , is extremely advantageous to his nourisher , in returning abundance for the little he receives , and not so only , but affords demonstrative rules to men , both of policy /z/ and frugality ; insomuch that the ancients nourished and preserved them as much for pleasure as profit ; calling them the birds of the muses ; and Virgil , with wonderful eloquence , describes their order , government , manner of waring , building , obedience to their king , &,c.; But not to enlarge thereon , I shall proceed to the improving part , viz. To store yourself , there are three manner of ways ; either by buying them , taking wild swarms , or making them by art . If you buy your bees , observe they be lively , little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones : and above all , let the King , or master-bee , be long , shining , and cheerful , not too great , or too small for upon his success , depend the welfare of the whole swarm . Observe , likewise , that the swarm be whole and great , which you may know by looking into the hive , or observing great numbers clustering about the door ; if these two observations fail , finding them all at rest , blow in among them , and by the greatness or smallness of the answering sound , you will perceive them to be more or less . If you transport them far , the change of the air many times incommodes them ; to remedy which you must set them in pleasant gardens , or scatter sweet smelling herbs about their hives . The best way to carry them is upon a man 's shoulder in sheets upon a pole ; one hive behind , and the other before , in the night time when they are at rest , being very cautious of jogging them , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove them is in the month of April ; being sure you carry them not from a pleasant place to one that is otherwise , for if you do , they will soon leave you . Wiien you have brought them to the place you intended . /z/ if it be day-time , you must neither open nor place them till night , to the end that after the quiet rest of the night , they may go cheerfully to work the next morning ; and be sure you observe them narrowly for two or three days after , whether they go out cr not , for if they do , ' t is a shrewd sign they intend to leave you . To store yourself with wild bees , take these following directions : that is , such as breed in clefts of oaks , or other trees , in fields , forests , or wildernesses , or in rocks , or ruins of castles , or churches . To find them out , set a little box , with a small hole in it , near the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when many have entered for the sugar or honey put therein , stop up the hole , and having let one out , follow him as far as you can see him , then let out another , following him likewise , and so a third , till by their flying directly to the place of their abode , you may find them out ; and to know whether they are far or nigh , set sugared water , and when they come to sip , sprinkle some red , green , or other colour upon them , and by their often or seldom coming , you may guess the distance or nearness of their nests ; as also by the sudden resort of great numbers , so soon as one or two have found out the sweets , for they suddenly give notice to their fellows . Having found them , if in the body of a tre ? , and you can not come at them , smoak them out and settle them , by ringing of any brass vessel ; and having **26;87;TOOLONG , shakethcm into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a sheet , setting your hive afterwards near it , that the bees of their own accord , may go into it ; or if you can not smoak them out , saw the tree , or use other means as may oblige them to forsake their dwelling . /z/ In the placing of your bees , observe it be so that in the winter and spring , the faces of the hives may stand to the rising sun ; and so order it that neither in winter nor summer , they be too hot or too cold ; observing above all things , that the air be wholesome , as also the herbs , plants , and flowers growing about them . The herbs , &c.; that bees most delight , are these , thyme , cassia , rosemary , savory , smallage , violets , sage , lavender , myrrh , wild marjoram , wild thyme , balm , sweet marjoram , saffron , bean flowers , mustard seed , mellilot , poppies , roses and the like . And those they hate , are for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elms , cornel , spurge , laurel , and all bitter herbs and flowers . They thrive better in the vallies than on hills , and love to be near clear water springs . The best honey is extracted from thyme , the second from wild thyme , and the third from rosemary . You may place their hives in three ranks , arid stand a yard one above another ; suffer them to be quiet and undisturbed , keeping all hurtful creatures from them ; as the toad , redbreast , woodpeckers , moth , hornet , lizard , swallow , sparrow , spider , serpent , and stork ; all which are utter enemies to the bees . All winter they rest , and live upon part of what they got in the summer ; or if you have taken the honey almost bare , you must feed them by putting in sticks very gingerly , dipped in honey , or sugar and water boiled ; as also figs , raisins , currants , or the like . About the sun 's entering the sign Jlries , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the which when they have done , they begin to breed , and afterwards till them with honey ; their wax , being extracted from gummy trees and the honey /z/ honey from flowers . The honey harvests , as many term them , are in some countries , three times a year , viz. the latter end of May , the end of July , and beginning of September ; though to take the combs but twice a year , viz. May and August , is best . If the hive by reason of a young brood be overcharged , which you may perceive by the bees clustering- about the mouth of it , and the great noise within , having new hives in readiness , watch the coming forth of the young fry for several days , from eight till twelve in the morning , lest taking wing , they seek a new habitation ; or if they delay to come forth , you may drive out the whole stock with galbanum , at which time having two kings , they will settle in two companies , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decayed , you may put two hives together , by killing the king or master-bee of the one hive . If at any time two hives swarm together and fight , cast dust upon the hives , or sprinkle them with the juice of pleasant herbs , or honey and water boiled , and the fray will be parted . If the master-bee of any hive be too apt to lead the swarm abroad , and by that means endanger losing them , to prevent this roving , clip his wings , and then , not daring to trust them , he will stay at home . The signs to know when your combs are full of honey , are when the bees drive out the drones ; when there is an extraordinary noise and rejoicing within , and when they play about the mouth of the hive , neglecting to perform their tasks ; for in nowise take the honey before the combs are full , lest displeasing the bees they leave you . Many are of opinion , that the mouth of the hive /z/ being rubbed with calves-dung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it . And thus much shall suffice for the ordering and improving of bees , from whose labour rises great profit to most kingdoms . /z/ Rheumatism , Palsy , and Gout . The oil of mustard-seed used outwardly , is said to be very good in these disorders ; taken inwardly it has the same virtues as the seed itself . Some say a spoonful taken at a time is good to drive the gout out of the stomach . Pleurisy and Cholic . Linseed Oil fresh drawn , loosens the belly , appeases coughing , promotes expectoration , and is reckoned a specific in the pleurisy , if two , three , or four ounces are taken at a dose , and repeated at every fourth or sixth hour till the patient finds himself relieved . Given in the same manner it eases the cholic , and cures obstinate costiveness . To kill Worms . Oil of wormwood rubbed on the stomach and navel , discusses wind and kills worms : it is also a great strengthener of the stomach . Against Ulcers and the Itch . Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external and internal . The dose is twenty drops or more . Outwardly it is good against the itch , scabs , and other defedations of the skin , rendering it soft and smooth . To expel Wind . Elec uary of bay berries warms the stomach , expels wind , and is good for the flatulent cholic . The dose is from a scruple to a dram . Spitting of Blood . Take conserve of roses two ounces ; of Loca- /z/ telli 's balsam dissolved with the yolk of an egg , au ounce ; mix them . This is pectoral , and is good in catarrhs , coughs , spitting of blood , and consumptions . The dose is the size of a walnut twice in a day : or half dram in a fit of coughing . Against the piles . Take of the lenitive electuary , two ounces , of flowers of brimstone half an ounce ; mix them . The dose is half an ounce . Against the dropsy . Take of gamboge in powder , an ounce and a half of cream of tartar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half an ounce ; of syrup of sugar enough to make an electuary . The dose is half a dram early in the morning . A safe and easy Purge . Take of julap in powder , two ounces ; of ginger in powder , three drams ; of syrup of oranges enough to make an electuary . When purging is required , this will operate safely and easily . The dose is from half a dram to two scruples , to be taken early in the morning . Jin Electuary against the Rheumatism . Take of conserve of orange-peel , two ounces ; of cinnabar of antimony levigated an ounce and a half ; of gum guaiac in powder an ounce ; of winter 's bark in powder three drams ; of syrup of orange peel a sufficient quantity ; mix them . The dose is a dram morning and evening . This is not designed against an acute rheumatism , but those tedious and wandering pains which fly from one part to another without a fever . For Consumptions Take of spermaceti fifteen grains ; of gum ammoniac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yen grains ; of syrup of sugar enough to make a bolus . This is to be given in disorders of the breast particularly , difficulty of breathing , and consumptions ; and may be given with success in the pleurisy and inflammation of the lungs . Scurvy in the Gums . Take gum-lac an ounce ; myrrh half an ounce : powder them , and then with oil of tartar per deliquium make them into a soft paste , which being dried by a slow fire , add spirit of scurvy grass a pint and a half . Digest in a water bath for four days , and strain off the tincture . This rubbed on the gums cures the scurvy , and fastens loose teeth . A cure for the Dysentery . Take and eat three cloves of the best tame garden garlick , night and morning . After first taking a purge of Calomel and Jalep , with which 1 have often cured the dysentery or flux , in three days ' time , which is the most excellent application that has ever yet been discovered . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent Sharon . /z/ A Receipt For Stack Ink . To six quarts of rain or river water , ( but rain water is the best ) put one pound and a half of fresh blue galls of Alepoo , for those of Smyrna are not strong enough , bruised pretty small , eight ounces of copperas , clean rocky and green ; also eight ounces of clean , bright , and clear gum arabic , and two ounces of rock alum ; let these stand together in a large stone bottle , or clean stone-pot , with a narrow mouth to keep it free from dust ; shake , roll or stir it well once every day , and you will have excellent ink in about a month 's time ; and the older it grows the better it will be for use . Ingredients for a quart . One quart of water , 4 ounces of galls , 2 ounces of copperas , and 2 ounces of gum , mixed and stirred as above . N. B. If you soak the green peeling of walnuts , at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw-dust , or small chips of it , it i rain water , and stirred pretty often for a fortnight , and then strained , and the water used with the same ingredients as above , the ink will still be stronger and better . Hoic to make Red Ink . Take three pints of stale beer ( rather than vinegar ) and four ounces of ground Brazil wood ; simmer them together for an hour and then strain it through a flannel ; then bottle it up , well stopped , for use . Or you may dissolve half an ounce of gum Senegal , or Arabic , in half a pint of water ; then put a penny-worth of vermillion into a small gallipot , and pour some of the gumwater to it , and stir it well , and mix it together with a hair pencil , to a proper consistency ; but it will not incoporate presently , but by the next day it will ; then having a clean pen , dip it into the ink , having first well stirred it with a pencil , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curious red , though not so free as the other . And after the same manner you may make any other coloured ink , as blue , green v purple , &c.; having divers gallipots for that use . In like manner you may mix the shell-gold , for curious occasions , pouring two or three drops , according to direction , into the shell , and mix it well with a clean hair pencil , and with it put a little into a clean pen , c . The small shells may be bought at some fan sellers , or fan painters , at two or three for two-pence ; or the large ones , which are the best , at the colour-shops at sixpence a piece . To keep Ink from Freezing or Moulding . In hard frosty weather ink will be apt to freeze ; if once it does , it will be good for nothing ; for it takes away all its blackness and beauty . To prevent which ( if you have not the conveniency of keeping it warm , or from the cold ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , and it will not freeze . And to hinder its moulding , put a little salt therein . Wheat to make equal to Coffee . Take English wheat , use it in all points as coffee , and it will be as wholesome . Secret Writing . If you dip your pen in the juice of a lemon or of an onion , or in your own urine , or in spirits of vitriol , and write on clean paper whatever you intend , it shall not be discerned till you hold it to the fire , and then it will appear legible . And if with any of the abovementioned , you write on your skin , as on your arm , or back of your hand , &c; it shall not be seen till you burn a piece of paper , and with the ashes rub on the place , - and then it will appear very plain
