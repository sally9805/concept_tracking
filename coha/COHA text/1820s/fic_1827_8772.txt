Laz . Lazarus Well , the Lord help us all , this world is made like the beggar 's coat , of odd fancies tacked together . Every wise man carries his own thoughts in his own belly . ( enter below . ) Welcome to Rome master , how dost ? Pau . Paulo Dust to dust , ( shakes his hand ) passing well . But Lazarus ! how thou hast changed ; thy face is long as a palm tree , the sounding board of thy voice is cracked . You should have been buried a week since . Laz . Lazarus Thank you full as much an I were buried ; please heaven I will die on a full stomach . What stirs abroad thus early ? the kittens have not mewed . Pau . Paulo Look to it Lazarus , men will bury their talents in a napkin . ( shows him a letter , having opened a napkin . ) If the kittens squeak , we squeak not . Tread as tho ' thy stocks wanted soles . Laz . Lazarus Then might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look ! a letter to the Lady Beatrice , touch it not . Laz . Lazarus How am I to come at it then ? Pau .

Paulo Why conscience would smite thee as with a speaking trumpet , for having dirty fingers , and a swinging from thy mistress . Laz . Lazarus What follows the Letter ? Pau . Paulo Marry ! the prescription , a letter is no letter without a prescription , and letters to nobody , argue a want of the faculty . Laz . Lazarus Oh that I had been a Scholard , howsomever that is a natural gift  --  I suppose thy master follows his prescription . Pau . Paulo I suppose he will if he like , the Apothecary follows the Doctor , master Lazarus ! master Lazarus ! this love is a tooth and nail business . Laz .

I should opine there was , if they go to work tooth and nail , something out o ' the common way . Pau . Paulo Well ! well ! hydrophobia ! horn madness ! let it rest ! fare you well ! Go pare thy nails , wash thy mouth , and give the letter to the Lady 's gentlewoman. exit separate . Scene II  --  a church . Alberto . Alberto The world is rank with life , no twist or turn , But some untoward imp has crossed my path , One kicks my heel , or treads upon my foot , Then follows with a thousand score of words : Sir , upon the word of a Catholic ; Saints and devils sir , I did not mean it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make a man go mad , Stark raving mad , to be bythwarted thus . Grave yards with break-neck tombstones at each step Afford no refuge . Earth , sea , and ether , Teem with unwonted plague and pestilence ! The desert would bring forth if I were there , Your civil Arab , with a low salute , Would bid me use his pipe , to rest in peace . This place of deep monastic gloom  --  the which , E'en suits sadly to my mediations , Old antic maidens will intrude anon , To mumble crusty prayers with parchment lips , And visages begrimmed with wealth of age ; Out upon them all ! apes of three score years , Belonging neither to earth or heaven , Putting poor human nature to the blush . The first matin bell rings out its summons , I 'll step aside and see who passes in. a number pass . There goes a man with venerable pace , Whose hoary winter locks would seem to say , That he visits soon perpetual spring ; His prayers will scale the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake the muck in hell ; He is a miser , earth will not rot him . Another , the noted beau , whose garment Serves half Old Rome to shape their doublets by , I know him for a long legged ass , whose soul Lies in his feet  --  yet he walks on earth , Brays loud in my naked Lady 's bed chamber ; A very nothing to enrich the soil , The essence of a chip sent here to be When angry nature satirized mankind . Lo ! where the courtezan comes on a-pace , Death at her heart , destruction in her brow ! The mistress of a prince ; alas ! poor thing ! Go die ! thou art too desolate to live . Oh ! man must turn aside and find no fault , For here his handy work hath raised a sign Which he that runs may read  --  most loathsome sight : This is the one whom jealous fathers curse , Good mothers hate , and all despise , and scorn : The world affects no charity for such , She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not curse her , tho ' there be few maids . The next , ah ! how ! the Lady Beatrice ! Then must I say my prayers , confess my sins , Strait repeat a grace , and gaze in her eyes ; With what grace she kneels  --  that I could pray too What majesty and love combine in her , Saint Peter now doth fumble for his keys To let her prayer pass foremost in of all . ( Anselmo enters unperceived , watching Alberto . ) Ans . Ansaldo My son ' t is evident some grief fits thee . Alb . Alberto How now ! what jay bird have we here ? good sooth That carrion crow , then something 's i ' the wind , Sir ! you have faculties , I would advise Thy faculty of speech " in a few words , " ' Twill more seldom used less shame the others . Ans . Ansaldo Nay , son ! thy words are sharp . Alb . Alberto Would'st prick a dog With a pin 's head ? I am my fathers son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross me not ; Thou hast a devilish visage which tells , As if a murder had been late confessed . Ans . Ansaldo Ha ! Alb . Alberto " Let the galled jade wince , " murther forsooth . There is a dogged gallows-look , a scowl , About thine ugly phiz , which spelt , reads , hang ! Ans . Ansaldo Thou may'st yet repent this wrongful usage . Alb . Alberto And be absolved again for two fair crowns ; I much doubt a pistole would not serve the turn , Unless the shot were doubled . Ans . Ansaldo Unmannerly ! Alb . Alberto Sir , sir , this world is curst with many such , Whilst pious men may like the serpent steal To sting good mothers with their base coined lies . Make easy women doubt their flesh and blood , And tangle private life with fiendish knots , Which murther young affections in the growth , Leaving disjointed life to show the moral ; Meek , pious , monk , and yet I know the well . Ans . Ansaldo Impossible ! my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off guard by heaven ! I have you on the hip You are not what you seem ; ha ! ha ! thy name , An arrant knave , runs thus  --  black knave of spades , In that the devil stood thy godfather . Be sly and watch each step upon the road , A slip may roost one ' twixt heaven and earth . exit . Ans . Ansaldo This eyeas knows me not , but hooded yet , Strikes at the wanton eagle , in his wrath . He flies at will , anon I 'll bring a clutch Shall make each fibre knot with agony . The mother is mine own , deceit and hate , Shall give this son a fall ; on their ruins I 'll build my fortunes , such a tow'ring arch , As places depths , and heights at my disposal  --  Ah ! yonder goes the apple of his eye , ( Beatrice passes . ) A sudden thought , ' t is good ! here will he wince , And this shall be the nerve I touch him thro ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansaldo . Ansaldo Good my dainty lord , have you seen our friend ? Conrade . Conrade The lord Alberto . Ansa . Ansaldo Ay , he has come home , Some three weeks past , I meet him by advice . Con . Conrade Methinks he is lately very altered . Ansa . Ansaldo Some grievance quaint devised to make us laugh . Con . Conrade It may be thus , howe'er it strikes me not , He was more wont to seek our company , Liked curious meetings , could enjoy free jests , Was himself the soul of mirth  --  all now shunn 'd , The good days are spent in idle rambles , And worse perhaps for this wide latitude ; His mind hath lost all zest for wholesome food . Ansa . Ansaldo Perhaps some Eve hath touched him with a frost . Con . Conrade Then do I warrant ' t is sheepkilling frost . Ansa . Ansaldo Lambs catch strange crotchets , I scarce would foray For a baaing mutton to lose the gout . Con . Conrade I saw him in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! with thoughtful face , He gave his watch and begged their acceptance , Saying ' t was great pity he had no crowns ! I ' faith ! they took him at his word well pleased , Not more astounded with his gift than I , They crowned him stark mad , most excellent mad . ( Alberto enters . ) Alb . Alberto 25 I pray you who is mad ? I 'll seek him out ; What sober man hath fortune lately kicked ? Beware brave sirs , the dog days are about , Strange sights are seen to stir the fantasy , The sea with wild uproar has ta'en to land . A shower of fiery hail last night Distracts the hearts of learned philosophers ; The heavens are mad with recent visitation ; Two glowing comets spread their blaze abroad , Warning the restless earth of direful plagues  --  Good ! you stare as if I were mad myself . Con . Conrade Alack , ' t is even worse than could be wished ; " Good my lord , " I had thought upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The dearth of former merriment and wit Which you were wont to entertain him with , I too , he thought , had reason for complaint . Alb . Alberto I have chastised my mirth , soundly whipt it ; It did offend me , was too loud , and rude . Now mark ! anon , my mirth comes back and says , " Save you good father , I crave a blessing . " " A blessing visit thee my son ; thou hast Of late been very absent . " " Yes indeed , yet father I shall presently begone . " " What need so soon ? " " A pressing urgency , I fear ' twill storm to night , the heavens are black . " " Will no persuasion stay ye ? " " Indeed not to night good father . " " It is not late , I pray you stay awhile , Here are some friends expect your company . ' T has gone you see regardless of my wish . " ( enter boy with a letter to Alberto . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mad as march hares ! Alas ! this noble wreck is evident , Curst fortune ! what a slipp'ry trick thou'st played . exit . Alb . Alberto Faith ! this is something strange . Oh he has gone , Ha ! ha ! by saints , wise Conrade thinks mo mad . Ansa . Ansaldo Are you not mad ? I swear I thought you most excellent mad . Alb . Alberto I shall feast a week on this , ha ! ha ! ha ! Read , read , Ansaldo , give me your advice . Ansa . Ansaldo ( reads ) Noble sir , you did me once a service , to night a band of desperadoes beset a certain Lady 's house to work some ill . Beware and watch . So a lady , then are you mad indeed ; Why my lord you were wont to jeer , and laugh , And point at lovers . Alb . Alberto I have changed my mind . List Ansaldo , to you my hearty friend , I will unburthen all my troubled soul ; It was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chance threw a lady So fair and excellent across my path My heart was captured , I wooed and won her ; My mother hearing this o ' the sudden , Grew cool ; from cool to hot , and thus we stand : She vows the honor of her house is dear ; I swear my noble mistress is most dear ! We part , and then this strange epistle comes , Say , what think you ? Ansa . Ansaldo ' T were well to notice it , At the best it will be a cheat ; if true , You may bless your stars and the kindly scrawl . Alb . Alberto She is an orphan , a pearl of rare price , Set in pure gold , rich indeed in virtue , And I must wed her soon or else some imp Of adverse fortune will destroy my hopes ; It has never happened yet but thus , The devil sends his compliments e'en now . Ansa . Ansaldo I would that I could serve you in this pass . To night ! Alb . Alberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ansaldo Then will I watch with your good leave to night , It will afford rare sport to prick these wolves  --  My love to you is tried , I 'm in the vein And will watch , I pray you grant me the boon . Alb . Alberto My ever faithful friend ' t is always thus , You alone of all have stood the test , well ! I am indebted to thee past return . Ansa . Ansaldo Nay , you do overrate , ' twill make me vain , Yet I did always wish some kindly chance Would make you know my good desire . Alb . Alberto Thy hand ! On which , by the heaven above , I swear Eternal friendship , spite joy or sorrow , And I do thank you and accept your love . Ansa . Ansaldo My plan is this , to summon to my aid Some twenty followers painted to the death , The enemy forestalled , will be confused , And beaten off with such wild fright and noise , As will make indweller 's hairs to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the streets are hushed late  --  Say twelve o'clock , before such time as that , The bravoes will not dare to venture forth . Ansa . Ansaldo I 'll be forth coming at the hour , farewell ! exit separate ways . Scene IV .  --  a room in Beatrice 's house . Laz . Lazarus Now when my lord doth come , we 'll watch concealed behind the arrass , the manner of his wooing . Marietta . Marietta Hark ! some one now , get thee behind . ( he gets behind  --  Beatrice enters . ) Beatrice . Beatrice Go ! see who knocks . ( enter Alberto , followed by Marietta , who goes behind the arrass . ) Alb . Alberto ( to Beatrice ) My dearest love . ( kisses her . ) Laz . Lazarus A good example , mark you that mistress . ( kisses her . ) Mar . Marecholi Faugh ! out upon thee cub . Bea . Beatrice Nay !

Alberto Nay ! Bea . Beatrice Oh yes you do . Alb . Alberto I swear I do not love . Bea . Beatrice Ay ! you might swear an hundred oaths , and I Believe them all but one . Alb . Alberto Name that false oath . Bea . Beatrice That you had done a pilgrimage to night . Alb . Alberto I am a sinner at thy shrine . Bea . Beatrice Confess ! Alb . Alberto I do , my love . Bea . Beatrice A sinful man . Alb . Alberto A she So passing excellent in rare virtues To love were sin , being impossible T'approach her high desert . Bea . Beatrice Why at this rate You die a bachelor . Alb . Alberto Most well content . Bea . Beatrice To die !  --  Alb . Alberto A husband man . Bea . Beatrice Tush , a farmer . ' Twill never do . Alb . Alberto In truth it will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lazarus Ay , and I warrant garden vegetables will be plenty . I see , I see . Mar . Marecholi Would it were a millstone hung round your fool 's neck for an eye glass . Laz . Lazarus Marry ! then should I grind thy wit for the looking at . Mark that mistress Marietta , you shall be my kitchen garden . Bea . Beatrice So ends confession , for I absolve thy wit for the mother . Laz . Lazarus Faith that is more than the mother warrants ; having no particle of her composition , he is motherless  --  he hath an orphan wit ; What a thing it is for a hungry wit to have a neat tongue . Alb . Alberto And now sweet mistress there remain some words Which are more fitting to the passing hour ; My plans are ripe for present execution , A se'ennight hence , the which I 'll pass away , To cure suspicions these late visits rouse ; I claim thy promise as the dearest boon , All righteous heaven gives on earth to man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tie the silken knot . Bea . Beatrice Ha ! methinks I heard a step . Alb . Alberto ' T was the wind , It murmurs a lullaby to nature , Which at this gloomy hour rests disturbedly ; It is the time when the wolf howls loudest ; When dreamers sigh and mutter in their sleep , When the centinel of the grave is clothed With awful majesty . Love it is the hour When kindred souls commune together best ; Yes my sweet love , look where yon starry host Swing in their orbits through eternal space , Peopled with happier purer beings . There may we voyage at some future time Linked hand in hand to seek our bower of love , Or soar from world to world coursing the spheres Of hymning seraphs and mighty archangels . Bea . Beatrice Oh I could list to hear you talk this wise Until all duller sense had fled the mind And left but one full heavenly feeling . ' T was this that gained my whole entire heart  --  To lean upon a soul that thinks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways With awful sense and wish for their enjoyment ; To know there does exist one thing on which I can employ my every earthly thought With consciousness of time not spent in vain ; ' T is that , ' t is that Alberto , it is love , True love for you , not passion which I feel . Alb . Alberto It is that which I would have you feel alone ; Our duties in this world command th ' estate Which God hath sanctified by great example . His only son was cradled on the knee , Was nursed by human paps and lulled to rest With all a mother 's fondness for her babe , Subject to grief and sorrow like us all . ( a shout is heard . ) Bea . Beatrice 94 What means this noise , filling the ear of night With angry discord ? Alb . Alberto ( aside ) Good , I had forgot , Lord Conrade watched , his life perchance beset By unfair odds whilst I remain here thus .

Lazarus Think , why that I am fool to stay here where some chance shot may hit me in the nouse. exit . Mar . Marecholi Well they do make the dreadfullest noise , the coward I wont have him , not I faith ; what a noise , I think I had better go . exit . ACT II . Scene I  --  a room in the palace . The Marchesa on a couch reading . Marchesa . Marchesa This legend suits me well , it tells of death . And of a man whose soul was all absorbed In the deep study of unearthly arts , Yet linked to earth by one remaining tie Which in his hours of dark abandonment Proved a great solace to his stormy soul . He had a mind above this grov'ling sphere , Which oft essayed to rend the awful veil That separates the view of future things , And did he then succeed ? yes , yes , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wildest winds were wont to run his errands , And he a living wight conversed with death , Could answer to the tempests horrid moan , And rule the deadly storm with unknown language : His end was strange and very terrible , But what of that ! we must all die sometime . ( muses ) I am weary watching , what ho ! who waits ? ( enter waiting woman . ) Has the confessor yet arrived ? Wom . Woman Not yet your ladyship . exit . Marc . Marchesa Go watch his coming then . The hours lag heavily like days , minutes Like to hours , until I learn the sequel . If my hopes , so long indulged , to see This son unite us with a princely house ; Should chance be thwarted by some base born wretch Instead , to be allied a swindling she , To call her ill begotten beggar brats By my own name , it is impossible . Enter Anselmo . Anselmo Well met ! how speeds the enterprise ? thy face Tells of disastrous news , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grate thine ear withall . Marc . Marchesa Hast failed ! rank cowardice was then the cause . Ans . Ansaldo List , and let reason away your hasty mind . We were forestalled , some unknown messenger Betrayed our purpose to the jealous Count , And fortune adverse frowned upon the whole . At the dead hour of night with thought secure , The band assembled at the appointed place ; When on all sides arose a yell so wild , So very horrible to their weak sense , As put them in disorder , soon , to flight ; When issuing forth from every nook , Appeared men painted , representing death , Pursuing with loud shrieks and mingled mirth . Marc . Marchesa Wretched miserable excuse ! vile fear ! When laws were framed , the first should been a stay , To curb young bloods from overleaping bounds ; The next should be a punishment devised , For such as introduce by wheedling arts , Their baser selves to nobler alliance  --  And such deserve the greatest punishment . Ans . Ansaldo Daughter ' t was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law points out the course , Should not the law of nature prompt our hands To do ourselves a justice ? Ans . Ansaldo Ay , most true  --  Such reasoning does become your better self , The law of nature is of the first . Marc . Marchesa And where three souls ; Ay ! two , are made to gain , By taking of a  --  life , it is no sin . Ans . Ansaldo No ! surely not . ( aside . ) I see the poison works ; Her blood grows thick , ' t is then the o'ercharged brain Is most confused , and easily inclined . Marc . Marchesa Does any punishment exist , too great To heap upon this Beatrice , this , this  --  Ans . Ansaldo She has traduced the honor of thy house , Cajoled its heir to base entanglements ; Within a week would make a near approach By sudden marriage to your noble self . Friends point , and enemies rejoice , saying , There goes the uncouth mistress of the Count ! Anon ! and beggars will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marc . Marchesa All means once tried as yet , have failed ! no more There remains one better , safer way . Ans . Ansaldo Ha ! So , so , so , so , here comes the rub . Marc . Marchesa Father ! Ans . Ansaldo Say on fair daughter . Marc . Marchesa For all the evil done , and good supposed To be derived in future to ourselves , And in the course of chance to many more , Methinks this girl deserves great punishment ; A capital , the greatest , though ' t were death . Ans . Ansaldo ( laughs to himself ) She is but young , a very tender plant , It seems almost too soon to mow it down . Marc . Marchesa The deadly nightshade , can you crop too soon , Or other poisonous shrubs , which taking root , Although cut off , send up more vig'rous shoots ; What think you ? Ans . Ansaldo That which your better judgment prompts , It may be well or ill to do : each one Has most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are very clear . Ans . Ansaldo ' T is to be wished , My mind is clear as I would have my words , If so there is a law , says life for life , Some danger of a noose may be observed ; The law runs thus , the noose slips afterwards , The fixed law may be slipp 'd , the noose can not ; ' T is a hard subject discussed and ends in knot . The hangman 's portrait makes a bad picture , Viewed in all lights , ' t is full of awkward slips . Marc . Marchesa Thanks good father , I stand on firmer ground , Your speech has drift , and no disguise is used . Ans . Ansaldo None is needed , your welfare is my aim ; A dwelling might be found to cage this bird . I knew sometime a man , stern in purpose , Discreet and secret , one to be trusted ; He lives upon a rude and distant coast , Full twenty leagues from any habitation ; He hates the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the tempest howl , The surges bursting on his rocky shore ; The screaming sea mew , bat , and moaning owl , Form good companionship to his fierce mood ; Like Judas , he would sell himself for gold , To him you may entrust your good desire , And rest assured ' twill be right well performed . Marc . Marchesa The worst were best , and any thing too good For this rare Atomic . We 'll talk this way , Father , thy fortunes yet may climb as high ( points to a statue . ) As mitred prelacy , thou know'st my will , Can do as much to serve a faithful friend . exit . Ans . Ansaldo Pile up the Pyrenees , the Caucasus , And let the Alps o'ertop the towering mass , It would not stay a woman from her will ! Weak , miserable tools ! in vice most loathsome , In virtue , frailer than an April day ; Curse on that hour I drank my mother 's milk ! First drew the breath of life from lab'riug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise And rack all nature with unwonted horror ! Let imps and fiends ride upon the air !

Yon lonely ruin , and the assassin look With which its owner steals upon my step , As watching fitting opportunity To do the murtherous deed he wills yet dreads , Alarm my woeful heart . Ah me ! my gentle lord , what now remains , For fortune hath exhausted all her tricks , Her scurviness , and left us in the lurch . Alas ! alas ! That I had one poor friend to weep with me . ( Anselmo enters , disguised in a cloak ) Ans . Ansaldo 20 How came you here in this wild waste of shore ? Bea . Beatrice Oh sir ! if thou hast any mercy left , One kindly feeling for a sad lost wretch , Torn from those ties which nature cherishes ; ( For you by outward look should have a heart , ) I do entreat the speedy use of such , Most humbly beg thy help and fair direction .

( tries to escape  --  Anselmo siezes her . ) Ans . Ansaldo Stay here , for here your stay is short . Bea . Beatrice Oh heaven ! What means this iron grasp ? thou hast no heart , To harm a weak defenceless woman thus , Believe me sir , I ne'er did hurt a mouse ; And always turn aside for busy ants , Lest my too heedless step might do them wrong . Ans . Ansaldo What dost thou fear for ? Bea . Beatrice My life and honor . Ans . Ansaldo ( releases her . ) Thy honor ! ( aside ) it is a crime I know not .

Beatrice Heaven will requite you for such kindness , I an orphan will pray for you to night ; They say that heaven smiles when orphan 's pray . Oh , sir ! if I were you , and found a wretch Without a hand to stay them like myself , I should forgive the weakness of her nature ; And to yet more ennoble my proud heart , Assist her with advice and friendly council .

Did I e'er beg the curse of being born ? Have I not often wished yet feared to die ? Ye heavens am I not drunk with misery ? ( a whistle is heard )  --  enter Malario . Mal .

Some door or loose rafter swinging in the wind . ( muses ) enter Anselmo unperceived . Ans . Ansaldo It is the night of nights befitting tales Which chill the pulses of the youthful heart , When palsied crones sit o'er the mould'ring brands , Recounting passages of former days , Tales which instill the mind with fearful grief ; Perhaps of some , whom frowning destiny Has marked as victims to infernal deeds . ( looking at Malario ) He sits wrapt up in thought ; to know those thoughts , Behold his glazed eye and quiv'ring lips ; The clenched fist as if it held a dagger . What was this fellow once ? what is he now ?

Blood-hounds do scent it ; And tell-tale curs yelp loudly at the moon . Men 's hair doth stand on end with sudden fear : The sleeper wakes to say forgotten prayers , And grieved nature mournsth ' unnatural deed .

Malario I marked her from a babe , and when you fled , Shunning the uplifted hand of justice , Then I did watch the road her mother took , To screen herself and child from infamy . Mark you , the mother died and left this girl , ( I knew her from the time you brought her here , ) Whom thou hast murdered , ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Say Count , does not hell stare thee in the face ? Ans . Ansaldo Go home and carry news .

Alberto chained and Marecholi with a dark lantern . Alb . Alberto So much for Rome in these degenerate days , And this vile priesthood , the cankerworm which eats Deep in the vitals of beggar 'd Italy . Would that these walls were scatter 'd to the winds , Gathered at the four corners of the earth , Their practised hypocrites buried in deep seas , And the great ocean time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this age . Oh shame ! shame to be ridden thus by knaves ; Where is the ancient eagle which could spread Its wings o'er half the world , gather to Rome The wonders of all ages and all men . What would a Csar , Brutus , Scipio say , To see just Romans plunged in loathsome dens , Without a right of voice in self defence , Whilst low born monks , the offals of the earth , Rule with a rod of iron o'er the land . Would that I had a mighty earthquake 's voice , To hoarsely thunder vengeance in their ears . Oh liberty ! liberty ! like me thou'rt chained ; Here wounded , I may rot , without one ray Of blessed light to cheer this dreary tomb . Had I that monk but once within my grasp . Who has so plotted ' gainst my life and love , Anselmo thou 'd find a tiger 's mercy . Mare . Marecholi Thou may'st have ample vengeance on that man . Alb . Alberto Art thou that demon who of yore essayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by first created sin , that in thyself , Conceived , progressive , and brought forth at last , To make an anarchy in high heaven ; With whom two thirds had joined an awful oath Of everlasting hate to him enthroned Who is the great Almighty of mankind ? Say , art thou that sullied fallen angel , Still great e'en in thy ruined fortunes ? Hear ! if thou art he , curse on thee Sathan . Man owes the deadly grudge for dev'lish wiles Practised on first created clay ; for this I do curse thee with my whole heart and strength . Coms't thou to tempt me in my hour of need ? I wish 'd a deep revenge , I did but jest ; Thou weak , foolish , miserable devil . Ha ! Ha ! thou ass . I would not hurt an ant . Oh ! my wound .

Monk ! thou might'st as well scale St. Peter 's dome . Mare . Marecholi Learn that to night thy trial will take place , And as you value life observe my words . When thou art asked concerning of thy crime , Tho ' guiltless , on their mercy throw thyself ; Say that in whatever late concern of thine The monk Anselmo , a Dominican , Is deeply implicated . This is not all ; Charge him with murther of the Countd'Alva And for proof refer to a confessor , Named Ambrose , of the order of mercy . On this man 's fate depends thy thread of life , And I swear , by happiness hereafter , That this advice is true and full of need ; Bringing a wretch quite ripe in wickedness To that stern judgment which the laws commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ' t was him Who worked this wrong on me , this wicked wrong . And shall I have that man within my reach ? No , No , you do but jest . He 's leagued with hell . How can'st thou find the heart to jeer me thus ? Mare . Marecholi Witness ye Saints ! I use no lie towards thee . I swear that man shall pay to me and all , The forfeit of his heinous bloody crimes . These walls would cry amen , had they a voice . Alb . Alberto Stranger , there is a law which says forgive  --  Pray for thy enemies , as he did once Who suffered for us all . I do now thus Towards that bad man . What hast thou to say ? Mare .

Enough ! Alb . Alberto I am not what I 've been . Long abstinence , And dungeon damps , have cramped my limbs and speech , But yet I thank thee for these upright words , Which most express the justice of your heart .

Grand Inquisitor Report had widely spread his sudden death , ' T is well ! Proceed to say . Mare . Marecholi It had great Judge , in me you see that man Who stands to visit justice on the head Of one who was the author of his wrongs . I am the true and rightful Count d'Alva , By virtue being eldest of our house , To whom descends its famed nobility : This did a brother envy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Which ripening with his manhood , took a shape Of such a nature , as to seek my death ; I loved him truly , propped his weak fortunes , And would have freely lost my life for his . Yet one tempest'ous night he pricked that life ; I saw his sabre gleam above my head , And felt the stunning blow of that strong arm In bitter hate , which should been raised instead , To guard the being who had lov 'd so well . This charge I lay on dark Anselmo 's head . Left for the wolves , I lay devoid of sense , Until a traveller chance sent that way , Most fortunate for me , a learned leach , Who finding life , as yet , not quite extinct , Brought me along , and used his utmost skill , Like the Samaritan , to heal my wounds ; I grew in strength , and lived to learn my death . Sick at the soul for such unwonted crime , Leaning against this worthless brother 's life , I left these parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of past events . Sending a messenger , consigned my heir To one I knew would prove a stedfast friend . Since then I 've voyaged over half the world , Have fought the infidel in Palestine , Trod the burning sands of desert Araby , And been by turns a soldier , or a monk , As best might suit the welfare of our creed . I 'm here great judge to prove a heavy charge , Which might , for me , have rested , but for crimes . Which militate against the good of some , I love , heaven witness , better than myself , These are my witnesses , to these I call , To give their evidence in my behalf . Grand Inq .

Chance threw him in her way , and that same chance Prevented me from knowing of the crime , Until I met her on her bed of death . Here had my brother 's hate still set its mark , His ill got wealth , so on melted like the snow , Then step by step , drew his stern fate more near ,  --  A ruffian stabbed , in a low drunken brawl , And fled for refuge to a monastery ; There , like a snake , casting his outward filth , He lay awhile , collecting his full strength , Then ventured forth a polished hypocrite  --  A godly seeming monk , in that disguise , Soon found the mother of this noble lord , Breathed in her ear and poisoned all her soul .

Whilst yet my noble brother lived , this man Tried oft to gain my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's life , That once enraged , I fell 'd him to the earth . He swore a deep revenge , lord Alva 's death Most strange and sudden . ( heaven knows with how much grief I mourned his loss , ) afforded him the means To gratify this unholy purpose . Meantime digusted with the world at large , I took the vows , and sought by prayer and fast , To purchase respite from all earthly cares . It seems he bears his malice coldly yet , For he has chose a time I have no friends , No human being , in whose veins , my blood , Might right me now to call upon for aid . I stand alone firm in my innocence , Here let him give his proofs and if he fail , Receive his death by slow consuming fire , Should he succeed , I ask no better fate . Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor Thou bear'st it bravely monk , I wish the well . If th ' accuser fail to prove on either charge , Which may be first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perjured mouth , not fit To speak , but n his hour of woe and death , And others also which ourselves have laid Shall pass and leave thee life and liberty . All those concerned in this stand forth , and first , Thy brother 's murder  --  ' t is the worst of all . Ans . Ansaldo I do entreat you place another fore . The grief upon my heart for that great loss , And anger in its turn ' gainst such a charge , Might make that seem to cross-eyed prejudice As guilty trembling , which alone would spring . From such sincere heart felt emotion . Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor No ! It can not be . Proceed . Mala . Malario It was a dark and stormy day , this lord  --  Ans . Ansaldo Thou liest knave , ' t was night , ( checking himself ) As I was told , Howe'er it matters not . Mala . Malario A four and twenty years agone , That night  --  Ans . Ansaldo Now by the mass he has confessed himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; My brother died these five and twenty years . Mare . Marecholi ( aside ) Yes , yes , ( aloud ) He said aright , the ides of March , ' T was five and twenty years . Ans . Ansaldo ( looking fearfully around ) What voice was that ? Was there not some one spoke just now ; Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor None , none ! What ho ! who spoke ? An echo of the voice . Monk , thy nerves lack vigour , I heard no sound . Ans . Ansaldo ( aside ) Methought I heard a dead man speak ; out o n't , It was a cursed conscience echoing ill . Mala . Malario The time , it matters not , this lord and I , Well armed , had sallied out in quest of one Whom he affirmed purposed to cross a waste , Some three leagues distant from the nearest house . He swore the knave had once essayed his wife , And thereby robbed him of his peace of mind ; Bribed me with gold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To do for him unto the death in this ; The victim fell o'ercome with such great odds , And then Alas ! I saw too late the deed , It was his noble brother , whom I loved , Had followed through the wars , fought side by side , Twice saved the life in vain which then I took ; For whom I would have died and thought it gain , And this is all the truth , than less , nor more . Mare . Marecholi He speaks it now , and I have done him wrong ; He did indeed twice save me at a fault . Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor What say'st thou to this ? Ans . Ansaldo A well wrought lie ; The meanest beggar in the street might swear With the same truth against my life and honor ; It bears a very lie in the front of't , Let him bring proof , I call him to the proof . Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor Monk if thou art guilty of this heinous charge Now is the only time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess thy crimes ; It has been known the dead did sometime rise , Permitted by th ' Almighty 's dread assent , To visit justice on the murtherers head . If such should happen now , woe to the monk ; Speak to the purpose , wilt thou take the risk ? Ans . Ansaldo ( aside ) Why should my soul thus quake with unknown dread , I 've no belief in such appearances ; Yet that mysterious something in the mind , Which tho ' it jeers abroad , still fears in secret , Shakes my whole system like an aspen leaf . ( bell tolls twelve ) The time , this gloomy place , the midnight hour , The hour at which they say the dead do walk . ( looks round fearfully ) Each face looks heavy on me , as to one ' Whom fate hath left no last remaining chance . I have it now , nature he thinks to gain , To evidence in favour of my guilt , Foul light  --  the crafty knave . It was well done , Right well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark ; ha ! ha ! I 've shrewdly guessed . Have at thee politics , ( aloud ) I do but stop To marvel at thy words ; I could e'en smile At such unwonted questioning . This man I have called to prove his accusation , He has proved nought but words of small avail , An ass might sing as well as this foul kite . Yet with good will , To please the humours of so wise a judge , I would now wish , in nature could it be , That some uneasy spirit might arise To witness of these foul and dev'lish crimes . ( Marecholi undisguised comes to his side ) I 've said , I see it not . Where now this ghost , Ay , this frowning dreaded ghost . ( turns round and sees Marecholi ) Mare . Marecholi Anselmo ! ( Anselmo falls senseless ) Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor Bear him away directly , Anon , let him be shrived by some good priest ; Tomorrow he must die . Pau . Paulo Never till now , Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inq . Grand Inquisitor Here is another doom remains to give . Mala . Malario Death is the dearest boon I have to beg , For I am sick of misery and life . Grand Inq . Grand Inquisitor Life is thy doom , go an outcast thro ' it , Visit hospitals , tend plagues and fevers , And seek that way forgiveness for your sins . ACT V. Scene I  --  Anselmo 's dungeon  --  Anselmo chained . Ans . Ansaldo Is this the end of all those deep laid schemes , To be thus poorly tricked of my good life , To lie enchaned waiting until the hour It pleases tardy justice to strike home ; Perchance , dragged like some beast thro ' public squares , For the pleased multitude to pelt and scoff , And suffer death , made tenfold horrible , With curses hotter than the scorching fire . Nay , nay , Anselmo , that will never do , A cordial for thee , to here it is. ( holds some poison ) Have I a pulse which beats unwonted time ? no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Till now I doubted , I had fear of death ; Let fasting monks sing madrigals , forsooth ! I will be merry , this my birthday night . Here 's comfort to ye heart . What now remains ? Not one poor drop to case a thirsty soul . Then for the sleep , down ages yet unborn . ( lays down )  --  enter Marecholi , Conrade , and Priest . What fiends sent you here at such a time ? Have ye no bowels , thus to break my rest ? Out upon thee priest , I 'm for Mahomet , Go preach thy lies to infidels thou dog . Mare . Marecholi Unhappy man , on me turn all thy rage , ' T was I who brought this holy father here , To shrive thee of those sins , for which thou'lt die . Ans . Ansaldo Ha ! my brother , this is too kind indeed , I pray you noble lords and gentlemen , Be seated , use little ceremony , I scarce can rise just now to welcome you , My noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thee for these things ; Pray use them all , here 's water , mouldy bread , And many other luxuries of woe . Sooth ! you look blank my lords , it grieves me much , Yet have I offered all I have to share . Here is a man brave sirs , of wild humours , Given to doing common things in strange way ; A curious man to look at , The children in the street would run to point , And fling mud , crying , oh rare ! should he pass . Never fear lords he can do you no harm ! The chained lion may couch but can not spring . Mare . Marecholi Anselmo , I had thought on other words ; Think my brother , think on thy repentance . Ans . Ansaldo Lord Alva , had I brought one to the stake , Methinks I could find heart to let him die Without addition of such base insult , Such mean and biting mockery , as this . Grammercy sir , I ask thee to begone ; Bound as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had rather be Anselmo curst , Than Alva blessed ! Pray go , there lies your way . Mare . Marecholi I will not , can not go , to leave thee thus ! By all that 's good , think of thy present state , With how much strength it bears upon the future ; Oh Anselmo , my soul is heavy for thee . Ans . Ansaldo Let vexed dogs howl , I am the more merry . ( Marecholi weeps ) Nay I did not mean it thus , I pray you peace , My hour is nigh , it is not long to live , Say twenty minutes , brother forgive me . Mare . Marecholi Would that heaven shall do as easily . Ans . Ansaldo Straight let all retire , I would speak with him ? But hold yourself in eager readiness To come at th ' instant mention of his name . all but Marecholi exit . My brother I have wronged thee very much , And now , as gloomy death draws on apace , Would seek forgiveness of my many crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace , She is dead , dead , I poisoned her . Thy niece , Murdered too , with these hands , behold how stained ! ( agitated ) Count Alva I have ta'en my daughter 's life ! Mare . Marecholi Hear it ye heavens , she lives recovered . Ans . Ansaldo Lives ! had she a mail too for protection ? ' T is excellent good , I am better for't , Say where ! Mare . Marecholi In my own Castle . Ans . Ansaldo Assist me ! I faint with weariness and long suff'ring . Count Alva I have hated thee with hate , Darker than hell can ever purify ; By every means which wicked men may use , Have sought thy woe and misery ; Would have leagued , had I then the power , With Tartarus , To purchase more inhuman wrong . Say , say , Can you forgive me from your inmost soul , And feel no sting of anger ' gainst the past ? Mare . Marecholi I can and do , with my whole soul and strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take thy doom ! ( stabs him ) ( Who jeers the Tartar must beware the dirk. ) ( shouts ) Marecholi ! How fares it with thee lord ? ( they re-enter ) He has the vile cramp , ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ( fulls backward and groans ) Con . Conrade 1 01 Alas ! there is no hope . Oh my brave friend , This murtherous wicked deed has broke my heart . Hush priest , he speaks ! Mare . Marecholi I can not see ! where is my brave friend , Conrade , my friend ! Con . Conrade Here my poor lord . Even now he clasps thy hand , ' t is too much . Mare . Marecholi Pray for my brother 's soul , now press my palm , My life goes out . God bless thee . ( dies ) Scene II .

Ansaldo and Paulo Ansa . Ansaldo How fares it with thy lord ? Pau . Paulo But poorly sir . A fever caught him in those dungeon damps , His wits have wandered sadly since you went . Four days and nights he has not tasted sleep , And now talks wild of seeking out himself , The place where lady Beatrice abides . Ansa . Ansaldo How says the leach ? Pau . Paulo That he must die to night , Without a kindly crisis gives him rest . Ansa . Ansaldo A straw to catch at for a drowning man , My gentle coz must use her aid in this .

( gets up ) A murrian on this thirst that chokes me , Give me wine , I could drink an ocean dry ; Were I a prince , I 'd have a fountain of't , Where I might bathe and quench this ardent thirst ; Each beggar in the streets should drink his fill , The valiant multitude should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood be shed at all ; Wine is the sinew of all gen'rous deeds .

Heaven 's in a passion here for something , Perhaps they hold a festival to night , So make this idle noise . Demons , methinks , Should be grave , and at times , somewhat sombre . What ho ! where is the lady Beatrice ? Paulo , come hither , tell the honest truth , Thou wert not wont to lie , where is she ? Pau . Paulo Above , within her bower my good lord . Alb .

How strange that filaments may lift dead weights , Thought , has an undiminished growth , whilst all Of nature 's magnificence has dwindled . There was the huge Mammoth , when first born men Lived centuries old , and all things likewise had Proportionate increase of age and strength , Grew to a size so nobly towering , That e'en the skeletons of present days , Make nations wonder , and all viewing quail ; Reared in those mighty deserts , whose stern sons Have waved the flag of freedom to the world , And who will e'er shout liberty or death , Or i ' the cottage or the glorious field ; They went forth in the greatness of their strength , Spurning the trembling earth , each footstep  --  death To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that a great and glorious age ?

Conrade I have never witnessed or heard of such , As is now hanging wrathful over us ; It was a dazzling flash , behold the tree , ' T has struck yon noble solitary tree . Pau . Paulo Then by the legend all is finished here , That one tall tree , the remnant of a grove , Remained to represent its fellows , As doth my lord his house , now that is scathed ; I hate the thought , but fear me he will die .

Back matter THE END @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , I have but told it as ' t was told to me . Let snarling critics judge , and stamp the fool , On all who vary from the general rule . All trades must live , and their 's the most , to gain A paltry shilling by the bleeding vein . But for the meaner class , who chuckle with delight . And seek the indulgence of a dev'lish spite ; Who once essayed to choke the sacred nine , With filthy verses tagged with gingling rhyme . Grant all ye powers , such ragged poets , curses ; Be worse than rags , prosaic naked verses . Still may the wretch but sow to reap in vain , Still as before , sweat hard and write again ; In ignorance , obstinate , in vain to try , Putrid with doggrel verse , at last to die . Descend to Pluto 's hall , condemned forevermore , To rhyme a laureat on the Stygian shore .
