txt ART . ILI. - * - -  - .1 foreigner 's opinion of England , *c . By C. *1 . U. Ga*de . Translated from the German , by Thomas home . Wells &amp; Lilly , Boston . TRAVELLIi*R5 from the continent of Europe , who have published their opinions of England , divide themselves with a few exceptions into two classes ; of which the most numerous is made up of illiberal writers , who speak only the language of prejudice , and represent every object in the hues which their own national prepossessions , or personal antipathies , have thrown over it . The misrepresentations of such persons are so glaring , as generally to carry their refutation with them to the mind of every candid reader . It is not equally easy to guard against the more excusable , but hardly less mischievous faults of tourists of the opposite character . It matters little to the reader , whether he is deceived by a spirit of malignity and censoriousness , or by an overweening partiality onthe part of the narrator . He has equal cause of complaint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nation which has the misfortune to be injured , it is of little moment whether it he by inordinate praise , or unmerited censure . Not that we have among ourselves any very great reason to murmur at the hardships we have suffered , from the first of these causes , but we have observed of late , that the manners of European nations , towards each other , in this regard are wonderfully softened , and that the writers of the present day , bandy compliments across the channel with as hearty a good will as their predecessors were wont to do invective and abuse . In this age of good humour , and good manners , we certainly are not disposed to act a churlish part , and to find fault with the prevailing sentiment . As indifferent readers , however , whose object is correct information , it is equally important to us. that truth should not be obscured by petulance or flattery . We do not intend to rank the writer now under consideration , in either of the above mentioned classes of travellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and people of England , he occasionally falls into the faults of both . The author of this work was a professor in the philosophical faculty of the university at G*.ittingen ; and died prematurely // and much lamented a few years since . He visited England in 1802 , a period of great excitement and interest , and appears to have participated in the curiosity at that time prevalent in Europe , respecting the character , resources , and probable destiny of Great Britain . Of all the loyal subjects of the English crown , it is somewhat singular , that the most loyal should be the Hanoverians ; who enjoy none of the benefits secured to the British by the constitution of England. - Whether this circumstance throws any light on the connexion between the loyalty and love of liberty , in the subject , we shall not stop to inquire . Notwithstanding his loyalty , our author always intends to be impartial , and so long as he confines himself to facts , we have reason to think he is so ; unfortunately , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his observation , but endeavours to explain upon philosophical principles , the leading phenomena of the English character . Here lie betrays , in common with all continental writers , a surprising ignorance of some of the most obvious effects of a free government . The humblest citizen of the United States , would smile at the labored conjectures of the learned German , upon occurrences that create no surprise in himself , because they are perfectly familiar . The spirit of liberty displays every where the same features which her children instinctively recognize . The want of this perception , leads continental travellers into the most absurd theories , when they attempt to explain the actual condition and character of the EngliTh nation . To illustrate our meaning , we shall give a few instances in which the author has bestowed praise where it was not deserved , and condemned what he did not understand . After enumerating several of the great divisions of society in England , and endeavoring to show the intimate connexion between them , and how inevitably the ruin of one must involve that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate how all these prominent features of the English character , supply , with a constant strea*ri of light , this splendid luminary of public spirit which sheds such a brilliant lustre over the English constitution . In propo " tion to the individual varieties of Englishmen , the stamp of public spirit is impressed , in a thousand different forms and shapes upon all ranks and classes of people . It does not indeed , universally wear the same noble character . The enlightened and liberal statesnnm associates with it the most exalted conceptions , whilst the // narrow minded , selfish shopkeeper blends and confounds i with his own interested views . Upon the whole , however , independently of its different modifications , its glorious effects are universally felt and acknowledged . ' Here , then , according to our author , is the prim*um mobile , from which every minute subdivision of this vast machine derives its impulse . Public spirit is the vivifying principle , which imparts health and vigor to the body politic . In England , it seems , from the palace to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters into every undertaking . If Mr Goede is correct , the ordinary motives , which impel the species , are here superseded by a disinterested patriotism . To such an agent , what effects may not be imputed ? With a stimulus like this , to what degree of excellence may Pot a nation aspire ? We must give the author the praise of having called in aid a power worthy of the occasion , but at the same time we must say , that , highly as we estimate the English character , we can not impute its excellence to a source so entirely inconsistent with the laws of analogy in human affairs . We are disposed to believe , that a nearer view of society in England would have taught our author to refer her national greatness more to the peculiar influence of her constitution , than to individual virtue . He would probably have discovered that selfish wants and enjoyments were the grand incentives to action , and that the English patriot measured his periods , the English lawyer his briefs , the English physician his pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbins , upon nearly the same standard , which regulates the value of similar commodities elsewhere . It is undoubtedly true , that the citizens of free states entertain a purer and more ardent love of country , than can be experienced by the subjects of less popular governments . The encouragement to industry by the security of property , to emulation by the hopes of distinction , to bravery by the certainty of reward , is powerful and constant . The interests of the state and the individual citizen become in a degree identified , and the latter turns to his country , as to the fond parent , who is to share in his success , and whose arms are ever extended to cherish and protect him . This sentiment is as strong in England , as in any nation on the globe , but unhappily refined and virtuous emotions form but one of the ingredients in the human character , and he , who would refer great reeults to such motives , gives* to be sure , // honorable testimony to the goodness of his own heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of observation . The felicity of England consists , not in the superior virtue of her citizens , but in the admirable adaptation of her government to the nature and wants of men . The glory of the English arms does not arise from the superior physical hiavery of her soldiers over those of any other nation . There are brave men and cowards in all armies . But the English soldier knows that the performance of his duty offers him a surer and a richer reward than could be derived from the most successful criminal enterprise . English politicians are probably not more sincere than those of other nations , but such is the force of public opinion , that the demagogue , to gain his ends , must act the patriot . It is the excellence of the English government to have done better than any other in Europe , all that the best government can do , namely , to make the bad , as well as the good qualities of its subjects subservient to the public . This trait has been so well defined by a late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using his words . England , after all , is the only country in the world , where chance , perhaps as much as human wisdom , compounding with the vices and the virtues of our species , has effected a treaty between them , assigning to each their respective and proper shares , and framed its political constitution on the constitution of human nature . ' We can not , however , agree in allowing this praise exclusively to the government of England ; we believe it to be the characteristic of all free governments . Mr Gede 's remarks on the police of England discover an equal misconception of the effects of free institutions upon national character . He is greatly scandalized that quackery is so prevalent , and devotes some pages to the enumeration of the tricks of certain worm doctors , venders of drugs , and wine manufacturers , whose practices he thinks extremely pernicious , and demanding the interference of the police . We agree with him entirely , that such abuses do exist , and in about the same degree , as in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means convinced , that they are within the reach of any system of police , however rigorous . If our author had pointed out the country where there are not quacks and their underlings to compound and administer potions , and dupes in abundance to swallow them , and where the trader and the inn-keeper never put off bad wine upon the unlucky // customer , we might perhaps have become converts to his scheme of a sanative police . Our present opinion is that the most that can be done , is to endeavor , by education and the dissemination of truth , to open the eyes of the multitude to their true interests , and leave the rest to their good sense and sagacity . He also complains that the safety of individuals is neglected , in a strain that will appear to American readers somewhat novel . That part of the police , to whose guardianship the personal safety of the subject is committed , is the most remiss in the discharge of its functions . Unhappily , accidents occur daily , which might be easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no festivity , no solemnity , in London , if attended by the sympathizing or inquisitive populace , in which the public rejoicings of the day are not disturbed by some tragical events . Upon some occasions , for example , very slight scaffoldings are erected for the spectators . It almost always happens , that some of them break down ; yet has this never induced the London police to take the least cognizance of their construction . When the peace was proclaimed by a public festivity , one of these scaffoldings broke down near the Mansion House , upon which there happened to be more than thirty persons , and many of them were in consequence dangerously bruised ; but the Londoners are so very indulgent to their police , that they do not even suspect that it ought to take any steps toward the prevention of such accidents ; though not fewer than live of them , during my short stay in London , were announced in the public prints . In none of the places , where it is presumed that great crowds of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police evincing the least concern for the maintenance of regularior the prevention of misfortune . They fight and squabble , ( in some instances fatally , ) at the entrance of the theatre , and the police has not yet been aroused from its lethargy . It will scarcely appear credible , that the carriages are not even enjoined to keep the necessary order on such occasions , yet though such scandalous confusion be always accompanied with unlucky casualties , the police suffers them to he renewed every day . At a subscription ball , which was given in commemoration of the peace , there were nineteen equipages overturned and broken to pieces ! When L expressed my surprise to some Englishmen , I was told that it was nothing extraordinary ; and they mentioned several excellent routs , where the same accident had happened to a still greater number . ' It is admitted , without hesitation- , that these are evils ; for we are by no means of the number , who maintain that such // *lisorders are requisite to keep alive the national spirit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of the privileges of freedom ? Are they not the rank weeds of a fertile soil , which can hardly be eradicated without injury to the valuable product ? The very circumstance mentioned by the author , that the English are not sensible of the inconvenience is of itself evidence , that it is not very great . Probably nothing would excite stronger indignation among the English , than an attempt , on the part of the government , to interfere in cases like those enumerated by the author , and the immediate sufferers would be likely to be the first to discover their resent .. ment . The question is not , whether this or that trifling abuse might be reformed by a more rigid system , but whether they are prepared to submit to a continental police , with its spies and informers , its gens d'armes , and lettres de sureU* for to this the proposed measures must inevitably lead . It is for them to choose whether they will submit to the inconvenience of occasional tumults , or enter every place of resort for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even of religious worship , between soldiers with fixed bayonets , as occurs constantly at Paris . What is the oecasionaj inconvenience from rogues and vagabonds on the high road , in comparison with the vexatious system of passports and police officers ? Public opinion is the censor of English manners and the engine of reform , the laws rarely interfering , unless they are violated . Self-interest is the strongest incitement to correct conduct , for in every occupation there are competitors to take advantage of the least deviation . It is to these , that all free states must confide ; and when they are no longer under their control , they may adopt a military police , for they *iave no longer a character to lose . In his chapter on education in England the author bestows great praise on the plan pursued during infancy and childhood , which he prefers to that of the continental nations . He also notices a peculiarity in English education , which we strongly recommend , in the hope that it may not be lost upon us . A singular maxin2i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dignity of a man , and no difference obtains in the penal laws of the higher and lower classes . A scholar of the first form at Eton , who already indulges himself with the fond hQpes of running a brilliant carreer at Cambridge // and Oxford , receives the chastisement of the rod , for any transgression , as certainly as the naughty boy of eight years old , who refuses to submit to lawful discipline . ' Wh* t a contrast do our seminaries exhibit , where the rod is barely spoken of as an antiquated instrument of torture , and boys of twelve and fourteen assume the airs and consequence of men . Of the more advanced stages of education in England , the writer seems to entertain a very different opinion , and of the universites he speaks with a degree of contempt hardly becoming a forei*ner , who admits that his information is procured at second-hand . It will be inferred then , perhaps , ' he says , that English schools and universities possess an eminent degree of merit . Quite the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inferior to the other noted seminaries in Europe , by a remove of least two centuries . ' We know of no better standard of the merit of seminaries than the characters and acquirements of those who are taught in them , and we certainly think it savors a little of paradox , to extol a nation in one breath as the only one on the globe which has discovered the true secret of greatness , and in the next to charge her public seminaries with more than monkish degeneracy . We would by no means be understood to defend the practice of the English universities . The objections of a too close adherence to antiquated studies , and an extreme devotion to the classics , to the exclusion of other branches equally important , are in a degree well founded . He might have added , what we think a still stronger objection , that the benefits of an academical education are too exclusive . The expense attending a residence at the university , and the interest necessary to procure admission , deprive a great proportion of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still more to be lamented , the common branches of instruction in England are within the reach of , comparatively , very few . Happily in this country the case is reversed ; in New England and some other portions of the United States , no individual , however humble , has to complain that he can not procure a competent school education . But it is conceded that our praise must stop here ; in the higher departments of education , particularly in classical learning , we are still far in the rear of European nations . What Johnson wittily said of learning in Scotland , that it // was like bread in a besieged town , where every man gets a share , but no man has a full meal , ' may with some truth be applied to the actual situation of this country . This remark is not made by way of reproach ; on the contrary , we think it reflects the highest honor on a people , that their first object should be to scatter with an equal hand the blessing of knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , is its highest eulogium . It is however to be regretted , that many among us are not only disposed to rest satisfied with what has already been done , but to look with jealousy on every attempt to introduce a more thorough course of classical instruction . Some men of enlightened minds , and otherwise liberal views , have been known to urge against any innovation , that we have done very well hitherto with our present allowance of Greek and Latin ; and why change a system of which we have no cause to complain ? Nothing is so unreasonable , as contempt for what we do not understand , and consequently no prejudice is so diffleult to overcome . Ignorance in itself is not disgraceful , for it may be unavoidable ; but to persist in keeping posterity in darkness , because we ourselves are not enlightened , is the surest index of barbarism . It by no means follows , that , because some are learned , the mass is necessarily ignorant . My taper is not extinguished by the brightness of my neighbour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stimulate to exertion , to encourage merit , and to refine and exalt the character of a nation , as a numerous and respectable body of men of learning . One of the first steps toward the attainment of so desirable an end , is to encourage learned foreigners to come among us . By a strange perversity , for which we can give no good reason , our citizens have uniformly shown an aversion to employ foreigners as instructers of youth , at the same time they have held out every lure to adventurers of all descriptions . This prejudice , we have reason to think , is gradually wearing away , and we hope that the example set by the national government , in the excellent academy at West PQint , where several very respectable foreign gentlemen are employed , will have a good effect throughout the union . To return , the author has given several anecdotes in illustration of a defect in English education , of which perhaps almost every traveller in England might furnish similar instances . 4 // There is , perhaps , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated . In their daily conversation they constantly utter the most ludicrous absurdities , as to foreibn parts . They are , in particular , strangely perplexed in forming an adequate conception of Germany . Most of them consider the states of the empire as a sort of parliament , destitide of energy , public spirit , orators , and debates . A well bred Englishman once expressed to me his astonishment , that we ( Germans ) could have deliberately given such a constitutional preponderance to the House of Peers , " for , " added he , " 1 have never yet heard speak of the German House of Commons . " By a strange association of ideas , he had metamorphosed the aggregate sum of all the Electors , and of all the great and petty Princes of the empire , into a House of Peers . The English are most conversant with the geography of France , and are the least acquainted with that of the north of Europe . For example , a Russian banker once told me that in a brilliant assembly at London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent solemnity , whether at Petersburg , the inhabitants were not exposed to danger in the streets , on account of the white bears ? It is p artly owing to the defective reports of their travellers , who seldom know any thing beyond what they glean in coffee-houses and at places of public resort , that these mistaken notions become radical and inveterate , The religious dispositions , the jurisprudence , and the po* litical divisions of the English nation , occupy separate chapters , which , as may be supposed , contain nothing particularly new or edifying to American readers . A distinct chapter is devoted to English literature , on which point some idea may be formed of the value of the author 's opinions , when it is stated , that he places Ossian first on the list of British poets , speaks with no little contempt of Johnson and his works , and expresses his surprise , that the nation should have been so long insensible to the merits of Darwin and Brown . We must here except the remarks on the English stage , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be generally acknowledged . The Ewrhish give currency to Johnson 's aphorism , that the theatre must be a school of morals , without annexing a more exalted idea to this conception , than is usual among ordinary pedagogues . XX hoever is desirous to have positive evidence upon this fact need only glance at their theatrical censors . It is indeed somewhat surprising , that among a people whose characteristical distinctions do not proceed from the narrow circumfe* // rence of a school room , but from an enlarged and liberal survey of mankind , such a doctrine should gain ground ; as if common place observations , which may be collected every day in the street , were sacred apothegms to instruct and edify our minds . But this standard has been universally adopted , to ascertain the moral excellence of dramatic poetry . When a character is nicely fashioned after some approved system of morality , when it is richly surcharged with the tinsel and emb oidery of moral sentences , and is fur ished up with such hi h coloring , that the spectator can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then all demands are satified . I shall only cite a single performance , which has been universally extolled as a perfect model of this sort , the West-Indian of Cumberland . 1 have seen it performed at Drury Lane , before a very large audience ; and have witnessed to my no small astonishment , the tumultuous applause bestowed upon the trivial sentences interwoven in the body of the piece . Whenever the actor , with a solemn accent , pronounced one of those choice scraps of morality , all the bystanders began to clap their hands , as if the goddess of wisdom herself were promulgating her oracles , for the illumination of mankind . Independently of the poets who thus regale the public with the quintessence of morality , there exists at present in this country a certain description of dramatists , who elude the malignity of criticism by usurping the province of ordinary punsters . Never has the temple of wit been more sacrilegiously profaned , than by these petty retailers of bon-mots . One can hardly conceive it possible , that such pitiful conceits should dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image may be imagined to reside ; but this has actually occurred , and the public has taken them under its protection . The applause bestowed upon the vile productions of an O'Keefe and a Morton , and other poetasters of the same stamp , affords at once a lamentable and an irrefragable proof of this assertion . ' The remarks on the state of the fine arts in England , form one of the most interesting and masterly portions of the book . We believe that the progress of good taste within the last twenty years has had a tendency to confirm the truth of most of the author 's opinions in this particular . We shall quote as an example , his judgment of the merits of West , who is , perhaps , better known in this country than most English artists , though we ought to observe that Mr Gcede visited England at a period anterior to the production of Mr West 's most distinguished works* // I have had an opportunity of inspecting a variety of Mr *Vest 's pictures , but I can not pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted , their composition or their coloring . The chief property of the former is dissonance and confusion , superadded to seve*'aI striking irregularities in the drawin * in the latter are accumulated all the combined faults of the English school . Observe , for example , the large altar-piece in the chapel at Greenwich . Nhat infinite difficulty there is , amidst this miscellaneous and huddled assemblage of fl*ures , to distin*ui sh the principal groupe ! Neither does it imply much knowledge of anatomy to discern many dislocations in the arms and lees of several conspicuous figures . The coloring is so harsh and cold , that you are al most tempted to imagine the artist had painted a set of masked countenances . ' His strictures are hardly less severe , and quite as just , on the prevailing style of sculpture in England , at that period . Of the performances of Flaxman , however , particularly of his monument to lord Mansfield , in Westminster abbey , he speaks in terms of the highest admiration . He is pleased , through his translator , to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The anecdotes interspersed throughout the book are related in a lively manner , and will constitute its chief attraction to a large class of readers . The following will serve as specimens . Nothing , in the opinion of a London shopkeeper , conduces more toward establishing his credit , than to have his shop decorated with the ensigns of royalty , and to be able to acquaint the public that he enjoys the protection of his majesty , or one of the princes . Thus you may see near Leicester Square a species of quack 's shop very elegantly fitted up , the proprietor of which styles himself , " Privileged bug destroyer to their majesties ! " - On the new road you pass by a house with an advertisement , inscribed in very legible characters over the gateway , announcing that a " Vender of asses ' milk to their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of York resides here ! " -A short time ago , a strange conceit was entertained by a man , who manufactures wooden legs with much dexterity , and who has placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample of his art , as a symbol of his profession , which was no other than to apply thr the title ot " Manufacturer of wooden legs to his royal highness the prince of Wales ! " It may easily be conceived , however , that the prince , who has the finest legs in the world , could not comply with this ridiculous request . ' In his observations upon the manners of the English coxcombs , the author commits a laughable blunder , which , whether // real or pretended , is an admirable satire on one of the reigning absurdities of the age . But of all their extravagances , their fashionable cant is the most absurd . It is generally an unintelligible gibberish ; a compound of broken French , seasoned with some significant and original terms . There are always some which have a run . Thus , the " boar " lately made a considerable figure among them . At all public amusements , which created languor or satiety , every body complained of " the boar . " This is the more extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . " As the author has placed English manners , morals , and domestic life at the head of the long list of topics enumerated in his title page , we were not a little surprised to find that his remarks are almost exclusively confined to London . This is the more to be regretted , as the beautiful scenery of England would have employed the pleasing talent at description , in which Mr Gmde principally excels . The specimen he has given us in this way , in the account of his journey from Dover to London , is just sufficient to make us regret , that he did not think proper to be more communicative . In the following extract , however , great allowance is to be made for the exhilaration , which every traveller experiences on his first introduction to scenes , on which he has long dwelt in anticipation . The first cursory survey of England , presents nearly the same aspect , from whatever side a stranger may advance toward the metropolis . One of the most animated high roads , is that leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dover , as you approach Ewell , a fine spacious plain lies extended before you , which gives the traveller a just idea of the highly cultivated state of the country . No spot is left without improvement ; as far as the eye can reach , it discerns traces of laborious industry . All the fields and meadows are enclosed with green hedges , or fenced round with trees . The dwelling houses of the country people , and farmers , appear to be but newly constructed , and are only distinguished from the mansions of the town 's people by their cheerful aspect . They are for the most part encompassed with a garden of flowers , and as every one follows his own humor in the style of building , they exhibit a great variety of architecture . Yonder you behold in idea a Gothic Chapel , another mansion is decorated with little pillars , and in a third you observe Roman pilasters jutting out beside Gothic bow-windows . The neatness , that reigns throughout , enhances the pleasing sensation excited by the prospect of universal plenty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he learns , that these mansions which he deemed the seats of country squires , are only the dwellings of farmers and peasants . He sees a lady seated in a bower of a little garden , with four young girls at her side , clothed in snowy robes of muslin . The mail coach drives up to the door ; they rise and hastily advance to meet it . A gentleman from within exclaims with a joyful accent ; " there are my wife and children , " He jumps out and meets with a most affectionate reception from his darlings . The gentleman and lady salute the travellers , in a cordial manner , the coach sets off , and the stranger on inquiring of his fellow travellers , who these gentlefolks are , is informed that they are a farmer 's family settled in the neighbourhood . ' We must take our leave of this work with a sketch of the daily routine of two very different classes of Englishmen . " Abmit eleven o'clock it grows day with a Londomi beau . He swallows a slight breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his stable , where his coachman , grooms and lacqueys , are in punctual attcudance . Here his horses are mustered up before him , he takes a strict cognizance of them , makes minute inquiriea after their state of health and constitution of body , and distributes the necessary orders relative to their management . If the weather be favourable , he then saunters through the town , on horseback , or drives out in his curricle attended by his servants . His way leads him through all the fashionable streets , and commonly ends after a few rounds in Hyde Park . Should the weather prove unfavorable , he frequents the workshops of the most eminent saddlers and coachmakers , is received with much ceremony , and many professions of regard , bespeaks fresh articles , proceeds to the auction of horses , and every where meets his friends . He then takes a survey of those curious sights with which the eyes of the public are feasted in exhibitions , steps into a print shop on his way and demands the new carricatures ; after which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . Our beau takes a second breakfast in the coffee house , peruses the public papers , converses with his acquaintances , and arranges with them the parties of pleasure for the ensuing evening . About five he returns home . Here his valet de chambre assists him in adjusting his dress , in which he discovers much taste . Whilst this important business is going forward , he hastily looks over all the visiting cards that have been sent in during the day , and gives the necessary instructions upon this head . At seven he repairs to a genteel coffee house , if no pressing invitation to some grand entertainment call him another way ; or as is more frequently the case , betakes himself to a friend 's party , where he is always a welcome guest , and considered as a member of the family . AbOIP // nine he rises from the table in order to repair to the theatre , not to see the play which is now nearly over , ( for such a practice would be quite unfashionable , ) but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the ladies , to oi , le with strangers , or to range about the lobby with his friends , in quest of those fair ones , whose nets are always spread for gallants and guineas . Should he fortunately withstand these powerful temptations , he then repairs to a ball or rout about eleven , or to one of those splendid houses kept by certain women of fashion , who endeavour to retrieve the low state of their finances by play . About four in the morning he returns home , fatigued with his nocturnal excursions , and next day commences anew the same invariable round ' To one of my friends , ' continues Mr. Gzede , ' I owe the following outlines of the rural employments of an eminent En6lish statesman . He usually rises before seven in the morning . The first inatin hours are exclusively dedicated to scientific pursuits , in which particular he always observes a fixed methodical order . At ten o'clock he repairs to the breakast parlour where the whole family are assembled . The newspapers are then examined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proposed and arranged . About eleven they begin to separate . The gentleman mounts his horse , pays a visit to his tenants , traverses the circumjacent country , and in the course of two hours returns from his excursion . At this time his clients , and those who wish to converse with him upon business are in attendance . He usually consumes an hour with them in desultory conversation . It is now near two o'clock . The secretary makes his appearamice . The letters which are come to hand are perused , and the pecuniary transactions revised . The secretary receives his instructions , and an immediate reply to the most urgent letters is transmitted by the master himself . His domestic then waits *upon him and the ceremonials of dress are adjusted . When this business is despatched , the books and pamphlets sent in by the bookseller , are slightly turned over , and the more important articles are noted and reserved for subs quent use The hour of five is now past , and the gentleman repairs to the dining room , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends out of the neighborhood .

The ladies withdraw , and the gentlemen discuss political and agricultural subjects , &amp;c. while the bottle circulates till the hour of tea arrives , at which the lady of the house presides iii the drawing room . The news of the town , family occurrencs , . aud the modern productions *f French and En*lish literature , now become topics of discussion . The ladies arraign th. literary heroes of the day ; the *entlemen conduct their de // fence , or occasionally appear as their accusers . The literary performances , which lie upon the lady 's toilet , are produced by way of reference ; and passages are read aloud , wriich serve to refute or to corroborate an opinion already advanced . The lady some* times takes her seat at a side-table , and overlooks favorite musical compositions . An elegant supper is served up at eleven , and about midnight the company break up In such h armless amusements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived , however , that this arrangement is liable to many interruptions ; - when an illustrious visiter is expected , when the master of the house makes a rural excursion , or when he follows the chase .
