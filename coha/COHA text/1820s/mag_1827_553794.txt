txt ART . XII. - Russicsn Tales ; from the French of Count Xavier de . Maistre , . guthor of the Leper of host , ' *c. l2mo. pp. 197 . Philadelphia . H. C. Carey &amp; I. Lea . 1826 . THE two Tales , which compose this volume , belong to the series of productions , of which a favorable specimen was presented to the American public , about a year since , in the Leper of Aost , ' of which an account was given in this journal at the time of its appearance . They are from the pen of the Count Xavier de Maistre , a native of Piedmont , who , after having risen to the rank of general in the Russian service , is now living in retirement at St Petersburg . With two other tales , as yet untranslated , the three which have been now presented to the American public , in an English dress , constitute the Romantic works of the author . They have no pretensions to a rank among works of classical merit , and aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recommended by simplicity and nature . With the Leper of Aost , ' the public is already too well acquainted , to require another allusion to it in our pages . We incline to give the Tales , which compose this volume , a preference over that which preceded them ; and we can not forbear to mention , as an additional commendation , that a beautiful typographical execution is in harmony with the contents of the volume . We confess ourselves so much the slaves of prejudice , as to like a neat volume ; and have often thought we could enjoy the Waverley Novels , with a greater relish , if the American press had furnished us the first reprints of them in a style of publication , equal to that of the Russian Tales . ' The great attraction of these Tales ( at least of the first of them ) , though it might not be fair to say the chief merit , resides in the scene . A faithful description of Russian manners , on Russian ground ; the wastes of Siberia , the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of novelty . One is glad , at length , to escape from Portman Square and Bromley Park ; from the banks of the Garonne and the passes of the Apennines , and all the rest of the traditionary geography , whose charms or terrors have been immortalized , in a hundred novels and romances . The regions , which furnish the local habitation ' of these Tales , is not only new ground , but is in itself fertile of interest . Something of Oriental adventure attaches itself to whatever is Russian ; while the fairy frostwork ' of the North is superadded , with its glittering and brilliant imagery . // The first of the two Tales contained in the publication before us , is called the Prisoners of Caucasus . ' The scene is laid in the mountain fastnesses of the unsubdued tribes , that inhabit the spots , to which philosophers now trace the whole proud family of the ho ? no sapiens Europa*us , and where the most perfect models of female beauty are still supposed to be found . Count de Maistre has sketched this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with somewhat too sparing and rapid a hand . He traversed the region , at the head of his military command , and he has rather torn out a leaf of his book of surveys , than given us an amateur 's painting . But we pay him the best compliment in our power by adding , that what he has done in this way , has but increased our wish , that he had indulged himself freely in these delineations . We much mistake , if the few following sentences do not place the reader on a field of action , new , peculiar , and awakening the hope of adventure . The Mountains of Caucasus have for a long time been included within the limits of the Russian empire , without forming a part of its jurisdiction . Their uncivilized inhabitants , divided by interests and unconnected by language , form a cluster of small tribes , who have little political connexion , but are equally animated by a love of independence and a spirit of rapine . One of the most numerous and formidable of these tribes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little Kabarda ; two provinces , the high valleys of which extend to the summits of Caucasus . They are a handsome , spirited , intelligent people , but rapacious and cruel , and in a state of continual hostility with the " troops of the Line . " Under this latter name are comprehended several military posts , occupied by the Russian troops , between the Caspian and Black Seas , from the mouth of the Terek to the entrance of the Kuban . It is in the midst of these dangerous hordes , and in the centre of this immense range of mountains , that the Russian government has opened a road of communication with its Asiatic possessions . Redoubts , built at intervals , secure the road into Georgia ; but no traveller would be daring enough to traverse alone the intermediate space ; twice every week a convoy of infantry , with a few field pieces and a strong detachment of Cossacks , affords an escort to travellers and to the messengers of government . One of these fortifications , erected at the entrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peopled village ; and , from its commanding situation , it is called " Wladi-Caucasus " ( " Wladeti " signifying in the Russian language , to command , domineer ) ; and it is the residence of the officer ivh* // commands the troops engaged in the fatiguing service , which , has been briefly described . ' pp. 1:3-15 . We have not space to make copious extracts from this pleasing tale ; nor is it worth while to reduce it to a skeleton of an abstract . It is , as presented to us by the author , a compressed narrative . The incidents given are enough for a full sized romance , with no greater expansion Ehan the rules of art admit , and , to speak critically on the subject , the story is too full of adventure . The author , in the attempt to embody it in too small a compass , has not allowed himself sufficient room , either for scenery or unaracter , and has been obliged to leave some parts of the story too little rnotiv&amp; to please . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of cruelty , not requisite to finnish out the composition of Ivan 's character , nor seemingly requireil by anything else in the plot . With a little more care in the execution , it could have been avoided or shown to be necessary . We have indulged ourselves in these strictures , because we fear we shall have to bestow unqualified praise on Prascovia Lopouloff ; ' a tale every way meriting the attention of the reader , and sure to reward it . This is the name of the heroine , whose adventures form the subject of Madame Cottin 's charming romance . The incidents related in Count de Maistre 's work were matters of notoriety in Petersburg ; the residence and connexions of the author at that capital put it in his power to become acquainted with them , and the use made of the names of the imperial family , by a person of rank and character , is a sufficient guaranty for the authenticity of the facts . Here , then , is the real exploit , which , though it seems in Madame Cottin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet , in the authentic narrative , far more astonishing ; inasmuch as an humbler education , than that ascribed to Elizabeth , makes the conception of her design more extraordinary , on the part of the wonderful girl , who undertook and achieved it . it appears from this narrative , that when she left her home , to traverse the Russian empire , a distance of three thousand wersts , to ask her father 's pardon of the emperor , this poor female was unable to read or write . We freely confess , that Prascovia Lopouloff , ' although inferior in mere literary execution to Elizabeth , ' is , in our opinion of the matter , infinitely before it in character and interest . In all the points of difference , the advantage is decidedly in favor of Prascovia . ' Madame Cottin , fearing that the simple truth was neither // quite dramatic nor quite elevated enough , has given us rather more plot and a good deal more sentiment ; and it would be certainly churlish to quarrel with her eie*ant performance . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure ? There were but two possible ways , in which a severe taste could adroit of the treatment of this subject . It must either be told in its pure Doric simplicity , as Count de Maistre has told it , or it must be transfigured , by some Shaksperian power , beyond the reach of any common genius . Madame Couin , of course , could not think of this way of proceeding , and she has , therefore , sacrifi*ed the stern and chaste character of the truth , by addin0 to it the orcinary appendages of a novel . She has made of her subject a performance , which stands in somewhat the same relation to the reality ( and that is the work , not of Count de Maistre , but of Truth and Fact ) , as one of Ducis ' translations stands in , to the original of Shakspeare . As Quintilian tellS his pupil , that he may be sure of having made good progress , who delights in Cicero , we would say to all our youthful readers , into all whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unless they prefer Prascovia ' to Elizabeth , ' their taste needs correcting . The ingenious an ( l distinguished translator , who has favored the American public with the version of these Tales , has , in his Preface , alluded to another heroine as a conception unquestionably suggested by the adventures of Prascovia . He expresses himself in the following manner . A comparison of the " Heart of Mid Lothian , " and of " Prascovia Lopouloff , " may , at once , illustrate the difference between the texture of mere imaginary tales , and romantic stories which have the recommendation of truth , and place in a strong light the distinctive and preeminent talent of the author of the Waverley novels . Both heroines are represented as uneducated , and are alike lovely in their native excellence . Their undertakings are the noblest display of female heroism ; they come into contact with almost every class of society ; they address monarchs and ministers , encounter numerous toils and dangers , experience a great variety of fortune , and succeed beyond their hopes . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great novelist undertaken to write the history of the Russian heroine , he hardly could have avoided introducing probable though not actual events , fictitious incidents merely for the sake of their dramatic effect , and characteristic but extensive dialogues . Count Maistre was either conscious that he could not be successful in such amplification* of feeling , such developments of character and such art unravelling // of action , or , confining himself to the simple duty of a biographer , he preferred to interest by mere sketches , chalked out with a vigorous and steady hand . Perhaps Retsch might not , in so masterly a manner , have illustrated some scenes of Gothe 's Faustus , in finished engravings , as in his outlines . Yet , to real talent alone is it given to know the compass and strength of its own powers . ' pp . S-1O . These observations of M. de Wallenstein are just ; and the allusion to Retsch 's Sketches remarkably happy . Another inference also may be made from the comparison of Jeannie Deans with Prascovia , either in Count de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really achieved by the Russian heroine , was incomparably more arduous , than that ascribed to Jeannie Deans . The difference in point of distance , between the journey from Siberia to St Petersburg and that from Edinburgh to London , vast as is that difference , is but a single circumstance , in which the true exploit exceeds the fictitious . But how different is the effect of their treatment ; for more , far more than Count de Maistre has excelled Madame Cottin , does the purely fictitious Jeannie surpass even Prascovia . This is the triumph of creative , or as we have just called it , Shaksperian genius ; and though the simple and devoted heroism of the forlorn Siberian girl was unquestionably the model , on which Jeannie 's character was constructed , the production of the master mind exceeds even that of nature , in all the difference between an idealized statue and a portrait . To express all that we would say on this topic , we might compare Prascovia to a vigorous and faithful painting from life ; Elizabeth to what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those creations of the chisel or the pencil , where nature herself is outdone by the genius of her great lord , selecting , combining , and ennobling her most lovely features . We would not entirely dismiss this work , without a well deserved compliment to the success , with which the translation has been executed . Let the reader , who wishes to judge of this , and we will suppose him to be one of the well educated , accomplished young men , who talk of knowing French , Italian , and Spanish , on the score of being able to exchange a salutation in those tongues , let him make the experiment of translating an English book , into either of them , and submit his performance for revision to a native Frenchman , Italian , or Spaniard . The defects in language , in this version , are neither so numerous nor // so considerable , as may be found in most of the fashionable productions of the English literature of the day . Nor is mere grammatical correctness its sole merit . It is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of the literary character of the original . The tone of Count de Maistre 's mode of writing is one of its great merits , and this is very successfully reproduced by M. de Wallenstein.
