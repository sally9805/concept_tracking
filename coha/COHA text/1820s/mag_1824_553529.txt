txt ART . XXIII. - Reflections on the Politics of . lncient Greece , translated from the German of drnoid H. L. Heeren . Bx GEORGE BANCROFT. 8vo. pp. 350 . Cummings , Hilhard , &amp; Co . Boston . THIs volume , in the original , forms a portion of a large work , which is entitled Reflections on the Politics , Intercourse , and Commerce of the chief Nations of Antiquity . ' It appears to have been Mr Heeren 's intention to treat at equal length all the ancient nations of historical importance . As yet , however , he has accomplished his design only with respect to those of Asia and Africa . He has discussed the subject of the Persians , the Phenicians , the Babylonians , the Scythians , // the Indians , in Asia ; and in Africa , the Carthaginians and Egyptians . The present volume , forming a disconnected work on the Grecian Institutions , is all that has as yet appeared on any European nation ; and whether the learned and ingenious author will extend his researches to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gauls , Germans , and Britons , we have no information . The masterly execution of what has already appeared has long excited a wish , among those acquainted with these volumes , that the plan may be pursued in its full extent . Few writers , as we shall presently remark more at large , have better succeeded than Mr Heeren in treating questions of antiquity with the spirit of modern philosophical criticism . By this we are far from intimating , that he partakes of that skepticism , by which the authenticity of every account of the ancient world is made to depend upon its analogy with . what is passing around us . Mr Heeren , on the contrary , is rather a disciple of the old school ; or still more correctly , a prudent mediator between the bold speculations of some of his countrymen , and the credulous learning of the last* century . We propose to present our readers with a brief analysis of this volume , and a few remarks on some of its important statements . We are not sure whether the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and accurate notion of its contents . It embraces some subjects , which do not generally find a place under the head of politics ; and all that belongs to politics are not discussed . The translator has justly observed , that it is a series of essays , which relates solely to subjects connected with the political institutions of Greece , and may he regarded as an independent collection of separate historical sketches . ' In the general preliminary remarks some curious topics are briefly touched . One of them occurs in the very outset* and is the superiority of the European race over every other race of men . Conceding the superiority in natural gifts to other quarters of the earth , in everything which is the work of man , ' says the author , the nations of Europe stand far above those of the other continent . ' In Europe alone , * the // 392 April . institution of marriage has been brought to a state , in which it is the foundation of domestic life and virtue . Here slavery alone has been abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest improvements in arts and sciences , useful , ornamental , and speculative , have been made in Europe ; and though the East is undoubtedly the birthplace of many inventions , the credit which might be due to her , on that account , is more than counterbalanced by the barbarous infancy in which , notwithstanding these inventions , she has remained . It is an equivocal compliment , which has been sometimes paid to the Chinese , to say they preceded Europe in the knowledge of the art of printing , and of the Mariner 's Compass , when we consider the state of their literature and navigation , compared with that of the western nations . Our author will not even concede to the other continents a political or military reputation . Nor can we less admire that political 5uperiority , * says he , C which the nations of this small region , just emerging from the savage life , immediately established over the extensive countries of the large continents . The East has seen powerful conquerors ; but it was only in Europe that generals appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name . Hardly bad a kingdom in Macedonia of limited extent outgrown its childhood , before the Macedonians ruled on the Indus as on the Nile . The imperial city was the heiress of the imperial nation ; Asia and Africa prostrated themselves before the C*esars . Even in the centuries of the middle age , when the intellectual superiority of the Europeans seemed to have sunk , the nations of the East attempted to subjugate them in vain . The Mongolians advanced into Silesia ; nothing but the wastes of Russia remained for a time in their power ; the Arabs desired to overrun the West ; the sword of Charles Martel compelled them to rest contented with a part of Spain ; and the chivalrous Frank , under the banner of the cross , soon bade them defiance in their own home . And how did the fame of the Europeans extend its beams over the earth , when , through Columbus and Vasco de Gama , the morning of a fairer day began to dawn for them . The new world at once became their prey ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian sceptre ; merchants on the Thames and the Zuyder See seized on the government of India ; and if the Turks have thus far been successful in preserving the country , which they have robbed from Europe , will it remain to them forever ? Will it remain to them long ? ' pp. 2-3. // i8*24 . Politics of . flncient Greece . We suppose no one , upon the whole , will be inclined to deny the justice , with which the superiority of Europe is here maintained ; unless there may be some who think that Europe has only for two or three thousand years had its turn ; that the Eastern nations had theirs earlier , and attained a perfection , in many of the arts and improvements of life , of which the monuments have perished , and the tradition is lost ; that the European superiority seems to us decisive , because we survey it from a nearer point of view , while it is out of our power to take a station , from which we can penetrate to the unrecorded ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has something to recommend it , especially if we consider the forgotten greatness of the East , and the present predominance of Europe , as two acts only in the history of man . When we look forward to the future , new combinations of national character and national fortune seem to be rising up , in no very distant perspective . We fear the past history of the world does not favor the belief , that while such a vast development of energy is taking place in the continents of America , no diminution will result of that , which is in action in the old world . In Roman and Grecian antiquity , national character , glory , and power appeared necessarily to gather about one centre . The sceptre seemed literally to pass from one to another . Whether we seek the illustration in the fabulous traditions of the oldest empires , of the primitive conquerors of Thebes , and Babylon ; and the succession of Egyptian , Assyrian , and ' Chaldean dynasties ; or whether we confine our remarks to events more within the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Roman supremacies , it would seem not only that Asia , but the earth itself , could bear but one lord ; and that a high degree of eminence could be attained only by one political coininunity , at a time . In modern ages , the capacities of man are certainly widened . A spiritual religion , the art of printing , the perfection of navigation , and the institution of representative government , have given an extension to improvement unknown before . They have made it possible that several refined , powerful , cultivated nations should coexist , and what is still more , many of them exist in unpropitious natural positions . Cold , mountainous , and rocky regions // have become the abodes of those arts , which could not flourish in antiquity , but in a Hesperian or lonian climate . Still , however , there must be a limit to the multiplication of powerful nations ; and while political power and national wealth are increasing , with a rapidity we can hardly compute in this hemisphere , it is scarcely possible that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern . Perilous conflicts must in time follow , and vast rivalries grow up ; and in that condition of the world 's politics , it is plain that the complicated enginery of the old world must give way in the collision with the new . If this be a just view , Europe is hereafter , like Asia , to exhibit monuments where she now exhibits trophies , and furnish themes for speculation , not on national superiority , but national decline . Nevertheless , as it is rather safer to take the world as it is , and as it has been for the last four thousand years , it must be acknowledged that the European ascendency is a fact , deserving at least an attempt at an explanation . The following remarks are thrown out by our author , merely as a hint toward solving a problem , which , in its extent , is probably beyond the grasp of our minds . Here one important circumstance excites attention ; and yet a circumstance , of which the cautious inquirer hardly ventures to fix the value . Whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations of different , and almost always of dark color ; ( and , in so far as this determines the race , of different races ; ) the inhabitants of Europe belong only to one race . It has not now , and it never had , any other native inhabitants than the white nations. * Is the white man distinguished by gr*ater natural talents ? Has he by means of them an advantage over his colored brethren ? This is a question , which physiology can not answer , and to which history must reply with timidity . Who will directly deny , that the difference of organization , which we so variously observe to attend on the difference in color , can have an influence on the more rapid or more tardy unfolding of the mind ? But who can , on the other hand , demonstrate this influence , without first raising that secret veil , which conceals from us the reciprocal connexion between body and mind ? And yet we must esteem it probable ; and how much does this probability increase in strength , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the white nations in all ages // and countries have possessed , is a matter of fact , which can not be denied . It may be said , this was the consequence of external circumstances , which favored them more . But has this always been so ? And why has it been so ? And further , why did those darker nations , which rose above the savage state , attain only to a degree of culture of their own ; a degree , which was passed neither by the Egyptian nor by the Mongolian , neither by the Chinese nor the Hindoo ? And among them , why did the black remain behind the brown and the yellow ? If these observations can not but make us inclined to attribute a greater or smaller capacity to the several branches of our race , they do not on that account prove an absolute want of capacity in our darker fellow men , nor must they be urged as the sole cause . Thus much only is intended , that experience thus far seems to prove , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations of a clear color ; but we will welcome the age , which shall contradict experience in this point , and which shall exhibit to us cultivated nations of negroes. ' pp. 4-6 . After some general remarks on the geographical configuration of Europe at large , Mr Heeren treats that of Greece in particular , and this topic forms the subject of his first chapter . It ought ever to be borne in mind , in studying the history of any nation of antiquity , that its geographical features are of far greater importance than they usually are in modern nations . It is true , that in all ages , some geographical features are sufficient to decide the whole character of a country . A bar at the mouth of a river , a want or an abundance of harbors , an insular or a continental position , are all facts , in which the fate of nations has been wrapt up . In antiquity , without printing and without the compass , man was far more the creature of the spot on which he grew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vineyards , from almost imperceptible qualities of the soil , so in antiquity , the smallest circumstances of position , contiguity , and protection of mountain , river , or sea , decided the condition of countries . If any one cause be demanded for the lead taken by southern Greece , in the march of improvement , none could be so well fixed on as the triple row of mountains , by which it was defended from the incursions of the barbarians of the north . The difficult subject of the earliest condition of the Greeks is treated by our author in the second chapter . The traditions of antiquity on this point are well known to be so contradictory ; // and the relations of the Pelasgi and Hellenes to each other , and to the subsequent Greek race , are so unsettled , that few topics relative to Greece less reward the labor of research . Mr Heeren does not , in any part of his work , assume the office of the antiquary , and the greater portion of the section is occupied in marking the radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Doric and ionic races . This distinction , closely connected as it is with all effectual insight into Grecian history , literature , and art , must yet be assumed as an ultimate fact , insufficiently traced to any remote springs of national character . When it first bursts upon us , in the return of the Heraclid* , it is already strongly marked , energetic , ominous , or rather productive of revolution and convulsion ; and from that hour to the last of Grecian liberty , it was the hinge of all their politics . It was to them alone all that has ever been included in patrician and plebeian , Guelph and Ghibbeline , catholic and protestant , roundhead and cavalier , and whatever other names have prevailed in other nations , with or without any other principle , than that which leads men to quarrel , when honors and profits are few , and candidates many . In treating the original sources of the culture of the Greeks , the author has made fine remarks on their religion , and on the colonists from Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous , and the other of the borrowed improvements , in the period which transpired before a new political organization was formed , original , peculiar , healthy , com* petent to the production of great works and great characters . Though Mr Heeren does not dwell to much extent on the interesting subject of the mysteries , yet from his brief remarks , it xvould appear that he regards them , in what has ever appeared to us the most reasonable light , that of representations of those arts of civilized life , which prevailed at the periods , at which the mysteries were severally instituted , and designed at first as festivals , in honor of the divinity more immediately connected with the arts or improvements in question . There can be little doubt , that the Bacehic and Eleusinian mysteries had a primitive connexion with the introduction of the culture of the vine and of wheat ; nor that the oracle of Dodona , among the oaks of Epirus , had its origin in the periods , when those oaks afforded the suste // nance of the rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , however , are speculations into which Mr Heeren does not enter , and from which such of our readers as may have fallen into the hands of Gibelin or Dupuis will be glad to escape , even at the risk of running into the unnatural refinements of the Warburtonian school . The heroic age of Greece and the Trojan war form the subject of the next chapter . In hinting at the analogy of the heroic age of Greece , and the age of chivalry in modern Europe , we are satisfied that Mr Heeren has made a suggestion , capable of being pursued to the greatest advantage . As we read of the heroic ages in their great record , the poems of Homer , we are apt to regard it only as a ' pleasing fiction , and not even always entitled to that epithet . The poetical attributes of the heroes , their manners , their exploits , their characters , by turns extravagant , ridiculous , marvellous , in all the gradations of the romantic ; frbulous , insipid , and revolting , are apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny all reality to an original of which this is the delineation . But we learn to think more soberly and charitably of Grecian heroes arid ' their conflicts with wild beasts , their predht*ry ex&amp;ursions , piratieal expediti6ns , multitudi-. nous wooings , their contests and intercourse with gods , the rudeness of their language and barbarity of their manners , when we look into Tasso and Ariosto . Possessing contemporary and authentic accounts of the age of chivalry , we are not left to these last poems for all our information relative to the period , in which their action is laid . But supposing all other documents had perished , that Ariosto and Tasso were the only sources of our information of the age of chivalry , or the age immediately preceding , it is quite phin that ae fabu- ' Ions an air would hang over those ages , as over the heroic ages of Greece . They would have ' been found open to the objections resting of course on everything avowedly marvellous ; and even doubts would have arisen in regard to the most unquestioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sufficient to make men , at this day , give credit to the traditions of the manners and ' character of the age of knight errantry . Now ' of the heroic ' age of Greece , we know nothing but through the poems of // Homer and some similar sources . He no doubt gave some scope to his invention , and pretends only to a distant traditionary knowledge of the events he describes. * If then , the main picture , which he gives us of the life and character of the heroes , be different from any form of social existence now known , the analogy of the modern chivalrous times should teach us , at least , a modest skepticism with respect to its reality . Before quitting this topic we would briefly observe , that a form of social existence , nearer to us in time and place than the chivalrous ages of Europe , might furnish some analogies to illustrate the heroic age of Greece . We allude to the condition of our North American savages . The classical . reader needs not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greece with the natives of our woods* There are some striking points of resemblance in their institutions , manners , and organization . The ascendency acquired by personal prowess , independent of any official rank , the nature of the authority of the chief , the priestly character , the style o* hospitality in which the hero slays the animal and cooks the food , the delicacy with which the stranger is feasted before his errand is inquired for , the honor in which thieving is held , and numerous other points will suggest themselves to the curious inquirer , in which the heroic life reappears in our western forests. * We can not here but recal the observation of M. de Talleyrand , in a memoir to the Institute , in which the same conclusion is reached in another way . He observes that in travelling inward from the . Atlantic coasts to the west , you pass through those gradations of character , which in the old world are found only by travelling backward in the line of time . We do not think that fruit enough has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about the aborigines of Greece and Italy ; we see the accounts are exaggerated , incredible , fabulous ; and we exclude the period , to which they refer , from the range of authentic history . But here in Amerca , we are brought in contact with tribes , from the nature of the case , nearly similar ; and we have no doubt , that a philosophical examination of their peculiarities would reduce within credible limits many of the wild tales of classical antiquity . * iliad IJ. 486. // Nor must it be inferred that the heroic age of Greece is too much degraded by the comparison ; for though we maintam that the heroic age was an age of barbarism , yet barbarism , like civilization , has its degrees . They are not themselves different degrees of the same thing . There appears to be an essential difference between them , x*hich makes the highest point of barbarism a very different thing from a low degree of civilization . Nations , who must be called barbarous , like the Mexicans , have carried some human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet the peasant in civilized countries possesses some points of superiority over any hero of the Iliad , or Inca of Peru . Though we think , therefore , the heroic life in Greece will hear a comparison with the life of our Northern American savages , inasmuch as both fall under the class of barbarous ; yet the Agamemnons and 1-lectors are certainly before the Redjackets and Tecurnsehs ; whether they are before the Logans would bear an argument . Mr Heeren next treats of the Period succeeding the Heroic . ilge ; of the Emigrations from Greece ; and the Origin and Gkaracter of the republican Forms of Government . Regarding Homer as having lived within this period , a brief discussion succeeds of the subject of his personality , and the effect of the poetry which bears his name , on his countrymen . Mr Heeren only alludes , and with the greatest impartiality , to those discussions among his neighbors and colleagues in Germany , relative to the authenticity of these renowned poems . This no doubt may be ascribed to the deep share of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contest , which this subject excited about thirty years ago in Germany , and to which we have made some allusion , in our review of Mr Heeren 's life of Heyne , in an early volume of the former series of this journal . The following observations on the subject , we are persuaded will interest our readers ; the fact mentioned , at the close of the extract , will probably be new to many of them . Under such circumstances it is intelligible , that when a sublime poetic genius arose among a people so fond of poetry and song as the lonians always were , the age was favorable to him ; although the elevated creations of his mind must continue to appear wonderful . There are two things , which in modern times appear most // remarkable and difficult of explanation ; how a poet could have first conceived the idea of so extensive a whole , as the Iliad and the Odyssey ; and how he could have composed them , how he could have executed works of such extent , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing . With regard to the first point , criticism has endeavored to show , and has succeeded in showing , that these poems , especially the Iliad , possess by no means that perfect unity , which they were formerly believed to possess ; that rather many whole pieces have been interpolated or annexed to them ; and there hardly exists at present an inquiring scholar , who can persuade himself , that , we possess them both in the same state , in which they came from the hands of the poet . But notwithstanding the more or less frequent interpolations , each has but one primary action ; which , although it is interrupted by frequent episodes , could hardly have been introduced by any but the original author ; and which does not permit us to consider either of these poems as a mere collection of scattered rhapsodies . It is certainly a gigantic step , to raise epic poetry to the unity of the chief action ; but the idea springs from the very nature of a narration ; and therefore it did not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age ; genius was able of itself to take this step . Herodotus did something similar in the department of history . We find it still more difficult to comprehend how works of this extent could have been planned and executed without the aid of an alphabet , and preserved , probably for a long time , till they were finally saved from perishing by being committed to writing . We will not here repeat at large , what has already been said by others ; that a class of singers , devoted exclusively to this business , could easily preserve in memory much more ; that the poems were recited in parts , and therefore needed to be remembered only in parts ; and that even in a later age , irhen the Homeric poems had already been entrusted to writing , the rhapsodists still knew them so perfectly , ( as we must infer from the Ion of Plato , ) that they could readily recite any passage which was desired . But let us be permitted to call to mind a fact , which has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves , that poems of even greater extent than the Iliad and the Odyssey can live in the memory and mouths of a nation . The Dschangariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in length , as much as it stands beneath them in merit ; * and yet it exists only * See on this subject B. Bergmann , Nomadische Streifereyen unter den Kalmycken . B. 2 , S. 213 , &amp;c . This Calmuck Homer flourished in the last century . He is said to have sung three hundred and sixty cantos ; but this number may be exaggerated . Of the singers , called Dschaugartschi , it is not // 1824. in the memory of a people , which is not unacquainted with *riting . But the songs of a nation are probably the last things , which are committed to writing , for the very reason that they are remembered . ' p. 1i4-1i6 . The next chapter treats of the Aleans of preserving i ! lte National Character ; and the remarks on the Amphictyonic Councils are particularly instructive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here too the Aziieri. ' * can student of history will find , in his own country , the aptest illustrations of the effect on the Grecian character of their united efforts against the Persian invaders . The war of 1776 is the Trojan war of America ; it brought the colonies into united action , and hound them together as members of a whole ; and even the last war with England , however the analogy may fail in other respects , had an effect scarcely less powerful , in concentrating the energy , crushing the parties , and raising the spirit of the people . The political tone* on all sides in this country , was comparatively 16w till this crisis . The reciprocal disputes about British and French influence can not now he read , hy a highminded American , without a blush . It is since the peace of December , 1814 , that the country has begun to raise its crest among the nations ; that it is quoted , feared , and courted al*road . We are well persuaded that , in our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bearing and effect of things , the war of 1812 will he found to be the Persian war of our country . What the Persian war was to Greece , is briefly told in the . following sentences . Thus the people of Hellas , by means of this war , appeared among the nations in the splendor of victory . They were now permitted to look around in tranquil security ; for who would venture to attack them ? The eastern world obeyed th' humbled Persian ; in the North , the kingdom of Macedonia had not yet begun its career of conquest ; and Italy , still divided into small states , did not as yet contain a victorious republic . The period was therefore come , in which Greece could unfold all its youthful vigor ; poetry and the fine arts put forth their blossoms * . the philosophic easy to find one , who knows more than twenty by heart . In the fourth part of his work , Mr Bergmann has given us a translation of one of them , which is about equal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no uncommon thing for the Calmuck singers to retain in memory a poem quite us long as the Iliad or Odyssey . // 402 April , mind contemplate itself in tranquillity ; and in public spirit , the several cities vie with each other in generous competition . A nation does not need peace and tranquillity , to become great ; but it needs the consciousness , that it is possessed of strength to gain peace and tranquillity . ' p. 149 . The Constitutions of the Grecian States are next discussed . The topic is various , perplexed , and difficult in some points to explain . But Mr Heeren has treated it with great success ; and the best read student will rise from the chapter with instruction . The readers of Mitford particularly will feel relieved from some of that melancholy , which his able work inspires , by its dark pictures of the effect of free institutions . The Political Economy of the Greeks , which forms the topic of the tenth chapter , has , since the publication of Mr Heeren 's work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , by Professor Boeckh of Berliu. * Still , however , the chapter in Mr Heeren 's Reflections will be read with advantage , even by those acquainted with the work of Mr Boeckh . Our limits do not permit us to enter into the discussion of any of the interesting topics brought forward in this chapter . We should , however , like the opinion of the assessors of the city of Boston of the feasableness of the usage hinted at , in the following passage and note appended to it by Mr Heeren . Taxes on property are attended with one great difficulty , that they can not be apportioned out without a knowledge of the fortunes of each contributor . But they depend also more than any other on correctness of moral sentiment , and on public spirit . Where these exist , ( and they can nowhere more prevail , than in such civil comi-nunities as the Grecian states , ) there is no need of returns on the part of those who are to be taxed , nor of any inquisition on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contributor ; and examples may be found in history , of states in which even a suspicion of any insincerity was almost unheard of.t In the Grecian cities , at least in Athens , very severe measures were in the later periods made use of against those , who were suspected of concealing the true state of their fortunes , or * Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener , vier B*cher von August Boeckh . Q. Svo. t As in several of the late German imperial towns . The author is acquainted with one , in which the contributions were thrown into a box , unexamined ; and yet the amount of the whole was previously known , with almost perfect oxactuess. ' // whom it was desired to vex in that manner . They could be compelled to exchange their property for the sum at which they had estimated it . But in better times , such measures , though perhaps permitted , seem never to have been usual . ' p. 208-209 . The Judicial Institutions and the . Llrmy and . JV'avy of the Greeks form the subjects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go deeper into the first , which is an intricate subject , Sir William Jones 's Is*eus will prove a valua*. ble source of information . However justly we may complain of the perplexity , which involves the accounts left us of the Athenian Courts , we venture to say , that a foreigner would sooner obtain a clear idea of their organization , than of the single point of the difference between the courts of Chancery and of law in England . The thirteenth chapter On the Statesmen and Orators of Greece is that , which will be perused with most interest by the general reader . We exclude the remarks to which it might otherwise give occasion , for the sake of gratifying our readers with the character of Demosthenes , as it is contained in the following extract . Nothing would be more superfluous , than the desire of becoming the eulogist of that master in his art , whom the united voice of so many centuries has declared to be the first ; and whose worth , the only rival whom antiquity placed by his side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally honorable to both . We would not here speak of Demosthenes the orator , but of Demosthenes the statesman ; and of him only as far as the man , the orator , and the statesman were most intimately connected in him . His political principles came from the depths of his soul ; he remained true to his feelings and his convicti6ns , amidst all changes of circumstances and all threatening dangers . Hence he was the most powerful of orators ; because with him there was no surrender of his convictions , no partial compromise , in a word , no trace of weakness . This is the real essence of his art ; everything else was but secondary . And in this how much does he rise above Cicero ! And yet who ever suffered more severely than he for his greatness ? Of all political characters , Demosthenes is the most sublime and purest tragic character , with which history is acquainted . When , still trembling with the vehement force of his language , we read his life in Plutarch ; when we transfer ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by a deeper interest , than can be excited by any hero of the epic muse or of tragedy . From his first appearance , till the moment when he swallows poison in the temple , we see him contending against destiny , which seems // to mock him with malignant cruelty . It throws him to the ground , but never subdues him . What a current of emotions must have poured through his manly breast amidst this interchange of reviving and expiring hopes . How natural was it , that the lines of melancholy and of indignation , such as we yet behold in his bust , should have been imprinted on his severe countenance ! Hardly had he passed the years of youth , when he appeared in his own bel*alf as accuser of his faithless guardians ; from whom , however , he was able to rescue only a small part of his patrimony . In his next attempts , insulted by the multitude , though encouraged by a few who anticipated his future greatness , he supported an obstinate contest with himself , till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared once more as an accuser in public prosecutions , before he ventured to speak on the affairs of the state . But in the very first of his public speeches we see the independent statesman , who not dazzled by a splendid project , opposes a vast undertaking . When Philip soon after displayed his designs against Greece , by his interference in the Phocian war , he for the first time appeared against that monarch in his first Philippic oration . From this period he had found the great business of his life . Sometimes as counsellor , sometimes as accuser , sometimes as ambassador , he protectect the independence of his country against the Macedonian policy . Splendid success seemed at first to reward his exertions . He had already won a number of states for Athens ; when Philip invaded Greece , he had already succeeded not only in gaining over the Thebans , hut in kindling their enthusiasm ; when the day of Chreronea dashed his hopes to the earth . But he courageously declares in the assembly of the people , that he still does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An unexpected incident changes the whole aspect of things . Philip falls the victim of as sassination ; and a youth , who as yet is but little known , is his successor . Immediately Demosthenes institutes a second alliance of the Greeks ; but Alexander suddenly appears before Thebes ; the terrible vengeance , which he here takes , instantly destroys the league ; Deniosthenes , Lycurgus , and several of their supporters , are required to be delivered up ; but Demades is at that time able to settle the difficulty and to appease the king . His strength was therefore enfeebled , as Alexander departed for Asia ; he begins to raise his head once more , when Sparta attempts to throw off the yoke ; but under Antipater he is overpowered . Yet it was about this very time , that by the most celebrated of his discourses he gained the victory over the most eloquent of his adversaries ; and IEschines was forced to depart from Athens . But this seems only to have the more embittered his enemies , the leaders of the Macedonian party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his downfall . When Harpalus , a fugitive from the army of Alexander , came with his treasures to Athens , and the question arose , whether he could be permitted to remain there , Demosthenes was accused of having been corrupted by his money , at least to be silent . This was sufficient to procure the imposition of a fine ; and as this was not paid , he was thrown into prison . From thence he succeeded in escaping ; but to the man who lived only for his country , exile was no less an evil than imprisonment . He resided for the most part in iEgina and at Trcezen , from whence he looked with moist eyes towards the neighboring Attica . Suddenly and unexpectedly a new ray of light broke through the clouds . Tidings were brought , that Alexander was dead . The moment of deliverftnce seemed at hand ; the excitement pervaded every Grecian state ; the ambassadors of the Athenians passed through the cities ; Demosthenes joined himself to the number , and exerted all his eloquence and power to unite them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people decreed his return ; and years of sufferings were at last followed by a day of exalted compensation . A galley was sent to IEgina to bring back the advocate of liberty . All Athens was in motion ; no magistrate , no priest remained in the city , when it was reported that Demosthenes was advancing from the Pira*us . Overpoxvered by his feelings , he extended his arms and declared himself happier than Alcibiades ; for his countrymen had recalled him , not by compulsion , but from choice . It was a momentary glimpse of the sun , which still darker clouds were soon to conceal . Antipater and Craterus were victorious ; and with them the Macedonian party in Athens ; Demosthene* and his friends were numbered among the accused , and at the instigation of Demades were condemned to die . They had already withdrawn in secret from the city ; but where could they find 3 place of refuge ? Hyperides with two others took refuge in A*gina in the temple of Ajax . In vain ! they were torn away , dragged before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island Calauria in the vicinity of Trcezen ; and took refuge in the temple of Neptune . It was to no purpose , that Archias , the satellite of Antipater , urged him to surrender himself under promise of pardon . He pretended he xvished to write something ; bit the quill , and swallowed the poison contained in it . He then veiled himself , reclining his head backwards , till he felt the operation of the poison . " 0 Neptune ! " he exclaimed , " they have defiled thy temple ; but honoring thee , I will leave it while yet living . " But he sank before the altar , and a sudden death separated him from a world , which , after the fall of his country , contained no happiness for him . Where shall we find a character of more ginadear , and purity than that of Demosthenes ? ' pp. 27*-281 . .

They are all filled with ingenious and learned observations , and leave a most lively impression on the reader 's mind . The character of Thucydides is beautifully drawn , but we must refer to the volume itself for that and several other admirable sketches . Mr Bancroft deserves the public thanks for translating this volume . He has observed , in the preface , that the translator 's task is an humble one . It may be made so ; but it is not necessarily so . This translation implies a command , not only of the German language , such as few possess , but an accomplishment of still greater value , a good knowledge of the English tongue . Nor could it have been executed , but by a person conversant with the large range of classical learning , which the work embraces . To make a translation of such a work , and as this is made , is no humble exploit . We should be much rejoiced , and think it auspicious of good to the literature of the country , if Mr Bancroft should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate the rest . The whole would form a treatise on antiquity different from any , with which we are acquainted , and better calculated , than any other , to give to general readers accurate knowledge of the institutions of Egypt , Persia , India , Carthage , and the other nations , which are described by Mr Heeren . This gentleman holds a place , in the front rank of the professors at G6ttingen , is one of the most esteemed German writers of the present day , is a correspondent of the National Institute of France , and worthy of the fame which he enjoys at home and abroad . It does America credit that she has made to English literature the accession of a volume like this ; and we venture to say , that the circulation among us of the whole of Mr Heeren 's Reflections , ' would visibly elevate the standard of knowledge , in the interesting department to which it belongs . No one in the country is better qualified for the enterprise than Mr Bancroft , and we should be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial pledge that he will undertake it .
