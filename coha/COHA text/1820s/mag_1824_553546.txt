By the Author of the Ruins of Pa*stum. 8vo. pp. 84 . Salem , 1824 . Cushing &amp; Appleton . As the book , which bears the first of these titles , made its appearance two years ago , we are not sure that we do not owe our readers an apology for not having noticed it earlier . We should ill fulfil the task we have undertaken , were we to neglect the principal works of this kind , which are published in our own country . We might also obtain credit for sterner natures than we really possess , were we not occasionally won upon to pause amidst our severer labors , and notice those early blossoms , which the spring time of our literature is throwing out along our path . It is , certainly , no uninteresting or unphilosophical speculation to watch the progress of our poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have read this volume with pleasure and interest . In addition to that strong sense of natural beauty , without which no man can be a poet , there is shown throughout a vein of true pathos , without which the most splendid poetry soon grows tiresome . The sentiments are often fine and striking ; always just , noble , and generous . With these qualities is associated a deep , natural , and unaffected admiration of whatever great and excellent the genius of man has produced in the fine arts . The remains of antiquity ; the wonders of architecture and sculpture , which are left as the vestiges of a mighty race , that has long passed away ; the works of modern masters , and the productions of contemporary talent , are alike the objects of this warm and liberal enthusiasm . Where so many of the elements of poetry are present , we can not hut regret that any cause should mar , in the slightest degree , that perfection and harmony into which they should mingle . We are at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is one which the author may easily remove . A little of the lime labor , a stricter attention to the niceties of poetical diction , and a more painful revision of weak passages , would do much towards freeing the poetry of our author // from the imperfections to which we allude . All readers of poetry know how much of its excellence lies in the language ; how much of the strength and distinctness of the impression depends upon the way in which it is communicated . There are expressions , which act like a spell upon the imagination and the passions , when the same general idea , conveyed in other combinations of words , shall leave the imagination ungratified and the heart unaffected . The defect of which we now speak is most perceptible in the author 's narrative poems . He seems , if we may judge from the style of these pieces , to have read one of the most delightful and fascinating of the English poets , the author of the Seasons , with all that attention which his beautiful pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , at the same time , he has contracted something of his diffuse , inverted diction , and foreign idiom . Of all styles in the world this is least adapted to narration . There is , perhaps , as much truth in the following maxim of Boileau , as in any general rule of criticism ever laid down . Soyez vif et press* , dans vos narrations . The general effect of any narrative is made up of a multitude of particular impressions on the mind , resulting from the particular incidents related . It is the business of the author to see that these impressions succeed each other in such a manner , that the new one shall be made before the last is effaced , and that each shall contribute to heighten and help forward those that follow . Whatever tends to weaken these impressions , whatever withdraws the attention from the particular incidents , diminishes the main interest of the narrative . An inverted style , by occupying the reader with the search of a meaning , and a diffuse style , by wasting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of the story , tend of course to distract the attention and impair the general effect . An elaborate magnificence of diction , overlaying the merely narrative parts of a poem , is like a load of costly drapery about the limbs of a competitor in the foot race . * The author , in one of the notes to his work , ingenuously acknowledges , that the greatest part of the volume was hastily composed . We could find it in our hearts to blame him // for this haste , were it not that the amiable and frank spirit , which pervades the work , makes us reluctant to blame him for anything . He will , at least , pardon us for expressing our opinion , that all authors of what are called works of taste , should set out with a resolution never to come hastily before the public . There is a respect due to the literary world , which should restrain an author from publishing his work , before he has made it as perfect as he is able ; in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves into a polite assembly with a long beard , an unbrushed coat , and dirty hoots . Besides , the advantages of a careful revision are so many and so important , as to render it matter of surprise that any class of authors , particularly the poets , should ever neglect them . It is true , that if the kiigh state of mental excitement , requisite for the writing of poetry , could be kept up from the beginning to the end of a production of any tolerable length ; if all the parts could be written with the same glow of inspiration , it might be better for the work that , the author should not tamper too freely with what had been so felicitously and forcibly struck out . But all poems will have their languid passages , the moment of exhaustion always arrives too soon , and often a stubborn idea refuses to be happily expressed . For these evils there is no remedy but revision ; the weak passages may be strengthened ; the original excitement may be recalled ; a lucky moment may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least What can not be entirely dispensed with may be rendered more tolerable by being abridged . From this charge of haste , however , the Ruins of Pa*stum , the first and largest poem in the collection , and in our opinion the best , must , in justice to the author , be exempted . It is full of beautiful images and fine thoughts . It is a series of reflections suggesting themselves to a beholder of those wonderful and venerable ruins , the remains of fabrics whose founders are unknown , but which still offer models of architecture to the world . The following brief outline , with the extracts we shall give , will enable our readers to judge both of the plan and the execution . The poem opens with a reflection upon the oblivion into which , to the confusion of human pride , the builders of those mighty edifices have fallen , the works of whose hands have // for so many ages survived even the memory of their names . The history of Pinstum is then briefly traced , from the Phuenician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes and changes of inhabitants , till the Roman Eagle seized The double prey , and proudly perched on high ! And here a thousand years he plumed his wings ; - Till from his lofty cyry , tempest tost , And impotent through age , headlong he plun* , ed , While nations shuddered as they saw him fall . ' p. 8 . The decay and desertion of Piestum followed in the night of barbarism , that succeeded the northern invasion , and the particulars of its decline are involved in the darkness of that period . The author then passes to the consideration of the individual fortunes of those by whom these solitudes were once peopled . The joys and sorrows of the children of that ancient race were like those of the men of our own time . Crimes were perpetrated , and great and good actions performed from age to age on this spot , which is now so desolate , and both alike are now forgotten . The attachments of domestic life were with them , as with us , the causes of happiness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts Of mothers wailing o'er their offspring dead , Whose graves the blossoms of the infant year Adorned ! and how have tears , at each return Of eve or morn , constant bedewed the turf Where mouldering the endeared mothers lay ! And by the twinkling light of star , or moon 's Pale beam-that moon whose mellow light now wraps This shadowy scene subduing all to peaceWhat thousand amorous vows in secret here Were pledged-reciprocated vows-ofttimes Conferring bliss , yet oft dissolved in air . ' p. 13 . Yet this race , with all their enjoyments and their sufferings , their virtues and their vices , are passed away ; they lie under the fertile spot they once possessed , and these old and , mighty ruins are their monument . These ruins too shall perish ; Yet Nature here In youth 's perpetual bloom shall still survive ; The hills still echo to the shepherd 's song ; // The groves , the green retreats of happier times , Shall lift their sacred tops amid the heavens ; And still these streams shall flow , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , too , amid the waste , with blush of morn , Breathing Sabean sweets , still lonely blooms , And shall forever bloom , thy lonely rose , Oh , Pa*stum ! ' p. 18 . The author closes his poem with an apostrophe to his country , of which we give the following lines . When shall that day come ? When shall thy homesick mariner from far Descry upon thy promontories bold , And seabeat coasts* the colonnade sublime Glittering like Pharos in the moon 's bright beams ? When shall thy isles their temples boast , and when Thy groves majestic , to the favored few Reveal the sculptured glories they o'ershade ? When mid thy Parian quarries shall be seen The marble wonder starting into life ? When , too , to honor thy illustrious sons , Shall Genius bid the glowing canvass breathe ? And when , oh when , shall bards like those of old , To distant times their deathless names convey ? Yet come it will ! the day already dawns ! I see its bright precursors-rosy clouds , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zenith shot . And look ! e'en now It trembles on the sea 's broad verge-now mountsOh , glorious view ! the conscious ocean smiles ; Wave their high tops the pines ; the vales rejoice ; And grateful nations hail the eternal day ! ' p. 20 . Enda Mohatink , ' and the Deserted Wreck , ' the two poems which follow , can not , for reasons already given , be considered as very perfect specimens of narrative poetry . Yet they are written with so much feeling , and so true a sympathy , that in reading them , we must regret that any fault of manner should lessen the interest they might otherwise excite . A variety of miscellaneous poems follow , of different degrees of merit , among which that entitled , I thought it slept , ' seems to us particularly beautiful . // There is also a collection of Sonnets , from which we extract the following , not only on account of its intrinsic elegance , but because it gives us the opportunity of transferring to our pages a just compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Aliston ! thy name dear to the enlightened few Who dare , even here , in this thy native clime , Where genius pines amid the public view , Predict the triumph of thy art sublimeAliston ! even here thy name shall loud resound In happier times , and not as now , alone In wondering foreign lands be echoed round . Ah happier times I would ye were our own ! Still nobly emulous of those sons of art , Who once the admiring eyes of Greece and Rome Around them drew , exalting every heartStill dare aspire and mount to Fame 's bright home . Thus the young eagle from some rock 's vast height Proudly looks down , then soars to endless light . ' The last poem in the collection , entitled Tockwallerdon , reciting an instance of great generosity and heroism in an Indian youth , is the best specimen of narrative poetry in the volume . With the exception of a few passages evidently composed in haste , it is abundantly spirited and impassioned . We had written thus far , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . duthor of the Ruins of Pa3stum , was put into our hands . In addition to the poem , which gives a name to the collection , it contains several miscellaneous compositions in blank verse , all partaking largely of the same interesting qualities , which pervade the volume we have just noticed . We are glad to see in it so many proofs , that the author has employed to good purpose the interval which has elapsed since his first appearance before the public . He shows a greater confidence in his own powers , and more compactness and vigor of thought ; and his numbers flow with a more easy and varied modulation . We find too that he has in some measure anticipated our criticisms on his style , and several of the poems in the present collection show , that he has projected certain important changes in his poetical dialect . There is more force and directness , and less of corn- // July , monpiace in his phraseology . There is not such an expression as fair science ' in the whole book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not called for by any of the exigencies of blank verse , which put the reader in a sort of despair to know the agent from the object . The poem entitled . /Ithens describes a view of the ruins of that city from the Museum hill , and sets before us the surrounding country , with its picturesque scenery and glorious recollections . We are , however , less pleased with it than with several of the smaller pieces of a pathetic cast , among which are the Ocean Travellers , Florello , Daphne , and Alphonso . We give the following passage from the poem entitled Daphne , because we believe our readers will be pleased with its soft and sober beauty , and because it will help them to understand what we mean , when we speak of the improvement in our author 's poetical diction . Softly I tread the mazy labyrinth , lest The rustling noise should interrupt the deep And fearful stillness here . T is thus amid The forest wilds , when Autumn cro*vns , as now , The plenteous year , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads his way , And , with a step cautious as Guilt , pursues The timid chase . But what shall I alarm In these deserted haunts , where none of choice Repair , save those whom wretchedness has taught After long toil to seek for refuge here ? The mole has burrowed deep and heeds me not , The bat has ta'en his headlong flight in search Of gentler skies , or nestles in some Jane And covered nook , while at my feet sleep those , Whom not the crash of worlds shall wake again . ' p. 58 . There is a brightness and warmth of coloring about the piece entitled Spring , which suits well with the bloom , and cheerful hopes of the season it describes . We take the liberty in this place to hint to the author a trifling fault in the mechanism of his verse . We have noticed several lines ending with an unaccented word or syllable , as in the following instances ; Immortal streams , on your loved banks reposed , And still at dewy eve or morn , shadowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methought I glad alighted on an Isle Laved by the violet waves , that seemed to my Astonished mind a place of pure delights , ' &amp;c. p. 28 . We take this practice to be hardly allowable , because it breaks down all the distinctions made by the ear between blank verse and prose , and leaves the reader only the barren gratification of beholding the words ranged in lines of apparently similar lengths . While we are upon this subject we would observe , that the license sometimes taken by our author of giving an additional syllable to the end of a line , is liable , from its unexpectedness , to a similar objection . It is indeed used liberally in dramatic poetry ; and in a kind of composition so little removed from prose , it has been thought to have a good effect , as giving the versification something of a free and colloquial air . But we are greatly mistaken if it does not strike the ear with a disagreeable harshness , when met with in other kinds of poetry , and accordingly most writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of gratitude to the author for the pleasure the perusal of them has afforded us . In the mean time , should he continue to pursue the unprofitable vocation of poetry , we would exhort him never to be seduced by any feeling of lassitude to refuse its labors . Let him apply his talents to the severe tasks it imposes , and he will be sure of obtaining its rewards . No species of composition requires a more perfect abstraction of mind than the writing of poetry , nor tasks the faculties to a more intense and vigorous exertion . When Parnassus is to be scaled , the palm is to him who cii*nbs boldly and directly up its steeps ; he who would pick out a safe way among the precipices , and sidle slowly and comfortably along in a circuitous path , will never reach the summit . The mighty and enduring edifices , whose remains our author has celebrated , were not built without immense toil ; and all that is great and lasting in literature has been produced by strength attacking and overcoming difficulty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
