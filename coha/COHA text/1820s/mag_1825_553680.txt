THE interest of this discourse is not confined to the events commemorated by the preacher , as having been remarkable in the history of the Church in Brattle Square , but is increased by an account of the life and actions of men , who have held important stations in society , and been ornaments to their country . Among the clergymen , successively at the head of that church , have been men not only of the highest theological and literary rank , but who have exercised a wide influence over the political and social concerns of the community . Dr Colman , the first pastor , was a correspondent of bishop badly , Dr Watts , and bishop Kennett ; he was the medium through which benefactions to a large amount for Harvard College were received from Holden and Hollis ; and he was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses on the affairs of the colony . He died in 1747 . Mr Palfrey speaks of him in the following manner . Among the worthies of the Massachusetts clergy , we can perhaps select no character , which we may regard with more thorough esteem , than that of Dr Colman ; and not much more may be said of any man . If his mind was not of that class , by which great revolutions are produced in the intellectual or social world it was still one of uncommon comprehensiveness , penetration , wisdom , and activity ; and it had been cultivated by an enlarged acquaintance with books and men . His writings , besides giving token to a liberal spirit , a well disciplined understanding , various knowledge , and a warm heart , show , for the period in which they were produced , a remarkable acquaintance with the true beauties of composition . To nature and to opportunity he was probably alike indebted for a manly and winning address . Yet , formed as he was for the admiration of a community like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he rose above the ambition of being eminent , to the ambition of being useful . With all his powers to impress and attract , he was not a man to be content with the notoriety , which consists in being followed by the tasteful , and applauded by the talkative . Like every other man , who thinks it better to be serviceable than to be flattered , he gave himself much to occupations , of which fame takes no cognisance . He was industrious , as every man needs to be , who would make // himself felt while he lives , and remembered when he dies . He possessed a truly kind heart , as is shown by his generous treatment of Mather , a man , whose character , intellectual and moral , has been sometimes astonishingly overrated ; by his constant affection for his colleague , whose views were sometimes different from his own , and who was not a person very easy to differ from without estranging ; and by the truly parental attachment , which , after his colleague 's death , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal public spirit , and of active and enlarged benevolence . The poor of his charge always found in him a brotherly attention to their wants . The town was his debtor for improvements , which he hazarded his popularity to effect . The College , besides owing , in a great part , to his influence the brilliant presidency of Leverett , and the bounty of the Hollises and Holdens , was indebted to him through a course of years for various services , not more honorable and important than laborious . He was animated by the distinguishof Christian philanthropy and desire ing 51 ) iI'it , . d to ( 10 extensive goo ( l to the souls of men . It was at his instance , that this Church and others of the town , voted to make a contribution , twice in each year , to form what was called an Evangelical Treasury , ( levoted to the extension of the knowledge and influence of religion . He was a man , finally , of true piety , proved in a series of domestic trials , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zealous services of a successful ministry , and by the unih ) rm tenor of a sober , righteous , and godly life . ' pp. 11-13 . For many years William Cooper was colleague with Dr Colman , and they were both succeeded by Samuel Cooper , so much distinguished for the active part he took in the early scenes of the Revolution . The ministry of Samuel Cooper , * says Mr Palfrey , had but just begun , when he lost the friendship and counsel of his and his father 's venerable associate . He was a young man of great promise , which his subsequent life in no degree discredited . He had been known to the society from his childhood . He had had the advantage of the prayers , instructions , and example of a most pious and watchful parent . He had come from college with a blameless character and a high literary reputation , and he had inherited his father 's place in the heart of the venerable shepherd of the flock . He had not begun to pieach , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office ; but partly , as it seems , through the influence of Dr Colman , he was invited to officiate here as soon as his studies should be completed . Decen ) ber 31 , 1744 , he was elected colleague pastor ; and having made a request similar to his father*s on the like occasion , was ordained , and entered on the active duties of his cure in the second following year , May 21 , 1746. // The life of Dr Cooper was one of various and conspicuous usefulness . His education , from the first , had been a suitable preparation for eminence ; nor were his advantages wasted on an unpromising subject . Nature had marked him out for a leading man . Acuteness , vivacity , versatility , decision , and the capacity of severe application , were prominent characterisiics of his mind . In addition to a person uncommonly dignified and engaging , and a most melodious voice , he possessed in remarkable perfection what seemed a natural fluency and grace , and he had cultivated the arts of writing and speaking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively learned , he was , however , familiar with the best writers , and was always found in possession of the information which the exigency required . To less uncommon endowments , he joined an address , and what is called a talent for affairs , which , if he had not been the leading divine , would perhaps have distinguished him as the most accomplished gentleman and adroit statesman of his country and time . He filled the clerical office at a period , when it had not ceased to be understood to give the right and opportunity to exert an important influence in public affairs ; and in the revolutionary movements of this quarter , he had an agency scarcely second to any man ' 5 . He was the confidential friend of Adams , Hancock , and other leading spirits of the time . It was to him that the famous letters of Hutchinson were transmitted , which kindled such a flame against the English ministry and their government here ; and among the writings , which alternately stimulated and checked the public mind in that season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency than those of Dr Cooper . If other hands launched the lightning , his guided the cloud . But it is chiefly of his ministerial character that I ought here to speak . With such gifts as those of Dr Cooper , it was impossible that a good man should not be eminently useful in his chosen and peculiar sphere of labor . Unhappily the Church records do not furnish materials for estimating the success of his ministry , having been almost entirely neglected by him in the niidst of his various cares . It is certain , however , that his preaching was attended with as great interest , to say the least , as that of any of his contemporaries ; and that his society was numerous , and comprehended a large number of distinguished citizens . His published sermons ,  --  methodical , elaborate , animated and impressive ,  --  would certainly be ranked , in this better day of pulpit eloquence , as productions of unusual merit . It has perhaps been sometimes taken for granted , by persons not particularly acquainted with his habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in political concerns , must have interfered with the punctual discharge of his pastoral duties . But of // this , no doubt , his parishioners were best able to judge ; and I do not find that such an impression concerning him exists in the minds of the small remnant of them , who survive . On the contrary , I find strong traces of the respect and affection , with which his parochial services inspired them ; and , while his name appears to the public view prominent upon the ? ecords of patriotism , in the memory of his religious associates it is embalmed no less in the odour of sanctity . Dr Cooper , like his predecessors , died suddenly ; December 29 , 1783. ' pp. 15-17 . Dr Cooper was succeeded by Mr Thacher , whose character and high qualifications for his office are thus described by the author . With a view to fill the office vacated by the death of Dr Cooper , the attention of the society was turned to Rev. Mr Thacher , of MaIden . The preference cre*ated by Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not improbably be strengthened by regard to the earnest part he had taken in the late revolutionary struggle , and possibly , even , by partiality for a name , than which there is none more illustrious in the annals of the New England ministry . Mr Thacher had no sooner been introduced to the sacred office at Maiden , which was so early as his nineteenth year , than he acquired a popularity so great , that it is recorded of him , that " no young man ever preached to such crowded assemblies . " From his childhood he had devoted himself to the ministry of religion and his whole mind , as it was expanded , had formed itself to this work . To rapid and clear conceptions , a temper equally affectionate and frank , a lively imagination , and a nice sensibility , he added the recommendations of a commanding presence , and a voice of extraordinary melody and compass . His preaching was direct , practical , and earnest ; and , like each of his predecessors in this place , he is represented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . " Whitefield called him the young Elijah . " His fame had been extended by the circulation of some sermons , and a few other occasional works , which he had published ; but he is said to have owed his remarkable popularity not more to his evident piety and zeal , and the power of his mind and style , than to the graces of a most captivating elocution. ' pp. 18 , 19 . Next in the succession of pastors of Brattle Sqi*ire was Mr Buckminster , whose short life left so bright a page ib the history of genius , letters , and religion ; whose memory p-till dwells with a cherished freshness in the minds of many , that knew him while living ; and whose name will remain an enduring star of glory , while virtue and intellect command the homam*e of men . Mr Paifrey recounts with feeling and eloquence the rare traits in the // character of this highly gifted scholar and christian . We have room for a short extract only . Dr Thacher died , December 16 , 1802 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffectual search of relief from a lingering pulmonary consumption . His successor was the late Mr Buckminster , who was ordained January 30 , 1805 , and died suddenly , June 9 , 1812 . In the sentiments of love and veneration , with which his memory is cherished , 1 can more entirely sympathise . Of other wise and good men , who have ministered in this place , I have only read and been informed . Him I have heard and known ; and who , that has heard him , has not thenceforward fi ) und religion invested in his mind with a beauty unknown before ? He was in truth a singularly gifted man ; of a judgment discriminating , independent , and exact ; of a fancy profuse of images of the grand and lovely ; of a various and accurate learning ; of a sensibility keenly alive to the importance of truth , and the dangers and obligations of men ; of a pure and fervid zeal ; of a truly heavenly spirit . He was fornied to interest men in religion ; to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on his intellectual beauty ,  --  no one could hear the softest tone of his rich voice ,  --  without loving the spirit that dwelt in the expression of them both . He spoke to solemnise the levity of the young , and inform the wisdom of age ; to shake the sinner 's purpose , and bind up in the softest balm of consolation the wounds of the Christian 's heart . Those of us , who have heard him , with a force and feeling all his own , plead the claims of our religion , describe its value , and disclose its hopes , may not exf ) ect , while we live , to *vitness anything approaching nearer to what we imagine ol a prophet 's or an angel 's inspiration . He was one of those , who seem appointed to the high and needful office of conciliating to religion the minds of intellectual and tasteful men . God does not abandon them in the mazes of their reasoning pride , nor leave them to lay the flattering unction to their souls , that ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , prepares h ) r them splendid proof , stich as this was , that " Piety hath found Friends in the friends of learning , and true pray'r Bath flow 'd from lips wet with Castalian dews . " Stich a combination as is presented in the character of a man , eminent at once.in Christian graces and in human accomplishments , has a vast efficacy to make religion understood and prized . Religion sanctifies the latter , and shows their proper uses ; and , in turn , is itself nobly recommended , by being exhibited in this imposing and attractive union . ' pp. 20 , 21 . Mr Paifrey has added much to the value of his discourse by the large body of notes* which lie has collected with great industry and // discrimination , and published as an appendix . These contain historical illustrations of many points , which could only be slightly mentioned in a general discourse . Among other things is a long and beautiful extract from the manuscript of President Kirkland 's sermon , preached at the funeral of Mr Buckminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the author . For our own benefit , and that of the public , we should be glad if other and more copious treasures could in some way be drawn from the same rich storehouse .
