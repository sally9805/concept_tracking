PREFACE . In writing the following dramatic trifle , I was not so foolish as to think to gain any literary distinction , or of giving it a lasting character ; it was the offspring of a few days ' labour , and my chief aim in writing it was to improve myself : and if any of those who see it performed gained a moment of pleasure and gratification , I feel myself fully repaid and satisfied for any labour there might have been in the composition . The dramatic authors on this side of the Atlantic have usually wrote a preface to their plays , sometimes of more real worth than the piece itself , railing against their readers and audiences , for not truly estimating native talent ; it is therefore totally unnecessary for me to tell over the old story of " stubborn prejudices , " &c.; &c; which , although sometimes very highly wrought , are nevertheless too true ; but it becomes my duty to say , that although I had all these to combat , its reception , under every circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows plainly , that though there are great prejudices in favour of the English drama , there are some true hearts , who can believe their country equally fertile in genius and learning , and are ready to foster American talent , whenever it shall bud forth . In England there are a numerous tribe of dramatic writers , who make a profession , and sometimes a fortune of the drama ; from youth they improve themselves in the dramatic writings of ages past , and drill themselves in every trifle . Neither time nor pains are spared ; the laurel , rendered ten times more beautiful by the golden gems that deck it , awaits them if they gain the goal ; no wonder then their pieces so far exceed ours . Yet with all these advantages , none or very few originals are produced ; they are mostly translations from the French or German . I hope none of my friends suppose from this I intend to enter the lists , and become a combatant for the drama ; in plain language , become a professed author ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents for it , I should never commit such an act of madness , for otherwise I can not call it . I am too well convinced , to use the language of a dramatist , " that fame , which the poet 's heart creates his visionary mistress , is a fugitive , uncertain phantom , that tempts , but still eludes his living embrace , never to be yielded as a bride , till fate has chilled his human fires , and the consciousness of his spirit has withdrawn to other worlds . Peace is the only real good ; and national monuments , shaded by the laurel and the bay , yield no dearer resting-place to him , who fain would sleep for ever , than a turf grave clasped by osiers . " No , truly ; fame is a very good thing ; but the means are better , and you certainly do yourself more good by living on roasts , steaks , mutton chops , &c.; than dying on bread and water all your life time , and living eternally after . Therefore , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be because the effort of composition amuses my mind , and perhaps it may please my friends ; but sat . est . Have mercy , good critics ! I now print the Mountain Torrent as performed at the New York theatre with great applause , not that it may be worthy of the press , but that it may be read by my friends , which was impossible while in manuscript ; likewise as I expect it will sell well , to promote the interest of a worthy man , Mr. Longworth . I have already trespassed on my reader , who I hope will pardon the length of this preface ; but I can not conclude without paying a debt of duty and gratitude : To Mr. Simpson I owe much , " very much ; " but it is in vain for me to attempt his praise . As an actor , a scholar , and a gentleman , he has been long before the public , and his worth is generally known , but those who are acquainted with him can appreciate him best in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return my most heartfelt thanks ; and can safely say , in my own opinion , as well as on the authority of others , he never exerted himself more or appeared to better advantage than in his performance or Baron Trevasi . To Miss Johnson , the beautiful , the amiable Miss Johnson , I am highly indebted . But it is in vain to speak of the merits of each performer that was engaged in this drama ; it would swell this to a volume . Let me conclude , by saying , that all equally exerted themselves , and I owe the same debt to all . S. B. JUDAH . New York , April 12 , 1820 . DRAMATIS PERSON . New York .

SCENE  --  Outside of Marco 's cottage ; on the left , towards the front , is the outside of the house ; on the right , a wooden bridge , old and broken , crosses a rivulet , which flows from the rocks that overhang the stage ; at the bottom of the stage , a low wall , hedge , &c.; beyond , in the distance , rocks , forest , &c.; ( hunting bugles , and the wild cry of falconers at intervals in the forest ; MARCO runs eagerly from the forest ) Mar . Marco Oh , la ! how lucky ! wife , come see the wonderful sight . There , there , some great news , I warrant . I wish I knew ; I loves to know news ; for I can benefit my neighbours . Wife , Beatrice , I say , make haste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may miss the show . Always loves to see all I can . Lawks ! the woman 's lost her ears ; I wish she 'd lose her tongue sometimes . Get out my best cloak , I 'm going to the castle ; and when I go to such places , I loves to look smart . enter BEATRICE from the cottage . Beat . Beatrice Do you think me deaf , that you bawl bless my soul , how my nerves ache : how can you chatter so ? Mar . Marco Chatter , missus ? do you take me for a woman or a magpie ? Hark ! ( bugles in the forest ) la me ! I shall never hear the news , never get to the castle . Beat . Beatrice News ? news ? Marco , what is it ? Mar . Marco Great , most surprising , wonderful , miraculous news . Beat . Beatrice Do tell me , bless my soul ! do n't keep me in suspense ! Mar . Marco The news must be great by the noise ; but  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to learn it . Beat . Beatrice Numskull ! I suppose you 've been chattering and fooling with the girls , instead of attending to this weighty concern . Mar . Marco No , indeed , this once I 'm innocent ; I tried every means in my power , but could'nt get a civil answer from any body ; tho ' I asked polite enough , as one might say . ' La , ' says I to one , ' please to tell me the news . ' ' Nothing at all , ' says he , ' look for yourself , and ask no questions . ' Then I asked another and another still , all in my most accomplishified and irresistible way ; but some called me booby , ape ; others , more politer , clown , simpleton , and a world of fine names , tho ' I look as much like a well made parson as any of them . La , its most monstracious that no one can give me a gentlemanlike answer . Now run , my missus , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat . Beatrice Well , you must not be running after the girls , Marco Zachiovenetti. exit into the cottage . Mar . Marco La , I never run a'ter the girls ' Gad ! they run a'ter me  --  There she goes ; peace go with her , she leaves me none . La ! she wears the petticoat , and has the breeches under her thumb . Lawks , she 'll have her own way ; she 's missus ; for it 's as hard to make her hold her tongue as to make a mule gallop . enter BEATRICE from the cottage with the cloak . Beat . Beatrice There now ; make haste and learn the news , that 's a good fellow . Mar . Marco La ! that I will ; ( puts on the cloak and struts about . ) Eh ! how handsome ; how does it sit behind ; how exquisite ; how adorable I look ; do n't you think I 'll strike ? wife , do n't be jealous . Egad ! I 'll make rare sport at the castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bridge Beat . Beatrice Go thy ways , numskull . Bless my soul ! I do n't see how I came to marry such a ninny . Ah , love , love , and my poor weak nerves together . Oh ! if it had not been for you I might have been Carlotti 's , the miller 's wife : alas , love conquers reason , and hymen conquers love . ' AIR .  --  BEATRICE . ' ' A maiden there was who was courted by all , The rich and the poor to her bent the knee ; But cold reason fled at little Love 's call , For headstrong directed by Love she 'd be . To church went the maid , With the youth of her heart ; ' ' Yes ' was soon said , ' And they were joined ne'er to part . ' ' Content and love she wished for her lot , No matter how humble her fare ; But soon she found beneath the low cot , Not love , but harsh discord was there . When the honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That discord and hymen were come , But love for ever was lost . ' ' She wished the time had never been past , When she cast a rich lover by ; ' ' Oh , ' she cried , as she repented at last , ' And a tear rolled down her eye ; And she spoke with a sigh , For the honey moon was over ; She fretted , she fumed , and cried , Till her husband proved a rover . ' exit into the cottage SCENE  --  a saloon in the castle ; to the right , at the bottom , a large gothic window is open , through the lattice of which is seen the gardens : to the left , corresponding with the window , is a door leading from the lawn : ' the voice of rustic merriment mingling with the noise of the pipe , castanet , tambarines , and a pastoral dance , sounds from the garden . ' Dancers . Dancers ' PASTORAL . ' ' Fair evening comes sweet o'er the mountains of snow , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun 's setting gleam on the valley does glow , And the silver dew drop the white rosy delights . ' ' The sweet breeze of evening comes cool o'er the stream , The murmur of twilight steals from her cloud spread vest : Soon Cynthia , new wakened , will sport her bright beam , Whilst peace draws her dove wing o'er the cottager 's breast . ' ' The dark robe of night soon in glory array 'd , The rosy-ey 'd star will shed faint beams around , The sweet falling pearls will refreshen the glade ; And the spark of the glow-worm enliven the ground . ' ' The songster of night attunes his soft voice , The insect is sporting in dew dripping robes drest ; The new roused creation in evening rejoice : Then hail to the maid of the cloud spread breast . ' ' CHORUS . ' ' While the evening cloud is weeping , Come , the tambarine be beating ! Join the dancers light ! Now the tabrets , cheerily sounding , Now the dancers , merrily bounding , Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARENZA with a slow step : comes towards the front : then paces the stage in visible agitation . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze It shall not be ; let me pause ; let me determine ere I plunge down the abyss that yawns beneath me : what ! to sacrifice my Viola , my child , to a man whose whole life has been a series of villany ; whose eye glistens to nought but blood , and whose heart beats reponsive to no throb but vengeance . Yet I 've no other resource ; he has me in his power ; my honour , my life 's within his grasp ; Oh , Heaven ! one fatal moment has placed a thorn that tears , a canker worm that rankles in my bosom for ever , for ever ruined me . Twenty years ; twenty dreadful years have rolled away ; yet brought no sunshine to my woe ; What 's to be done ? shall my dagger ? what , a second murder ? is not my soul heavy enough with blood already ? is not my dagger still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be erased ? Alas ! ruin stares me in the face ; Oh ! I must remain the very fiend I am. ( he falls exhausted in a chair ; after a pause , enter Viola , she comes at first with a hesitating step , then goes tenderly and takes his hand ) Viola . Viola Why , dear father , still so sad ? when joy and mirth reign around ; ah ! when all are gay , why droop you , sir ? why with saddened eye have you left the glittering hall ; where all await our noble guest 's return from hunting . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Daughter , pageantry 's cold to the heart , nor e'er can please the ear of sorrow . The song of the minstrel vibrates upon the soul with fancy 's sweetest dream but to shed a draught of poisoned bitters to the heart . " Joy 's but a mockery , that holds the goblet to the lip to madden with the heavenly taste , then place a gnawing vulture in the bosom , and dash the fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Viola Oh ! my father , does sorrow usurp that bosom ; droop not , but repose thy cares in the heart of thy child ; fear not my mounting spirits or my giddy youth ; I can not be gay while thou'rt sad ; come then , let filial love wipe the tear from off thy cheek , and cheer thy sinking soul ; but , if it can not , let the sweet assurance be , that every pang Arenza feels is echoed in his child 's bosom ; that every tear that moistens his cheek , its fellow glitters in his child 's eye ; nor let Viola banquet on selfish joy while her father is unhappy . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Ah ! yours is an age of unpolluted bliss ; " hope shrouds thee with her cloudless pinions , and fancy dances day-bright visions in your happy mind ; " but thou canst ne'er shed tear in fellowship with mine ; ne'er heave a sigh to echo me ; Girl ! Girl ! thy pure soul would start with horror at the thought ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the midnight wind . Girl ! Girl ! I 'm mad ; my brain is racked , is torn . Viola . Viola Oh ! my father , forgive me ; my fault was unawares ; pardon ! let these tears plead for me. ( attempts to kneel ) Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( preventing her ) My innocent child , thou hast not offended . ( he pauses , then proceeds in a suffocated voice ) Oh ! Viola ; my daughter ; wilt save me ; save thy father ? Viola . Viola Save thee ? Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Ay ! from a death of horror and of shame . Viola . Viola Save my father ? Heaven knows how willingly ; point but the path ; howe'er so dark and drear ; was it to toil day and night thro ' Afric 's burning sands , or in a convent 's gloomy cell to spend the bright flower of youth in fast and penance ; thy Viola flies with joy , with eager pleasure . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Harder , sadder than these ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to wither on an uncongenial soil ! Heaven ! you must marry the Baron Trevasi . Viola . Viola Marry Trevasi ! father , I love  --  I love  --  Aren . Marchese D'Arenze I know it , daughter ; but the times are changed since I placed your hand in that of Alonzo 's ; no tear then coursed its way down this cheek ; this bosom heaved no sigh of sorrow , the sunbeam of happiness played on my brow , and joy planted flowers on my pillow ; all was one gay dream of delight ; but malicious fate hath blighted all ; necessity compels me . Daughter , you must marry the Baron Trevasi . Viola . Viola Oh , my father ! I can not love him ; have mercy on thy child , thy Viola . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Viola ! Viola ! refuse and kill me . Viola . Viola My dearest Father ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( grasping her hand violently , convulsed with agitation ) Ay ! see this hoary head covered with shame ; see these white locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh horror ! cursed by the shouting rabble ; see these old limbs quiver on the wheel . Girl ! Girl ! thou mightst have saved me ; thou  --  Viola . Viola Hold ! hold ! for mercy 's sake ! ( shuddering ) Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Wilt save me , then ? wilt save me from a death of dishonour ? marry Trevasi ? Viola . Viola Oh , heaven ! my soul can ne'er consent ; is there no other way ? Aren . Marchese D'Arenze None , Viola , none . Viola . Viola Oh , dreadful , dreadful ! Oh , Alonzo ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Degenerate girl ! has then a lover 's name more weight than a father 's life ? Viola . Viola ( faintly , and throwing herself upon his neck ) My father , do with me as you will ; I  --  I  --  con  --  sent . ( falls back exhausted ) Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( catching her to his bosom and kissing her forehead ) Oh , heaven ! I thank thee ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not express , that fancy can not paint ; that feeling is swelling here ; my own , own Viola ; heaven hath shown me one blessing ; it gave me thee ! Preserve thee , bless thee , my child . ( he breaks from her and gains the side ; suddenly he stops , turns round , looks at her affectionately ) Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Thou'rt too good ; I 'll perish rather than sacrifice thee . ( he rushes out ; Viola does not hear the last ) Viola . Viola ( after a pause of agitation ) Marry Trevasi ! am I awake ? to give my hand without my heart ; but ' t is to save my parent ; heaven will bless the deed . Save him ? what crime could he have committed ? there was a wild meaning in his eye that brooks expression , despair glared on his face ; but could that heart so gentle , that soul so mild  --  Oh , thought of horror ! Alonzo ! Alonzo ! what wilt thou say , to see thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight ; how my pulse swelled with rapture a few short moments since ! for I thought ere the star of evening floated in the western clouds , to have welcomed Alonzo home . But how changed ! he will come ; but oh , his welcome will be sad ; he will come ; but a night beam will have darkened his Viola 's joy . Alon . Alonzo ( without ) Viola ! Viola ! Viola . Viola Hark ! ' t is he ! Oh , that some frightful mist would shroud me from his sight for ever ; " I can not bear to meet him , for all our hopes of youthful bliss are faded and transformed ; tyrant fate has scattered poison in our once happy path , and withered every rose that fancy painted .

Alonzo Stay still my heart ; what joy is thine , Oh ! list , that lov 'd tone ever : Oh , rapture ! Viola ! thou'rt mine , Beloved , ay , and ever . ' ( the door leading from the lawn opens , and Alonzo enters with a joyful step ; utters the name of Viola , who rushes to fling herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with recollection ; she casts her eyes on the ground , and the name of Alonzo dies on her lips ; Alonzo recedes for a moment in surprize , then advances to take her hand ; but she recoils from him , and turning to conceal her emotion ; waves him away ; a pause of mutual agitation ) Alon . Alonzo ( his eye , which was at first lighted by joy , by degrees droops with an expression of despair ) Viola ! is this my Viola ? Oh ! how altered ; even now my eager heart was filled with a joy that despises eloquence ; my whole soul fluttered on my lips ; I felt as if heaven was in your presence , breath within your arms ; yet this cold reserve , that freezing look , hath chilled to death each budding thought of love . Merciful heaven ! whence this scorn , this aversion ? In what have I offended ? Oh , Viola , speak , I conjure you . ( she advances a step and endeavours to speak , but agitation chokes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to keep down the rising emotion ; then leans on a chair for support , and turns her eyes to heaven ) Alon . Alonzo Alas ! I see it all too plainly ; you hate me ; this silence speaks for you . " Oh Viola ! Viola ! was this well done ? amid hardships and privations , in the midst of death , in the darkest hour of battle , your name was a solace to my every care ; a guardian angel ! Yet , after all , thou'rt false , thou'rt faithless . Oh , why was not this deceit spared ; thou'st broke a heart that beat , that lived but for thee . " ( pauses in violent emotion ; then proceeds in a tremulous voice ) Ah Viola ! how joyful to my delighted eye did these lofty walls rise after two long , long years absence ; they were to me as the friendly lights are to the benighted traveller ; the moss-grown turrets , sparkling in the last day beam , were dear , by every tie of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistened at the well-known view . I thought of those awaiting my approach , and oh , sweet hope whispered there was one who wept my stay ; who longed my coming ! Fatal deception ! " Fancy was busy in my brain , I drank from her flower-wreathed cup , my breast glowed high with ecstacy ; " I spurred my horse and gained the castle as the dark mists of night floated by ; but sunshine was in my bosom , my soul fluttered here to drink a nectared draught ; but your hand , alas ! has dashed the goblet from my lip ere it was tasted , and mocked my joy for ever . ( Viola , no longer able to contain her agitation , bursts into tears ) You 're affected , Viola ; but my office is not to upbraid . Forgive me : far be it from me to raise a tear in thy eye for my sorrows .

Alonzo Lady , the chain is burst that bound me ; the deceitful veil is torn from my eyes , I see it all ; could the lady Viola , heiress of uncounted wealth , deign to love a child of charity , an unknown foundling of her father 's bounty ! oh ! I was mad to hope  --  to think it ! Viola . Viola Indeed , you wrong me ! hear ! I love you , heaven knows how true , how faithful ! but ' t is to save a beloved father 's life ; to save him from a scaffold that I marry the baron Trevasi . Alon . Alonzo Trevasi !  --  Lady , your father , the rich , powerful marchese D'Arenza , on a scaffold ? these arts are cold , unworthy of thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viola can bestow her affections on whom she pleases , without deigning to give her reasons to an inferior . ( affectionately ) Adieu , Viola , heaven bless and preserve thee ! save thee from Trevasi ! ( he goes to the door , looks round , darts back , kneels and kisses her hand , and rushes out in the greatest agitation . Viola stands in speechless emotion , the clouds pass quickly , and the thunder suddenly rolls , and the saloon is illuminated by lightning ; music loud and descriptive ) Vio . Viola Oh heaven ! in the midst of this storm he wanders : mercy ! there 's no shelter till past the Mountain Torrent ! oh , he might miss the path , a thousand fears assail me : merciful powers ! protect him , save him . exit SCENE  --  an apartment in the castle ; thro ' the long windows the sky is seen to grow darker as the storm increases , frequent flashes of lightning glare on the sky ; domestics bring on a table , bottles , glasses , &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludovico There , as I was saying : oh , what a furious storm ; I thought it would rain , just to spite .

Bion Biondella Indeed you improve vastly ; your travels have polished you considerably ; but I 'm much alarmed , a short time since I saw signior Alonzo rush joyous to the welcome of my mistress , " his eye beaming rapture , and his step the light tread of joy , " but soon after I saw him dart in the forest , a dreadful image of affliction , " his countenance overcast with sorrow , and his soul convulsed with anguish .

I 've lost the track ; my attendants are scattered ; the echo of the distant horns are sunk to rest ; no answer to my calls except the loud roar of the storm : ( thunder ) Death presses around !

( music ; he rushes down the path to the torrent , gains the bridge , rapidly darts to the tree , stabs Lupartro in the back , throws him over , the lightning glares on the water as he falls in the stream ; Trevasi clings to the bridge , catches the hand of Alonzo to his lips in speechless transport who raises his other to heaven ; the storm roars with deafening violence around , and the curtain falls slowly on the scene ) ACT II . SCENE  --  the interior of Marco 's cottage ; to the left an external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney ; a stair-case in the back ; a table , with a frugal repast spread out , stands in the centre of the stage ; a lamp burning in the casement . MARCO is discovered as the curtain rises sitting by the table ; BEATRICE at a spining-wheel in front ; music expressive of the storm without . Mar . Marco La me , wife , ca n't you be still ! Lauks ! the tempest is in doors and out doors . Beatrice , now do be still ; behave pretty , and hear what a fine , noble , interesting oration I 've been framing to salute the great and magnanimous Baron Trevasi . You 're a judge of oratory ; I 'm a great judge of oratory myself . Beat . Beatrice Bless me ! what a silly fellow ! do you think the baron would listen to you ? even was he to come to our humble hut , which is very improbable . Mar . Marco La , la ! not listen to me after practising attitudes ? such graceful , pretty , interesting attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , to have the honour of receiving him , and learn an appropriate address ? Egad ! not listen to me after having kept supper a waiting ? he indeed would be a foolish man : you know there 's but one track from the Mountain Torrent , and that 's by our cottage : but hist ! do n't I hear footsteps without ? Beat . Beatrice ' T was but the echo of the storm as it howled round the cottage . Mar . Marco ( listening ) La , la ! soft again : ' Gad ! ' t is he ! ( noise , and faint halloo at the external door ) Swift , Beatrice , help to unbar the door to his excellenza . Beat . Beatrice Bless my soul ! stay , Marco , do n't be too hasty . Gracious saints ! I dread to think ; it may be some ruffian from the forest " who lurks near to imbrue his hands in the blood of innocence . " Mar . Marco ( trembling ) Lauks ! true , true : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one will know a word about it . Alon . Alonzo ( without ) For heaven 's sake open the door ; " if sacred benevolence lights its pure flame within your bosoms , Oh ! " give a shelter from the peltings of this merciless storm . Mar . Marco Oh , lord ! Oh , lord ! good master cutthroats , sweet gentlemen villains , spare me , spare me ! ( Beatrice opens the casement and looks out ; the storm rages , and the lightning is seen to flash repeatedly on the dark sky ) Beat . Beatrice ' T is the cry of distress ; ' t is wayworn travellers half perishing from the drenching rain : cheer the signiors. ( they unbar the door ; ALONZO enters bearing TREVASI , who has fainted ; their garments are soiled and drenched by the rain ; Beatrice and Marco help them with open hospitality . She supports Trevasi to a seat ; Marco brings the table , and sets it before him , with herbs , fruits , flasks , &c.); Alon . Alonzo Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go unrewarded . Beat . Beatrice Nay , signior , we covet no reward ; the smile of our guests gives us more pleasure than wealth can bestow . Necessity ever has what we can give ; ' t is poor indeed , yet still the stranger 's welcome to what simple fare our mountain-board supplies . Alon . Alonzo Words are too poor to express our gratitude : ( to Trevasi ) how fares it now , signior ? Trev . Baron Trevasi Better : blessings on my preserver ! brave youth , how can I speak the feeling that beats in every pulse , and fills my soul ! how can I ever discharge the obligation I lie under ; No ! heaven forbid I should wish to discharge it ; it shall be the link of a chain of friendship cemented by life . Mar . Marco ( aside to Beatrice ) La ! they 're great people : Lauks ! I can tell great people , because they make use of great words ; egad , I always make use of great words myself . Alon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was but the duty of a soldier , of a man ; ' t was but the impulse of the heart to succour danger . Trev . Baron Trevasi Modesty glories in its own distinction , but the cherished recollection of the hour I was preserved shall never be effaced from this breast ; here , signior , take the hand , and with it the heart of Trevasi . ( Trevasi must be wrapped in a cloak during the above , but must take it off at this moment ) Alon . Alonzo ( starting from him in horror ) Trevasi ! ah ! Trev . Baron Trevasi Ay , the Baron Trevasi , who hath the will and power to reward ; why start you ? say , are we friends ? Alon . Alonzo Friends ? no , eternal , deadly enemies : for , know , the bond of friendship severed ere it joined our hearts ; may mine forget to beat when it feels one kindred throb with that of Trevasi 's ! may eternal palsies strike this hand when it gives one press of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed with astonishment at Alon . ) Amazement ! how is this ? you spurn my friendship , cast my hand away ; in what have I offended ? Alon . Alonzo ( fixing his eyes upon him with a look of horror ) Offended ? dare you ask ? hypocrite , wretch ! look to thy soul ; ask thy conscience . Trev . Baron Trevasi What means this ? " are you mad ? " I forgive these insults to my preserver , but mark me , young cavalier , presume not too far , lest you tempt a just resentment . Alon . Alonzo Thou ? thou ? thy just resentment ? Oh , eternal heaven ! Trev . Baron Trevasi This is too much ; recollect yourself ; you mock , insult me . I challenge an immediate explanation . Declare at once , or , know , as my friendship 's firm , my hate is deadly , never to be sated . Alon .

Baron Trevasi Insolent ! is this to me ? another word my sword shall lend a keen reply ; provoke not the chastisement of this arm . Alon . Alonzo What ? ha ! thou threatenest ? I defy thee : no ; thy sword is not used to be wielded fairly ; wait , my lord , for some midnight opportunity . Trev . Baron Trevasi ( exasperated almost to madness ) You brave me ? my rage can brook no more : miscreant ! this to thy heart ! ( Trevasi furiously draws his sword , and is rushing on Alonzo , but is prevented by Marco , who forcibly catches his arm , whilst Beatrice falls on her knees before him ) Beat . Beatrice Oh , pray , your lordship , stay , do n't stain your sword with blood beneath our humble roof ; return not our hospitality with murder . Trev .

Baron Trevasi ( with frantic impatience ) Away , rage , distraction , to thy heart ! Mar . Marco La , la , now I beseech you  --  Trev . Baron Trevasi ( fiercely ) Away ! vengeance ! away ! ( breaks from them and rushes forward ; at that instant Alonzo casts back the cloak in which he had been enveloped , and the light is thrown immediately on his face ; it appears pale and agitated ) Trev . Baron Trevasi ( as he advances , his eye becomes rivetted on him ; he shudders violently ; his arm falls powerless by his side ; for a moment he stands as if rooted to the spot by magic ; then staggers backward and exclaims deliriously )  --  D'Almeida ! Alon . Alonzo Heaven ! what new light breaks on me  --  D'Almeida ! Eternal powers ! Oh , if you know the secret of my birth , speak ! disclose it , I conjure you . ( he rushes towards him ) Trev . Baron Trevasi ( receding in horror as he advances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to show his gory wounds ; I can not bear to look upon him ; he frowns , he grasps me ; despair ! a mist obscures my sight ; I can see no more ; Oh , Heaven ! desert me not . ( he falls into Marco 's arms ) ( Alonzo sinks on his knees , and entreats with frantic ardour ) Alon . Alonzo Oh , tell me , pronounce my parent 's sacred name ; have mercy  --  speak ! Oh , speak , and I 'm your slave for ever : Oh , my heart is bursting ! hope beats around my soul ; nature contends within me ; Oh , tell me , breathe but the holy sound , and I will worship you . Trev . Baron Trevasi Did I dream ? Yes : it was a fearful , deadly dream : no , no too sure ; look , look  --  Alon . Alonzo Baron ! you mistake , look on me well ; perhaps memory may recal the name of the foundling Alonzo , who demands of you his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self possession ) Fool , fool that I was to be frightened at a shadow ! well , signior , what am I to expect ? hast come to betray me ? Alon . Alonzo No : I was your companion , your comrade in arms ; amid the shock of steel I saved your life , then think not so meanly of me ; I come not to disclose your secret ; yet mark me , it was intrusted in honour , and while you keep fair honour 's path , it shall be sacred ; but if you persevere in your guilty course , if your present visit to these mountains is fraught with what I think , believe not I 'll conceal my knowledge of your crimes . No ! heaven 's vengeance shall be speedy , and burst with overwhelming force on your head . Trev . Baron Trevasi My heart is light again : I live , I breathe . Alon . Alonzo Oh , then , if your heart is not callous to every human feeling , by your soul 's best hope , speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevasi ( involuntarily ) Never !

Baron Trevasi Nay , on my honour ! Alon . Alonzo Inhuman ! Trev . Baron Trevasi ' T is in vain  --  nay , I can not  --  I will not . Alon . Alonzo Ha !

ARENZA is discovered pacing the chamber with a quick petulant step ; his looks are wild and haggard ; he seats himself suddenly , and leans his head upon his hand ; a short symphony is played .

The MARCHESE , and TREVASI leading VIOLA , whose countenance is pale , wild , and haggard , enter , followed by domestics , &c.; As the characters arrive at the triumphal arch , village girls suddenly intercept them , scattering flowers , &c.; ' SONG AND CHORUS . ' ' Warrior , in this rosy bower , ' Anointed by love 's balmy tear ; ' Rest thee sweet in happy hour , ' For gratitude and friendship 's here . ' ' No wind thy happy course deform ' But 's hushed by friendship 's tear : ' Love 's sacred sigh shall sooth the storm , ' For friendship and love rules here . ' ( during the last stanza the villagers precede the Marchese , &c.; to the bower ) Trev . Baron Trevasi In truth , fair lady , this does credit to your design . How enchanting , how brilliant ! it seems a dream , a fairy vision ; and thou , Viola , the fair spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee for the rapture of this moment , my love alone can tell . Viola . Viola ( turning aside to conceal her emotion ) Ah ! this spot was sacred to another ! Alas , my fate 's decided ; would that the grave would swallow me ! Trev . Baron Trevasi You weep ! What means these pearly tears ? lean on me ; tell me , love ! Nay , by a dearer name ! Viola . Viola Nay , stay , my lord ! The sad thought was but momentary . Trev . Baron Trevasi Come then be seated ; the night air 's too keen for you ; the rose has left your cheek awhile to let the lily reign . ( they enter the bower ; Viola is seated between Arenza and Trevasi ; one seat remains vacant ; Trevasi perceives it with hypocritical joy ) Trev . Baron Trevasi Ha , ' t was for Alonzo ! ( loud ) How , do you expect another visitor ? Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( casting a glance of anger at Viola ) How so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere mistake . Trev . Baron Trevasi I suppose so ! ( smiling malignantly ) The hour wears . Come , let the sports begin . The priest will soon arrive ; but a few moments yet remain . ( Viola , at the last words , sinks back in the seat ; Arenza bows to Trevasi , and waves his hand ; immediately a ballet commences with castanets , tambarines , &c.; As it concludes , the boughs disappear from before the grove , and a transparency appears inscribed with the name of ' Alonzo ' above , and ' ever dear be the warrior 's return , ' beneath . Viola shrieks ; Trevasi starts , and claps his hand on his sword ) Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( reproachfully ) Viola , is this your duty ? Viola . Viola ( starting forward and raising his hand ) Hear me , for mercy 's sake . Pardon ! Hear me ! Have mercy ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( passionately ) Mercy ! You 've none on me ! Away ! degenerate ! to wound me thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself too much ! Viola , retire ; come , let me entreat you to compose yourself . Viola . Viola Away ! your touch is blasting . Alonzo , save me ! Save me , father ! Trev . Baron Trevasi Lady Viola , remember yourself ; this is mere folly ; see by yonder torch 's light the barehead monk that comes to make thee mine for ever . Viola . Viola ( distractedly ) Thine ! Never , oh never ! Away ! Away ! Trev . Baron Trevasi ' Sdeath ! here , bear her in ; remove her hence to the chapel . Viola . Viola Oh , father , have pity ! My bursting heart ! Alonzo ; oh , Alonzo ! Trev . Baron Trevasi Come , lady , this instant ; I command you . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( aside ) Every word is a dagger to my heart . Oh , I can bear no more . ( interposing ) Nay , baron , nay ! Forbear to persecute us longer ! Can you behold this , and not spare us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Oh , speak not , proceed not farther ! Look not with that frown ! Come , Viola , come , kneel with me ; he is not human if he can gaze on thee , lovely angel , and not pity us . Trev . Baron Trevasi Insupportable ! I can endure this no longer . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Oh , spurn us not ; drive us not from you . " Here will we cling till you show mercy ! Oh , let not your pillow be embittered by our tears ; let not our groans scare away your joys . " Heave not the green turf on these hoary hairs ; oh , blast not this sweet rose ! Pause , pause , yet a moment . Trev . Baron Trevasi ( spurning them from him ) Away ! I am resolved ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( rising proudly ) Villain ! I too am at last resolved ! I will not sacrifice my daughter ! Scared at the horn , the timid stag flies ; but when hard-pressed , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life 's of little moment ; " but my daughter , yet a bud , though drooping now beneath the storm , when the clouds disperse , and the sunbeams play , she will revive ! but oh , the withered flower can ne'er revive again ! Once stricken by the tempest , oh its beauty and its strength are gone for ever . " But thou ! Fear thee , villain ! tremble at the vengeance that awaits thee ! How wilt thou look on death ? how meet the hour that joyful I embrace ? Horrors will hurtle round thy death bed ! Hell will mock thy cries ! Demons will laugh to see thy pain , and at every cry for mercy , a voice like mine shall shriek in thy ear , ' Murderer , no mercy didst thou give ! no mercy shalt thou receive ! ' Trev . Baron Trevasi How ! dare you refuse me your daughter ? " Dare to threaten such nonsense ? " Your breath depends on a word ; Dare you death ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of eternal hate ! Now ' t is well ! Now to sate my  --  Viola . Viola ( rushing between ) Hold ! Hold ! Lead to the altar ! Trev . Baron Trevasi On ! The monk 's without . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Stay ! I command ; my resolution 's taken ; irrevocably fixed ! I dare your power and your vengeance ! Trev . Baron Trevasi Well , then , be it so ; " and as your blood dyes the scaffold , I 'll shout and cry o'er it , " ' vengeance , vengeance ! ' ( music : a loud crash : the bower falls broken to the ground , and discloses a dark avenue behind , from which officers of justice emerge , headed by Marco ; and groupe in the back ; the peasants in consternation crowd to the sides : ALONZO among the officers : the music expressive of the alarm , hurry , confusion , &c.); Trev . Baron Trevasi ( with a shout of joy ) How say you now , proud man ; officers , behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drag him hence ! Viola . Viola ( falling on her knees , and clasping his robe ) Whither would'st thou lead him ? Trev . Baron Trevasi To prison ; to death . Come , lead him hence ; drag hence the murderer , I say . Yet stay a moment ; D'Arenza , I 'll tell the something in kindness e'er we part . Know , then , D'Almeida ne'er harmed thee in word or deed . Thy hand , homicide , was bathed in the blood of him who loved thee . I , the poor , needy gamester whom you spurned , whose friendship you despised , have been your evil genius , and now live to tell how much he hates you . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Monster ! Barbarian ! Tre . Baron Trevasi Ha ! ha ! ha ! How I banquet on every sigh ; each tear is nectar to my soul . Another word ; know more : know that your foundling  --  Alon . Alonzo ( aside ) Ha ! Trev . Baron Trevasi He that from a monastery was conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom thou lovest , and whom that girl adores ; he ought to have cursed thee , and will curse thee ; for thou hast left him fatherless ! Ay ! the hand that fed him was bathed in his parent 's blood ; the heart that loved him had panted for his parent 's death . " Alon . Alonzo ( aside ) Heavenly powers , ' t is confirmed : he says it ; my suspicions were true : I am , I am D'Almeida 's son . " Trev . Baron Trevasi This dagger too brings a heavier proof of villany . Yes , ' t was he that sought my life , directed the attack at the Mountain Torrent ; more blood was his aim , but heaven defeated his purpose . Heaven watches over the innocent . Away ! his hour hath come ! ( Alonzo darts forward with the utmost impetuosity : music descriptive , &c.); Alon . Alonzo No , tyrant , ' t is thy hour that 's come . Heaven does watch over the innocent . Tre . Baron Trevasi Despair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster ! I come , armed with justice , to unravel this web , to unfold thy deep-laid arts ! Trev . Baron Trevasi ( recovering ) Arts ! I do not understand . Away , boy ! Officers , bear hence your prisoner . Alon . Alonzo No , there behold your prisoner ! behold the murderer ! my father 's murderer ! secure the villain , the fiend . Trev . Baron Trevasi Discovered ! madness ! but thus , thus , I triumph still ; thus laugh at thee , defy thee . ( attempts to destroy himself ) Alon . Alonzo Disarm the villain . ( the officers rush on him , and wrest the weapon from him : he is held foaming with rage ) Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Oh , Alonzo ! can you forgive me ? Alon . Alonzo ( casting himself at his feet ) Thou'rt innocent ! Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Mysterious providence ! explain , D'Almeida  --  Alon . Alonzo As the barbarian said , was my father , but is dead ; but he died not by your hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns , and I curse yon monster . Unexperienced in the world , I left these bowers for the bustling camp . Fate cast yon villain in my way ; he won my friendship ; deep were his arts ; he wished to make me a villain like himself , and told a tale of horror , how he 'd rivalled thee ; how , by his odious arts , you , for a supposed injury , had stabb 'd D'Almeida . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Oh , heaven ! my heart ! Alon . Alonzo The wound was slight ; he recovered . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Eternal mercy ! I thank you ! Alon . Alonzo But he recovered to feel a more than death ; to be torn from all he held dear ; to be cast in a darksome dungeon , where the pangs of dying were before him every moment , yet death was far away . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Oh the fiend ! oh , my friend ! Alon . Alonzo At last death came as a kindness from his dagger , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour ! you found me . Trevasi 's own lips confirmed my birth , and D'Almeida 's son now comes for justice on his parent 's murderer . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze ( embracing him ) My son , life is thy boon . Heaven hath watched o'er thee . How shall I reward thee , how sooth the spirit of my friend by kindness to his son ? Oh , D'Almeida , " float on the silvery clouds cloathed in light ; " let thy radiant eyes smile on , and thy holy lips bless this union , and forgive the repentant Arenza ! ( he joins the hands of Alonzo and Viola : music descriptive ) Alon . Alonzo My love ! my Viola ! oh , this is bliss indeed ! Vio . Viola " Ah , I am awake , yet still I dream ! " oh , Alonzo ! this vision is so light , I fear a dazzling sunbeam may dissipate it , and the sweet phantasy dissolve in storm ! " Alon . Alonzo O then , be our dreams ever , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flower surcharged with dew when night is past . ' T is joy ! ' t is joy ! Joy brings the dew-drops as well as grief ! " ( Viola sinks gradually on his breast ; he supports her with animated tenderness ; a group around ) Trev . Baron Trevasi Oh , what a sight ! Eternal lightnings blast them ! my throat is choked with curses ; but I can not vent them . Welcome , darkness , for there I can breathe my hate . Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Bear hence the fiend ! the sight is painful to my soul ; it sheds a mildew on my joys . Trev . Baron Trevasi Would that its damps might wither to death . I go , ay to the scaffold ; would that thy blood went with me , " it would light my tomb . " My latest breath shall curse thee , D'Arenza. ( he is conducted away by officers of justice , &c.); Aren . Marchese D'Arenze Miserable , hard-hearted man , may'st thou repent , and heaven show mercy to thee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though blanched by many a storm , and benighted by fate , will at last shine forth , fair as a sun-beam , and encounter a flowery path fresh with the dews of joy .
