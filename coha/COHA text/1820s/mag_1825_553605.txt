txt ART . lI. - Reminiscences of Charles Butler , Esq . of Lin .. cola 's Inn ; with a Letter to a Lady on dncient and Modern Music . From the Fourth London Edition . l2mo. pp. 351 . New York . Bliss and White . To those who would gather knowledge without much expense of thought , or labor of study , better pleased to loiter in the smooth places of literature , than toil up its rugged ascents in search of its higher trophies ; and to those who would relax their severer studies with an agreeable variety of literary anecdote , traits in the character of distinguished men , and curious historical facts ; to all such persons , these remembrances of a veteran scholar , and amiable man , may be highly recommended . The author has long been known , as a writer and a lawyer of considerable eminence , and it is the purpose of this work , which he insinuates may be his last , to comprise such scattered thoughts as had occurred to him in the course of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life connected with his literary pursuits , and to add notices of all his previous publications . These ends he has attained in such a manner , as to mingle amusement with the instruction he communicates , and to win the reader not more by the variety and interest of his topics , than by the ease and // simplicity of his style , and the fair , candid , temperate , and liberal views , which mark the operations of his mind . As a scholar , or man of learnine , his works abundantly testify that few have ranged so widely in the fields of human knowledge , or returned laden with stores so rich and abundant , notwithstanding his intense devotedness to a very absorbing and laborious profession . The following short notice of himself affords a key , by which the mystery of his great attainments is easily unlocked . Very early rising ,  --  a systematic division of his time ,  --  abstinence from all company and from all diversions not likely to amuse him highly ,  --  froni reading , writing , or even thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  never permitting a bit or scrap of time to be unemployed ,  --  have supplied him with an abundance of literary hours . His literary acquisitions are principally owing to the rigid observance of four rules ;  --  to direct his attention to one literary object only at a time ; to read the best book upon it , consuIting others as little as possible ; - where the subject was contentious , to read the best book on each side ;  --  to find out men of information , and , in their society , to listen , not to talk . ' p. 23 . A life of fifty years thus employed could not fail to accomplish things , which might at first seem incredible . No virtue is more rare than economy in the division and use of time , and in the few instances where this has been rigidly practised , the world has seen prodigies of attainment . Seneca tells of the vigilance with which he seized on every moment of time as it passed ; not a day at its close could reproach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a late hour of the night . In one of his beautiful Epistles he says ; A " ullus mihi per otium dies exit ; partes noctium stud us vindico ; non vaco somno , sed succumbo , et occulos vigilia fatigatos , cadentesque , in opere detineo . Sir William Jones is a remarkable example in point ; with talents of a high order , it is true , but more especially by an industry that never tired , and a methodical appropriation of every moment of his time to some definite purpose , he made acquisitions in the midst of a busy life that astonish the mind , accustomed to observe only the ordinary results of intellectual labor . His aims were always fixed high , and he seldom fell below them ; the vast schemes , which he did not live to mature , were not without their use in carrying his mind upward , // and giving it the excitement of a lofty motive . It can not be denied , that there is sometimes danger to be apprehended from this very propensity for grasping so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mind necessarily acquires a habit of dwelling on particulars , and , without the exercise of much caution and good judgment , its energy will he lost on trifles ; magno conatu magnas nugas . In the same proportion it will lose the power of developing broad principles , and of draw .. ing from particulars , general and philosophical conclusions . This was doubtless in some degree true of Sir William Jones not that his mind was deficient in the powers of philosophical discrimination , but his eagerness for new attainments was so great , that time was not left , nor space in his thoughts , for arrangement and combination . In many cases he reasoned and thought profoundly , but take all his labors together , we are amazed rather at what he learnt , than at what he has taught . There is good counsel in Seneca 's Second Epistle , on the subject of diversity of study , which our readers will pardon us for translating . The best proof of a well ordered mind , ' says Seneca , is its power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the reading of many authors , and those of all descriptions , do not produce vagueness and instability . Close application to a few writers of rare merit is necessary , if you would treasure up anything , which will settle faithfully into the mind . He , who is everywhere , is nowhere ; and the traveller , who is always in motion , may experience much hospitality , but make no friendships . So it will be with those , who dwell not on a particular branch of study , till they become familiar with it , but are always hurrying from one thing to another . Nothing so much impedes a restoration to health , as a frequent change of medicine ; a wound will not heal , which is irritated by repeated applications ; a plant will not flourish , which is often removed to a new soil ; and , in short , perpetual change is Th ) x*1* rn *vtt*yVtnng . I*i* muX*ixu*e o* Vo6ks &amp;stracts iXie mind . Since , therefore , you can not read all you can obtain , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . " But " you reply , " I wish to look a little into this volume , and a little into that . " It is the mark of a fastidious stomach to desire to taste of many dishes , which , when of variouB // kinds , vitiate rather than nourish the body . Hence let your reading be confined to the most approved authors , and if at any time you seek for amusement in others , return again to the first . ' Sir Matthew Hale is an illustrious example of the wonders that may be wrought , by a methodical use of time ; his application was unremitted , and the compass of his knowledge almost without bounds , but he knew how to estimate it right .. ly ; he made all his acquisitions subservient to discovering the springs of society , unfolding the principles of human nature , teaching lessons of practical wisdom , and acting on the condition of man . He sought knowledge for these ends alone , and valued particulars only as they opened light into some new truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reminiscent entertains us with a long chapter on the Letters of Junius ; if forsooth we may be allowed the intimation , that anything entertaining can now be said on a subject so completely exhausted . There is little new in the Reminiscent 's observations , inasmuch as he has left the great mystery of the authorship of these letters as much in the dark as it was before , yet there is an interest in hearing a man describe things in which he has been personally concerned , and talk of distinguished men with whom he has been in habits of intimacy . This kind of interest will be found in the author 's discussion on the Letters of Junius . The argument in favor of Sir Philip Francis having been the author of these Letters has been pursued with so much success , chiefly on the ground of resemblance in the handwriting , that Mr Butler would destroy its force by supposing Sir Philip to have been the amanuensis of Junius , and copied the Letters for the press . When it is considered , that the known writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of style , or power of thought , with the Letters of Junius , this hypothesis is more than probable . The Reminiscent examines the evidence on which the other candidates have been brought forward as the authors of these Letters , but after going round the circle , and telling now and then an agreeable anecdote on the way , he sits down at the point from which he first set out , fain to acknowledge that he has found no clue by which to penetrate the mysterious labyrinth . The parts of the volume , which will be perused with most delight by the greater portion of readers , are those rel*ti*g // April , to distinguished British statesmen and orators . As the Re .. miniscent was either personally acquainted with these men , or had often witnessed the public exhibition of their talents , and knew their characters , habits , and the estimation in which they were held by their contemporaries , his descriptions are doubtless to be relied on for their fidelity . His manner , style , and spirit , will speak for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , C The eloquence of this remarkable man was an era at the bar . His addresses to juries have not been equalled ; they alike captivated their understandings , their imaginations , and their passions . He often rose to the highest oratory ; but it was always simple ; and even in his sublimest flights , there was much that was very familiar ; but this rather set off than clouded their splendor , rather increased than diminished their general effect . His skill in the conduct of a cause , and in the examination of witnesses , has never been surpassed ; his discretion never forsook him , even in his highest forensic enthusiasm ; his manners were always most gentlemanly ; at the bar he was uniformly loved and admired* and , when he accepted the seals , no one , as lord Eldon justly remarked of him , could have a greater wish to discharge properly the office , which was conferred on him , or greater talents to qualify him for a proper discharge of it . A true friend to constitutional liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never failed in respect to the crown , or sacrificed to the prejudices or vagaries of the populace . It is highly to the credit of the two noble bids , that , though the difference of their l ) olitics repeatedly placed them in a state of forensic conflict , neither ever said that to the other , or of the other , which it was unpleasing to him to hear . This circumstance Lord Erskine himself noticed to the Reminiscent . ' pp. 61 ; 62 . Lord Chatham is thus described . C The nature of the eloquence of this extraordinary man , it is extremely difficult to describe . No person in his external appearance was ever more bountifully gifted by nature for an orator . In his look and his gesture , grace and dignity were combined , but dignity presided ; the " terrors of his beak , the liglitnings of his eye , were insufferable . His Voice was both full and clear ; his lowest whisper was distinctly heard , his middle tones were sweet* rich , and beautifully varied ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was completely filled with the volume of the sound . The effect was awful , except when he wished to cheer or animate ; he then had spirit stirring notes , which were perfectly irresistible . He frequently rose , on a sudden , from a very low to // a very high key , but it seemed to be without effort . His diction was remarkably simple , but words were never chosen with greater care ; he mentioned to a friend of the Reminiscent , that he had read twice , from beginning to end , Bailey 's Dictionary ; and that he had perused some of Dr Barrow 's Sermons so often , as to know them by heart . His sentiments , too , were apparently simple ; but sentiments were never adopted or uttered with greater skill ; he was often *amiliar and even playful , but it was the familiarity and playfulness of condescension ; the lion that dandled with the kid . The terrible , however , was his peculiar power . Then the whole house sunk before him . Still he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended with this most important effect , that it impressed every hearer with a conviction , that there was something in him even finer than his words ; that the man was infinitely greater than the orator ; no impression of this kirJ was made by the eloquence of his son , or his son 's antagonist . Still ,  --  with the great man ,  --  for great he certainly was ,  --  manner did much . One of the fairest specimens , which we possess of his lordship 's oratory , is his speech , in 1766 , for the repeal of the stamp act . " Annuit , et nutu totum tremefecit Olympum. ** Most , perhaps , who read the report of this speech , in * Register , will wonder at the effect , which it is known to have produced on the hearers ; yet the report is tolerably exact , and exhibits , although faintly , its leading features . But they should have seen the look of ineffable contempt with which he surveyed the late Mr Grenville , who sat within one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , " As to the late ministry , every capital measure they have taken , has been entirely wrong. ** They should also have beheld him , when addressing himself to Mr Grenville 's successors , he said , " As to the present gentlemen ,  --  those , at least , whom L have in my eye , " - ( looking at the bench on which Mr Conway sate , ) - " I have no objection ; I have never been made a sacrifice by any of them . Some of them have done me the honor to ask my poor opinion , before they would engage to repeal the act ; they will do me the justice to own , I did advise them to engage to do it , but notwithstanding , ( for I love to be explicit , ) I can not give them my confidence . Pardon me , gentlemen , ** ( bowing to them , ) " confidence is a plant of slow growth . * Those , who remember the air of condescending protection , with which the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke these words , will recollect how much they themselves , at the moment , were both delighted and awed , and what they themselves then conceived of the immeasurable superiority of the orator over every human be VOL . XX. - NO. 47. 36 // ing that surrounded him . In the passages which we have cited , there is nothing which an ordinary speaker might not have said ; it was the manner , and the manner only , which produced the effect . ' pp. 121-123 . The parallel between Fox and Pitt , which we next introduce , is loosely drawn , hut it contains some discriminating traits of the character of their minds and eloquence . On his first separation froni the ministry , Mr Fox assumed the character of a whig ; and , from this time , uniformly advocated , in consistency with that noble character , the great cause of civil and religious liberty , on their broadest principles . Almost the whole of his political life was spent in opposition to his majesty 's ministers . It may be said of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but 110 enemy . Good nature , too easily carried to excess , was one of the distinctive marks of his character . In vehemence and power of argument he resembled Demosthenes ; but there the resemblance ended . He possessed a strain of ridicule and wit , which nature denied to the Athenian ; and it was the more powerful , as it always appeared to be blended with argument , and to result from it . To the perfect composition , which so eminently distinguishes the speeches of Demosthenes , he had no pretence . He was heedless of method ; having the complete command of good words , he never sought for better ; if those , which occurred , expressed his meaning clearly and forcibly , he paid little attention to their arrangement or harmony . This detracts from the merit of his speeches , when they are read ; but , when they were delivered , it perhaps added to their effect , as it tended greatly to make the hearers believe that he was above art , and spoke from conviction . Nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater force to his oratory . The moment of his grandeur was , when , after he had stated the argument of his adversary , with much greater strength than his adversary had done , and with much greater than any of his hearers thought possible , he seized it with the strength of a giant , and tore and trampled on it to destruction . If , at this moment , he had possessed the power of the Athenian over the passions or the imaginations of his hearers , he might have disposed of the house at his pleasure , but this was denied to him ; and , on this account , his speeches fell very short of the effect , which otherwise they must have produced . It is difficult to decide on the comparative merit of him and Mr Pitt ; the latter had not the vehement reasoning , or argumentative ridicule , of Mr Fox ; but lie had more splendor , more imagery , and much more method and discretion . His long , lofty , and // reverential panegyrics of the British constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as advocating the democratic spirit then let loose on the inhabitants of the earth , and his solemn adjuration of the house , to defend and to assist him , in defending tht-ir all against it , were , in the highest degree , both imposing and conciliating . In addition , he had the command of bitter contemptuous sarcasm , which tortured to madness . This he could expand or compress at pleasure ; even in one member of a sentence , he could inflict a wound that was never healed . Mr Fox having made an able speech , Mr Erskine followed him with one of the very same import . Mr Pitt rose to answer them ; he announced his intention to reply to both ; " but , " said he " 1 shall make no mention of what was said by the honorable gentleman who spoke last ; he did no more than regularly repeat what was said by the member who preceded him , and regularly weaken all he repeated. ** It was prettily said by the historian of the Roman Empire , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galley ; " but never did horoscope prove more false ; Mr Fox said more truly , " Pitt will do for us , if he should not do for himself . " Mr Fox had a captivating earnestness of tone and manner ; Mr Pitt was more dignified than earnest . The action of Mr Fox was easy and graceful ; Mr Pitt 's can not be praised . It was an observation of the reporters in the gallery , that it required great exertion to follow Mr Fox while he was speaking ; none to remember what he had said ; that it was easy and delightful to follow Mr Pitt ; not so easy to recollect what had delighted them . It may be added , that , in all Mr Fox 's speeches , even when he was most violent , there xs*a s an unquestionable indication of good humor , which attracted every heart . Where there was such a seeming equipoise of merit , the two last circumstances might be thought to turn the scale ; but Mr Pitt 's undeviating circumspection ,  --  sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , from the considerate and the grave , a confidence which they denied to his rival ; besides , Mr Pitt had no coalition , no India bill to defend . Much that awes by power or charms by beauty was heard in the harangues of both ; but , while Fox spoke , his argument only was thought of ; while Pitt harangued , all his other excellencies had their due measure of attention . Each made better speeches than Lord Chatham ; neither of them possessed even one of those moments of supreme dominion , which , ( he is sensible how very imperfectly , ) the Reminiscent has attempted to describe . ' pp. 138-141 . We trust we shall he pardoned for introducing the following notice of Lord Thurlow , although it contains his cele* // brated speech , which is familiar to many of our readers . But however celebrated , or however familiar , sentiments so noble and just can hardly be too often repeated , or too strongly impressed . The occasions have been rare in which the dig* nity of man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still more rare in which they have been embraced with a power so tremendous , and an effect so astounding . At times , Lord Thurlow was superlatively great . It was the good fortune of the Reminiscent , to hear his celebrated reply to the Duke of Grafton , during the inquiry into Lord Sandwich 's administration of Greenwich hospital . His Grace 's action and delivery , when he addressed the house , were singularly dignified and graceful ; but his matter was not equal to his manner . He reproached Lord Thurlow with his plebeian extraction , and his recent admission into the peerage . Particular circumstances caused Lord Trhurlow 's reply to make a deep impression on the Reminiscent . His lordship had spoken too often , and began to be heard with a civil but visible impatience . Under these circumstances , he was attacked in the manner we have mentioned . He rose from the woolsack , and advanced slowly to the place , from which the chancellor ge. *erally addresses the house ; then , fixing on the duke the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am amazed , ** he said , in a level tone of voice , " at the attack which the noble duke has made on me . Yes , my lords , " consi ( lerably raising his voice , " I am amaze ( l at his Grace 's speech . The noble duke can not look before him , behind him , or on either side of him , without seeing some noble peer , who owes his seat in this house to his successful exertions in the profession to which 1 belong . Does he not feel that it is as honorable to oWe it to these , as to being the accident of an accident ? - To all these noble lords , the language of the noble duke is as applicable and as insulting as it is to myself . But 1 do n't fear to meet it single and alone . No one venerates the peerage more than I do ; but my lords , I must say that the peerage solicited me , not I the peerage . Nay more , I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament ; as speaker of this right honorable house , as keeper of the great seal ; as guardian of his majesty 's conscience ; as lord high chancellor of England , nay , even in that character alone , in which the noble duke would think it an affront to be considered  --  but which character none can deny me-as a MAN* I am at this moment as respectable ; I beg leav** to add , I am at this time , as much respected , as the proudest peer I now look down upon . " The effect of this speech , both within the walls of parliament and out of them , was prodigious . It gave Lord Thurlow an ascendency in the house , which no chancellor had ever possessed ; it invested him , in public opinion , with a charac // ter of independence and honor ; and this , although he was ever on the unpopular side of politics , made him always popular with the people . ' pp. 164-166 . Our extracts shall be closed with the Reminiscent 's remarks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their compositions , before they entrusted them to the public eye . Such rigid practices would alarm the writers of novels , and the reviewers of these modern days . Newton wrote out the first chapter of his Chronology , which is the larger part of that great work , eighteen times with his own hand , and he published nothing which he had not copied many times over . Who can refrain from deploring the degeneracy of these our latter days ? To write much and rapidly is now the watchword ; to make one novel a year , and two if possible , or at all events to be always in the press , and running a race with the printers ; to indite poetry , with Pegasus at his greatest speed , by inspiration , leaving sense , nature , reason , truth , and such dull things to the poor possession of the uninitiated ; to send out reviews quarterly , monthly , weekly , on all sorts of subjects , with some of which the writers , themselves are acquainted , and of others as ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the feats of modern literature1 these the exploits of modern genius , these the trophies of modern learning . But we are revealing secrets . Let us return to the Reminiscent . We have mentioned , ' says he , Mr Burke 's endless corrections of his compositions ; Bossuet , by the acceunt of his Benedictine editors , was equally laborious ; but in this they differed ; that Burke appears to have been satisfied with his original conceptions , and to have been fastidious only in respect to words and phrases Bossuet seems to have been equally dissatisfied with his first thoughts and his first words . The inequality between those works of Bossuet , which the Benedictine editors published from the drafts of them , and those published by himself , is utterly inconceivable ; it is a literary phenomenon ; it might be considered impossible that both should proceed from the same pen , or be the thoughts or words of the same person . Rousseau himself has informed *s , that between his first committing of a sentence to paper and his final settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should have been the case of such writers as Robertson or Gibbon , is not surprising ; their eternal batteries and counter batteries of words seem // April , to be the effect tf much reflection and many second thoughts ; but that it should have been the case with writers like Bossuet , Burke , and Rousseau , who appear to pour streams equally copious and rapid of unpremeditated eloquence , appears extraordinary ; it justilies the common remark , that we seldom read with pleasure , what has not been composed with labor . The molle atque facetum , which Horace ascribes to Virgil , indicates a composition which taste has inspired , but which doings and iterated doings have worked into softness . Such are the pages of Addison , such the Offices of Cicero ; such also , but in a superlative degree , are many passages of iVlilton. ' pp. 209 , 210 . A long chapter on the jurisprudence of France , both ancient and modern , and on the English law of property , contains many historical facts and ingenious remarks , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to the understanding and improvement of ' the general reader . Notices of the author 's various writings are interspersed throughout the volume , and so arranged as to enable us to trace the course of his studies . His work , entitled Horce Juridicce Subsecive , has been highly approved by lawyers , and his Hore Bibiicce , by theologians , as containing a fund of valuable knowledge , well digested , and compressed within a small compass . He has written several theological essays , and also the lives of Bossuet , Fenelon , and other eminent persons . He is wayward in some of his poetical criticisms . In preferring Homer to Virgil , and Dryden to Pope , he has our full consent to enjoy his opinion ; but we do not agree , that Virgil 's language sometimes ceases to be Latin , ' nor believe that the works of Gray are more read and admired than those of any other English poet . ' Nor shall we soon be convinced , that the muse of Gray was of a higher order ' than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good tempered in all his criticisms , as well as in all his writings , that for our own credit we forbear to quarrel with him on so small a matter as that of extolling a favorite poet , a liberty belonging to every one that chooses to exercise it , and we take leave of his little volume , with grateful feelings toward the reminiscent , for the sources of entertainment , which he has opened to us.
