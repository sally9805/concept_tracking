txt ART . V.-Johann Gottfried von Herder 's siimmtliche Werke . Zur sch6nen Literatur und Kunst . John G. Herder 's complete Works , relating to Belles Lettres and the . drts . OF the men of letters in Germany , who contributed to elevate the reputation and improve the taste of their country , few were so distinguished for variety of attainments , industry , and the love of pure morality , as Herder . Without possessing great originality , he had still that power of genius , which gives life to acquisitions , and knew how to enrich and strengthen his mind by diligence in study and the faithful exertion of his faculties . The character of his mind was poetic ; yet as nature had denied him the highest qualifications of the poet , and he was conscious of his own inability to tread firmly in the heaven of invention , ' he contented himself with occupations suited to his capacities , taking thc widest range through the literature of almost every age and nation , to which he could gain access , and returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to estimate the excellence of others ; he could hold his mind aloof from the objects by which he was immediately surrounded , and enter upon the // study of a foreign work , as if he had been of the country , for which it was originally designed . Being possessed of great skill in the use of his own language , he was able to transfer into it the lighter graces no less than the severe lessons of foreign poets . To turn over some parts of his works is as to walk in a botanical garden , where the rare and precious plants of other countries , which thrive in climates the most distant and most different , are artificially yet safely collected , and planted without injury in soils suited to their natures . The ancient songs of the Scots , the pleasing ballads of the olden times in England , the little poems , which have been revived in the recent popular selections from the early English writers , the tales and canzons of the French , the Spaniards , the Italians , are many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately translated into the German . But not only the beauties of the literature of the west , the finest sayings of Sadi and other oriental poets , the Greek cQnvivial songs , the most blooming flowers from the Grecian Anthology , those odes of Horace , those poems of Persius and other Latin authors , which breathed a high moral spirit , are introduced in his pages , and either arranged in separate collections , or pleasantly interwoven amidst his criticisms , his moral reasonings , and his remarks on history and man . Indeed some of the volumes of his works may be compared to a fanciful piece of mosaic , composed of costly stones from all parts of the world , and if not always arranged in the very best taste , at least always rich in themselves , and well fitted to gratify the observer . He did more than translate . Wherever he found a beautiful idea , a just and happy image or allegory , he would seize upon it , and , giving it a form suited to his own taste , present it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he often met amidst the rubbish of verbal commentators and allegorical expositors , many curious and instructive fables , narrations , proverbs , and comparisons . These he did not fail to select , to amplify and arrange , and thus put in currency again many a bright thought , which lay covered with the rust of learning , or buried under a mass of useless criticisms . He collected the ballads of the Spanish Cid , and formed of them a continued poem ; he seized on ideas in the eastern as in the classic mythology , and wrought them into beautiful and instructive fictions ; he se // 140 Jan. lected from the writings of men , whose minds had an influence on their age , the thoughts which characterised them , and thus gathered a magazine of practical wisdom . In fables , dialogues , and familiar letters , in poems and allegories , imitated , translated , or original , he alike endeavored to please and to teach lessons of goodness . It may be said of Herder , that he passed his life in tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cherishing in himself and others a love of learning , creating as it were anew the thoughts of the wise and good , and always employed in disseminating a knowledge of what seemed to him the elements of virtue , and cherishing and promoting whatever can improve or adorn humanity . And what is humanity ? Herder would have answered , the best part of human nature ; the sum of good affections , generous dispositions , and noble principles of action , by which man is capable of being moved and guided . This idea of humanity was one , which possessed his affections and his reverence . It was the favorite subject of his thoughts , and he delighted to believe and to gather proofs , that men are becoming more and more humane . Others have loved to revile mankind , in the bitter spirit of satire , with the vindictive temper of misanthropy , to speak evil , not of the manners of their own times only , but of human nature , and so to deny the best and most cheering part of the creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human folly or crime . He felt that the world is full of beauty and excellence , and that man is the fairest and most exalted part of the visible creation , and , being by the character of his mind opposed to that cold and distrustful selfishness , which will not confide in others , he loved to warm his heart with contemplating the examples of purity and disinterested virtue , of highminded patriotism and ardent devotedness to the welfare of mankind . And he , who is conversant with Herder 's writings , will be disposed to think , that the world has been rich in such examples , and that men , who have been gifted beyond measure by a bountiful and gracious Providence , have almost always associated the light of virtue with the brilliancy of genius . Herder was the son of a poor Prussian schoolmaster . He received his literary education in I ( 6nigsberg , at a. time , // when the chair of philosophy in that very respectable univei'sity was filled by Kant , who , as a metaphysician , has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though Herder devoted himself eagerly to the study of theology , yet he was deeply interested in pursuits , connected with philosophy and elegant literature . Hardly twentyone years of age , amidst all his cares as a responsible instructer at the Gymnasium of Riga , he came before the public in 1765 , pith criticisms on the men and subjects , which then attracted most generally the attention of his countrymen . German literi*-ture had received a powerful impulse , and was rapidly rising ; Herder felt the inspiration , which had been breathed into Klopstock and Lessing , and the other fine minds of that day , and was desirous of accomplishing his part in guiding the taste and thoughts of the public . Though so young he wrote with freedom , and considering that a public declaration of opinion must be a sincere one , he did not reason coldly on matters of taste , but communicated his ideas and sentiments with all that warmth , in which they existed in his mind . His manner was not without pretensions , but his work was obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his end with unwavering steadiness , and expressed himself with youthful sincerity . In this he acted wisely . If a young man dares to praise and blame those , whose reputation is already established , it is his safest course to explain the impressions , which their works have made upon himself , and to tell the truth frankly . Indeed , even in despotic countries , this has appeared the least dangerous plan of action , and the least likely to give offence . How shall you contrive , ' said the duke of Burgundy to the Abb* Choisy , to insert in your history , that Charles the Sixth was a fool ? ' My Lord , ' replied he , I shall say , he was a fool . ' Lewis the Fourteenth began censuring his historian , Mezerai , for delineating Lewis * There is no justice in considering Kant , as the only great writer on metaphysics in Germany . He was the earliest in point of time , in the new school , but Fichte has at this time certainly as many followers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konigsherg . In Fichte 's Addresses to the Germap nation , delivered in Berlin , many excellent , and withal some very ext*avagant notions on the subject of education , may he found . His little treatise on the end of man , Ueber die Bestimmung des . Tttenschen , is well fitted to convey a general idea of his manner , while its doctrine will please those , who do not disregard the speculative sciences , and are not disposed to sneer at contemplative habits of thought . // the Eleventh as a tyrant . Sire , ' replied he , with great humility , why was he a tyrant ? ' The criticisms of Herder were well received , notwithstanding their novelty and boldness , for the German public , not less than any other , is willing now and then , that new opinions should be started , and ancient prejudices be somewhat alarmed , especially if the new opinions are just ones . Lessing , whose thoughts and criticisms are always clear and discriminating , prophecied of the young scholar , that he would either become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . It did not long remain a question , which of these he would become . Supported by an inward consciousness of worth , and a pleasant foreboding of his future usefulness and honor , he confirmed his independence in thought and action , and soon began to enjoy the honors , which a vast nation pays to its literary benefactors , the guardians of its morals , and the patient instructers of its youth . To one , who has not considered how much may be accomplished by uninterrupted industry , how large the prospect is , which the student may command from his seclusion , it may seem impossible , that Herder should have known so many languages , and the literature contained in them , and have known them so well . But he not only wrote on subjects connected with letters , like a man of taste and feeling , but also on subjects of theology like a man of learning . His Letters relating to the Study of Theology are full of instruction and good sentiments , and his work On the Spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowth , is full of original , profound , and interesting criticism , exhibiting the majesty of the Scriptures in many new views , and illustrating the rich imagery , the brilliant and sublime thoughts and language of the ancient prophets . Herder reverenced the inspired men as the oracles of God , only in so far as revelations of wisdom and goodness are common to all the superior minds , with which Providence has blessed the world . Whilst these views are rejected , there still can be hut one opinion of the successful effort , which he has made to vindicate the character of the Hebrew Scriptures , and illustrate their claim to admiration for the beauties of their poetry . // While yet in the vigor of early manhood , after his mind had been enlarged by travelling in his own country , and a part of Pi7ance , and after having passed five years at the court of the enlightened Prince of Buckeburg , Herder was invited to accept a professorship in theology at G6ttingen , a university , then and still distinguished for the learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous members . His election was made ineffectual by a circumstance of rare occurrence . The reigning king of England , in the exertion of his power as king of Hanover , and Rector of the University of Gdttingen , put a negative upon the appointment , because his majesty was informed , that Herder 's religious opinions were not orthodox . We make no comment on such an exertion of arbitrary power . The German princes at home were far more free and more just . They recognised the truth of the fact , that religion does not suffer from freedom of inquiry , that by the conditions of our being , the elevating feelings and faith , which connect man with his Maker , appear under the most various forms , and are modified by the different circumstances of times and couiatries , by national character , and the diversity in the intellectual habits of all reasoning men . Herder received from the duke of Weimar an invitation to repair to his court , to be at the head of the clergy in his small but highly respectable dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors , to be , in the walks of literature , the associate of Goethe , Wieland , and Schiller . This was a glorious triumph after his short disappointment in his earlier prospects . It was here in Wei. mar , that the last half of Herder 's life was passed in quiet but uninterrupted activity . While he found much leisure for disseminating his own views of what is worthy of admiration or imitation , he filled a large space of active duty . Besides his labors as a preacher , and as the head of the church , he was diligently watchful over schools , and unwearied in his efforts to improve them . A volume of his works contains a collection of essays , and addresses , on subjects connected with education . It is not necessary to say , that he at all times insists on a liberal treatment of boys , and believes in the possibility of instilling into young minds a love of virtue and knowledge , a love , which fear could only check , and personal emulation corrupt . He died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Herder 's reputation as a writer rests principally upon his works in prose . His mind , we have said , was of a poetic character , yet not inventive , and his sensibility to the beautiful and his lively and busy fancy never conducted him to high original efforts in verse . In his writings in prose everything is expressed with warmth and life . His thoughts are communicated under the most various forms and images ; and his style would seem gorgeous , were it not at once clear and natural . There is in it a profusion of figures , hut not a display of them ; he makes use of them , because it was the most natural way for him to express his thoughts . They arose under such forms in his own mind , and he communicates them , as they existed within him . But for this he could be accused of an excess of ornament ; but with him comparisons and the figures of rhetoric are not the efforts of art , but natural modes of expression , and he at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet not always with elegance , or taste . Few of his works can be recommended as finished performances , or of universal interest . His phi ... losophical reflections on the history of man are written in a solemn and contemplative mood , and exhibit , perhaps , most fairly his private character not less than his merits as a Writer . The influence of Herder on his age was wide , and entirely beneficial to the best interests of our race ; he has been extensively read and admired , and always with results beneficial to morals and sentiments of philanthropy . A place can not be assigned him among the great lights of the world ; but he bore a high rank among his contemporaries , and was a blessing and an honor to his age . We return from these general criticisms , to say a few words on a work , which Herder designed , and to a certain extent was enabled to execute . In 1778 and 1779 he undertook to collect , and faithfully transfer to his own language the most beautiful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing the national feelings of different ages and races to exhibit distinctly the common features of human nature . The noblest bards were to be assembled , and each to express the spirit of the people to which he belonged , so that from the most various national tones , the harmony of all with one common nature might be apparent . It was a noble idea , thus to assemble the representatives of popular feeling from all parts // of the world and all periods of history , that they might unite in hearing testimony to humanity , the affections , and moral rectitude . Among the poems thus selected there are many of exquisite beauty and intrinsic value ; hut for the most part they are curious , as specimens of the literature of the wspective nations , to which their authors belonged . We should be glad to enter into a comparison of the several poems , were not the subject so extensive a one . Instead , therefore , of undertaking anything so arduous , we will only ask leave , before parting from our readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have hardly merit enough to amuse a few moments of their leisure . They are by authors of different countries , neither of whom has ever before been mentioned in our pages . The first is from Rist , a man of some consideration in his time . He lived from 1607 to 1667 , wrote many hymns , and knew how to express commonplace thoughts in correct language . His works are now quite forgotten . Yet Herder thought one of his songs worth preserving . It follows . TO A FLOWER . That thou bloomest in colors the fairest , That the sun paints the robe thou wearest , That thou rt splendid in purple and gold , Can my Rose without envy behold . That the bee so often caresses thee , That the sick man so often blesses thee , And physicians report thou canst heal , This my Rose hath no wish to conceal . For in these and in all things beside , Her perfection can laugh at thy pride ; Thou art first of the flowers of the field All that s created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away Thy bright hues-of what use are they ? Oft lurks poison thy leaves beneath Oft thy juices lead to death . What is beauty , that can not speak ? What are flowers , which any may break ? What is grace , that can sing no song ? Nothing to Rose , to whom hearts belong . // Jan . What makes heaven of earthly hours , What in beauty surpasses the flowers , What with Philomel 's voice may compare , What is purer than pearls and more rare , What bath friendliness ' winning art , What by virtue can quicken the heart , What hath charms , that never will fade , Makes my Rose a faultless maid . These verses are translated in the rhythm of the original , and with the exception of two or three lines are literally rendered . The following little Anacreontic song is by Meli , a Sicilian professor of chemistry . We fluid his works collected and published in five volumes at Paleruno , 1785 . Meli is , we believe , universally regarded as the happiest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one , which we cite , is on the lip of his mistress . A SICILIAN SONG . Tell me , whither art thou going , Where so early , little bee ? Still no beam of day is glowing Oi* the hills so near to thee . Still the dews of night are sparkling Everywhere along the wold ; Heed thee , lest thou injure , darkling , Thy wee wings , so fine with gold . See , the languid flowers are sleeping , Pillow mid the leaves their heads , Softly closed their eyelids keeping , Rest upon their downy beds . But still onwards thou art flying , Onwards still , and firr away Tell me , whither art thou hying , Little bee , thus ere the day ? Is t for honey ? Why this fleetness ? Shut thy wings , arid haste no more , I will show thee , where its sweetness Rests in unexhausted store . // Little wanderer , hast thou never Seen my Nice 's beauteous eyes ? On her lips there s honey ever ; Sweetness there forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , On my lovely maiden 's lip , There is honey , purest , rarest , Thither come and freely sip . This song is found in the first volume of Meli 's poetic works . Another entitled Li Capiddi , in the same volume , is exceedingly lively , and a favorite with the Italians .
