PREFACE . The present period , when all are anxiously expecting a visit to our city from the early champion and steady friend of Columbia 's freedom , appeared peculiarly appropriate to the production of a dramatic sketch , founded on events of the hero 's history . Perhaps there never were scenes in real life , which gave more unbounded scope to the imagination of the poet , or a finer field for the fancy of the skilful dramatist . The romantic intrepidity of the gallant youths , their noble devotion to the dangerous task , give an interest to their endeavours , independent of the character of the great man in whose behalf they laboured . Notwithstanding all these facilities , the story is too well known , the number of actors too small , and the incidents , uncommon and striking as they are , too few , to form without some additions , alterations , and transpositions , a piece that would suit the genius of the stage in its present state of perfection . The author hopes , that the liberties he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With regard to the omission of Dr. Bolman , the associate of Huger , this apology is offered , that he , being actuated by the same spirit of chivalrous daring , that animated his companion , the noble sentiments of the one would but be echoed by the other , thus producing a useless repetition equally tiresome and injudicious . If the character of the great La Fayette , be thought irreverently treated , if he be not placed in that exalted point of view , which he holds in the estimation of every American , let the fault be ascribed to its true cause , the youth and inexperience of the author , and not to an insensibility to the claims of valour and virtue . Among the numerous objections , which it is anticipated will be advanced against the following trifle , the paucity of the active DRAMATIS PERSON will not be one of the least ; to which there is this reply :  --  That it was considered that the introduction of more interlocutors than were absolutely necessary to carry on the piece , would deteriorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of La Fayette and Huger , for the same reason the indulging in those sinuosities of plot of late years so much in use , has , as much as possible , been avoided . With these remarks the author commits the piece to the public , stating however , that it was commenced subsequently to the arrival of our illustrious Guest , and was ready for publication in three days after the date of its commencement . Philadelphia , Aug. 1824 . DRAMATIS PERSON . La Fayette Huger Count Archo . ( The Military Commandant . ) Spicket Jerry Judge Lieutenant of the Fortress of Olmutz .

Written by a friend of the Author . The days are past , when to the captive maid , The high-born noble gave his lance 's aid ; When the weak cry imprison 'd beauty sent , Her dungeon 's portals from their hinges rent ; Brought the bright sabre , and the trusty spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrench 'd from the tyrants grasp his trembling prey , The victor 's guerdon for his bold essay  --  These days are past , but still in later time , Live deeds as daring , virtues as sublime , Souls , that would spurn the coward 's odious name , And pluck from danger 's front a deathless fame . Such were the souls that left enjoyment 's bow'rs , And sought dark Olmutz , and her frowning tow'rs , The champion of Columbia 's rights to save , And give that Freedom , which to her he gave . To stay their course , vain was each coward fear , Honor , their pole star , led their bright career , Fame , hung effulgent o'er their weary way , The Hero 's star to guide them where he lay , This is a theme whose deathless scenes require , The pen of Shakspeare , and Apollo 's lyre , Yet does our author aim his leaf to join , To the green laurels that around them twine . To add one flow'ret to the sweets that breathe , From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaflet bask in beauty 's smile , Let but the flow'ret bourgeon there awhile , ' Twill grace the chaplet of a nation 's praise , Blend with its laurels , bloom among its bays , And with the bright assemblage join to crown The Hero 's temples with deserv 'd renown . Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  OLMUTZ . A public room in the " Fly Inn , " Chairs , Tables , &c.; &c.; Enter Spicket , Mr Spicket Singing . Bookworms may write , and say what they will , But mar'age is a dam 'd bitter pill , To swallow  --  Oh , Spicket ! Spicket ! Why did you ever marry ? Why did you thrust your neck into the hymeneal noose ? Would I had gotten the lock-jaw when I opened my mouth to say I took Mrs. Spicket as my true and lawful wife . But what 's done ca n't be undone . I have launched myself into the stream of matrimony , and I must weather it out . Such a wife too , as I am yoked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Megra : and the melody of her voice can only be outvied by the dulcet notes of the Screech-owl . Oh ! Spicket ! Spicket ! why did you not prefer a hard crust , and single blessedness , to a wife , and hell upon earth . I wonder where in the devil 's name she has put herself . I hav'nt heard the sound of her voice for these five minutes  --  that 's extraordinary , and well worth a prominent place among the list of remarkable circumstances . Lord ! Lord ! what can have occurred  --  by all that is to be hoped for , perhaps she has gone off in an apoplectic fit , or made too frequent appeals to her Eau de Cologne , as she calls her ardent spirits , and I , left a disconsolate , unhappy , mourning widower  --  oh ! oh ! ( affecting to cry ) married but just five days , and so soon to be left a single man  --  hey ? Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ( without ) Spicket ! Mr. Spicket ! Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spicket Oh ! the devil take you . I say ( aloud ) , Here my love . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ( without ) Where are you Mr. Spicket ? Spicket . Mr Spicket Curse the old crone ! ( aside ) Here , this way my dear . Enter Mrs. Spicket . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Why did n't you answer when I called ? must I strain my feeble voice ? Spicket . Mr Spicket ( aside ) . Feeble voice ! ! oh lord ! oh lord ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket And eventually burst a blood vessel  --  Spicket . Mr Spicket ( aside ) . That would be a gladsome hearing . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket If it was n't for my morning bitters , I should have fainted under the exertion I used in halloing after you . ( takes a bottle from her pocket and drinks . ) Delightful restorative ! Spicket . Mr Spicket So I should think , by the quantity you swallow . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket My late husband , Solomon Corkbottle , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr Spicket So you have often told me . What a pity he pop 'd off so soon , he ought to have lived as an example to the world of what a husband should be ; you clearly evinced the respect you had for his memory and the sorrow you experienced at his dissolution , by marrying me two weeks after . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket My charms and person demanded it . I was fearful of those villains that are ever on the watch to seize on and ruin such youthful artlessness as mine , so , to baulk any designs against my innocence and honour , I determined to have a husband 's protection . But oh ! what a change have I made for the worse ! Spicket . Mr Spicket ( aside ) Ditto ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Better would it have been for me , to have remained exposed to the foes of virtue , than to have chosen such a person as you are for the partner of my board and bed . But , as I was observing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave my bed chamber , without coming to hand me down stairs . Would you believe it ? we quarrelled but six times during the honey-moon . Spicket . Mr Spicket Curse me if I would . Why ! the very night we were married you rung such a peal about my ears that I have scarcely gotten over it yet . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Had I not good reason , did n't you want to  --  Spicket . Mr Spicket Do n't mention it . ( shading his face with his hand )  --  Spare my blushes Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Pray , now I think of it , who was that ? What female was't you were talking to before I came in ? Spicket . Mr Spicket I talking to ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Yes , do n't pretend to deny it . Spicket . Mr Spicket I was talking to myself  --  soliloquising a trifle , and enumerating some of the blessings and curses of matrimony . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket I do n't believe a word of it . Spicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me say , that when once married persons doubt the sincerity of their partners , suspicion and jealousy not long after follow . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket I thought  --  I 'm sure I heard a woman 's voice : and I 'll be convinced to the contrary before I 'm done , or , I 'll know the reason why . Spicket . Mr Spicket I tell you Mrs. Spicket , there has been no one in the room this morning but myself . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket I believe you are deceiving me , Mr. Spicket . You presume on my warm affection for you , but I will not be trifled with . My life on it now , you have some sly minx concealed here , but I 'll ferret out the unchaste wench ( flies in a passion about the room , looking under the tables , &c.); Spicket . Mr Spicket There now she 's at it . Now she 's in one of her infernal jealous tantarums ( aside ) . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Tell me where the slut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I never convince you madam , of my sincerity . On my soul , no other female but yourself , has entered here this morning . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Oh ! cruel , faithless man , you want to kill me . Spicket . Mr Spicket Mrs. Spicket , how can you suppose  --  Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Cease , you do . I know you do want to kill me . O ! my head grows dizzy  --  I faint  --  a chair  --  oh !  --  oh !  --  oh !  --  Why do n't you bring me a chair ? you blockhead . Spicket . Mr Spicket ( places a chair ) There ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket So  --  oh dear  --  cruel man  --  I faint . Oh ! oh ! ( affects to faint ) Some water  --  oh !  --  Spicket . Mr Spicket Damme but she 's at her tricks again . ( aside )  --  Some water  --  yes , you shall have some water . ( he runs off . ) Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh ! Enter Spicket , running in with a bowl of water . Spicket . Mr Spicket Damme but I 'll souse her . ( aside ) Mrs. Spicket , my dear here 's water for you . ( flings it into her face . ) Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ( jumping up and running off . ) You 'd better drown me . Spicket . Mr Spicket Ha ! ha ! ha ! I 've watered her enough for a time , however . I wish I could wash off her infernal temper as easily as I can her fainting fit . Ha ! ha ! mum ! here she comes . By all that 's damnable ! blowing a hurricane . Enter Mrs. Spicket . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Once for all Mr. Spicket , where have you hid your concubine ? Where have you stowed the filthy thing ? Tell me ! and perhaps I may be inclined to clemency . Spicket . Mr Spicket Now it is my turn . ( aside ) Let me tell you Mrs. Spicket , these suspicions are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs Spicket Well , well , for this time I will believe you . Spicket . Mr Spicket ' T is as little as you can do , to do me that justice . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Let us then drop the subject and be friends . Let this embrace prove the sincerity of my words . Spicket . Mr Spicket ( avoiding her embrace ) Let me tell you Mrs. Spicket , I am tired of the life you lead me , a dog 's life is content to it . Forever suspecting my fidelity . Scolding and picking at me , morning , noon and night ; although we have not been married a week . I 'll be master . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Well ! and so you are . Spicket . Mr Spicket Aye , but you 're master and mistress both . It is no wonder we have no customers , the sound of your voice is enough to scare any chance person that might pass this way and had an idea of entering . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a Virago . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ... You are a cruel  --  Spicket . Mr Spicket Tartar ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Perfidious ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Scolding ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Unkind ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Ranting ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Vile ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Bawling ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Wretch ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Doxey ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Unmindful ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Termigant ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket False ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Wrinkled ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Faithless ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Fusty ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Man ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Woman ! Yes , you are a cross-grained , foul-mouthed , incorrigible , ugly old she devil . ( Walking up and down in a great passion . ) Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Why did you marry me , Sir ? Spicket . Mr Spicket How could I help myself madam ? Was n't I a poor itinerant student , and was n't I taken ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and when I recovered did n't you threaten me with a prison , and then offered me your hand ? Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket I , ask you to marry me ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Yes ; leaving it to myself , to choose either your arms or a prison 's walls , so to save myself from being confined in a jail I married you five days ago , and became in name master , or landlord of the " Fly Inn . " O ! that I had chosen a dungeon 's gloom instead of your meagre arms . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ' T is all a base falsehood . There were many your betters , that were ready enough to snap at me if I would have had them . Let me tell you with my fortune I might have had even a Baron . But this all comes of my too fond affection for you . Spicket . Mr Spicket Oh ! curse such affection I say . ( looking out ) But come , put on a cheerful countenance , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the present . Enter Huger and Jerry , with a portmanteau . Jerry . Jerry ( aside ) Looks as if there had been cloudy weather  --  a little cat and dog play . I take it . Huger . Huger Can my servant and myself be accommodated with lodgings ? Spicket . Mr Spicket Aye , sir , and a hundred more . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ( glancing at her husband ) Any females , sir . Spicket . Mr Spicket ( aside to his wife ) Do n't be troubling them with questions . Huger . Huger None . Jerry . Jerry Women are troublesome affairs for travellers , what with their trunks and cases , band-boxes and bundles , there 's but little , if any comfort in travelling with them . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ( to Huger ) Would you please to take something after your journey ? Huger . Huger For myself , not any thing , perhaps tho ' my servant here , may be differently inclined . ( retires up the stage . ) Jerry . Jerry Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good natured stomachs , that is content with fresh air for a breakfast , but a voracious maw , that will not be satisfied but with substantials ;  --  good substantials , mistress ! So hark'ee , bring me something delicious to alleviate my hunger with , and as I am devilish sharp set , you may provide a plate of mush and molasses with your other things . Mr. and Mrs. Spicket . Mr Spicket , Mrs Spicket What ! Mush and molasses ! Jerry Jerry Aye , What do you stare at ? Mush and molasses . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Long as I have been mistress of an Inn , I never heard of the dish . Jerry . Jerry No ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket No . Jerry . Jerry Now I 'll be darn 'd if that do n't beat a mackerel . Nor ever heard of hominey I suppose ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket No , sir . Jerry . Jerry Nor buck-wheat cakes ! Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Never heard of such cakes . Jerry . Jerry Well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mackerel ! Well bring me some of your slops . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Slops ! We have none . Jerry . Jerry He ! he ! he ! if that do n't beat a mackerel  --  what odd folks ! I 'm hungry , bring me something to eat . Do you understand that ? Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket Oh yes , sir .  --  Queer folks these . ( aside . ) Exeunt Mr. and Mrs. S. Jerry . Jerry O master . Huger . Huger Well Jerry . ( rising and coming to the front . ) Jerry . Jerry May I never again touch hot corn if these here folks knew what mush and molasses was . He ! he ! fit ar n't equal to a shad 's climbing up a tree . Huger . Huger Jerry you must recollect that you are now in a foreign land  --  in a place where the manners and peculiarities of our beloved country are but little known . Jerry . Jerry So it would seem master , but its tarnation queer , that 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter servant with breakfast , and exit . What have we here tea and coffee , stewed and broiled ,  --  excellent  --  that will do  --  that will do . ( eats ) These rolls are good , very good  --  yes , this will do . Huger . Huger ( coming in front of the stage ) At length we have reached Olinutz . ' T is within the gloomy walls of her Fortress , that the injured and god-like La Fayette lies incarcerated Yes ! in a dark , humid and filthy dungeon lies manacled and imprisoned that Champion of Freedom  --  that friend of Liberty  --  that generous philanthropist  --  that second Washington  --  La Fayette  --  But it shall not be said there was not one American that strove to extricate the greatest friend of his country from the chains of slavery and oppression Heartless indeed must I have been , could I have remained inactive and unconcerned as to the fate of a man whom I had ever been taught to venerate as more than mortal . Oh no , my blood boiled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of honour , and a nations rights , had vilely and ignobly seized upon the brave Fayette and confined him like a criminal in a dungeon , when , trusting to his generosity he sought protection in his land from the daggers of his own ungrateful countrymen . For nearly five years has he languished in prison . But heaven has inspired me with the idea that I might with my individual efforts release him from bondage , with this fond hope did I leave America , friends , family , a young and blooming bride , scarce one little month united to me  --  Oh thou ! who lookest upon good men 's deeds be propitious to my design , let me only be the means of giving freedom to one who so valiantly fought and bled for America  --  let me but be the means of unclasping the fretting and galling chains that fetter his body , restore him to liberty and the bosom of his family , and I care not how soon after my life shall terminate  --  I must proceed with caution . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fidelity I can not doubt . Firmness and courage are requisite for the success of my plan , I must examine him further . The least want of firmness may blast my project forever , and bring both of our lives into jeopardy . Prudence direct and Providence guide me . Jerry . Jerry ( rising and walking front ) Well master , I have finished  --  that is to say I have satisfied a certain craving void called my belly , and I am now ready to attend to whatever duty you may impose upon me . Huger . Huger You know Jerry for what I left America . Jerry . Jerry Aye , do I  --  to perform an angel 's part  --  to free from a d  --  d black hole of a dungeon , America 's best friend the Marquis De La Fayette . Heaven assist you and bless him , I say . If you will listen to me sir , I will tell you a story about him . Huger . Huger Willingly . Jerry . Jerry Well sir , I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate the story . I never heard her speak about it without blubbering . You must know sir , my father was a revolutionary soldier , mother and I used to follow him in all his marches , and we did well enough while he lived , but one day in a skirmish with the British he was killed . Mother took on mightily at his death . It was a sad blow to be sure , for mother had n't one piece of copper to rub against another . The soldiers , who had known feyther used to give mother and I a mouthful now and then , but poor souls , they had n't half enough to eat themselves , and it was but little they could give us . I was a very small boy then , not so high . Mother used to try to laugh and sing to I , when I would cry for food , but the tears she said would run down her cheek , to think how she might get I a crum of bread to keep I from starvation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , with I in her arms , was huddling over a little , very little fire , and I was bawling for something to eat , and she praying God Almighty to send us food , a man in a cloak entered into the place we were sitting . He sat down and took I in his arms , and kissed I , and hugged I , and took cake from his pocket and gave I to eat . Mother says he was the sweetest , benevolentest looking person , she ever set eyes on . Well , sir , he talked awhile with mother , and when he left her he put a purse into her hands containing in silver and gold twenty pounds . Huger . Huger Noble , generous man ! Jerry . Jerry And all as true as the bible is no lie . Huger . Huger And your benefactor was  --  Jerry . Jerry ( with pride ) La Fayette ! Huger . Huger How knew you it was him ? Jerry . Jerry Mother recognized him riding beside General Washington  --  asked his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he always distributed his charity that way . Huger . Huger Glorious man ! Day by day , some new trait of thy exalted character is sounded in mine ear . Never shall I forget him . The image of his beloved , revered countenance , is engraven indelibly on my heart . When in America , a great part of his time was passed with my father , then a Colonel . They were like brothers , born of the same parent , suckled by the same breast . They fought  --  they eat  --  they slept together . Often did he dandle me on his knee , and e'en now methinks I can feel on my cheek the tepid touch of his affectionate kiss . ' T is to his intrepidity that I owe my life . Once I accidentally fell into an impetuous stream . He saw me fall , and it was but the work of a moment for him to plunge into the water and place me on land . From my youth upwards , scarcely a day has passed , without my wonder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the magnanimous Fayette . Can it be wonderful that I should forget the ties of nature in the wish to repay a debt of gratitude I owe to him for the preservation of my life , and the obtaining of the liberties of my country . Jerry . Jerry Your wife and friends wished you , I believe , master , to give over your design . Huger . Huger They did  --  " It will be " said they , " a vain , hazardous and unsuccessful attempt , and one which may perhaps cost you your life . " But " no , " returned I , " my heart is in it , " The champion of our country 's rights shall not pine and languish in a prison , without my making one personal essay for his emancipation  --  and willingly will I give up my life to enfranchise him , and break apart the chains of despotic slavery which confine him  --  Here we are in Olmutz , and near the prison of Fayette , and I shall commence my operations as soon as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huger Think'st thou , that thou couldst assist me ? Jerry . Jerry Try me  --  prove me. ( quickly and warmly ) Huger . Huger Thou wilt not play the coward then if danger track us. ( smiling ) Jerry . Jerry I must not boast of what I would do at such times , master . The proof of a pudding is in the eating of it ; man 's courage is shown in action , not by talk . I must own however , that in time of danger prudence dictates a timely use of my legs . But , sir , to feel fear in such a cause would be to act a disgraceful part , and I do believe if I were to turn coward at such a time , poor dead mother would appear to me in the shape of a ghost , and charge me with ingratitude . Huger . Huger Generous heart ! noble fellow ! I will trust you . Jerry . Jerry Will you sir ? You have made me the happiest fellow alive . Huger . Huger The Fortress where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and examine the place ; I 'll return anon . Be you careful not to let slip any word which might lead to a discovery . Jerry . Jerry Never fear me sir , I am a Yankee , and he who can outwit one must first catch a dormouse dancing a jig . Huger . Huger Remain here until I return . The Fortress where La Fayette is confined , is not far distant , I shall not be absent long . Exit . Jerry . Jerry There goes as brave a man as ever trod on earth . Heaven shower blessings down upon him , I say , and prosper his design ; and when I forget to love and be willing to die for him , may God forget me . Hard indeed would it be , if after his having left his wife , his parents and friends to come here in the endeavour to free Fayette , he should expose himself to the same fate . Our parson used to say : " Heaven looks with a benignant eye on virtuous deeds , " surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about so blessed a deed as the endeavour to free from slavery our country 's benefactor , the noble La Fayette . Here comes some one , I wonder if he be the landlord . Enter Spicket . Spicket . Mr Spicket Your servant , sir . Jerry . Jerry A fine Inn you keep here landlord . Spicket . Mr Spicket ' T is my endeavour to make every thing agreable , and I flatter myself I succeed pretty well . Jerry . Jerry You look young for an Innkeeper , how long have you been in your present occupation . Spicket . Mr Spicket Exactly a week come this day 12 o'clock . Jerry . Jerry Indeed ! married and just settled here , I guess . Spicket . Mr Spicket Just so . Jerry . Jerry And for your wife a rosy-cheeked , cherrylip 'd , young , buxom and dapper wench , hey ? Spicket . Mr Spicket No such a person . You saw a female when you came into the house ? Jerry . Jerry Aye . Your mother I suppose . Spicket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ha ! ha ! ha ! dang me if that do n't beat a mackerel . Come , you are joking with a traveller , ha ! ha ! ha ! your wife ! no that wont do . Spicket . Mr Spicket As I am a commoner and no king , my wife by all that 's lamentable . Jerry . Jerry The old one had the rhino , you but little or none , I suppose , and so you tickled the old lady into marriage  --  hey ? said I right ? Spicket . Mr Spicket Not quite . I was formerly an itinerant student , and travelled about the country teaching little chubby-faced village children their ABC 's , teaching the " young idea how to shoot , " as an English poet says . Jerry . Jerry He ! he ! I guess as how you soon taught them to bring down a bird on the wing . Lord ! though what a power of powder you must have used . Spicket . Mr Spicket You misunderstand me , I was speaking metaphorically  --  meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry O aye . Spicket . Mr Spicket I got along pretty well , when as the devil would have it , ( for it surely must have been the devil that lured me to this place ) I was taken ill at this Inn , without a sou in my pocket , and lay for some time in momentary expectation of being summoned to kingdom come . Jerry . Jerry Delightful predicament to be in truly . Spicket . Mr Spicket You may well say that . Well , when I recovered , the landlady , my old harridan of a wife , civilly told me I should go to prison for the money I owed her for boarding and attendance , unless I married her . So I was trap 'd . Jerry . Jerry Dang my buttons if that do nt beat a mackerel ! I declare I never heard the like . That 's just what I would call a take in ; how does she behave herself ? Spicket . Mr Spicket Behave herself ; continually like the devil , or one of his imps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do nt hear her melodious voice . Jerry . Jerry I do nt hear her . Spicket . Mr Spicket No : she is not within half a mile of your ears . She is gone out to enjoy a little agreable scandal chit chat with some of her neighbours  --  a fashionable diversion for females now-a-days . Jerry . Jerry But married a week ! Spicket . Mr Spicket Just . During which time we have had  --  let me see  --  yes  --  ten downright fights , six sparrings , and twelve squabbles , besides innumerable wordy contests . Perhaps you do nt quite understand me ; by downright fights I mean when we use all sorts of missiles to throw at each other , such as tables , chairs , brooms , brushes , pokers , tongs , shovels , flagons , pitchers and glasses . Sprees , are when we just use fisty cuffs , thus .

We have travelled much and rapidly of late and we will remain here for a time to recruit our strength . Spicket . Mr Spicket I hope to your master and self , I shall make every thing agreeable . We have'nt much here to be seen save the Fortress of Olmutz , where your country 's best friend , liberty 's dearest champion lies confined  --  the noble La Fayette . He fought bravely for American Independence . Jerry . Jerry ( with enthusiasm , quickly and proudly ) He fought like a God . Is any one permitted to visit him ? Spicket . Mr Spicket No . He lingers out his existence without hearing the voice of a friend , or even beholding a countenance of commiseration . Jerry . Jerry His wife not with him ? Spicket . Mr Spicket No . Government denies him even that consolation . But his wife I hear , unwearied , still offers petitions praying to see her husband . Jerry . Jerry ( choaking with suppressed feeling ) Dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . But surely his friends are permitted to write to him . Spicket . Mr Spicket No . It is deny 'd him either to receive or to write letters . Jerry . Jerry Then I fear our scheme is hopeless . ( aside ) How does he employ his time . Spicket . Mr Spicket In reading . Jerry . Jerry ( with interest ) Then he is allowed the use of books . Spicket . Mr Spicket He was suffered to retain some volumes . Jerry . Jerry Has he never left his dungeon . Spicket . Mr Spicket For a long time he was not permitted to behold even the countenance of his gaoler , but government has relaxed a little lately , in the severity of their treatment of him , and he is sometimes permitted to walk out attended by a couple of guards , and within sight of the Fortress . Mrs. Spicket . Mrs Spicket ( without . ) Mr. Spicket ! Mr. Spicket ! Mr. Spicket ! Spicket . Mr Spicket My wife by all that 's damnable .

I 've news for you . Huger . Huger Indeed ! our prospect brightens . Hope tells me we shall be successful . I have just come from conversing with La Fayette 's gaoler ; he pities his prisoner , but his integrity is incorruptible . Though his orders will not permit him to pass any letters to or from Fayette , I have prevailed upon him to let me send him a few books occasionally . Now listen , my plot is , on the margin of the books I send him , I will write in pencil mark and endeavour to awaken him to a sense of our design . If my plan succeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between us , which may for the present , brighten a few hours of his cheerless solitude and ultimately procure his deliverance from his blistering chains . Here , take this key and bring me from my portmanteau a volume of Racine , but stay , I 'll get it myself . Your province it shall be to deliver the book to the goaler , while I by playing an American air beneath his window , will arouse his attention . But come to my chamber and I 'll inform you further . Exeunt . ACT II . Scene I.  --  A dungeon in the Fortress of Olmutz . A rude table , jug and stool . In one corner of the room a wretched pallet , La Fayette discovered , heavily chained . Fayette . La Fayette No it will not be ; sleep , the dewy nurse of nature , flies a stranger from me  --  to me she offers not the golden goblet of sweet cordial . Ah , that I had but a draught of Lethe 's stream , that I might drink a long oblivion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy energy ? No , I will not despond . But when I think of France , my wife , my children , it goes nigh to break my sinking heart . And for what have I been immured ? for endeavouring to bring my own oppressed countrymen to a sense of their bondage , in endeavouring to exhibit to them the blessings of a free people ; to show them how to live , have I been insulted , degraded laughed at , scoffed at , and imprisoned . Oh God , how is it that for this that man can hunt and persecute his fellow man . But why lament , if men will hug their chains , kiss the lash of steel , and bow to the yoke of an oppressive tyrant , why let them . But who can behold his country 's laws trampled upon and insulted , and not feel his soul rise with indignation . My wife , my beloved offspring where are you now ? perhaps exposed to the insults of a lawless mob , for being the progeny of Fayette . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you , sir . Fay .

La Fayette My prattling little ones ? M. Fay . Madame La Fayette Well , quite well . Fay . La Fayette God I thank thee ! ( with fervor ) . Poor little ones , I fear they 'll never more know a father 's fondness . M. Fay .

And yet my soul is still oppressed with sorrow , when I think that my misfortunes have brought thy constant goodness to suffer with me . Pray tell me love , how I see thee here ; how is it that my cruel tormentors have allowed me an indulgence as sudden as it was unexpected ? Yes , here I see thee , hold thee , ( pressing her to his bosom ) press thee to me now . M. Fay .

Madame La Fayette Oh , Fayette , why dost thou use such language to a heart like mine , it probes it too , too deeply . Talk not thus unless you wish my heart to drop blood ; despair not , the order for thy release will ere long be obtained . The Americans have , and still continue to present petitions for thy emancipation ; even England has interposed and though the emperor now is inexorable , he can not always continue as callous . Fay . La Fayette ( with a faint smile . ) It may be , love . M. Fay . Madame La Fayette But prithee tell me , how dost thou spend thy tedious , melancholy time ? Fay . La Fayette By bringing thee and my loved children before my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me than the substance of all the world besides  --  then of France , of poor degraded France  --  No matter , I have thee now and fate may do her worst .

La Fayette Ha ! what music is that ? No , yes it is the national air of my beloved America . What can be the meaning of it ; at such a place ' t is strange . ( Rises and approaches the grated window . ) Cruel bars they will not let me see beneath . ( Huger plays as before . ) Again those notes , how sweetly they fall upon my ear , they bring to my recollection the times , the happy times I passed with my brother in arms  --  the saviour of America  --  George Washington .

What hope of success can you hold out to your magnanimous deliverer ? Fay . La Fayette Listen ; I am suffered occasionally to walk out , attended by a couple of guards a league or two from the Fortress : my unknown friend and myself may overpower and disarm my guards , and under the favour of Heaven , escape , ere alarm can be given .

And now sir , you are aware of the danger you are in , you 'll perhaps be more guarded in your answers . What are you ? Huger . Huger ( proudly ) An American . Judge . Judge You are now , sir , brought before this court to answer for interfering in the cause of justice , in assisting the condemned traitor , La Fayette , to escape . Huger Huger ( indignantly ) ' T is false ! he is no traitor , and I more glory in being the means of rescuing from tyranny and misery a man I esteem as one of the first characters upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . nature ; than if , instead of being arraigned before a criminal tribunal , I were now about to have a regal diadem seated upon my head .

Count Archo aside A brave , courageous spirit by Heavens ! Judge . Judge I am as much at a loss to account for the intrepidity of your behaviour , as I am to know what were the motives which actuated your conduct in the affair at present before us . Was La Fayette related to you ? Huger . Huger He was not . Judge . Judge You were intimately acquainted . Huger . Huger Not personally . Judge . Judge This cause bears a singular appearance  --  ( thoughtfully ) I can not understand . Although you are not compelled to answer , or I to demand of you the motives which instigated you to act as you have done , may I enquire what they were ? Huger . Huger Will you hear them ? Then listen : Scarcely had I learned to lisp my childish thoughts before I was taught to bless La Fayette , and to remember him in my infant orisons . As years rolled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manhood , each day was my wonder and astonishment excited , as I listened to a detail of his magnanimous actions  --  his daring intrepidity  --  his devotion to the cause of Liberty , my love and veneration for him changed into adoration , and I contemplated him not as a man , as something more than human  --  as a God . Judge . Judge ( rather scornfully . ) Proceed , proceed . Huger . Huger When I learned that this man , who in his rosy prime , and manly beauty , e 're nineteen vernal suns had shed their beams upon him , had , despite the displeasure of his monarch , unsheathed his blade , and enrolled himself under the banner of my country , then reduced to almost the lowest ebb of misery , hopeless of aid and sinking under the heavy lash of it 's iron handed oppressors and proclaiming himself the champion of Liberty , fighting with the brave in the general cause , watching the cold and timid , stimulating the wavering , and assisting with his counsels  --  was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could I , I an American , hear of the benefactor of my Country pining away in a dungeon , and remain untouched with a sense of his misery ?  --  No :  --  Had I felt cold and unmoved I would have been an ingrate , worthy only of the contempt of the world while living , its obloquy when dead . When I saw the petitions which every friend of liberty and humanity presented to your kingly master for his deliverance , were disregarded , I vowed , ( and the oath was registered in Heaven 's high chancery ) to free him , or perish in the attempt . I have kept my oath , La Fayette is free  --  Judge . Judge Dare not to utter aught against the justice of our royal master . A more dangerous man than La Fayette does not live . Huger . Huger ( with indignation ) . And for what is he dangerous ?

" When in the scowl of the giddy multitude , it was evident that the life he would have sacrificed with delight to the public welfare was aimed at by the dagger of the assassin ; distracted by the view of evils he could not prevent , and forseeing the miseries that would speedily fall on a deluded people , he retired a voluntary exile , to seek an asylum in a foreign land , where unnoticed and unknown , he might pity and lament them . " Judge . Judge I 'll hear no more . Huger . Huger A word more and I 've finished . Yet without the slightest commiseration for his state while journeying to his retreat , showing no disposition to hostility , uttering no word that could offend , or that could be construed into a wish to disseminate the principles of his own political creed , was he , contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrested , and conducted here to Olmutz , to suffer every rigour of persecution in solitude and in a dungeon . Judge . Judge I 'll hear no more ; you rush upon your fate . Justice will be speedy . Huger . Huger Justice ! Judge . Judge Had you have been less presumptuous , you might have been recommended to the clemency of the Emperor . Huger . Huger Clemency ! how can I expect it from a man who did not act with justice even to La Fayette . Judge . Judge Silence ! no more . He appears to be engaged in talking to the civil officers . Ad . Adeline O Francis ! I fear that your inconsiderate warmth has steeled the hearts of your judges against you . Huger . Huger I fear not their displeasure , sweet . Judge .

Judge . Judge He has . Ad . Adeline And was he not disposed to mercy ? Judge . Judge The offence was too great to admit of his showing any . ' T is true , our orders were that if we found on his examination , that he manifested any contrition for his daring behaviour , we might mitigate the rigour of his sentence ; but as he not only glories in what he has done , but has questioned the justice of our royal master , and exhibited the most inveterate contempt for our laws , we must pronounce the sentence of the court . Ad . Adeline Can a heart , possessed of any claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disinterested friendship , treat with rigour an intrepid youth , whose generous ardour in a cause he idolized , constituted the only crime alledged against him ; can the conduct of such an emperor be palliated .

" What ! can justice forbid the voice of nature to be heard ? " Judge . Judge We trifle , I must read the sentence . Ad . Adeline Then read , and let me know the worst I have to suffer . Read , read . Judge . Judge The court 's award is this : ( reads ) That the prisoner be put to death ; to be executed by hanging , at sunrise to-morrow morning . Huger .

If one spark of pity hold a place in you , if sweet humanity and soft mercy rule you , hear me . Recal your words ; speak  --  I ask but one word  --  one single word of hope .

Yes ; my heart tells me that it would . Does she not use me as a fool ? True . But am I not deserving of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear her ? Why not claim my just prerogative ?

Confidence direct and prosper my intention , and fortune second my attempt to bring her under who bears so high a head . Come , now , I feel marvellously excited with the idea of pulling down my wife a little . I hear her stirring , she has missed me already , and is coming with all haste after me . There 's nothing like striking while the iron 's hot , I 'll begin now , and my motto shall be . He is a fool , and merits every ill , Who bows and cringes to a woman 's will . Mrs. Spic .

Adeline ( She starts up , under the impression of her dream ) Look there !  --  the scaffold  --  the victim is my husband  --  no , no , you shall not murder him  --  hold off  --  loose your ruffian hands  --  Who is it intercepts my way and keeps me from my husband .

Who are you that set your eyes on me  --  a man  --  there 's no trusting men they are all cruel  --  cruel .  --  Huger . Huger Dost thou not know me love ? Ad . Adeline ( Gazing on her husband for a time then recollecting him throw herself into his arms ) My husband ! Huger . Huger My sweet wife ! Ad . Adeline O , my husband such a dream  --  I saw the scaffold surrounded by the giddy multitude  --  the gibbet  --  the man of death and you  --  you my husband were there ( shuddering ) ' T was but a dream  --  they shall not tear thee from me . Huger . Huger Oh , my Adeline , call back thy wonted energy of mind , that fortitude which bade thee here to follow me . Ad . Adeline Then I was in search of him who made life precious to me , oh , ' t is terrible to think that I have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huger . Huger But I will die in a glorious cause Adeline . Ad . Adeline By an inglorious death . Huger . Huger Ah , that is the severest pang of all  --  ' t is the manner of my dying only that makes the thought of death bitter , but let us not think of that , I have accomplished my enterprize , La Fayette is free and I shall die content . Ad . Adeline And I be left to perish  --  despised and unknown in a foreign land . Huger . Huger Say not so my love , that God who loves and cherishes virtue , will protect you from every harm , and send you friends . Ad . Adeline You are my only friend  --  my hope  --  my stay  --  my life ; I wish none other . Destitute of thee I will wander about all loneliness , like the poor tender dove that has lost its mate , pine , droop , and die ; and strangers will lay me in the grave . Huger . Huger Oh , speak not thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe . Oh , then be calm , and let the few sad moments that I 've left , be passed in preparing for my fate . Cease then my love nor wound my soul with thy passionate exclamations . My doom is irrevocable . I must die  --  death , Adeline , has no terror for me . Ad . Adeline Death shall unite us , one grave enshroud us . Huger . Huger Oh , why will you not suppress these feelings , Adeline ? your agonizing expressions , are poignards to my heart . Though death shall part us , we will meet again , where one fair morn still orient smiles where wo and want do never come . Enter Count Archo . Huger . Huger I am summoned  --  Count A. Count Archo I come  --  Huger . Huger I am ready . Count A. Count Archo I am not here young man to summon you to death . Ad . Adeline You bring his pardon  --  his executioners have relented . But no ! there is no hope in that countenance ; pardon ever comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard not your sentence with indifference ; it would not become me to reflect upon my sovereign 's conduct , but yet I could not but think your temerity so nobly displayed , deserved a less harsh sentence than death . Your situation interested me , I made use of all my power and influence to have it repealed . In vain did I set forth your youth  --  your noble bearing  --  a wife torn from her husband , and left to bewail his untimely end ; all would not do  --  fate was inflexible , and all that I was able to obtain was a mitigation of your sentence , from gibbeting , to death by the arms of the soldier . Huger . Huger Then I shall not die a felon 's death . Count A. Count Archo Even so . Huger . Huger I feared not death , but coming in such a shape it did indeed imbitter my moments ; but now I hail it with gladness  --  now indeed I can die as becomes me . Ad . Adeline No pardon , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fortress .  --  Bell tolls . Lieu . Lieutenant Sir , your hour has arrived . Huger . Huger A moment spare me , and I will follow . Adeline , my dear Adeline , one last kiss , and then farewell for ever . ( The Lieutenant retires to the back of the stage . ) Ad . Adeline They antedate thy hour , it is not yet the time ; ' t is but a moment since they placed us here . Huger . Huger The numbered hours of the poor condemned criminal , stride with rapid steps towards his latest period , love . Come , ( embracing her ) farewell . Ad . Adeline No , no , they shall not take you to the cold embrace of death . I 'll hold you from them . Huger . Huger Believe me Adeline , the only pang that death brings with it , is the thoughts of what you may feel at my loss . Ad . Adeline ( falling on her knees before Count Archo ) Oh , sir , you seem to pity him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Count A. Count Archo Lady , my heart bleeds for him , but I can do nothing of myself .

Kisses her , then rushes out followed by Lieutenant . Count Archo bears off Adeline . SCENE LAST THE PLACE OF EXECUTION . Huger enters to Execution , preceded and followed by soldiers , &c,; &c.; Lieutenant of the Fortress at their head . Count Archo walking beside Huger . Muffled drums beat . Lieu .

( to soldiers ) Fall back ! ( the soldiers retire to the back of the stage ) Speak , I am ready to listen to you . Huger . Huger Sir you have evinced a interest in my fate that prompts me to ask one request of you  --  a last  --  my dying request . Count A. Count Archo If there is any commission you would entrust me with and it lay within my power to execute it , I promise you on the word of a soldier and an honest man , it shall be faithfully performed . Huger . Huger Sir , I leave behind me a wife . Count A. Count Archo I understand ' t is concerning her you would speak . Huger . Huger It is  --  she is far dearer to me than my own hearts blood , distant far from her home , she has no friend to soothe her woes , no protector to shield her from danger and calamity . Will you sir , guard her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , and they will persecute her for being so . Count A. Count Archo Not while I have an arm to resist an insult or a tongue for utterance . Rest you young man , I here swear to love and cherish her as my own daughter , and may heaven so deal with me as I perform my vow . Huger . Huger ( Grasps Archo 's hand with fervor ; his eyes suffused with tears ) I  --  I can not sp  --  speak , sir , my thanks , forgive me , my heart is too big for utterance  --  Now soldiers I am ready . ( A soldier advances with a bandage to cover his eyes  --  when Adeline rushes in , her hair dishevelled , &c.; Ad . Adeline ( shrieking and flying into his arms ) Ah they have not yet murdered you . They would have kept me from you  --  I have you now  --  I feel your heart beating against my own . Huger . Huger Why Adeline do I see thee here ? Ad . Adeline To die with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many happy days are yet in store for you . Ad . Adeline No ; here is all my happiness . Rather would I die than survive him . Prepare then your instruments of death and let us both dwell in one grave . Huger . Huger ( endeavouring to disengage himself ) Soldiers take her from me and execute my sentence . Sweet retire . ( Two soldiers advance to take her from Huger . ) Ad . Adeline Hold off your hands , I come to die as resolute as he , here I am , chained in death our ashes shall not be divided . Huger . Huger Take her away , but use her gently . Ad . Adeline Never , here I am rivetted. ( clinging to her husband ) Lieutenant . Lieutenant ( to Huger ) ' T is past your hour . Longer delay will expose us to punishment for disobeying our orders . Huger . Huger I am ready , Adeline , farewell ! The soldiers take hold of her to sever her from Huger , she struggles violently  --  at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adeline ( As she is carried out ) Inhuman ! Murderers ! help ! Mercy ! Huger . Huger Now fit me for my doom . ( he kneels , a soldier puts a bandage over his eyes ) Soldiers let your aim be certain . Count A. Count Archo Advance . The soldiers destined to shoot Huger advance opposite to him the muffled drum rolls . Prepare ! ( combatting with his feelings ) fire !  --  commotion without , the soldiers pause ! La Fayette rushes in and throws himself before Huger , exclaiming Fey . La Fayette Hold ! All . All La Fayette ! Fay . La Fayette Aye , I am your victim . Not this brave youth . Huger . Huger ( removing the bandage from his eyes ) La Fayette . Fay La Fayette Yes ; and have just come in time to save you . I was far distant and safe from pursuit , when I learned that your life was about to be sacrificed for mine , and with speed by man before unequalled , hastened here . Huger . Huger To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thought for me , why did you not continue onward . Fay . La Fayette What ! and have left you to perish . Would such an act have been worthy of La Fayette , for procuring whose liberty you were about to forfeit your life ? Count A. Count Archo Young man , La Fayette is again our prisoner , and you are free . Huger . Huger Beshrew me now , but I heard with more transport sentence of death passed upon me , than I now hear that I am free . Had my doom been lingering torments , with fortitude would I have borne my fate , for all selfish feelings would have been hushed in the proud satisfaction of knowing I was suffering for the champion of my country 's rights  --  the compeer of Washington  --  for La Fayette , but to know that my efforts have been unavailing , and that he is again in the power of proud oppression , is  --  ( shouts , beating of drums , &c,; without . ) What is the meaning of that tumult ? Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer A pardon ! a pardon ! ( presenting a paper Archo . ) Count A. Count Archo For whom ! ( tearing open the paper . ) Ha ! What 's this I read  --  Joy  --  Joy  --  La Fayette is free ! All . All How ! Count A. Count Archo ' T is even so . This paper I hold in my hand is an order for the immediate liberation of the gallant American , and of La Fayette , should he be taken . ( Shouts and Acclamations . ) Enter Jerry , M. La Fayette , and Adeline . M. Fay ! Madame La Fayette ( rushing into her husbands arms ) Safe ! Free ! Fay . La Fayette My wife ! Adeline . Adeline ( embracing Huger ) Francis ! Huger . Huger Adeline ! Jerry . Jerry Tol-de-rol-lol . What a pity it is that I hav' n't a wife to make one in this hugging and bussing .

Huger Yes , now indeed am I happy ; but how ineffable would be my feelings , did I know that you felt the same transport . ( to La Fayette , taking him by the hand ) Though your body is unfettered ; yet , to give utterance to the noble sentiments which inspire you , would be to speak an unknown language , and only subject you to the malignant smile of contempt : Come then to the country which your own noble deeds have gained for you ; to that land whose mountains ring with your name , and whose vallies smile with the plenty you have obtained for us ; whose songs commemorate your atchievements ; and whose maidens invoke Heavn 's blessings on your head . Come to America , flowers shall strew your path , beauty shall shine on your progress , youthful valour shall imitate you , childhood shall lisp your name , age shall wet your hand with the tear of gratitude , while the fire of affection shall rekindle the spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the reward of your toils , the rich banquet of feeling that tyrants can not taste , the sincere the unaffected , hearty tribute of a NATION 'S GRATITUDE.
